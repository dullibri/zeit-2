HEADLINE: Arab Royals Buy 2 Pieces Of the Skyline

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
They are two trophy buildings in Manhattan, familiar if not instantly nameable by anyone who knows the city: 230 Park Avenue, the gold-crowned, 34-story tower that sits astride the avenue between 45th and 46th Streets, and the Essex House, one of the grand Art Deco hotels on Central Park South.
 And now they have a new landlord: the royal family of Dubai, the oil-rich Arab emirate on the Persian Gulf. 
In lightning moves reminiscent of the Japanese real-estate shopping spree in the late 1980's, two companies controlled by the royal family plunked down more than $1.1 billion for the buildings. The family's representative, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, flew into town yesterday to make the announcement this morning over breakfast at Michael's, the cafeteria for New York's media elite on West 55th Street, and raise Dubai's profile.
 Two buildings, even famous ones, may not make a new real estate dynasty, but the purchases have the New York development community humming because they constitute Dubai's first -- and probably not the last -- foray into the hot market here.
 The hugely wealthy emirate, one of seven city-states that make up the United Arab Emirates, has turned itself into one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world and is now an avid real estate investor in the United States and England, because its oil reserves are slowly running dry. The crown prince, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is intent on diversifying.
 One of the royal family's companies, Istithmar, closed this week on the $705 million purchase of 230 Park, known variously as the Helmsley Building and the New York Central Building. A separate Dubai company closed in September on the $440 million acquisition of the Essex House, home to Alain Ducasse, the restaurant which recently won a coveted three-star rating in the Michelin guide to New York City.
 The big question now is not whether the emirate can afford the buildings, but whether it will escape the fate that befell Japan 15 years ago when it made too heavy a bet on real estate at the top of the market and lost.
 ''New York is a world unto its own as far as real estate is concerned,'' said David S. Schaiman, a managing director of Sonnenblick-Goldman, the real estate investment bank that oversaw the sale of the Essex House. ''Everybody wants to buy in New York.''
 In an interview yesterday afternoon, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said he believed that there was still opportunity for growth in New York: ''This shows our confidence in the real estate market in New York. We believe the market is very good here. If we see another opportunity, we'll return.''
 Slightly smaller than Delaware, Dubai has become an international banking center as well as a major tourist spot. Oil accounts for only 8 percent of the city-state's national income, while tourism accounts for 17 percent, government officials said. 
 Golf and tennis tournaments feature Tiger Woods and Venus Williams. Rod Stewart reportedly bought an island there, and the soccer star David Beckham and his wife, the former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, are frequent visitors. Indeed, some 5.45 million travelers visited Dubai in 2004, nearly 20 times the number of a decade earlier. 
 Over the past three years, Dubai has also quietly invested more than $1 billion in real estate in the United States, putting money into nursing homes, office buildings, hotels and thousands of apartments in Dallas, Phoenix, Nashville and Atlanta. 
 Last year, the crown prince made a splash in London when his companies bought Madame Tussaud's wax museums and the office building at 1 Trafalgar Square.
 Now it is plunging into one of the most expensive and most lucrative markets in the world, New York. Essex House last sold for $250 million in 1999. A year earlier, 230 Park was sold for $225 million. With both properties, real estate brokers say, Dubai moved quickly, blowing all other offers out of contention.
 To some observers, it sounds like Japan all over again.
 With their economy booming in the 1980's, the Japanese paid top dollar for landmark buildings and golf courses from New York to Los Angeles. They bought $7.4 billion worth of real estate in Manhattan alone over three years ending in 1990, including Rockefeller Center, which touched off a xenophobic reaction over the sale of American patrimony.
 But in 1990, the Tokyo stock market collapsed and property values in Manhattan plummeted. Japanese investors lost hundreds of millions and most of the buildings found their way back into American hands.
 Andrew Farkas, a partner with Istithmar in 230 Park and some other deals, said that the crown prince's strategy had no parallel with that of the Japanese in the 1980's. 
 ''This is much more strategic in nature,'' said Mr. Farkas, a scion of the Alexander's department store family and the ex-chairman of the Insignia Financial Group. ''It's part of a focused, deliberate decision-making process that would appear to be asset by asset, not a broad, sweeping ambition to acquire things.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Man Pleads Guilty In Shining of Laser at Small Jet

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
A New Jersey man who ran afoul of the antiterrorism USA Patriot Act last year when he shined a laser pen at a private plane pleaded guilty on Wednesday to willfully interfering with a craft involved in mass transportation. 
 David W. Banach, 39, of Parsippany, could have faced up to 20 years in prison for the incident last Dec. 29, but instead reached a plea agreement in return for federal prosecutors' dropping some of the charges.
He entered his plea before Judge John C. Lifland in United States District Court as prosecutors agreed not to pursue charges that he lied about his actions when questioned by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. 
 Initially, the prosecutors said, Mr. Banach denied directing the green laser beam into the cockpit of a Cessna Citation jet as it passed 3,000 feet over the backyard of his home. Federal Aviation Administration experts said the action could temporarily blind pilots and cause accidents.
 Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said that the prosecutors had also agreed not to oppose an expected defense request of a ''noncustodial'' sentence, which would mean no jail time. 
 Complex federal sentencing guidelines would ordinarily call for an 18- to 24-month prison term for Mr. Banach, said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Mr. Christie. But recent court rulings have determined that the guidelines are advisory only.
 Judge Lifland set sentencing for Feb. 17.
 When Mr. Banach was indicted in March, Mr. Christie said that his actions might not be connected with terrorism, but that they were ''illegal and unacceptable'' nonetheless because they could have caused an accident.
 ''We have to send a clear message to the public that there is no harmless mischief when it comes to airplanes,'' Mr. Christie said at the time, explaining his office's use of the counterterrorism law against Mr. Banach. 
 Outside court on Wednesday, he insisted that the ''key thing'' in accepting the plea deal was sending the message that such actions would not be viewed by his office as mere pranks.
 ''I think Mr. Banach being now a convicted felon sends a strong message,'' he said.
 Mr. Banach, an unemployed fiber optics technician and father of three, said that he had bought the laser pen on the Internet for $100. On Wednesday his lawyer, Gina Mendola-Longarzo, said that she was relieved about the plea agreement and would request probation and no jail time. 
 Ms. Mendola-Longarzo had argued that the Patriot Act, enacted after 9/11, was unconstitutional and unnecessarily broad and vague because reckless driving and other acts that might interfere with mass transportation could be construed as terrorism. But Judge Lifland rejected that argument in August.

HEADLINE: Police Say Man Robbing Store Is Killed in Struggle With Clerk

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A man trying to rob a convenience store in Brooklyn last night was shot in the head during a struggle with a store clerk and died, the police said. The clerk was shot in the elbow and slashed in the arm, but survived the attack, they said. 
 The man who died, whom relatives identified as Ryan Walters, and two other men entered the store, the Neighborhood Food Center at the corner of Winthrop Street and East 91st Street, around 8:40 p.m., pointed a gun at the clerk and announced the robbery, the police said. But instead of surrendering to their demands, the clerk fought back and managed to wrestle the gun away from Mr. Walters.
Officers recovered a gun at the scene and said it belonged to one of the robbers.
 It is unclear if the clerk was shot before or during the struggle. Mr. Walters was hit in the head as he left the store, the police said. Four hours later, his body lay on the street, covered by a white sheet.
 ''It's not right somebody should be shot and dead on the ground for four hours,'' said Mr. Walters's father, Earl Walters, 58, who walked from his home to the scene of the shooting to find his son dead.
 Ryan Walters, 22, was unemployed, but occasionally worked odd jobs in construction, his father said. He lived in the neighborhood with his parents and had a son, Mekhi Walters, who turns 3 on Sunday, relatives said. The elder Mr. Walters acknowledged that his son had had run-ins with the law, but could not provide any specifics. 
 Ryan Walters collapsed and died on the sidewalk just outside the store, while his two accomplices fled, the police said. There had been no arrests as of early this morning.
 The police did not know last night how many shots had been fired or who had fired them. Grace Alexander, 50, who lives upstairs from the store, said she heard ''more than 10 shots.'' 
 The injured clerk, who was not identified, was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center and reported to be in stable condition, the police said.

HEADLINE: For Choicest Apartments, Many More Choices

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
WHEN developers opened new buildings for sale in New York a year ago, brokers jostled for appointments, buyers camped out before open houses and people made decisions to part with thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes. One sales agent famously sold five luxury condos from the back seat of her BMW in a day.
 The frenzy has died down, but the buildings keep going up.
With close to 16,000 units being built in Manhattan alone this year and next, and another 23,700 planned, according to Yale Robbins, a real estate publishing company in New York, there is much to choose from, especially at the high end, where a disproportionate amount of building is going on. 
 The plentiful options mean that buyers can now return to a sales office repeatedly to examine floor plans before writing a deposit check. Where some buildings might have sold three or four apartments in a day, now developers are happy to sell that many in a month. And some buyers even feel bold enough to offer less than the asking price, though few developers are biting.
 ''I just feel like people are waiting to pull the trigger,'' said Ariana Meyerson, project manager at 225 Fifth Avenue, a 192-unit building with $1 million one-bedroom apartments. ''They are waiting to see where the market goes.''
 Some brokers predict that sales will slow more as newer apartments, often with fancier amenities than the building down the street, come on the market. ''I do think that there is going to be product sitting on the market a year from now,'' said Michael Shvo, a broker who markets new developments.
 Citywide, developers applied for building permits representing 15,870 new units in the first six months of this year, census figures show. Last year they applied for 25,208 units, the most since 1971. A large proportion of the newest units are being marketed as ''luxury'' apartments, a term that has come to mean anything from $600,000 studios in Brooklyn to $40 million penthouses on Central Park West.
 The bounty of choice includes the planned condominiums at the Plaza Hotel and in the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue near the Metropolitan Museum; chic new apartments designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel at 40 Mercer Street in SoHo; and the Philip Johnson-designed units at the Urban Glass House on Spring Street nearby.
 ''We do have a healthy amount of developments coming on stream,'' said Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage in Manhattan. ''And if there is one question mark'' looming about the state of the market, he said, ''that may be it.''
 Although condo prices are still increasing, brokers said buyers are being shrewder about what they are willing to pay. Six months ago the luxury market was so heated that ''you could basically put a 3,000-square-foot coal chute on the market and three people would try to buy it,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Warburg Realty. Now, he said, buyers were being more selective about location and quality.
 Stacey Silverman, 41, has been looking for a two-bedroom apartment in a new development for the past six months. She has yet to put down a deposit. ''I think there is a lot to choose from, and there is more coming on the market,'' she said. ''So I'm taking my time.'' 
 Some developers have not caught on to this new reality. ''Sellers are in denial that the market has shifted,'' said Jonathan Miller, a New York appraiser. ''On projects that appear to have stalled, the developer kept ratcheting up the prices systematically -- which was the norm for the past few years -- until it was priced out of the market.''
 Some new developments are still selling briskly, even at the superluxury end of the market. The developers of the condominiums at 15 Central Park West have had no trouble selling 74 units worth $650 million in the two months since the sales office opened.
 William Zeckendorf, a partner in the development, said 12 of 16 penthouses, including one at $45 million, were under contract. A prominent Wall Street investor lost out on a duplex penthouse when he tried to buy at a discount and another buyer offered full price, Mr. Zeckendorf added. 
 But brokers said the scramble at 15 Central Park West, designed by Robert A. M. Stern in the spirit of such grand buildings as the San Remo and the Dakota, was largely a reflection of its irresistible location, lavish amenities and old-world charm. 
 Alex and Luba Rabey were not even looking to move from their apartment at the Grand Millennium on Broadway when they heard about 15 Central Park West. Mr. Rabey, a 65-year-old consultant, said they were attracted to the building's particular vantage on the park, its gym facilities and its 11-foot ceilings. They have signed a contract to buy a $4.87 million three-bedroom apartment.
 Name architects have not necessarily spurred sales at either the Richard Meier tower at 165 Charles Street or Charles Gwathmey's undulating glass building at Astor Place. They are both in downtown locations that some brokers said wealthy buyers do not prefer. 
 The tower at 165 Charles Street, the third to be designed by Mr. Meier overlooking the West Side Highway, has been on the market for over 18 months. Out of 31 units, 24 have sold, including a $20 million penthouse. One broker who asked not to be named because she did not want to criticize a building where she might bring clients said it should have sold out by now. Izak Senbahar, the developer, said, ''It's a very specialty product that sells at its own speed.'' 
 Despite extensive media coverage and a model apartment sponsored by Esquire magazine, the Related Companies, developer of the Gwathmey building, has sold only 24 of 39 units there. David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related, said he was perfectly happy with those numbers, given what buyers were paying: $1,400 to $2,600 a square foot.
 But, he acknowledged, ''buyers, at those numbers, because they have more choices, are being more cautious about where they buy.'' 
 Even at less lofty levels, buyers are hesitating. ''It's taking longer to sell out buildings,'' said Richard Cantor, a principal at Cantor & Pecorella, a marketing firm that is handling 1,500 units in 10 new buildings around Manhattan. 
 It has taken 10 months to sell 43 of the 79 units at Beacon Tower, a high-rise condominium in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, despite the lure of a Zen garden, a gym and high-end kitchens. Steve Rutter, who handles marketing of new developments for Corcoran Group in Brooklyn, said the developer, Leviev Boymelgreen, closed down the sales office for part of the summer because sales were sluggish, and reopened after Labor Day. Only four apartments have sold since then. 
 So far, nobody is predicting a glut or that prices will collapse. That is partly because today's building boom pales in comparison to the one that took place in the 1980's (developers built 125,623 units in Manhattan from 1985 to 1991, Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said). That building spree exacerbated the effects of the stock market crash and a severe recession, and median prices fell as much as 45 percent. 
 Since 1999 builders have put up only 13,374 units, about a tenth of what was built in the 1980's. 
 This time around, Mr. Miller pointed out, developers have focused on the upper third of the market, making it vulnerable to the impulses of one group of buyers. 
 For the moment, many remain in the game. Ali Akansu, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, recently bought an $815,000 one-bedroom apartment in Bryant Park Tower, a 94-unit condominium that will sit atop a hotel. He said he figured that it would be a good investment, and that maybe his college-age daughter would move in at some point. But when he was looking, he said, he saw several other projects that he deemed overpriced.

HEADLINE: President Offers Tributes To Medal of Freedom Honorees

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Aretha Franklin could not hold back the tears on Wednesday. Carol Burnett pranced coquettishly for the cameras. Muhammad Ali, though unable to walk unassisted, mimed boxing jabs with President Bush. 
 Having the president fasten the Presidential Medal of Freedom around your neck apparently does something even to those accustomed to fame and fortune.
 ''All who receive the Medal of Freedom can know that they have a special place in the life of our country and have earned the respect and affection of the American people,'' Mr. Bush said as he gave the awards.
 Last year, Mr. Bush chose three architects of his Iraq agenda as award winners, and drew fire for it.
 This year's 14 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the government's highest civilian honor, were divided about equally between sports and entertainment celebrities and prominent figures from the more sober worlds of economics, science, letters and policy.
 They included Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman; Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who designed a language for data transmission that gave rise to the Internet; the golfer Jack Nicklaus; and the actor Andy Griffith.
 Only one recipient -- Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier whose sheltering of hundreds of people from the 1994 Rwandan genocide was the subject of the movie ''Hotel Rwanda'' -- was younger than 60. 
 White House stewards, and Mr. Bush himself, stepped in to help several recipients navigate the nearly hourlong ceremony. Mr. Ali suffers from Parkinson's disease, and three other recipients, the radio personality Paul Harvey, former Representative Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi and the Soviet historian Robert Conquest are all well into their 80's.
 Other winners were Gen. Richard B. Myers, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Frank Robinson, the great baseball outfielder.

PERSON: Kocheril Raman Narayanan

HEADLINE: K. R. Narayanan Dies at 85; 'Untouchable' India President

BYLINE: By P. J. ANTHONY

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Kocheril Raman Narayanan, India's first Dalit, or ''untouchable,'' president, died in a military hospital here on Wednesday evening, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. He was 85, according to the Press Trust of India, and he had been suffering from pneumonia and kidney failure. 
 More than half a century after Gandhi led India to independence with a vision of ridding the country of its ancient system of caste discrimination, Mr. Narayanan, a member of Hinduism's lowest caste, assumed the office of president on July 25, 1997.
After being elected by the country's federal and state lawmakers to the largely ceremonial post, he declared his elevation proof that ''the concerns of the common man'' had taken precedence in the nation's affairs.
 Mr. Narayanan, an academic, administrator, author, journalist, cabinet minister, politician and diplomat, also served as vice president for five years. While other Dalits have risen to be senior cabinet ministers, top judges and high-ranking military officers, Mr. Narayanan was arguably India's most powerful symbol that the humiliations of the caste system could be overcome.
 On Thursday evening Mr. Narayanan's body will be cremated with full military honors on the banks of the Yamuna River in New Delhi, near the funeral ground of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, the government-run news media reported. A weeklong period of national mourning has been declared.
 ''A creature of circumstances,'' as Mr. Narayanan called himself, was born in Uzhavoor, a tiny village in the backwaters of the southern state of Kerala. The third son of Raman Vaidyan, a practitioner of herbal medicine, and his wife, Pappiamma, the youth walked for miles each day to attend school, according to the government-run media. He graduated from Kerala University with high honors in 1943.
 Like countless ambitious young men from southern India, Mr. Narayanan then traveled north to New Delhi, India's capital. He worked in a government office and as a journalist before winning a scholarship to the London School of Economics. There, he studied political science and graduated with high honors.
 After returning to India in 1949 he joined the Indian Foreign Service and served in the Indian Embassies in Burma, Japan, Britain, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand and Pakistan. In 1976, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi chose Mr. Narayanan, who spoke Chinese, to be the first Indian ambassador to Beijing in 15 years. He also served as ambassador to the United States.
 An avid reader and a writer, he wrote several books and numerous magazine articles.
 Mr. Narayanan is survived by his wife, Usha, and two daughters, Amrita and Chitra, who is India's ambassador to Turkey.
 In 1984 he won election from Kerala to the first of three consecutive five-year terms in Parliament. ''I have been an ambassador, but there is special pride in being accepted by the people who have elected me,'' he said at the time.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Fires Its President In Dispute Over Future

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Amtrak's board fired the company's president on Wednesday morning, widening a divide between the Bush administration and Congress over the future of the railroad.
 The board chairman, David M. Laney, said that the president, David Gunn, helped develop a strategic plan that would have injected more competition into passenger operations, but that Mr. Gunn's ''enthusiasm and commitment seems to have drained away.''
Mr. Laney said Mr. Gunn had failed to move forward on simpler initiatives, like outsourcing maintenance and catering in a way that would cut expenses. 
 But in a letter to the board dated Nov. 9, Mr. Gunn said, ''I can assure you that we have already begun to work on those initiatives that are wholly within our control.'' In a telephone interview Wednesday he said some changes would require action by Congress.
 Mr. Gunn, who is credited with turning around New York City's subway system in the 1980's and came out of retirement three years ago to steer Amtrak successfully during a financial crisis, described the reason for his dismissal as ''ideological.'' 
 ''Obviously, what their goal is -- and it's been their goal from the beginning -- is to liquidate the company,'' Mr. Gunn said in the interview.
 The Bush administration has proposed putting the railroad tracks of the Boston-to-Washington Northeast Corridor, which are Amtrak's major asset, in the hands of a federal-state consortium, an idea Mr. Gunn has vehemently opposed. The board has voted for now to put the corridor in a separate subsidiary.
 Mr. Gunn said he did not oppose injecting some competition into the system if it was done carefully. He pointed out that the administration had discussed bankrupting the railroad, which would mean breaking it up, as a way to reorganize.
 ''They want at least one transportation mode that is totally free market,'' Mr. Gunn said.
 But highways, airports and ports are all federally subsidized, he said, decrying ''all this angst over an operating deficit of 500 million bucks for the whole country, and the bulk of money going into capital or infrastructure.''
 The action Wednesday was a sharp turnaround for the board. Asked in September about Mr. Gunn's performance, Mr. Laney told a Senate subcommittee, ''Mr. Gunn has done, as far as I am concerned, a splendid job.'' 
 He said Mr. Gunn had ''righted a ship that was listing and about to spill over.''
 Mr. Gunn is known as a rail-turnaround artist. He was brought in to fix the New York City subway system in the 1980's, and provided leadership in the construction of the subway system in Washington.
 Amtrak's supporters in Congress reacted swiftly and bitterly to Mr. Gunn's removal. Democrats sought to contrast what they said were his successes, including cutting expenses, increasing ridership and improving the railroad's physical condition, with the recent failures of the Federal Emergency Management Agency after Hurricane Katrina.
 ''We have learned recently that there is room for cronies in this administration,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, ''and we've learned the cost of cronyism. And now we've learned today there is not room for straight shooters.'' 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, questioned the board's legal ability to fire Mr. Gunn. Only one board member, Mr. Laney, has been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Schumer pointed out. The secretary of transportation is, by statute, a member, and two other members are recess appointments, whose terms will expire when Congress goes home in a few weeks. There are three vacancies.
 ''Gunn is more legitimate than the board is,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 He asserted that Mr. Gunn was fired over policy, saying: ''The policy difference is that the board wants to kill Amtrak and Gunn wants it to prosper. It's that simple.'' 
 The railroad announced Wednesday morning that Mr. Gunn had been ''released'' from his job, then notified Mr. Gunn. He replied with a memorandum to the board: ''For your information, I did not resign. I was removed. It's been fun. Good luck.''
 Mr. Gunn, 68, was paid $275,000 a year. An Amtrak spokesman, Clifford Black, said he did not know if there was a severance package.
 On Sept. 30, the railroad ended the fiscal year with $120 million in cash as operating capital, a strong performance, Mr. Gunn said, especially considering that the Acela express train was out of service for most of the summer because of a brake problem. The Senate just voted 93 to 6 to authorize $11.6 billion for Amtrak over the next six years, although the vote did not actually appropriate any money. That measure, which will probably go to a conference committee to work out differences with a House version, would make the Amtrak president a member of the board.
 Both the House and Senate have supported aid packages for the current fiscal year that are far more generous that the White House has proposed. 
 But the Government Accountability Office said last week that while progress had been made at the railroad, Amtrak needed ''fundamental improvements.''
 Mr. Gunn is widely credited with improving the railroad's management, cutting costs, imposing better financial controls and improving the state of repair of Amtrak's locomotives and passenger cars, which are old, and its tracks, signals and electrical systems, which are truly antique. But while ridership has recently risen to record levels, government auditors predicted that Amtrak's budget deficit would grow sharply in the next few years. The administration has said it is determined to end the perennial subsidies to the railroad, which was created 30 years ago to take over passenger service as the commercial railroads abandoned that business as unprofitable.

HEADLINE: An Unclear Role for an Oversight Agency at Ground Zero 

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
IN creating the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Gov. George E. Pataki promised it would be ''the entity that drives the train of Lower Manhattan development.'' The question on its fourth anniversary is where the track ends.
 ''We look forward to working ourselves out of business,'' said Stefan Pryor, the president of the corporation, which was never envisioned as a permanent agency. ''But we don't think we've accomplished that goal yet.''
It is not clear how the corporation will fit with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to become more involved at ground zero. He is entitled to appoint eight of the corporation's 16 directors but now has only three appointees on the board, though he pledged to fill the vacancies after the election.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who is not a director but represents the mayor at board meetings, said, ''With the exception of what's going to happen with the commercial buildings, the truth is the vast, vast majority of decisions have basically been made.'' 
 ''So naturally,'' he added, ''the role of the L.M.D.C. declines as the responsibility for actually building things devolves to the respective agencies.''
 Governor Pataki still views the corporation as ''central to the rebuilding efforts,'' a spokeswoman said last month, citing its responsibility for designing the 9/11 memorial and memorial museum, championing a performing arts center on the World Trade Center site and allocating the remaining federal redevelopment grants.
 On Sept. 28, the governor seemed to undermine the corporation when he declared -- while the board was reviewing the matter -- that the International Freedom Center museum could not be placed in the memorial area. (State officials note that Mr. Pataki told the corporation to look for an alternative place for the museum, a search that might have succeeded had the Freedom Center executives not pulled the plug on their own project.)
 As a result, Roland W. Betts, one of Mr. Pataki's original appointees and a business partner of a Freedom Center co-founder, Tom A. Bernstein, resigned from the board, saying the corporation's ''ongoing role has been severely marginalized.'' Other directors also considered resigning, though none are known to have done so.
 That is not the only way in which influence and power have shifted recently. John P. Cahill, the governor's chief of staff -- not the corporation chairman or president -- has emerged as the top downtown development official. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation has asserted itself in the construction process. And the Alliance for Downtown New York and Community Board 1 have lost representation on the board.
 Supporters still see the corporation as a vital intermediary among the many groups with a stake at ground zero. They contend that it is reaching a critical point in designing the memorial. And they point out that it must oversee demolition of the former Deutsche Bank building, which it owns, a process that will last until 2007.
 They envision the corporation as the defender of Daniel Libeskind's master site plan; as the advocate of a performing arts center, for which the board committed $50 million, and of cultural institutions generally downtown; and as the partner in redevelopment projects in Chinatown, at the Hudson River Park, on Fulton and Greenwich Streets and along the East River waterfront.
 Robert P. Balachandran, the former president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust, whom Mr. Pataki appointed to the board in 2004, said, ''Our role is even more crystalline and important now than it ever was before.''
 The Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, as it was first called, was created Nov. 5, 2001, as a subsidiary of the state's Urban Development Corporation. Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the parent corporation, said it would ''oversee all aspects of revitalizing and rebuilding Lower Manhattan.''
 Faced with the possibility that Mark Green, a Democrat, would be elected mayor, the Republican administration in Albany allocated six of nine board seats to the governor and three to the mayor. In April 2002, with a Republican mayor in office, the board was expanded to 16 members. The mayor and governor were each given eight appointees.
 That sounds like city-state parity, but the Urban Development Corporation owns all the shares in the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was incorporated in December 2001. It was granted ''all purposes, powers and functions entrusted to the U.D.C.,'' including property condemnation, and charged with the ''implementation and management'' of redevelopment south of Houston Street.''
 What gave the fledgling corporation real power was its designation in January 2002, by federal law, as the conduit of a $2 billion community development grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was designated eight months later to distribute an additional $783 million grant.
 There is still roughly $400 million to be distributed, almost guaranteeing that the corporation will operate for some time. So does its role, established by executive order in 2003, as the state's lead agency for environmental reviews of redevelopment plans financed by the HUD grants.
 In other words, no one will be turning off the lights any time soon. But recent events have taken a toll.
 THE corporation -- which worked with relatives of 9/11 victims, revised the master plan with public input and handled federal grants without scandal -- was ''mortally wounded'' in the Freedom Center case, said a former director, who asked not to be identified so as not to be publicly critical of officials and former colleagues. ''I think it was a grand experiment and it had some very important successes and it was the right thing to do at the time,'' the former director said. ''But that time is passed.''
 Billie Tsien, a principal in Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, who was a Bloomberg appointee from 2002 to 2003, said the governor had made the corporation peripheral. ''As long as he's running it,'' she said, ''it's hard to imagine they have a reason for being.''
 ''I went on the board because I thought it was a chance to make a positive contribution and a difference in New York City,'' Ms. Tsien said. ''And in the end, that didn't happen. I wouldn't have said this until recently. I've tried essentially to be discreet. But I feel like now it seems like an incredibly empty exercise.''
 After four years on the board, Madelyn Wils said she still saw a future for the corporation, which ''always served the really strong purpose of bringing together agencies in an effective manner.''
 ''Whether the governor and the mayor have the wherewithal to have L.M.D.C. continue that work,'' she said, ''is not entirely clear.''

 BODY:

As Opposed To What Exactly, Diddy?
 We are growing so accustomed to the animal-rights folks on the party circuit that we will soon be able to distinguish among their ubiquitous skinned-animal replicas. ''Hey, it's Blood-Covered Ermine! Fancy seeing you again, good sir! That was you we saw, was it not, in the Social Diary at the J. Mendel show?'' Then, sotto voce: ''Noticed you were there with Skinned Rabbit, you old dog!''
 The protests were in full blossom on Tuesday night at the Accessories Council Excellence awards at Cipriani 42nd Street, holding up large photos and replicas (we think) of dead skinned animals. But enough of that: we were here for serious business, to honor the ''individuals and companies who have furthered the awareness and use of accessories.'' 
Among the award recipients were BETSEY JOHNSON, KENNETH COLE, OSCAR DE LA RENTA, MARY-KATE and ASHLEY OLSEN and JESSICA SIMPSON. And what's this? Was not NICK LACHEY on the guest list? And a seat reserved for him at the dinner? And yet he wasn't there. A publicist said that his people had canceled and we could infer whatever we wanted to from that. 
 So: Wow, he sure has been spending a lot of time in the studio, so his new album will probably be great! 
 DIDDY, honored as a Fashion Influencer, and the Olsen twins received the ACE award, which honors an all-around dedication to advancement in accessories (venti Starbucks cups being but an example of the twins' innovation in this arena). Mary-Kate was silent while Ashley accepted the award with a brief speech; then they walked off the stage. ''They just don't tend to speak in general,'' the publicist observed. 

Bad News for Amanpour
 Same night, a few blocks farther east. After dinner. Couples scattered at the tables under warm lighting.
 ROBERTA FLACK was singing ''First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.''
 At Table No. 2, MARC MEZVINSKY was playfully kissing CHELSEA CLINTON behind the ear; next to those two lovebirds, MARC ANTHONY had his arm around JENNIFER LOPEZ. 
 The scene: a dining room at the United Nations. The topic of the evening? (And here we ask you to imagine the voice of BARRY WHITE over a slow, thumping bass line. Also, there are strings.)
 ''Microcredit.''
 Girl, you know what we're talking about. Microcredit. Small loans to low-income people, often in the poorest countries as a method of poverty eradication. Mm-hmm This was the United Nations Year of Microcredit gala awards dinner and TIM ROBBINS was the host.
 Performers and presenters included ALYSSA MILANO, BEN JELEN and WALTER CRONKITE, about whom Mr. Robbins said, ''If you forgot, this is what a real journalist looks like.''
 Mr. Jelen, having a cigarette beforehand in his dressing room, which overlooked the East River, was no slouch on the topic. ''We take for granted that we can take out a loan and live in a house,'' he said. ''But in other countries the finances just aren't there to do that. To offer them a small loan can pick themselves up out of that poverty trap.''
 He did not broach the topic of accessories. But he did tell us that he was going to India in January with his girlfriend, FERN PALMER.
 ''She will be working with an orphanage,'' he said, ''then staying to study to be a nurse.'' Whoa. The Barry White just skipped. She's so attractive, we said. She could, like, totally be a model. ''Yeah,'' Mr. Jelen replied. ''You don't grow as a model, unfortunately.''
 Later, Mr. Robbins asked people to come up with ''a really sexy name for micro-financing.'' 
 REBECCA DE MORNAY suggested ''micro-sexonomics.''
 Mr. Mezvinsky stroked Ms. Clinton's arm. Mr. Anthony caressed Ms. Lopez, who was wearing a stunning Rocha gown (which, come to think of it, probably required a heck of a lot of microfinancing). 
 ''What we are talking about,'' Mr. Robbins said, ''is love-economics until the end of time.''

HEADLINE: September Trade Gap Set Record 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened by a surprisingly large 11 percent in September, reflecting both a surge in energy imports after Hurricane Katrina and a steep drop in airplane exports because of a strike, the government reported yesterday. The trade gap with China also set a record.
 The United States imported $66.1 billion more in goods and services than it exported in the month, breaking the record of $60.4 billion set in February, the Commerce Department reported. 
The trade deficit in the first nine months of the year totaled $529.8 billion, about 18 percent higher than in the first nine months of 2004. That figure itself was up 21 percent over the period in 2003. 
 Economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to $61.5 billion in October, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Some analysts said the gap would narrow in the coming months but others were not as sanguine, saying the deficit would have been wider even without the one-time effects seen in September.
 ''One-third of the widening of the deficit is the oil bill, and aircraft sales explains most of the rest,'' said Carl Weinberg, chief global economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm.
 After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans at the end of August, gasoline and natural gas prices surged and imports of the products increased to make up for lost domestic production. Natural gas imports climbed 30 percent, to $3.7 billion, and petroleum products and fuel oil jumped 22.8 percent, to $6.8 billion. (Crude oil imports, however, fell by $350 million, reflecting the shutdown of oil import terminals and refineries on the Gulf Coast.)
 At the same, exports fell by $2.8 billion, mostly because of the drop in airplane sales. The Boeing Company said a strike by machinists in September delayed the delivery of 30 planes. Food exports fell $296 million, reflecting transportation disruptions caused by the shutdown of the Port of New Orleans.
 Mr. Weinberg said he expected the trade deficit to narrow as aircraft sales pick up -- Boeing projects an 11.7 percent increase in sales in 2006 -- and energy prices retreat. The Labor Department reported yesterday that the price of petroleum-based imports fell 4.4 percent in October after surging 8 percent in September. Prices of all imports dropped 0.3 percent, only the second decline this year, after rising 2.3 percent in September. Excluding petroleum products, import prices rose 0.8 percent in October.
 But other economists say the trade deficit will remain at today's levels, or could deepen, because domestic demand for foreign products remains strong and the dollar has strengthened against the euro and Japanese yen this year, making American exports more expensive in other countries
 ''Only with very weak U.S. growth or a major drop in the U.S. dollar will the trade deficit improve on a sustained basis,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''The reason you need these dramatic movements is that the U.S. has, according to almost every study, an incredible appetite for imports.''
 The trade deficit with China, the largest with any single country, rose 8.8 percent, to $20.1 billion in September and was up 28 percent, to $146.3 billion, for the first nine months of the year. Exports to China fell 17 percent and imports rose 4 percent in September.
 This week, American and Chinese government officials reached a deal to restrict the growth in textile imports from China for the next three years. The Bush administration and Congress are also pressing China to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate much more against the dollar. Democratic, and even some Republican, lawmakers have threatened to impose sanctions on the country.
 President Bush plans to visit Beijing late next week, and the growing trade deficit with China is expected to be at the top of his agenda.
 Economists note that the United States has an increasingly complex relationship with China, in part because it is the largest holder of federal government debt. 
 ''If the Chinese abandon our Treasury market, we would see an enormous jump in interest rates,'' Mr. Harris said, ''and, of course, if we stop buying their products their economy is going to go into recession.''
 The Chinese government reported yesterday that its October trade surplus with the rest of the world jumped to a record $12 billion in October. It had a total trade surplus of $80.4 billion for the first 10 months of the year, 2.5 times the figure for the period last year. 
 In other economic news, the Labor Department reported yesterday that claims for unemployment benefits rose about 2,000, to 326,000 last week. Claims were down by about 5,000 from the comparable week last year.
 The University of Michigan said yesterday that its consumer confidence index edged up to 79.9 this month from 76.5 in October, its first increase in three months.

HEADLINE: A Shattered City Finds That Labor Is Its Greatest Need

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Burger King is offering a $6,000 signing bonus to anyone who agrees to work for a year at one of its New Orleans outlets. Rally's, a local restaurant chain, has nearly doubled its pay for new employees to $10 an hour.
 On any given day, contractors and business owners pass out fliers in downtown New Orleans promising $17 to $20 an hour, plus benefits, for people willing to swing a sledgehammer or cart away stinking debris from homes and businesses devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Canal Street, once a crowded boulevard of commerce, now resembles a sparsely populated open-air job fair.
Ten weeks after Katrina, government officials and business leaders worry that a scarcity of able-bodied workers is hampering the area's recovery. In their desperation, they are using a variety of tactics to attract workers. 
 ''I'd say I'm paying two to three times as much as I would in normal circumstances,'' said Iggie Perrin, the president of Southern Electronics, a supplier in New Orleans, who has offered as much as $30 an hour when seeking salvage workers on Canal Street. 
 Is it any wonder, then, that Donald T. Bollinger Jr. is jittery about the local economy as he peers into the future? Mr. Bollinger is the chief executive of Bollinger Shipyards, the country's third-largest shipbuilder, with 13 sites along the Gulf Coast.
 Mr. Bollinger recently turned away $700 million in contracts, though he had devoted a good share of the previous two years trying to secure them. He says he just will not have the workers he needs to meet the deadlines. As it is, he says he is 600 employees short of the 2,500 he needs to meet contractual obligations on deals made before Katrina. 
 ''This region is going to be going through a huge boom for the next three to five years rebuilding the coast,'' Mr. Bollinger said. ''That's very good news for those who want work and really worrisome news for employers who have to compete with everyone else for labor.'' 
 Joseph C. Canizaro, a bank president and retired real estate developer, said: ''I think we all believed there would be more happening than is happening right now. One of the key problems is jobs. You look at the housing situation, and the schools situation, and you wonder where businesses are going to find the people they desperately need to get things going.''
 For Mr. Bollinger, welders are just one of his labor headaches. His company pays welders $16 to $17 an hour. ''When Sheetrock layers start paying $25 an hour,'' he said, ''I'm either going to match it or I'm out of luck.''
 Virtually every New Orleans business confronts the same conundrum: In a city without a functioning school system and with vast stretches that are still uninhabitable, where will they find the employees they need to begin the long recovery? Everyone from bank presidents to restaurant owners to the Port of New Orleans are approaching the task like a nurse in an emergency room performing triage on patients based on the most immediate need.
 ''Employees are these precious commodities right now,'' said John Kallenborn, president of the New Orleans region for J. P. Morgan Chase. The state senator representing St. Bernard Parish, a working class suburb west of New Orleans demolished by Katrina, has lobbied Mr. Kallenborn to free up a few employees and set up a Chase branch in a trailer as a sign the county is back in business. 
 ''I'd love to help out, but right now I can't afford to waste a single employee,'' Mr. Kallenborn said. 
 The Bollinger Shipyards were more or less at full staff before Katrina hit on Aug. 29. The shipyards sell a wide variety of vessels, including Coast Guard patrol boats, barges of all shapes and sizes and supply vessels that serve offshore oil rigs. 
 The company had more than $300 million in revenue last year. Roughly half was from orders on new vessels and the other half from repairs. 
 Only 2 of Mr. Bollinger's 13 shipyards suffered severe damage during Katrina or Hurricane Rita. One of them was a 400-employee repair yard in the Ninth Ward, an impoverished and heavily damaged area of New Orleans. Almost every building was destroyed. Much of one dry dock sat half collapsed in the water recently, while two others (with a barge being repaired at the site) sat in a cow pasture a quarter-mile away.
 ''I don't just need people to work in my facilities,'' Mr. Bollinger said. ''I need people to rebuild some of them.'' 
 When the storm hit, Mr. Bollinger chose to keep every employee on the payroll, whether or not they were working. After a few weeks, though, he grew frustrated as many of them had not contacted the company.
 ''We threatened to terminate them as an incentive to get them back,'' he said.
 He has decided to keep paying workers who have told him they are waiting for the local schools to re-open before they return. 
 Mr. Bollinger, 56, whom everyone calls Boysie, is a large, heavily jowled man with a ruddy complexion and wavy steel gray hair on the longish side. He describes himself as from ''the swamp,'' is partial to black alligator skin boots and lists shrimp etouffee and grilled alligator among his culinary specialties. He is a man used to getting things done.
 And he counts President Bush among his friends. The two have gone rabbit hunting. Mr. Bollinger served as the Louisiana chairman of the president's 2000 campaign. In 2004, he earned ''Super Ranger'' status when he rounded up more than $300,000 in individual contributions.
 He inherited the family business from his father, who founded the Bollinger Shipyards in 1946. But through a series of acquisitions, the junior Mr. Bollinger, who took over as chief executive in 1985, has increased its size so substantially that only Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics are bigger.
 ''Boysie took a business worth in the millions,'' said J. Stephen Perry, Mr. Bollinger's former brother-in-law, ''and turned it into a business worth in the hundreds of millions.'' Mr. Perry is chief executive of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 Like other businesses, Bollinger Shipyards has dispatched emissaries to shelters around the South, looking for displaced residents willing to return. For the moment, though, evacuees who are living free in a hotel or in a subsidized apartment while collecting a stipend from the Federal Emergency Management Agency may not have the same pressing need to return to the stricken city as they might otherwise. Bollinger employees made 20 or so trips, but they did not sign up a single evacuee. Mr. Bollinger has yet to bump up his pay scale but he said that raises were inevitable. 
 ''My worry is that I've got an annual 3 percent inflation factor built into my costs,'' he said. ''And if I have to go up 20 percent on one day, I've just blown the contract. I've gone over.''
 Still, Mr. Bollinger has certain advantages that most others do not, starting with his friendship with the president.
 In early October, Mr. Bollinger found himself in a social setting with Mr. Bush. The shipyard chief was concerned about a FEMA policy to pay for only one housing unit per family. Mr. Bollinger explained that he had invited the relief agency to set up trailers on his grounds -- but no evacuee could stay there if the rest of the family was living in FEMA-subsidized quarters. 
 Within 30 hours after his discussion with Mr. Bush, Mr. Bollinger said, the policy changed. 
 ''I hate to waste the president's time talking about house trailers, but that's what we were discussing,'' Mr. Bollinger said.
 Officials like C. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, and Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who is the Gulf Coast director of FEMA, have identified housing as the area's pre-eminent concern. 
 ''Our No. 1 priority is housing, our No. 2 priority is housing, and after that, at No. 3, we'd put housing,'' Mr. Allen recently said. 
 FEMA has set up 70 trailers at four Bollinger locations, with the shipyards paying for setting up the utility lines and other structural costs. The company is only now starting to sketch out plans to convert warehouses and office buildings into housing for other employees. 
 And the lifting of a state moratorium on evictions means that landlords, for the first time since the storm, can start court proceedings against tenants who have not paid rent since Sept. 1. That will prove a hardship for evacuees who are stranded elsewhere, but it will also mean more apartments back on the rental market. 
 For Mr. Bollinger, this would come none too soon.
 ''If a guy doesn't have a place to sleep at night, you're not going to get him to work here, period, end of story,'' he said. ''Forget what you're willing to pay. They're not coming back until we deal with the housing issue.''

HEADLINE: Thorny Issue For Board: How to Value Pension Plans

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The board that writes the professional accounting rules for American businesses voted unanimously Thursday to start a far-reaching revision of the rules for reporting pensions and other retirement plans, a project that is sure to be contentious, especially among companies with big retirement plans.
 To keep the project from bogging down from the start, the Financial Accounting Standards Board agreed to focus on a single issue at first: how to express the true economic value of a company's retirement plans on its balance sheet. 
 At the moment that information is tucked away in the footnotes, making it hard for anyone but a sophisticated analyst to understand how much a company owes its future retirees, and how those promises might affect the business.
 The accounting board agreed that until that task was completed, it would not start working on the potentially touchier issue of how companies should report the way their retirement plans affect their earnings. The current method has come under intense fire because it distorts earnings and can sometimes make a company look more profitable than it really is. 
 ''The broader the scope, the longer it takes,'' said Jules M. Cassel, the board's senior technical adviser, explaining why the board had decided to start with just one part of the project. He said that in any case, balance sheet changes would have a powerful effect on some companies' reported financial strength.
 ''In terms of the immediate effect on balance sheets, it's huge,'' Mr. Cassel said. ''There are companies which have positive equity now which could have negative equity when this changes.'' 
 Having negative shareholders' equity is not an immediate catastrophe, although it can have certain consequences, like putting a company out of compliance with its loan covenants. But in general, having negative equity means that over time the company has built up liabilities that are greater than its assets, and that is not an image any company is eager to project to its investors or creditors. 
 ''We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars'' in coming aggregate changes in corporate financial reports, added Peter Proestakes, who will manage the pension project. Mr. Proestakes said the biggest change would probably be in sectors like heavy manufacturing, where adding current pension values to the balance sheet is likely to increase the company's overall indebtedness.
 At the moment, the board is planning to use the pension values as they are currently calculated. Board members said they were aware that those values had also come under fire, because they can be based on questionable actuarial assumptions.
 But in the board's public meeting Thursday, members said they feared muddying the waters too much if they tried to revise the calculations at the same time as they were making the balance-sheet change.
 ''It's clear to me that we're going to be criticized for not doing enough in this particular part,'' said G. Michael Crooch, a member of the board, adding that he believed that the board would be criticized no matter what approach it took. 
 The board set a one-year deadline for completing the first phase. It hopes to issue a so-called exposure draft of the new requirements for public comment next spring, and then issue a final standard by the end of 2006. But the one-year schedule met with some skepticism. 
 ''It's very aggressive,'' said Timothy S. Lucas, a former research director of the accounting board and a veteran of the bitter battle over the writing of an accounting rule for stock options, which lasted 10 years. ''It could easily be two years.'' 
 Robert H. Herz, chairman of the accounting board, said that he had told the professional staff that once the balance sheet changes were done, he hoped to complete the remaining pension accounting revisions in three years. But he said the staff would say only ''maybe.'' 
 There are many more questions to be resolved about the accounting for retirement benefits, and any one of the issues could keep the accounting board busy for a long time. The board also agreed that when it took on the second phase, it would work jointly with the International Accounting Standards Board, in hopes of creating a uniform international standard.

HEADLINE: U.S. Awards Contracts to Help Automate Health Records

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The federal government awarded contracts yesterday to four consortiums that are building electronic health systems in 12 regions across the country, which are intended to serve as models for the nation. 
 The contracts by the Department of Health and Human Services are meant to accelerate the use of modern computer technology in health care. The contracts totaling $18.6 million are a fraction of the investment that the four groups -- led by Accenture, the Computer Sciences Corporation, I.B.M. and Northrop Grumman -- will invest in the regions.
The government's role is to set goals and require that companies link doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals in computer networks using open data standards so information can be easily shared. But the details of how to achieve the objectives are being left to the private sector.
 ''This is a hands-off government approach,'' said Dr. David J. Brailer, the Bush administration's coordinator for health information technology. ''We're not operating these networks, and we're not procuring them.''
 Yet the competition for the four contracts was fierce because the winners may have an early lead in the market for digital patient records and health networks to connect physicians, clinics and hospitals. More than 70 corporate groups sought the contracts.
 Investment in information technology is expected to grow rapidly in a drive to improve quality and curb rising costs in health care, which accounts for 15 percent of the nation's economic output.
 In the dozen pilot programs, the companies are required to create personal digital health records and provide physicians with affordable online access to patient records, diagnostic information and billing. Such electronic networks are also intended to help in monitoring and responding to health emergencies like epidemics or bioterrorist attacks. 
 Each of the four corporate groups has three regions in which it must develop local health networks over the next year. Each can use different technologies, as long as one local network can pass patient and other health information back and forth to other local networks.
 These pilot projects are seen as steps toward a nationwide health information network. The approach championed by the Bush administration is conceptually much like automated teller networks at banks; the networks are somewhat different, but they connect and share information so customers can handle transactions across the country.
 And the American plan for moving to electronic health records is less directed by the government than in other countries, like Britain, where the National Health Service is financing the national network.
 ''We want to see competing networks,'' Dr. Brailer said. ''There won't be one national health network. We're not doing this like Britain.''
 The 12 regions for the pilot projects include both urban and rural areas, from Cleveland to eastern Kentucky. Dr. Brailer hopes that what is learned in the pilot projects will guide further investment over the next several years. ''We want to stimulate a lot of capital investment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Warm Sand, Majestic Surf and Maybe a Little Rain

BYLINE: By CHARLES E. ROESSLER

 BODY:
ABOUT three decades ago, when Oahu and Maui were heating up as tourist destinations, some farsighted public servant on Kauai took a look around and declared, ''There will be no more buildings on Kauai taller than the highest coconut tree.'' Nobody is quite sure who first came up with that statement, but Kauai County acted on it and secured the island's place in the sun with a height limit of 40 feet. Nowhere are the results of this thinking more apparent than on the North Shore, where it goes a step lower still, to 25 feet. 
 The single road along the 22-mile-long North Shore runs past open vistas of deep-blue ocean on one side and sinewy waterfalls tumbling down on the other, with occasional low-roofed houses blending modestly into the views. Kauai retains the character of the original Hawaii, and as the oldest of the major islands it has the sandiest, most eons-worn beaches of the chain. And the North Shore, with quieter tourist activity than the island's South and East Sides, still feels natural. 
 Locals are shocked by rising home prices: the average price for a house or condo in Princeville, a planned resort community on the North Shore, is now nearly $1.5 million, and quarter-acre vacant lots there run from about $500,000 to $1.1 million. But to property-rich Californians, a place on Kauai can still seem like a bargain.
 ''You really get more for your money here than in the Bay Area, where there's little vacant property,'' said Joe Sweeney, 57, a San Francisco police officer a few years short of retirement who comes to Kauai twice a year for the golf, tennis and general relaxation. He and his wife, Jennifer, who was born in Shanghai and who works as a mortgage broker, have parlayed the rising equity of their main home in San Francisco to buy a two-bedroom Princeville townhouse for $895,000. ''Kauai has good feng shui,'' Mrs. Sweeney, 51, said. ''I have never seen such beautiful mountains.''
 Buyers can choose from three distinct areas on the North Shore: Princeville, with more than 3,000 homes including elegant houses and condos, as well as two golf courses and beach access; the Kilauea area, covering about 10 miles of shore, with three-to-five-acre lots carved out of agricultural land; and the area from Hanalei town to the western end of the coast road, which has a potpourri of homes ranging from former plantation houses to 6,000-square-foot villas hugging the shoreline.
 David Gallenson, 46, who manages income property, and his wife, Karen Izumigawa, 40, a part-time Delta flight attendant, live full time in Hermosa Beach, Calif., and are now renovating a house with an ocean view and two acres that they bought for $2.25 million in 2003. He came for the surf; she comes for the tennis. ''We travel all over the world, and we love Kauai for the spiritual beauty, the air, the people and the landscape,'' Ms. Izumigawa said.

The Scene
 The Ching Young store in the middle of Hanalei town has always been a good barometer of the North Shore. Started by Chinese immigrants as a general store and rice mill in 1906, it added a small plaza to morph into Ching Young Village in 1982, an era when surfers and tripped-out hippies lived alongside locals who worked in the sugar and taro fields. Today, Ching Young has a crowd of commercial neighbors: surf shops, real estate offices, pizza parlors, sushi joints and variety stores that create a mellow hubbub perfect for people-watching and kicking back. Everything is casual on the North Shore, with flip-flops, tank tops and surf shorts always in style. Since nobody dresses up, you can't easily tell a Pierce Brosnan (he owns a home in Hanalei town) from a construction worker.
 ''We bought on Kauai because people are so friendly -- people say hello and there's eye contact,'' said Marjorie Bennett, 46, an investment adviser from Oakland, who, with her partner, Kari Hovland, 46, a banker with Wells Fargo, paid $700,000 in 2002 for an oceanfront North Shore condo. ''In the morning, I can get up on any day and go for a run on Hanalei Bay. I can't do that in Oakland.''
 Ms. Hovland plays golf on their four visits each year and said she is ''a different person'' on Kauai, even when she's telecommuting. ''The me I am here,'' she said, ''I like better than the me in Oakland.''

Pros
 Year-round, visitors play golf and tennis, pursue water sports or lie on the beach. In the winter months, humpbacks breach and spout not far offshore and world-class surfers put on a spectacle with death-defying maneuvers on 20-to-30-foot waves. In summer, the North Shore turns calm and suitable for kayaking, snorkeling and sailing.
 Though night life is limited to entertainment at a couple of hotels and some small bars, there are several good restaurants.
 With broadband widely available, you can sip a Mai Tai on the beach and go back to check in with the boss from your vacation-house office. 
 And, of course, there's the weather: never more than 90 degrees, with gentle trade winds to moderate the humidity. Nights drop to 65 or so, making sleep easy.

Cons
 The North Shore is an exquisite deep green because of abundant rain -- sometimes very abundant. (Kauai's South Side, where many of the island's tourists stay, has drier weather.) Visitors and locals alike are periodically trapped on their sides of the Hanalei River when the bridge that spans it closes from flooding. It can rain 10 days in a row and make you rent videos.
 With a state unemployment rate of 2.7 percent, it may be hard to get a house built. Carpenters earn $50 an hour, and contractors are busy. Even corporate giants can be intimidated: Costco is reconsidering its plans to build a new store on Kauai because construction bids came in 30 percent over budget.
 Living on an island has its particular disadvantages. ''Rock fever'' may afflict restless souls who find the isolation stultifying. And in such a self-contained place, there could be no avoiding catastrophe if the wrong hurricane/tsunami/energy crisis/financial collapse hits.

The Real Estate Market
 About 20 percent of sales on Kauai are to second-home buyers, according to a recent survey by SMS Consulting, and this is putting a big strain on locals, including professionals, who can't afford to buy. The record median home price on Kauai reached $750,000 in September, and the condo median was $405,000 that same month, and Kauai continues to receive favorable treatment in news reports, luring more would-be buyers. Home sales were up 40 percent in September from a year earlier.
 ''On game shows now, it's a trip to Kauai for the winners rather than a trip to Maui,'' said Donna Apisa, president of Oceanfront Realty in Princeville. ''Folks who first visited Oahu have found Kauai, and the affluent have driven up the prices.'' Buyers she sees are ''mainly Californians who are tired of the hustle and bustle,'' she said. ''They want the clean air and are looking down the road. They have a 3- or 5- or 10-year plan ending with retirement here.''
 Barbara Sloan, an agent with Coldwell Banker Bali Hai Realty in Hanalei, believes the market will stay strong. ''My clients buy Kauai because they love Kauai,'' she said. ''They are not a speculative group of buyers, so they are not buying to make a killing. They never have to sell, and if the market gets soft, they can afford to sit on the sidelines. The chief economist for the Bank of Hawaii foresees a bit more distance to go in the current upward trend.''

LAY OF THE LAND

POPULATION -- Approximately 8,000 live full-time on the North Shore and perhaps an equal number part-time.

SIZE -- The North Shore area is 22 miles long and about 2 miles wide.

WHO'S BUYING -- Outdoorsy California baby boomers; some affluent Arizonans and Coloradans.

GETTING THERE -- Kauai is a 30-minute flight from Honolulu or a five- to six-hour direct flight from San Francisco or Los Angeles. The drive from Lihue Airport to the North Shore takes 30 to 40 minutes.

WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING -- The Princeville Resort (5520 Ka Haku Road, 808-826-9644) has a jaw-dropping view of Hanalei Bay. Its 252 rooms and suites start at $465. Hanalei Bay Resort (5380 Honoiki Road, 808-826-6522) in Princeville has 280 rooms and suites starting at $195.

HEADLINE: Indianapolis

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

 BODY:
FOR years, Indianapolis bore the stigma of nicknames like Nap Town and Indiana No Place. But in the 1990's, construction and development downtown seemed to wake the city up, and today, a thriving cultural scene mixes with Hoosier hospitality and charm. And there are still the old Indianapolis standbys, like the hearty Midwestern food; the many classical monuments and fountains, laid out using elements of L'Enfant's plan for Washington and built partly by freemasons; and of course, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indy 500. And all those smiling faces? Colts fans. JOHN HOLL

Friday 


6:30 p.m.
1 -- A Cocktail With That Scotch
Start with a drink downtown at one of the city's oldest restaurants, St. Elmo Steak House (127 South Illinois Street, 317-635-0636), where for 103 years patrons have sidled up to the tiger oak bar -- first used in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair -- for martinis and single malts. Settle in under the gaze of the Indiana celebrities whose photos adorn the walls (David Letterman, Larry Bird) and try St. Elmo's not-for-the-faint-of-heart signature dish: the shrimp cocktail ($11.95). The jumbo shrimp are served smothered in horseradish cocktail sauce made every hour to ensure freshness and a proper sinus assault. If you can see through the tears in your eyes, you'll probably notice one of the tuxedoed bartenders having a quiet chuckle at your expense.

8 p.m.
2 -- Elements of Surprise
Downtown is dominated by chain restaurants, but one excellent exception is Elements (415 North Alabama Street, 317-634-8888), housed in a storefront in the Mass Ave arts district. Greg Hardesty, an owner and the executive chef, tries to use Midwestern ingredients in his always-changing menu, which he likes to keep ''simple and seasonal.'' Typically he'll use Indiana-grown produce like corn, peaches, tomatoes and zucchini in his entrees ($24 to $30). Whatever's on the dessert menu is not to be missed, especially if it's the honey-roasted Indiana peach trifle with mascarpone mousse ($7.75) or the chocolate cake with Indiana wild red raspberry coulis ($8).

10:30 p.m.
3 -- Blues in the Night
Indianapolis has had a blues scene for generations, and it's still alive and kickin' at the Slippery Noodle Inn (372 South Meridian Street, 317-631-6974; $5 cover). Housed in a two-story building constructed as a bar and roadhouse around 1850, the Noodle attracts a lively crowd (including, back in the day, the Dillinger Gang) and nationally known blues musicians like Country Joe McDonald and Ronnie Earl. But it's the local bands that make the place rock, so hoist a pint of the Indiana-brewed Upland IPA ($4) and groove along with the thumping bass lines on the neon-bathed dance floor.

Saturday

10 a.m.
4 -- Monumental Efforts
Start at Monument Circle in the heart of downtown with a cup of coffee ($1.43) and a fresh-baked muffin ($1.79) from the Chocolate Cafe (20 North Meridian Street, 317-951-4816) and head to the Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1 Monument Circle, 317-232-7615). Inside the base of the 103-year-old, 284-foot tall obelisk, look over the Civil War museum that chronicles the lives of Hoosier soldiers, then take the elevator or brave the 330 stairs to the top. A few blocks north is the Freemasons' Scottish Rite Cathedral, above (650 North Meridian Street, 800-489-3579; open Monday through Friday and the third Saturday of each month from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. only). Take an hourlong guided tour. The cathedral, a 76-year-old Gothic structure believed to be the largest devoted to freemasonry, is used as a meeting hall rather than as a house of worship. With its 212-foot tower, 54 bells, 2,500-pound gilded bronze chandelier, cavernous oak-paneled halls and stained-glass windows depicting the 33 degrees of freemasonry, the cathedral is a tribute to the masons' devotion to the arts, sciences and religion.

Noon
5 -- Vintage Eating and Bowling
The Fountain Square Diner, above, in the Fountain Square Theater Building (1105 Prospect Street, 317-685-1959) is a restored 1950's soda fountain and diner complete with arcade games of the era and a working Rock-Ola record-playing jukebox (three plays for 25 cents). Have a hamburger with crinkle-cut fries and a bowl of chili ($5) and a malted milkshake ($3.50) that requires a bit of work to get through the straw. After lunch, head to one of two duckpin bowling alleys in the building. The one upstairs still uses the original 1930's equipment. Downstairs has 50's-vintage bowling (both alleys: $25 an hour for each lane, shoes included).

3 p.m.
6 -- White River Junction
Stroll along the canal and green spaces of White River State Park (801 West Washington Street, 317-233-2434) on the city's west side, where you have a pick of several museums and the Indianapolis Zoo. The N.C.A.A.'s national headquarters is here as well, and you can visit the N.C.A.A. Hall of Champions (317-916-4255, $3 admission) to see exhibits on the 23 men's and women's intercollegiate sports it administers.

6 p.m.
7 -- Hoosier Heartland
For a real taste of Hoosier country, grab some hors d'oeuvres and a bottle of wine and drive about 40 minutes northeast of the city, past farmland and cornfields, till you come to Bonge's Tavern (9830 West 280 North, Perkinsville; 765-734-1625), an eclectic country roadhouse that opened in 1934. The restaurant does not take reservations for fewer than 10 people, so arrive early and be ready to wait 90 minutes or more. Part of the Bonge's experience is chatting with other patrons while sitting on rocking chairs on the enclosed porch, maybe sharing some of the wine and snacks you so thoughtfully brought. Once inside, order the Perkinsville Pork ($19), a juicy, pounded-flat, parmesan-crusted loin, arguably the best in the state. Other meals are posted on a chalkboard above the bar and change weekly. All meals come with an unusually large crispy wedge salad and creamy tomato soup.

10 p.m.
8 -- Tickling the Twine
High school basketball is practically a religion in Indiana, and perhaps there is no more famous team than the 1954 Milan High School squad, which won the statewide championship with Bobby Plump's ''shot heard 'round the state.'' Their story formed the basis for the 1986 film ''Hoosiers.'' Today, Mr. Plump and his son Jonathan operate a bar, Plump's Last Shot (6416 Cornell Avenue, 317-257-5867), a hoops-memorabilia-filled hangout in the Broad Ripple neighborhood and the perfect place to catch a game on TV -- especially if it's the Indiana High School Boys Basketball State Finals, which will be staged for the 96th time this March.

Sunday

Noon
9 -- Start Your Engines
No visit to Indianapolis would be complete without a trip to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (4790 West 16th Street, 317-492-6784). The Hall of Fame Museum ($3 admission) within the racetrack grounds houses vintage race cars, trophies and more than two dozen cars that actually won the Indy 500 -- including Ray Harroun's Marmon Wasp, above, which finished first in the race's inaugural running in 1911. The narrated bus ride around the fabled 2 1/2-mile oval ($3) may be the closest you ever come to racing in the old Brickyard, but unfortunately the driver never gets above 30 miles an hour. The tour offers an up-close look at the famed racing pagoda, Gasoline Alley and the last remaining strip of the track's original brick surface, 36 inches wide, which now serves as the start/finish line.

THE BASICS
Hoosier Hospitality, Midwestern Charm
 Downtown Indianapolis is a 15-minute drive from the Indianapolis International Airport. A rental car is recommended; on-street parking is easily found throughout the city. 
 Most of the major hotels are downtown. The Canterbury Hotel (123 South Illinois Street, 800-538-8186), a 12-story building and a local landmark, offers 99 rooms starting at $189. 
 The Crowne Plaza (123 West Louisiana Street, 317-631-2221) is connected to the city's old Union Station, and 26 of its 273 rooms are in 13 Pullman sleeping cars down on the track and are named for personalities from the early 1900's. Rooms range from $139 to $209.

HEADLINE: Deal to Replace Schools After Katrina Is Faulted 

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
From their new metal-encased classroom, the third graders who returned to school this week can look straight into the carcass of the old North Bay Elementary.
 To the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the modular classrooms lined up next to the soon-to-be demolished former school show, as the billboard out front boasts, ''Katrina Recovery in Progress.''
But to critics, the 450 portable classrooms being installed across Mississippi are prime examples in their case against FEMA and its federal partner, the Army Corps of Engineers, for wasteful spending and favoritism in the $62 billion hurricane relief effort. 
 Provided by a politically connected Alaskan-owned business under a $40 million no-bid contract, the classrooms cost FEMA nearly $90,000 each, including transportation, according to contracting documents. That is double the wholesale price and nearly 60 percent higher than the price offered by two small Mississippi businesses dropped from the deal. 
 In addition, the portable buildings were not secured in a concrete foundation, as usually required by state regulations because of safety concerns in a region prone to hurricanes and tornados. 
 The classroom contract has already prompted a lawsuit from one of the Mississippi companies and a government investigation. 
 ''The fact that natural disasters are not precisely predictable must not be an excuse for careless contracting practices,'' David E. Cooper from the Government Accountability Office, told Congress recently. In testimony submitted this week, Mr. Cooper said, ''We found information in the corps' contract files and from other sources that suggest the negotiated prices were inflated.''
 Officials at Akima Management Services, the contractor that got the job, say they that while the cost was high, this was not a case of price gouging. The speed demanded in installing the classrooms required charging a premium, said John D. Wood, the company's president. 
 ''What we provided to the government was a fair and reasonable cost given the emergency conditions and the risks,'' Mr. Wood said. ''If it had been done the other way, the kids would not have been in school yet.''
 Akima's majority owner is the NANA Regional Corporation. It is represented in Washington by Blank Rome Government Relations, a lobbying firm with close ties to the Bush administration and particularly Tom Ridge, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA's parent agency. NANA's federal contracts have grown rapidly in recent years, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
 Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, argues that the Akima deal made no sense. Instead of paying a middleman like Akima or the Mississippi companies, he told the Department of Homeland Security, the federal government should have purchased the classrooms directly. And he complained that FEMA had ignored a requirement to give preference to local businesses.
 The transaction, Mr. Thompson wrote to the department's inspector general, could ''result not only in the American taxpayer being exorbitantly overcharged, but will hamper real rebuilding and economic recovery efforts in Mississippi.''
 The school construction job is just one of several Hurricane Katrina deals under scrutiny by auditors and Congressional investigators. In awarding those contracts -- for roof tarps, debris removal and mobile homes -- the federal government said it had to move quickly and often turned to proven contractors accustomed to large-scale work.
 The classrooms would have been by far the largest project ever undertaken by the Mississippi company seeking the contract, its owners acknowledge. The business, Adams Hardware and Home Center, has been selling modular classrooms statewide for decades and operates a local mobile home park.
 Adams is based in Yazoo City, Miss., about 200 miles north of Bay St. Louis, in a hardware store with a hornets' nest hanging, an eight-point buck with a cigarette stuffed in its mouth and a life-size doll whose head is buried in a toilet outside. 
 After Hurricane Katrina passed, the father and two sons who run the business recognized that the calamity could turn into a windfall for them and a frequent partner, Magnolia State School Products of Columbus, Miss. Hundreds of schools across the state were damaged or destroyed. 
 ''We set out to do this project not only, of course, to make a profit but to create jobs within our own community,'' said Kent Adams, the son of the owner, Paul Adams Jr., and manager of the business.
 Calling their usual suppliers, they identified a Florida dealer and a Georgia manufacturer that could soon deliver more than 400 classrooms, Mr. Adams said. They proposed a deal for about $24 million, including transportation. That included a profit of about $4 million above the $19.7 million it would cost to acquire and transport the units, the contract documents show.
 But when Adams and Magnolia approached the state education department with the offer, they were referred to the Corps of Engineers, which then referred them to Akima.
 Akima (pronounced AH-kahmah) is a 10-year-old enterprise jointly owned by 14,000 Inupiat and Unangan Native Alaskans. Thanks to a law passed in 1971, it is one of several native-owned businesses eligible for no-bid federal contracts. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, has long pushed for changes in contracting rules that have helped enrich Alaskan companies. 
 Akima, now based in Charlotte, N.C., has 1,300 full- or part-time employees who work on 22 federal contracts, mostly with the military. It also has an agreement with the Army to supply modular buildings.
 Mr. Wood said that neither Akima nor NANA used any ties to elected officials to pursue contracts, despite assertions in a Mississippi newspaper that the classroom deal may have been the result of political connections.
 ''We have never used or attempted to use political influence for any contract involving Akima,'' he said. ''That is fact.''
 After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA asked the corps to help Mississippi reopen schools. The corps passed the assignment on to Akima.
 The Adams company, as requested, faxed letters to Akima on Sept. 16, outlining its arrangements to acquire the portable classrooms.
 But there were a few details the Adamses did not note in their faxes. Paul Adams Jr. had agreed to plead guilty in 1990 to a charge that he conspired with Magnolia to fix prices by divvying up the Mississippi modular classroom business.
 Kent Adams said they did not disclose the matter because he and his father did not consider it relevant. The corps asks applicants to disclose such information for only the last three years. The charges were dismissed after his father paid a $1,000 fine and was put on probation.
 Akima was not aware of the case until after it dropped Adams Home Center from the deal. But its executives were worried about other issues, Mr. Wood said. Akima concluded that the Mississippi business could not deliver as many classrooms as promised. That meant Akima could not meet deadlines set by the Corps, which wanted 200 classrooms in 14 days and the rest within 45 days, or by the end of October.
 ''He could not satisfy the schedule,'' Mr. Wood said.
 Contract documents show that the Adamses had miscalculated how many classrooms the Georgia manufacturer had said it could provide. But Kent Adams said that after he and his father learned of the mistake, they identified alternate suppliers to make up the difference.
 A day after the shortfall was identified, Akima completed a $39.6 million no-bid deal with the corps that did not include Adams Home Center. 
 Under the agreement, the corps would pay $87,892 per classroom, far more than the $55,545 Adams intended to charge, contract documents show.
 Mr. Wood said the higher price was justified because Akima had to buy more expensive units and hire 187 truck drivers to meet the Corps deadlines. They had to pay twice the normal rate for drivers, he said.
 ''We did not gouge the government,'' he said, declining to disclose the company's profit. ''If you had until next summer to deliver these trailers, you could get it cheaper.''
 But so far, government auditors are not convinced.
 ''We have concerns that the government may be paying more than necessary,'' Mr. Cooper, of the G.A.O., said in written testimony presented to Congress this week, adding that there was evidence of inflated prices. The auditors are also inquiring about how the classrooms were installed. After Akima delivered them, the structures were placed atop concrete blocks, with a series of straps tied to anchors drilled into the ground. Plywood walkways were then built, linking the classrooms.
 A Mississippi State Board of Education code does not permit concrete blocks and piers to anchor modular units. Instead, it requires that they be built on foundations consisting of steel posts secured by poured-in-place concrete.
 Regina Ginn, a director in the state office that imposes the standards, said she knew the new classrooms did not fully comply with the state code. But Ms. Ginn added that she considered the corps approach sufficient, an assessment endorsed by Jerry Brosius, a Pennsylvania engineer who has installed modular classrooms for more than 20 years.
 ''These are temporary buildings,'' Mr. Brosius said. ''They are not going to be there for 20 years.''
 Michael H. Logue, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers regional office in Vicksburg, Miss., defended the classroom deal. ''We executed the fastest, most reasonable procurement action we genuinely felt was available to us,'' Mr. Logue said.
 Akima met its corps deadlines for the classrooms. The total cost for the corps project to date has been $72 million, because of additional work, installing modular offices for government agencies and building walkways.
 The project was not a total loss for Adams Home Center and its partner: They were paid a $200,000 finder's fee by the classroom supplier because Akima bought the units they had identified. But the Adamses have filed a lawsuit seeking some of the profits they had hoped to collect, to which Akima already has said they have no right to claim.
 In Bay St. Louis, where homes and stores are still largely ruins, the debate over the classroom costs or contractor seem irrelevant. 
 ''School being back for these children is a break from the reality of destroyed homes,'' said Johnette Bilbo, a teacher at North Bay. ''It is just a start. But this is the first large step back to normalcy and routine in their lives.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Starts Semi-Independent Forum for Mideast Democracy

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Friday, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, facing complaints that it is trying to impose democracy in the Middle East, is forming a government-financed but semi-independent foundation to promote political activities with less of a taint from being financed solely by Washington, administration officials say. 
 The program, the Foundation for the Future, and a Fund of the Future to promote business activities are to be announced as many American officials say President Bush's democracy initiative has borne fruit in some places and met resentment in others.
''In many ways we're seeing that veil of fear is lifting,'' said Elizabeth Cheney, the State Department's official in charge of promoting democracy in the Middle East and the vice president's daughter. ''We're seeing something very real happening across the region in terms of progress toward opening up societies, opening up political systems and economic systems.''
 But other officials, speaking anonymously to avoid being seen as undermining the effort to promote democracy, say the record has been disappointing, particularly in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, two of the United States' most important Middle East allies. What can often sound like preaching from American officials has not helped the cause, they say.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who arrived Friday in Bahrain for a meeting involving Europe, Japan and Muslim nations, part of the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative started by Mr. Bush in June 2004, said Thursday that the initial financing goals for the new programs would be $100 million for the business fund and $50 million for the democracy foundation, raised from American, European and Arab governments.
 ''The remarkable thing about this is that we're going to have Arab partners and Middle Eastern partners,'' she said. How much the financing for the new efforts would supplant money for other American aid programs was unclear. 
 American officials say the Bahrain meeting will signal a recalibration of Mr. Bush's approach to aiding democracy. This year, the Middle East Partnership Initiative is to spend $100 million to support election monitors, candidate training and political groups in the Middle East. But under the new programs, $85 million from the initiative is to go to the two new semi-independent efforts. Financing would be directed by people in the region, not Americans.

HEADLINE: In Louisiana, Old Rivalries Resurfacing On Storm Aid

BYLINE: By JEREMY ALFORD

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
When she called a special legislative session on rebuilding southern Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco expressed hope that the state's ancient political rivalries, which have set lawmakers from the piney woods of north Louisiana against those from the swamps and bayous in the south, would finally be cast aside.
 ''The nation must see a united front,'' Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, told the Legislature on Sunday night, as she prepared both to cut the budget deeply and to spend large amounts on recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
But four days into the 17-day session, there are already signs that the old geographic differences are again bubbling to the surface. Representatives of rural areas to the north are trying to protect their programs from being slashed. Cities that have taken in large numbers of evacuees want money to deal with the overflow. And lawmakers from stricken southern regions are desperately trying to begin the rebuilding process.
 Reggie P. Dupre Jr., a Democratic state senator from Terrebonne Parish, said it was always a challenge to persuade his colleagues from the northern part of the state that coastal restoration and flood protection should be priorities for Louisiana. Some areas in the lower part of his district sank under nine feet of water as Hurricane Katrina traveled the coastline in late August, demolishing homes and shuttering businesses.
 ''It's difficult to explain to people who aren't from here, or who haven't seen it,'' said Mr. Dupre, who wants the state to assume greater oversight of levee maintenance. ''Our priorities in south Louisiana are not pork barrel issues, like some might say. They are about the survival of coastal communities.''
 But Charles D. Jones, a Democratic state senator who represents an impoverished northern district around Monroe, said his constituents could not afford cuts in government assistance programs, like the 60 after-school teachers who were laid off this month at the Louisiana Center Against Poverty in Lake Providence after the budget cuts began.
 ''The area was already poor in the first place,'' Mr. Jones said in a recent interview. ''Now, to absorb these cuts on top of all this is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment.''
 He added: ''I supported New Orleans. I voted for the Superdome. I voted for everything these cities needed to improve their economies. Our needs are so great, and we need so much, but no one is paying attention.''
 In the wake of the hurricanes, cities and towns around the state sent hundreds of volunteers and emergency workers to help. The cities took in hundreds of thousands of evacuees from the south and put them up in private homes, shelters and trailer camps. 
 But many of the evacuees remain there, taxing city services, and the spirit of generosity is being strained by diminishing resources. Some legislators have complained that the $1,000 per student they have received from the state for educating evacuees is not nearly adequate.
 There has also been an outcry from northern legislators at the governor's decision not to spend any money from a discretionary fund long used to pay for pet projects of members, in part to help reduce a budget deficit approaching $1 billion. The deficit is largely the result of the evacuation from southern Louisiana.
 Elliott Stonecipher, a political analyst and demographer based in Shreveport, said the traditional north-south divide in the Legislature dated to the cultural origins of the state, with French and Caribbean Roman Catholics in the moderate-to-liberal south and Germanic Protestants in the conservative north. 
 New Orleans, with a far more concentrated black and Democratic population than the rest of the state, has long had more power in the Legislature than popularity.
 ''Everyone knows that all of Louisiana benefits from New Orleans,'' Mr. Stonecipher said. ''But New Orleans has also roughed up the rest of the state politically for as long as anyone can remember. There's not a political official, not to mention legislator, outside of New Orleans proper who has not had projects near and dear to them die over and over in the Legislature because of the sheer power and clout of New Orleans. But now they need everyone's help, and that is the irony we find ourselves in.'' 
 Once the voting on cuts and spending begins, he said, the old divisions will reassert themselves.
 But Robert Adley, a Democratic state senator from the northwest town of Benton, said he believed that the hurricanes' devastation could still produce a consensus.
 ''We all know there are three states in Louisiana: north, south and the Isle of Orleans,'' Mr. Adley said. ''But we are a family, and families come together in the time of a crisis.''

HEADLINE: Genetic Find Stirs Debate On Race-Based Medicine

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
In a finding that is likely to sharpen discussion about the merits of race-based medicine, an Icelandic company says it has detected a version of a gene that raises the risk of heart attack in African-Americans by more than 250 percent.
 The company, DeCode Genetics, first found the variant gene among Icelanders and then looked for it in three American populations, in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta. 
Among Americans of European ancestry, the variant is quite common, but it causes only a small increase in risk, about 16 percent. 
 The opposite is true among African-Americans. Only 6 percent of African-Americans have inherited the variant gene, but they are 3.5 times as likely to suffer a heart attack as those who carry the normal version of the gene, a team of DeCode scientists led by Dr. Anna Helgadottir reported in an article released online yesterday by Nature Genetics.
 Dr. Kari Stefansson, the company's chief executive, said he would consult with the Association of Black Cardiologists and others as to whether to test a new heart attack drug specifically in a population of African-Americans. 
 The drug, known now as DG031, inhibits a different but closely related gene and is about to be put into Phase 3 trials, the last stage before a maker seeks the Food and Drug Administration's approval.
 Last year a drug called BiDil evoked mixed reactions after it was shown to sharply reduce heart attacks among African-Americans, first in a general study and then in a targeted study, after it failed to show efficacy in the general population. The drug, invented by Dr. Jay N. Cohn, a cardiologist at the University of Minnesota, prompted objections that race-based medicine was the wrong approach. 
 Geneticists agree that the medically important issue is not race itself but the genes that predispose a person to disease. But it may often be useful for physicians to take race into account because the predisposing genes for many diseases follow racial patterns.
 The new variant found by DeCode Genetics is a more active version of a gene that helps govern the body's inflammatory response to infection. Called leukotriene A4 hydrolase, the gene is involved in the synthesis of leukotrienes, agents that maintain a state of inflammation. 
 Dr. Stefansson said he believed that the more active version of this gene might have risen to prominence in Europeans and Asians because it conferred extra protection against infectious disease. 
 Along with the protection would have come a higher risk of heart attack because plaques that build up in the walls of the arteries could become inflamed and rupture. But because the active version of the gene started to be favored long ago, Europeans and Asians have had time to develop genetic changes that offset the extra risk of heart attack.
 The active version of the inflammatory gene would have passed from Europeans into African-Americans only a few generations ago, too short a time for development of genes that protect against heart attack, Dr. Stefansson suggested. 
 The DG031 drug being tested by DeCode Genetics affects a second gene, but one that is also involved in control of leukotrienes. Because the drug reduces leukotriene levels and inflammation, it may help African-Americans who have the variant of the hydrolase gene. ''It would make scientific, economic and particularly political sense to have a significant part of the clinical trials done in an African-American population,'' Dr. Stefansson said.
 A spokeswoman for the black cardiologists' group, which supported the BiDil trial, said the group's officials were not ready to discuss the new gene. 
 Dr. Troy Duster of New York University, an adviser to the federal Human Genome Project and a past president of the American Sociological Association, said he saw no objection to a trial, provided it focused on African-Americans with the risk-associated variant of the gene and took into account that people with ancestry from different regions of Africa might show variations in risk.
 But Dr. Charles Rotimi, a genetic epidemiologist at Howard University, said a separate study of African-Americans would not be desirable. The variant gene may be overactive in African-Americans because of their greater exposure to deleterious environments, Dr. Rotimi said. 
 Dr. Cohn, the inventor of BiDil, said it was ''always best to study a drug in a highly responsive group,'' rather than testing large populations where possible benefits to subgroups could be missed. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 16, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the genetics of heart disease in African-Americans referred imprecisely to the drug BiDil. It has been found to increase survival among black patients with advanced heart disease, not to reduce heart attacks.

HEADLINE: Angry Jordanians Mourn Dead, and a Bruised Image 

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Eric O'Keefe contributed reporting from Dallas for this article.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
The dead were buried, the city mourned and a nation grew defiant on Thursday after the worst act of terrorism in Jordan's history rattled the country's delicate sense of stability and set off an outpouring of emotion in condemnation of the attacks.
 As investigators continued to sift through the rubble left by Wednesday's suicide bombings at three popular hotels, Jordanians struggled to come to terms with what many saw as a direct attack on the country's identity and economy. 
Three suicide bombers tore through the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, a wedding party at the Radisson SAS Hotel down the street, and at the Days Inn Hotel several miles away, killing 56 others and leaving 96 severely injured.
 More than half the victims were Jordanians. Among the dead at the Radisson were the fathers of both the bride and the groom. At least one was American, a spokesman the American Embassy said. Numerous Saudis, Indonesians and Chinese were also among the victims, the government said. 
 ''This culture that is mingling in our society has no justification,'' said Marwan Muasher, the deputy prime minister, speaking of the suicide bombers. ''Our society will confront them and say, no, no matter what their cause is, be it the occupation of Iraq or Palestine. We will do everything to defend ourselves.'' 
 Jordan has long struggled to maintain a delicate balance between the interests of its Arab neighbors and those of the United States and Israel. 
 Jordan was the second Arab nation to make peace with Israel but has also sought to maintain good relations with its Arab neighbors, including Syria. 
 It backed the United States in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has become a staging ground for Iraqis and for foreign businesses entering Iraq. In the process, it has reaped the benefits of trade that has strengthened the economy despite the loss of inexpensive oil once supplied by Saddam Hussein. 
 On Thursday the main terrorist group in Iraq, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, posted an Internet message claiming responsibility for the bombings here. The group's leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is a Jordanian who has been behind several attempted attacks in Jordan in recent years.
 King Abdullah II, in a forceful address broadcast on Jordanian television, pledged to root out the militants responsible for the bombing. He cut short a state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday in order to respond to the attacks.
 ''We will pursue those criminals and those who are behind them, and we will reach them wherever they are,'' Abdullah said in his speech. ''We will confront these cowardly terrorist groups that have no religion or conscience.''
 As day broke on Thursday, crews began cleaning the bomb damage at the hotels while investigators continued to pick through evidence. 
 Authorities said two of the suicide bombers entered the lobbies of the Hyatt and Radisson Hotel and set off explosives belts strapped to their bodies, while the third set off his explosive belt outside the Days Inn. Security men recovered what they believe are the remains of the bombers and were conducting DNA analyses to identify them. 
 At the Radisson, hotel managers tried to get back to business, and staff members took reservations and checked in guests even as investigators were sifting through the wreckage. 
 At midday, hundreds of Jordanians gathered for protest marches in the heart of the capital and elsewhere in the country, waving Jordanian flags and unfurling banners declaring, ''No to cooperation with the forces of evil and fear.'' Some chanted ''Oh, terrorists, listen! We will not bow down to you!'' Others chanted, ''We are Christians, we are Muslim, we are one people!'' 
 ''We came to support our nation and our unity,'' said Ibrahim Haniya, 22, who marched with a group of friends. ''These bombers didn't differentiate between Muslims, Christians or Jews. They were against the world.''
 Yazan Faure, who took part in the march, said: ''We have been trying to help solve the problems of Iraq. All the things we have been doing for Iraq have attracted the eyes of the terrorists, who realize we are still stable.''
 Black flags fluttered from many closed shops, and Jordanian flags were lowered to half-staff as the nation observed a day of mourning. Schools will be closed Saturday, a school day.
 From across the world, leaders telephoned King Abdullah to express their condolences. Among them were Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and President Bush. 
 Mr. Bush said during a meeting in the White House with President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen that the attackers had defiled Islam.
 ''The killings should remind all of us that there is an enemy in this world that is willing to kill innocent people, willing to bomb a wedding celebration, in order to advance their cause,'' The Associated Press quoted Mr. Bush as saying.
 The American Embassy advised citizens staying in Jordanian hotels to remain indoors and avoid going to public places like restaurants, night clubs or other locations perceived to be Western. 
 The embassy also advised Americans to postpone nonessential travel to Jordan.
 In Dallas, the Council on American-Islamic Relations organized a news conference for a relative of many of the victims of the bombing that shattered the wedding at the Radisson. The relative, Nader Akhras, was born in Jenin, in the West Bank and is now an American citizen.
 ''Sixteen of my relatives were killed,'' Mr. Akhras said at the news conference. He described a tearful night at his home in Dallas on Wednesday as family and friends gathered to console one another and wait as news of the deaths arrived via telephone and television. Learning the status of those hospitalized in Amman hospitals has proved especially difficult. 
 Although he remains optimistic, he believes some of the critically injured may have already died.
 ''Many injured people are still in the hospital,'' he said. ''Some people, they don't know which hospital they go to. Many kids, young kids, we don't know what happened with them. 
 ''I pray that God will shower his mercy on the injured.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally as Oil Prices And Bond Yields Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks overcame early losses yesterday as falling oil prices and declining bond yields sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest close of the quarter.
 Wal-Mart Stores helped lead the rally as crude oil and heating oil dropped to three-month lows, giving consumers more money to spend at retailers. Financial and real estate shares climbed on speculation that the decline in energy costs might limit the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases.
The S.& P. 500 rose 10.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,230.96, a level not seen since Sept. 19. The Dow Jones industrial average added 93.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,640.10. The Nasdaq composite index gained 20.87 points, or 1 percent, to 2,196.68. 
 Crude oil for December delivery slid 1.9 percent, to $57.80 a barrel in New York, the lowest since July 21, after the International Energy Agency reduced its forecast for world oil consumption in 2006. Heating oil plunged 2.6 percent, to $1.7435 a gallon, a level not seen since Aug. 5.
 Oil prices, which reached a record in August, and rising interest rates have kept the market at bay this year, with the S.& P. 500 up 1.6 percent and the Dow average down 1.3 percent. The Fed has lifted its target rate 12 consecutive times, to 4 percent, and indicated last week that further increases will follow.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, gained 84 cents, to $49.04. Target, Wal-Mart's rival, climbed $2.29, to $58.85.
 General Motors, the world's largest automaker, slumped $1.12, to $23.51, its lowest level in 13 years. The 4.6 percent loss was the steepest in the Dow average. The company quadrupled its second-quarter loss to $1.07 billion because it overestimated the value of a unit, and said it would restate 2001 profit because of accounting errors.
 Visteon, the auto parts maker, was the S.& P. 500's worst performer for a third day, after it said it would delay filing its third-quarter results because it had yet to complete restatements of previous periods. The shares fell 65 cents, or 9.8 percent, to $5.99. Its shares have plunged 33 percent since Nov. 7.
 More than two stocks gained for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Almost 1.8 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 8.8 percent more than its three-month average.
 A gauge of financial companies rallied on expectations that a slide in bond yields would increase demand for loans. The group climbed 1.8 percent for the biggest gain among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500.
 Shares of Citigroup, the largest financial services company, added 91 cents, to $47.73. J.P. Morgan Chase, the No. 3 United States bank, rose 60 cents, to $38.32.
 An index of real estate stocks jumped 2.6 percent for the biggest advance among two dozen industry groups in the S.& P. 500. The shares gain appeal when bond yields fall because of their dividend yield, which calculated as a group is 4.6 percent, compared with the 2.1 percent payout for the S.& P. 500. 
 The Simon Property Group, the nation's largest owner of shopping malls, climbed $2.42, to $74.26. Equity Office Properties Trust, the largest owner of office buildings, rose 99 cents, to $30.40.
 Prices of United States Treasury rose after overseas investors bought a record amount of notes in an auction, with the benchmark 10-year note climbing 22/32, to 97 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.55 percent, from 4.64 on Wednesday.
 The bond market is closed today to observe the Veterans Day holiday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes: 



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	Price	99.379	High Yield	4.578	Low Yield	4.500	Median Yield	4.565	Total applied for	$31,296,887	Accepted	$15,220,587	Noncompetitive	$82,301	Interest set at	4 1/2	The 10-year notes mature Nov. 15, 2015.

HEADLINE: British Phone Executive Is Content to Observe Mergers 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Deal fever may be threatening to overtake the European telecommunications industry, but Ben Verwaayen, the chief executive of BT, wants nothing to do with it. 
 ''I firmly believe this is an industry that has to reinvent its reason for existing,'' Mr. Verwaayen said in a recent interview at his company's headquarters here. ''Companies will have to change what they need to sell, change how they sell, and therefore change their culture.''
 ''I'm not sure mergers and acquisitions in the traditional sense'' are the answer, he added. 
 Mr. Verwaayen, a 53-year-old native of the Netherlands, has already been a force for change at BT. In his three years at the top of the company, he has helped transform it from a debt-laden bureaucracy into a solid franchise that is growing slowing but steadily, and looking outside of Europe for new business. 
 [On Thursday, BT reported a 14 percent drop in earnings, to $:371 million ($646 million), after a $:70 million charge to create a new business to comply with Britain's telecommunications regulator. Revenues rose 5 percent, to $:4.82 billion ($8.4 billion).] 
 Many telecommunications companies have righted themselves after going on spending sprees in the late 1990's, but Mr. Verwaayen's view on big deals puts BT in sharp contrast to its peers, which have started reaching into their very deep pockets to expand in Europe once again. 
 Telefonica of Spain demonstrated in late October just how deep its pockets were, offering $32 billion for O2, the mobile company that BT spun off four years ago. The price tag was more than 20 percent above O2's market value, and approaching the market value of BT itself, although O2 made far less than BT in operating income in the last fiscal year. Earlier in 2005, France Telecom did its own big deal, buying the Spanish mobile operator Amena for about $8 billion. 
 The Telefonica offer seems to have finally put to rest rumors that BT could itself be interested in buying back O2 -- it is a deal that Mr. Verwaayen says he would have done long ago had he wanted to. 
 Instead of buying up consumer customers, BT has staked its growth plans on corporate ones. The company is concentrating on providing them with the communications technology they need, like corporate computer networks. And instead of looking to Europe, BT is focusing its energies on the United States.
 In doing so, Mr. Verwaayen is going head to head with some of the world's technology giants, like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Analysts and investors are still not completely sold on the plan. 
 ''Everyone is looking at the U.S. market,'' said Brownlee Thomas, a principal analyst with Forrester Research, and it will not be easy for foreign companies. ''U.S. firms like to buy American.''
 ''It's not a political thing,'' she said, ''it's a sense that the company will be closer'' physically in case there is a problem. 
 Some investors say that while they admire Mr. Verwaayen's tenacity, the company should be less ambitious. BT is ''rated as a utility and they generate huge amounts of cash,'' said Alan Beaney, a fund manager at Principal Asset Management, which owns BT shares. BT ''can buy back their shares and grow their earnings that way,'' Mr. Beaney said. ''I know it is not that exciting for the management, but it is good news for shareholders.''
 But Mr. Verwaayen, who radiates a bristly energy, seems to like a challenge. He started in the public relations department of ITT, and his speech is punctuated with phrases like, ''If you don't get passionately emotional about it, then you don't care,'' or ''focus, focus, focus.'' 
 ITT soon promoted him out of public relations (''I was a kid, but a kid with a big mouth,'' Mr. Verwaayen explains), and at age 36, he was plucked by the Dutch government to tackle the thorny task of privatizing KPN, the country's largest telecommunications company. He joined Lucent in 1997 and became chief operating officer a month later. 
 Under Mr. Verwaayen's hand, BT is already making inroads in some corporate markets like network technology services. In 2004, BT ranked fifth globally in the business, with $2.9 billion in revenue, according to the research group Gartner, behind I.B.M., Electronic Data Systems, Hewlett-Packard and Accenture. That is up from seventh the year before.
 The business plan has led BT to some acquisitions of its own, but they have been tiny and specific, rather than colossal or transforming. In October 2004, BT paid Reuters $175 million for Radianz, an Internet, intranet and communications technology provider to financial institutions. The business gave BT 185 bank, brokerage and exchange customers, like the New York Stock Exchange and Merrill Lynch. 
 Mr. Verwaayen, ever the skeptic of big deals, contends that the mega-mergers that combined SBC with AT&T and MCI with Verizon in the United States have created opportunities for him. All the acquisition activity has distracted those companies from the business of seeking new customers. Which, he added, ''opens the door for us.''

HEADLINE: Syrian Chief Voices Defiance Against 'Foreign Attack'

BYLINE: By KATHERINE ZOEPF

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
In a rare, televised public address, President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday offered no bold initiatives and characterized a United Nations investigation into the Feb. 14 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon as part of a United States attack on Syria. 
 ''We must be steadfast in facing this foreign attack: we don't want to mention names, but you know who I'm talking about,'' he said, to peals of laughter from his audience at Damascus University. 
Mr. Assad said Detlev Mehlis, the German prosecutor who leads the inquiry, had refused Syria's invitation to come to Damascus to discuss Syria's cooperation. He did not say whether he had decided to comply with Mr. Mehlis's request to send six high-ranking intelligence officials -- including his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat, the head of military intelligence -- to Lebanon for questioning. 
 Later Thursday, though, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations, Fayssal Mekdad, told reporters in New York that Mr. Mehlis was free to interview the six officials anywhere but in Beirut, Lebanon, Bloomberg News reported.
 An interim report by Mr. Mehlis in October implicated the six in the killing and accused Damascus of impeding the investigation. In response, the Security Council passed a resolution calling on Syria to cooperate or face the threat of economic sanctions. 
 Mr. Assad did pledge Thursday that Syria would continue to assist Mr. Mehlis in his investigation. But he also struck a defiant note, telling Syrians that they must remain strong in the face of ''cultural and psychological warfare'' that aimed to weaken Syrian unity. 
 In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, dismissed Mr. Assad's speech as ''appalling'' and ''outrageous.'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on her way to the Middle East, said it was just another stalling tactic. ''I don't think this constitutes cooperation,'' she told The Associated Press.
 Hunein Nemer, a member of Syria's Parliament, said Mr. Assad's speech was calculated to shore up domestic support and to quell Syrians' growing sense of anxiety about the pressures the country faces. 
 In the hours before the speech, carefully choreographed patriotic rallies sprang up throughout Damascus. At 7 a.m., all subscribers to Syriatel, the cellphone network that is owned by the president's first cousin, Rami Makhlouf, received text messages asking them to attend rallies showing ''love of country and the rejection of external pressures.'' 
 Outside the hall where the president spoke, thousands of demonstrators pumped their fists in the air, chanting, ''Our blood and our souls we sacrifice to you, oh Bashar!'' 
 Yet many Syrians said they were disappointed by the speech, which, for all its passionate display, was mainly a reiteration of the government's long-held positions. It had been widely expected that Mr. Assad would announce major new reforms in order to build popular support. 
 ''Yesterday, everyone's hopes were sky high,'' said Marwan al-Kabalan, a political science professor at Damascus University. ''Everyone was talking about reforms, about a very dramatic speech that would discuss the Mehlis report in detail and outline Syria's response. But the president didn't even talk about whether he has decided to hand over these six intelligence officers, and of course this is the single thing most on Syrians' minds.''
 Mr. Assad used harsh language when he discussed the Lebanese, and he appeared to warn opposition groups trying to organize here. ''If someone in Syria raises his voice in tandem with foreigners, he is being controlled by foreigners,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cleaner Cars for New York

 BODY:
New York State announced Wednesday that it would adopt California's strict new limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, a major global warming gas. The announcement fulfills Gov. George Pataki's pledge in his State of the State address in 2003 to make all cars sold in New York State adhere to the California standards. It also puts him on a direct collision course with the Bush administration, which has joined with the major automobile manufacturers in opposing the California program. 
 The California program, approved by the State Legislature in 2002, requires manufacturers to begin cutting carbon dioxide emissions in the 2009 model year, with a goal of reducing these emissions by 30 percent by the 2016 model year. This is an ambitious target, and absent a sudden technological breakthrough, the only feasible way to meet it is to force the automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars, which produce less emissions.
 The program faces a legal siege. The automakers and the administration argue that this is merely a backdoor way of mandating tougher fuel-economy standards, which under current law are the responsibility of the federal government. California's reply is that it has a right -- indeed, an obligation -- under the Clean Air Act to remove pollutants of any kind from California's air. 
 The larger issue here is one of political leadership. President Bush has refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from any source -- cars, power plants or industrial sites -- preferring instead a softer, voluntary approach that has yielded little progress. Congress, meanwhile, has refused to mandate significant increases in fuel efficiency.
 Impatient governors who take global warming more seriously than Mr. Bush and Congress do -- including Republicans like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr. Pataki -- have therefore decided to take matters into their own hands. 
 Altogether, more than 30 states have approved global warming laws of one sort or another. And in a few weeks, a consortium of Northeastern states will announce a breakthrough program imposing regional caps on power plants' emissions and setting up a trading program to help cut these emissions in a cost-effective manner.
 The impact of the automobile program could be huge if it survives legal challenges. Cars and light trucks (a category that includes sport utility vehicles) account for one-fifth of America's greenhouse gas emissions and about 40 percent of its oil consumption. In addition to New York, seven Northeastern states as well as Washington and Oregon have either adopted the California program or are moving in that direction.
 This means that by the end of the year, nearly one-third of the automobile retail market is likely to be covered by the new regulations -- a tremendous incentive to the industry to start making fuel-efficient cars for everyone.

HEADLINE: Nissan to Move American Base to Tennessee

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Detroit. Stuttgart. Tokyo. All three are cities known for being hubs of the global auto industry. But Franklin, Tenn.?
 The Nissan Motor Company said Thursday that it would sell its North American headquarters outside Los Angeles and relocate to Franklin, a town of 46,000 people 15 miles southwest of Nashville. 
''We're coming to Tennessee,'' Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, announced to a room packed with state and local politicians at the State Capitol.
 Nissan will begin relocating employees next year and plans to open the new headquarters in 2008. 
 Nissan's decision to move to Tennessee, where Mr. Ghosn said the cost of doing business was 44 percent less than in California, comes as automakers are cutting costs in a tough North American business climate. High gas prices, stiff competition and consumer fatigue have combined to drive auto sales in the United States to historically low levels.
 ''We're going to be facing in 2006, 2007, I'd say at best stagnation,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''It's an industry where you have to move all the time. You have to question yourself all the time. You have to challenge the way you're doing business all the time.''
 Nissan decided to move after conducting a study of how it could cut costs and improve efficiency across its global operations. The company said last year it would move its global headquarters from downtown Tokyo to Yokohama, a nearby port city. 
 To entice Nissan to Tennessee, the state is providing a tax-incentive package, but state officials would not say how much the tax breaks would be worth. The state offers what it calls a jobs tax credit, which awards companies tax incentives based on the value of their investment in the state.
 Mr. Ghosn declined to say how much the company would save by moving to Tennessee.
 The company already has a sizable presence here. It employs about 8,000 workers in two plants. When Nissan closes its California headquarters, it will transfer all 1,300 jobs. 
 Mr. Ghosn acknowledged that the company could face a brain drain of employees reluctant to move to central Tennessee from Southern California. He said as many as half the employees in the Los Angeles headquarters might decide to leave the company.
 ''At the beginning, a lot of people will be hesitant,'' he said. He later added that he expected most, if not all, of the company's top North American managers to stay on.
 The move has been met with some criticism. A former top Nissan executive for North America, Yutaka Katayama, known as Mr. K to Nissan enthusiasts, wrote to Mr. Ghosn saying that the move was a mistake.
 But Tennessee's governor, Phil Bredesen, a former Californian, offered some encouraging words for Nissan employees: ''With creativity and hard work, you can make a pretty good life for yourself in Tennessee.''

HEADLINE: Nominee For Fed Chief Wins Backing Of Schumer 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
A leading Senate Democrat on Thursday endorsed President Bush's nomination of Ben S. Bernanke to become chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 ''I think he's going to be an outstanding Fed chairman, and I think he's going to be in the mold of Alan Greenspan,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, after a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Bernanke. 
The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing for Tuesday on Mr. Bernanke, a longtime economist at Princeton and a former Fed governor who is now a top economic adviser to Mr. Bush.
 Though Mr. Bernanke has won widespread praise from economists and lawmakers, Mr. Schumer's emphatic endorsement means that Democrats are likely to clear the path for an easy confirmation.
 ''I think the only people who might not like him are on the far right or the far left,'' Mr. Schumer told reporters after his meeting. 
 Mr. Schumer said he had received assurances from Mr. Bernanke that he would follow the lead of Mr. Greenspan and speak out about fiscal policy and about the need to reduce deficits.
 That is a shift for Mr. Bernanke, who has defended Mr. Bush's tax cuts and played down the significance of the current budget deficits since he became chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in June. 
 Mr. Bernanke initially told lawmakers and others that he would avoid commenting on fiscal policy if he became Fed chairman. But Democrats are hoping that Mr. Bernanke will echo the view of Mr. Greenspan that tax cuts should be paid for with savings in other areas.
 Mr. Schumer said Mr. Bernanke also assured him that he would be flexible and would not rely on rigid formulas for setting monetary policy.
 Mr. Bernanke has been a longtime champion of ''inflation targeting,'' that is, having the central bank set its policies to keep inflation within a tight range. Mr. Bernanke has suggested a rate of 1 percent to 2 percent, excluding the prices of food and energy.
 Critics of inflation targeting, including Mr. Greenspan, say the approach is too rigid to deal with the uncertainties and unexpected jolts that often throw an economy off course. Some Democrats, like Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, have worried that Mr. Bernanke would focus only on inflation and pay too little attention to job creation.
 The writings of Mr. Bernanke have made it clear he believes in flexibility. In 1997, for example, he argued that the Fed's inflation target should be a relatively long-term goal and that the main purpose of inflation targeting was to make the policy of the central bank more open and predictable.
 ''While he believes in transparency at the Fed, he is much less rigid than I had been led to believe in monetary policy,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''I don't think he's wedded to a mechanistic formula; he says he's not.''

HEADLINE: For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Don Garber pointed to a neon orange chair in his cushy corner office, which overlooks Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. With a smile as bright as the chair's leather exterior, he gushed: ''How many commissioners have orange leather chairs, man? It's happening!''
 For Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, the chair is more than a place to sit. It is a statement of where the M.L.S. is and where it is heading. 
''It represents the brand that we want to shout out to everyone in this country and around the world,'' he said. ''That we're young, that we're somewhat hip, that we've got a sense of who we are and a sense of history, yet at the same time a real sense of our future.''
 And what exactly is the future of M.L.S.? The league concludes its 10th season Sunday when the Los Angeles Galaxy plays the New England Revolution in Frisco, Tex., for the league title.
 While intelligent marketing has helped give M.L.S. financial certainty, Garber's vision may not be universally accepted. He said the league has exceeded expectations and has an even brighter future.
 ''Decades from now, this will be one of the most popular sports leagues in America,'' Garber said.
 But the sports consultant Marc Ganis said soccer ''is not a traditional U.S. sport and has not grown into that. There are many people who believe it never will.''
 Ganis is the president of SportsCorp Ltd., a sports business and marketing consultant group.
 ''I think it will be a major niche sport, and it has the potential of growing even a little bit beyond that,'' he added. ''In our lifetime, and the lifetimes of our children, Major League Soccer will not rival the N.B.A., Major League Baseball or the N.F.L.''
 The raw numbers alone suggest the league has shown little growth since its inception in 1996.
 Average regular-season attendance was at its highest in the league's first season (17,406), but it has been up and down since and was at 15,108 this past season, slightly down from last year. Although total viewership has increased, television ratings have declined since the inaugural season.
 And the league was reported to have lost an estimated $250 million in its first five years and more than $300 million over all.
 But M.L.S. also has reasons for optimism.
 A television deal that, according to Garber, ''will drastically change the economics of Major League Soccer,'' is close to being completed.
 The league is continuing to invest in multimillion-dollar soccer stadiums and plans to expand to 14 teams by 2007, signs that it is not planning to close its doors.
 ''I would say probably in some respects, the league may not be exactly where we thought it might be,'' said Lamar Hunt, owner of the Columbus Crew, F.C. Dallas and the Kansas City Wizards, as well as the N.F.L.'s Kansas City Chiefs. ''But I think the sport has far exceeded what a reasonable expectation might be.''
 Though the league is still losing money -- only the Galaxy and the Crew have been reported to have had at least one profitable season -- the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap and marketing umbrella, Soccer United Marketing, have given M.L.S. financial security.
 For Hunt, there is no comparison to be made with the North American Soccer League, which lasted from 1967 to 1984 and was driven out of existence by overexpansion and overspending. Hunt owned the N.A.S.L.'s Dallas Tornados.
 The question for M.L.S. is not if it will survive, but if it will grow into a product that is largely accepted by the mainstream sports fan.
 ''We have the same kind of difficulty that hockey's got,'' Doug Logan, the former M.L.S. commissioner, said in a recent telephone interview. ''We've got a rabid core fan base, but to reach a larger universe of the viewing public is a difficult thing, and it's going to take a long time for it to happen.''
 For now, Garber said, he is not concerned with turning football, baseball or basketball fans into soccer fans. His first priority, he said, was to turn fans of soccer in the United States into M.L.S. fans.
 M.L.S. has focused on young people over the past 10 years, Garber said, hoping that as they get older, the fan base will grow.
 The league is also focusing on the growing ethnic population in the United States, he added.
 Before the start of this season, the league signed a 10-year, $150 million sponsorship deal with Adidas, which is more than twice as much as it received from nine corporate sponsors in its inaugural season.
 Ganis said he has heard the argument that soccer's big day is coming all too often.
 ''There is a fundamental disconnect between the participation in the game as children and interest to watch and attend games on the professional level in the United Sates,'' he said. ''It's one of the strangest things that people in sports have found.''
 Soccer participation among high schoolers has been growing since 1985, according to studies released by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.
 Still, M.L.S. receives little national attention compared to other major professional sports in the United States. It does not have the best time slot on television.
 Yet Garber, backed by a group of investors, has been patient. While M.L.S. compares itself to other sports leagues, Garber said, those involved with the league ''also remind ourselves that we're 10 years through our first generation,'' he said. ''We're only halfway through our first turn of a father and son having that shared experience of going to a Galaxy game or going to a MetroStars game.''

HEADLINE: Health Care: A Right or a Privilege?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Pride, Prejudice, Insurance'' (column, Nov. 7):
Paul Krugman underlines the economic arguments for change in our health care system. An employer-based health insurance system is no longer economically sound: we now have runaway costs with increasing numbers of uninsured among the employed. 
 Incremental change has provided short-term solutions, prolonging an inefficient system with business uncertainties each year.
 Business leaders must lead the fight for change to a universal system, which the entire society will support. By removing this increasing burden from labor negotiations, our employers and our society will benefit. 
 Appeals to moral concerns like the inequities and injustice in our present system have fallen on deaf ears. Change will occur only when it makes economic sense from a conservative and liberal perspective.

HEADLINE: Arts Center At Ground Zero May Feel Pinch

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
With construction estimates rising for the World Trade Center memorial, several directors of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation expressed concern yesterday that the performing arts center at the site might get squeezed by a tightening budget.
 Contributing to the uncertainty at yesterday's board meeting was the lack of a definitive overall estimate and of a dollars-and-cents breakdown for the memorial, the memorial museum, the cultural building and the performing arts center.
If construction economies and new financing sources cannot be found, it is conceivable that the memorial and the performing arts center would compete for what money is available. And that could pit those who advocate the memorial above all else -- some of whom are skeptical about the performing arts at ground zero -- against those who envision cultural institutions overlooking the memorial's plaza, pools and voids. 
 ''To build all of those things, we have $800 million,'' said John C. Whitehead, the chairman of both the development corporation and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. 
 He added, ''We are looking for additional sources of funds to build the project if the costs are going to be higher than that.''
 His words left little doubt that the budget would be increasing. ''The costs of construction have risen very substantially, particularly in the last 12 months,'' he said. ''The cost of steel is way up. The cost of lumber is way up. The cost of cement is way, way up.''
 ''Without changing the beauty of the memorial or the quality of the memorial in any way, we are trying to find ways to reduce the costs,'' Mr. Whitehead said.
 The foundation hopes to raise $500 million privately and has pledges of more than $102 million. The corporation has committed $300 million of federal money, with $50 million earmarked for the performing arts center.
 At the meeting, Stanley S. Shuman, a corporation director and a managing director of Allen and Company, an investment banking concern, said: ''The budgeted numbers that we have do exceed $800 million. The fund-raising will have to probably exceed the $500 million from all sources, including the foundation. We all understand and agree wholeheartedly that the memorial is our first priority, but we also have to stress that the performing arts center is a high priority and is central in our commitment to the site master plan.''
 Carl Weisbrod, a corporation director and the president of Trinity Real Estate, said it would be hard to implement the overall plan ''if we have the budget for the memorial as a constantly moving target.''
 ''It's important to establish a budget as soon as we can,'' he said.
 Stefan Pryor, the corporation president, sought to assure the board that budgeting efforts would prove successful. He said, ''There is a concerted effort at present among all the parties -- inclusive of the state and the city and all of the rebuilding partners -- to ensure that we fulfill the plans that we've set out together: memorial and cultural.''
 Culture dominated the agenda yesterday.
 The directors approved up to $10 million for the Drawing Center, a SoHo museum that is looking for a new home downtown, having lost its place in the cultural building at ground zero. ''We feel a responsibility to them,'' Mr. Whitehead said.
 He also offered details of how the cultural building might be reshaped, following the departure of the Drawing Center and International Freedom Center. Its bulk could be shifted to the south so that it would no longer have to span the underground mezzanine of the permanent PATH terminal, he said, thereby reducing costs.
 Mr. Pryor announced a search for a project director for the performing arts center, which is to be designed by Frank Gehry as the new home of the Joyce Theater Foundation and the Signature Theater Company.
 And the corporation said it would make $35 million in grants available to existing and new cultural institutions downtown, with applications due on Dec. 22. An advisory committee is to evaluate applicants and recommend recipients.
 Its members are Eddy Bayardelle, director of global philanthropy at Merrill Lynch & Company; Anita F. Contini, senior vice president and director of corporate and public affairs at CIT Group; Tom Finkelpearl, executive director of the Queens Museum of Art; Kate D. Levin, commissioner of the city Department of Cultural Affairs; and Richard J. Schwartz, chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts.
 The corporation plans to post application forms and information on its Web site, renewnyc.com, on Monday.
 Tom Healy, the president of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, who recently criticized a five-month delay in the grants, said yesterday that the corporation had assembled ''stellar'' advisers ''who know downtown arts organizations well, and who I know will bring independence, intelligence and rigor to their evaluations of proposals.''
 ''This is very good news from L.M.D.C. today,'' Mr. Healy said. ''It's the vote of confidence in the arts that we needed.''

HEADLINE: Science Chief Says Schools In New York Are Failing

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The official in charge of science education in New York City gave her own program a failing grade of 55 at a City Council committee hearing yesterday and said the state of science education in the city was ''horrendous.'' 
 But she added that steps were being taken to turn things around.
Council members argued that in the city's push to improve teaching and test scores in literacy and math, science had become a second-tier subject that was poorly taught.
 Julia Rankin, the Department of Education official in charge of science programs, largely agreed.
 Dr. Rankin, who has led the science programs for a year, testified that the subject had not been a priority in the schools for many years, but added that recent efforts had been made to change ''the whole thinking and philosophy around science.''
 ''We have much work ahead of us, but I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish in the past year,'' Dr. Rankin said, citing the building of science labs, more professional development for teachers, and progress toward a more comprehensive curriculum.
 Dr. Rankin said she would give the science education program a grade of 55 after she was asked by a city council member, Robert Jackson of Manhattan, to rate performance on a 100-point scale.
 Council members said that the school system suffered from a lack of qualified science teachers, laboratory space and classroom time to spend on science, and that the results were lackluster test scores in the low grades and high failure rates for high school students on the science Regents exams. 
 In addition, they said, the science curriculum is uneven and the department has very little knowledge of what actually happens in individual schools regarding science, a claim that education officials at the hearing did not dispute. 
 ''Science education is the foundation of our global economy, yet it has been treated with second-class status for decades,'' said Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the Council's Education Committee.
 ''Our programs are failing the kids,'' she added. ''And I don't see the level of concern I think we should have, given the numbers.''
 Dr. Rankin told Ms. Moskowitz that the department had asked elementary school teachers to spend 150 minutes a week on science instruction, but she said she did not know how many schools did so.
 Another department official, Elizabeth Arons, the chief executive of the human resources division, said the department could not say how many science teachers had master's degrees in subjects related to science.
 Both officials said the schools would benefit from new data that the Department of Education collected about science education -- information they have just begun to analyze.
 Ms. Moskowitz often bristled at the answers given by the education officials, particularly since she had asked some of the same questions at a similar hearing on science education last year. The officials lacked the same data then. 
 ''You have to know what you're starting with,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''Four years into this administration and we don't know.'' 
 Dr. Rankin replied: ''We need data, we don't doubt that at all. These are issues we're looking into right now.''

HEADLINE: City's 311 Help Line Plans to Add Data on Social Services 

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The city's 311 government help line will be expanded in a year through a partnership with United Way of New York City to give out information on social services provided by thousands of nonprofit agencies, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.
 The expansion of 311, a two-and-one-half-year-old telephone service that provides information on a huge compendium of government programs and regulations, will draw from United Way's list of 2,500 agencies, guiding callers to programs in health care, housing, job training and other services, officials said. 
''When an individual or a family is in crisis, they should be able to make one call, and that call should lead them to the service that they need whether it comes from a city agency or nonprofit organization,'' said Verna Eggleston, commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, who joined the mayor at a news conference.
 Mr. Bloomberg announced the expansion of 311 two days after winning re-election to a second term. He said that he expected to make few changes among his commissioners and top advisers., adding that the second-term Bloomberg administration ''will look very much like the current administration.''
 He also said that the hotel bombings in Jordan on Wednesday had led to a ''ramping up'' of police security at New York City hotels by uniformed and undercover officers but added that the city had no evidence of any terrorist threat to any hotel.
 Mr. Bloomberg made the popularity of the 311 system, which the city claims has fielded 26 million calls since its inception in March 2003, a recurrent theme of his re-election campaign, and promised before the election to expand it.
 United Way, through its affiliates across the nation, has established many social service referral systems similar to the one planned for New York by using a 211 telephone exchange. Mr. Bloomberg announced plans for the city's program at an office complex on Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan, where 311 operators field calls from rows of desks and computer screens, and where the mayor was joined by Lawrence Mandell, the president of United Way of New York City.
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city would spend $10 million to expand the 311 system to handle the increased demands of people calling for social services, a process that would take 12 months. Once the system is operating, the city will pay United Way $12 million a year in subsidies, he said.
 Mr. Mandell said United Way planned to hire about 100 people to help callers. People calling 311 will first speak to the city's operators, he said, but they will be transferred to those employed by United Way if their requests are best suited to one or more social service groups.
 Although the city has long maintained contracts with, and helped finance, many of the same nonprofit agencies that are included in United Way's network of providers, 311 operators are not equipped to make direct referrals to the social service groups, officials said yesterday. 
 Mr. Mandell said yesterday that one hurdle to expanding the system was that people fielding questions about social services must have different qualifications than those now fielding 311 calls, so they can sort through an array of agencies and programs and match people to the right providers on the basis of a telephone conversation.
 The officials said the advisers hired by United Way would, in many cases, be equipped to provide people with an unexpected range of services.
 In one example, they said poor people calling for help getting food stamps or finding soup kitchens might also be guided to housing assistance, job counseling and information on the earned-income tax credit.

HEADLINE: A Gap Worth Exploiting In Bond Yields

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
MUNICIPAL bonds are an investment hiding in plain sight. They form a huge market but, compared with other assets, get scant mention in the media and in brokerage firm research.
 But a lack of attention does not mean a lack of interest. At the moment, munis -- bonds that are issued by state and local government agencies and pay income exempt from federal and, sometimes, state tax -- yield far more than Treasury bonds after taking account of the tax breaks.
For taxpayers in the 33 percent bracket, the effective yield on 10-year munis is more than 6 percent, David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, pointed out. That is far superior to the 4.56 percent yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, whose credit quality is only marginally higher. 
 Wall Street is not inclined to dispense free lunches, so why the wide discrepancy? The best explanation is an ennui gap. Mr. Wyss noted that muni tax advantages accrue to individual American investors, not to the foreigners who are large owners of Treasury issues or to traders whose holdings amount to inventory in a business.
 That leaves salt-of-the-earth small investors as munis' only big constituency, and they have more tax-favored savings choices available than ever: 401(k) plans, I.R.A.'s, S.E.P.'s. The top tax rate on dividends has been cut to 15 percent, too.
 Mr. Wyss noted that tax breaks come and go and that investors may be worried that munis will lose their status if Congress overhauls the tax code. But if a change in the code occurs -- and it is an enormous ''if'' -- its provisions, which may not even affect municipal bonds, are unlikely to take effect for several years. Meanwhile, investors can earn an effective return that is far higher than that offered by any other equally safe investment-- if they invest in the right place.
 ''The main thing you need to consider is what state you live in,'' Mr. Wyss advised investors shopping for munis. Interest payments are exempt from state tax only for residents of the state in which a bond is issued, so ''if you live in New York, you don't want to buy a New Jersey bond,'' he said.
 You may not want to buy a single bond at all. A fund may be better. As with other assets, the diversification of a muni fund provides liquidity -- it is easier to sell shares in a fund at a fair price than an individual bond -- and maximum safety. Many management companies have single-state portfolios that allow investors to benefit from the double-barreled tax break, too.
 The yield premium over Treasuries makes this an especially good time to consider muni funds, in the opinion of Scott Berry, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar.
 ''If you look at municipal bond funds, they make a better case for themselves than taxable bond funds,'' he said. ''When you look at tax-equivalent yields, you're getting a much better deal.''
 THE uniform credit quality of general-obligation munis -- those backed by state treasuries, not revenues from specific projects like toll roads -- makes cost a pivotal factor when choosing a fund, Mr. Berry advised.
 ''Returns in muni bond land are typically tightly bunched,'' he said. ''If you've got an expense advantage, it can be a huge hurdle for competitors to overcome.''
 One firm renowned for the low costs of its equity funds is a top name in municipal bond funds, too. ''Vanguard funds are tough to ignore,'' he said. ''Their costs are so low, they're tough to beat.''
 It is hard for a muni fund to beat the market, but they try in one of two ways -- by changing their cash position to bet on interest rates or by choosing issues that are slightly riskier and offer slightly higher yields. Mr. Berry favors managers that use the latter method.
 ''At the top of our list would be Fidelity,'' he said. ''Franklin is another that doesn't mess around with interest rate bets. We're big fans of the Franklin muni group.''
 Among the managers he prefers that take the first approach is Salomon Smith Barney, which he called ''one of the few that we would recommend that take interest rate bets.'' Vanguard does, too, but its managers are content to ''make slight adjustments.''
 Mr. Wyss anticipates an adjustment in the gap between muni and Treasury yields. ''I expect yields to come back together as people get confident that tax laws are not about to change,'' he said. ''I'm surprised at how long this aberration has continued. It almost makes me think I should go out and buy more.''

HEADLINE: Admission Test's Scoring Quirk Throws Balance Into Question

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
For weeks, Joshua N. Feinman had graded practice tests to help his daughter prepare for New York City's specialized high school exam. Then one day, he took a hard look at the scoring chart from her private test-prep class and was stunned by how the verbal and math scores added up. 
 ''I took a look and said, 'Wow, this thing is really nonlinear,' '' said Mr. Feinman, the chief economist of Deutsche Asset Management. '' 'Wow, it's much better to score high in one and low in the other than to score good in both.' ''
Mr. Feinman had stumbled on a little-known facet of the test: because of the complex way it is graded, a student scoring extremely high on one part of the exam has a sharp advantage over a student with high but more balanced scores in each subject. 
 For Mr. Feinman's daughter, Amanda, and more than 26,000 other eighth graders who will get their results in February, the implications loom large. Last year, for instance, a student with a 99 percentile score in math and 49 percentile in verbal would have been admitted to Stuyvesant High School -- the most coveted specialized school -- but a student with a 97 in math and 92 in verbal would not.
 As a result, test-prep tutors who understand how the test is scored advise their students to spend as much time as possible not where they are weakest, but on their stronger subject. Students are allotted two and a half hours for the exam and can divide the time as they wish. 
 City education officials and the company that has prepared the test since 1983, American Guidance Service, said that they were aware of the potential outcomes and that scoring for the exam had to be designed this way to identify the best test takers. They also said their hands were tied by state law, which they said required that admission to the specialized schools be based on a single combined score in math and verbal. 
 Officials also said that the test, which had not changed in at least 30 years, had served its purpose well, even as the number of children taking the test has soared. About 4,200 students were admitted to specialized testing high schools for ninth grade in September 2005.
 ''Parents should be really confident, and I am confident, that this is a scientifically valid and reliable test,'' said Lori Mei, the director of testing for the city schools.
 But in an age of $325-an-hour test-prep tutors, and cutthroat competition for the best schools, some parents and testing experts said that even the slightest quirks in scoring should be publicized to ensure fairness. 
 ''As taxpayers and parents, we should know how the test is graded -- not necessarily with an eye to changing it -- but certainly as a matter of public knowledge,'' said Mr. Feinman, who lives on the Upper East Side. ''It shouldn't be hidden or disclosed only to the select few who have the advantage of test prep.'' 
 Even some veteran test-prep tutors were surprised.
 Barry Feldman, an owner of GRF Test Preparation, which tutored Mr. Feinman's daughter, said that in 24 years in the business, he has never focused on the scoring method. 
 ''I just really never thought about it before,'' said Mr. Feldman, a retired junior high school math teacher and a 1964 graduate of Stuyvesant. ''What are the reasons? Why do they do it how they do it? I don't know. I really don't know, and I never really thought about questioning it.''
 Officials of American Guidance Service, a private company in Minnesota, said the test had been designed to the city's specifications. Principals of the six specialized schools are not involved in developing or grading the test, much as colleges are not involved in administering the SAT. 
 In essence, the scoring system rewards students with more points per question as they get closer to a perfect score on either math or verbal. 
 The impact of the scoring is potentially so great that a student with a perfect score in math last year could have answered fewer than half of the verbal questions correctly and still been admitted to Stuyvesant. But students who got 41 of 50 points on one part and 42 of 50 on the other would have fallen short of Stuyvesant's cutoff. 
 ''Stuyvesant loves lopsided geniuses,'' said Naomi Bushman, a mathematics education consultant who runs a test-prep course for the exam.
 The reverse was similarly true. A student with a perfect verbal score needed only 18 of 50 math questions for admission to Stuyvesant. The same student needed only 11 of 50 math questions correct for admission to the Bronx High School of Science and 9 correct to get into Brooklyn Technical High School.
 Principals said they were aware that a super-high score on one part could substantially lift an applicant's chances, because many recent immigrants with extremely limited English skills had earned admission by posting exceptional math scores. But even principals said they were surprised to learn just how low a student could score on one part and still be admitted. The principals said they were typically not shown copies of the test or the score charts and were not asked their opinion of the results. 
 City officials acknowledged that they had not discussed the test with principals in recent years and that they had never conducted studies to gauge the validity of the test. But they insisted it was valid, as evidenced by the high graduation rates of the specialized schools. 
 But Regan Kenyon, the president of the Secondary School Admission Test Board, which publishes the admissions exam for 700 private schools and boarding schools, said validity studies, comparing students' test scores to their freshman year grades, were needed regularly. 
 ''We don't know if the way they are selecting kids is the right way or not,'' he said of New York City. ''If you haven't done the study, then you don't have a transparent admission process.'' 
 Stanley Teitel, the principal of Stuyvesant, said that educators there had long wondered about establishing minimum cutoff scores, so no student could be admitted without scoring well on both verbal and math. But he said there should also be a place at Stuyvesant for students who are exceptional in one area.
 Mr. Teitel said the school and its alumni would strongly resist using any criteria but the test for admissions. ''One of the things they love about the school is that it remains a true meritocracy,'' he said. ''You only get into Stuyvesant because you proved it on an exam.''
 But virtually all testing experts warned against using an exam as the sole basis for admissions decisions. The Boston Latin School judges applicants on test scores and grades. The Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a specialized school in Fairfax, Va., uses test scores, grades, essays and teacher recommendations. 
 According to American Guidance Service, 52 students -- or one-fifth of 1 percent of the more than 25,000 eighth graders who took the test last year -- scored perfectly on one part. Of these students, one scored in the 50 percentile on the other part of the test; some scored in the 60's, 70's or 80's, but most were in the 90's.
 The test, known by its acronym SHSAT (pronounced Sh-ZAT), consists of 45 verbal questions and 50 math questions, with each part worth 50 points (five verbal reasoning questions are worth 2 points each). 
 The total for each part is scaled and curved, based on the difficulty level of individual questions and the relative performance of all test-takers, to a score from 20 to 400. Then, these two numbers are added to get a final score. 
 To differentiate among high achievers, there are wider gaps between scores at the top of the curve. On one form of last year's test, a verbalscore of 49 converted to a 345, while a perfect math score of 50 converted to a 365, a 20-point gap. But from 39 to 40 correct, the gap was only 5 points. 
 The city's official guide to the test describes the scaling of scores. But the guide never specifically explains that a high score in one subject can lift a low score in the other, or that students might benefit from focusing on their stronger subject. 
 Several test-prep instructors said they learned how the test is scaled by accompanying students to review their results. Any parent can request to see his or her child's test paper and results, but not the scoring chart. 
 Ms. Bushman, the math education consultant, said that she explained the scoring to her students but that the concept was hard to grasp. 
 ''My advice to a student is that catching an error on his stronger side is worth more to his total score than catching an error on his weaker side,'' she said.
 The lower a school's cutoff score, the bigger the problem, said Mr. Feinman, the economist. For example, a student in the 95 percentile in math and the 79 percentile in verbal could have made Bronx Science last year, beating out a student in the 94 percentile in math and the 81 percentile in verbal. 
 Mr. Feinman said these results seemed arbitrary.
 ''There is a notion that the kids who didn't get in are clearly inferior to those who did,'' he said. ''But I think what the grading suggests is there may be a significant number of cases where that is really, really hard to say.''
 Mr. Feinman added, ''If you don't have to spend your time equally you should spend it more on the area in which you are stronger, which would be counterintuitive, I think, to most people.''

HEADLINE: Jury Finds That Former Analyst Misled Investors

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A federal jury found yesterday that a former analyst at Robertson Stephens, Paul Johnson, violated federal securities laws by omitting from his research reports important facts about his holdings. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. Johnson of deceiving investors by failing to disclose his financial stake in companies he was recommending. After a two-week trial, a jury in Manhattan agreed that Mr. Johnson had violated securities laws.
 ''We are very surprised and disheartened by the verdict,'' a lawyer for Mr. Johnson, Mark Pomerantz, told the judge after the verdict, according to a transcript. Mr. Pomerantz said he would ask the judge for a new trial.
 The case stems from the collapse of the Internet stock bubble, which led to the S.E.C.'s lawsuit in 2003. Of the S.E.C. cases accusing analysts of misleading investors with biased research, this is the only that has gone to trial. Eleven securities firms, including Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Company, paid $1.4 billion to settle regulators' fraud claims. 
 The S.E.C. will seek civil penalties against Mr. Johnson, 44, including forfeiture of his trading profits.
 His former employer, FleetBoston Financial, then the parent of Robertson Stephens, paid $5 million in 2003 to settle regulators' claims. 
 FleetBoston shut Robertson Stephens in 2002 and was later acquired by the Bank of America Corporation.

HEADLINE: Hofstra Panels on Clinton Attempt to Outguess History

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Hundreds of political scientists and former members of the Clinton administration met at Hofstra University yesterday to debate the legacy of President Bill Clinton, part of a three-day gathering that was part college reunion, part policy powwow and part dogfight.
 They parried and thrust on panels that considered everything from the Middle East peace process to the White House office of correspondence, trade agreements to global warming, old Democrats and new, offering a rough draft of how history books and political science journals might someday treat Mr. Clinton's two terms. 
The sessions also provided a chance for old government hands -- including the former president himself, who appeared on Thursday --to relive the glory days. They gathered in the hallways of Hofstra's student center, pulled each other aside in between panels and sneaked off for quiet lunches wherever they could. 
 ''It's good to see some old faces,'' said John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's last chief of staff, who spoke on a panel about administration staffing. 
 But the conference, which began on Thursday, also showed that the years that have passed since Mr. Clinton left office have done little to settle the debates -- about both the president and his policies -- that animated his admirers and his detractors through the 1990's.
 At a panel titled ''Redefining Liberalism,'' two men who were among Mr. Clinton's close advisers, David Gergen and Al From, the chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council, did their best yesterday to add definition to Mr. Clinton's brand of politics. Mr. From emphasized the president's use of market solutions to advance liberal ends, while Mr. Gergen said that Mr. Clinton's strength was ''not as an innovator'' but as ''a synthesizer.''
 ''Clinton was trying to challenge the regnant orthodoxy of his day, which was conservativism,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''He made a valiant effort to redefine the Democratic Party, which did not last.''
 But David Green, a Hofstra political science professor and the lone Clinton critic on the panel, , took a much dimmer view of Mr. Clinton's legacy. Mr. Green, who described himself as more liberal than Mr. Clinton, said, ''The ideology of Bill Clinton was Bill Clinton,'' and added that Mr. Clinton's presidency was ''a fifth-column move to undermine the ideas that I hold dear.''
 Most of the sessions were arranged as a sort of high-minded show and tell, with professors presenting papers at some 50 different panels before former administration officials, journalists and audience members.
 A parade of former high-level Clintonites made its way through the conference during the first two days, from cabinet secretaries (Madeleine Albright, Richard W. Riley and Robert E. Rubin) to chiefs of staff (Thomas F. McLarty and Mr. Podesta) to speechwriters (Michael Waldman and Terry Edmonds, among others).
 ''When you've been through that together, you have a tie,'' said Mr. Rubin, who served in Mr. Clinton's administration for six years.
 Mr. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary, spoke at a lunch on Thursday attended by Mr. Clinton, who looked on approvingly from the dais as Mr. Rubin praised the Clinton stewardship of fiscal policy. 
 Mr. Clinton himself spoke later that day, delivering a speech at Hofstra's athletic arena before several thousand students, faculty members and conferees.
 But many of those attending the conference seemed chiefly concerned with the future, pressing panelists for Clinton-era lessons for the Democratic Party as it struggles to regain power in Washington.
 Stanley Greenberg, a former pollster for Mr. Clinton and an architect of his 1992 campaign message, said that the circumstances that fostered the president's mix of economic populism and appeals to middle-class values had shifted.
 ''It was much more possible to merge the material and the spiritual'' during the 1990's, Mr. Greenberg said, when the culture wars seemed to have dissipated and the Sept. 11 attacks had yet to divide the country on issues of national security.
 During another panel, an audience member asked what Mr. Clinton would do if he were again running for president. 
 ''If he were running again today, he would do exactly what Mrs. Clinton is doing, and run to the center,'' said Shirley Anne Warshaw, a professor of political science at Gettysburg College. Paul Begala, a former political adviser to Mr. Clinton, said at Thursday's session that he thought Americans would re-elect the former president ''in a heartbeat if it wasn't for that pesky 22nd Amendment; he's looking better and better every day.''
 The Clinton conference is the 11th presidential conference that Hofstra has sponsored since 1982, covering every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt forward.

HEADLINE: The Troll On The Tracks

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Amtrak's president was fired this week, which was good news for those of us who love trains and want a reformer in charge of the railroad. Yet members of Congress along the Northeast Corridor immediately denounced the firing.
 One obvious reason is that these politicians are indebted to Amtrak's unions, which want no part of reform. But there also seems to be a more baffling reason. Northeastern politicians actually like the railroad the way it is. After being held captive for decades by Amtrak, they're suffering from the Stockholm syndrome. 
Before he was fired, David Gunn ran Amtrak according to the same principles of his predecessors. Amtrak was created to be a for-profit private corporation, but it instead went into the red by running unprofitable long-distance trains while stinting on service and maintenance for the Northeast Corridor, the route that makes the most economic sense.
 When the White House or Congress balked at covering the annual losses, Gunn and his predecessors resorted to extortion. They ritually set a date and threatened to shut down Amtrak at midnight if the ransom wasn't paid.
 It has always been a powerful threat, but not because the nation depends on Amtrak's trains. They're about as vital to America's transportation system as horse-drawn carriages are to New York's. Amtrak's share of the intercity travel market has been falling for half a century and is now less than half of 1 percent. 
 No, what makes the threat powerful is the chokehold that Amtrak has on other railroads. Commuter trains, which carry nearly 20 times as many passengers as Amtrak does, would be crippled by an Amtrak shutdown in the many cities where they use tracks and stations owned by Amtrak, including New York and much of the Northeast, as well as Chicago and San Francisco. Thanks to its power to strand hundreds of thousands of commuters, Amtrak is the troll on the tracks. 
 Los Angeles and Boston used to be hostage to Amtrak's annual threats because it operated their commuter trains, but they had the sense to free themselves by switching to other operators. You'd think Northeastern politicians would yearn for similar relief, but they've rebuffed the White House's offers.
 The Bush administration proposed disarming Amtrak by giving away its tracks and stations in the Northeast Corridor to a new public agency, run by the states. While Amtrak stuck to running trains, this new agency would get money from Washington to rehabilitate the tracks neglected by Amtrak, and then the tracks would eventually be open to other railroads, too.
 This is hardly a radical idea for transportation. The Northeast Corridor tracks, instead of being an Amtrak fief, could be like a highway or an airport: a regional public facility used by a variety of public and private carriers. Amtrak and other railroads would compete to run passenger trains, maybe with the help of further subsidies from taxpayers, although an efficient railroad might well be able to operate profitably. 
 It's difficult, of course, to imagine Amtrak ever turning a profit at anything. Even though it has a captive audience of customers for meals and drinks aboard the trains, it collects only $1 in revenue for every $2 that it spends on its food service, according to a new report by the Government Accountability Office. The report forecast that the railroad's operating losses would increase by 40 percent in the next four years.
 Gunn, brought in as a turnaround expert, was fired by Bush appointees on the Amtrak board. They criticized him for inept management and reluctance to pursue their plan to make the Northeast Corridor an independent entity. The firing was immediately questioned by senators like Tom Carper of Delaware and Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer of New York.
 Carper called the firing ''further proof that the Bush administration doesn't want Amtrak to succeed.'' Schumer made the same point: ''The policy difference is that the board wants to kill Amtrak, and Gunn wants it to prosper. It's that simple.''
 Well, he's right about it being a simple policy difference. The Bush administration, in an unexpected bit of benevolence toward voters in blue states, is trying to rebuild the Northeast Corridor, improve service and remove Amtrak's power to shut down the system. The senators along the corridor are focused strictly on protecting Amtrak. They've been held hostage so long they can't imagine life without their captor.

HEADLINE: Supersize Comeback for Fast Food 

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL. 
E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com.; Complete links are at nytimes.com/business.

 BODY:
TWO years ago, KFC was trying to market its fried chicken parts as a healthy alternative to pizza and burgers. Bob Garfield, writing in Advertising Age, ranted that the company had been misleading in its effort to sell America on the health benefits of its ''chicken-flavored doughnuts.'' 
 It would be better for KFC, Mr. Garfield wrote then, to market to people who didn't care about the health risks -- including those who proudly spurned them. ''In fact, it could be the mirror image of the competition's strategy.'' 
As described this week by Business Week Online, both KFC and the competition seem to have taken Mr. Garfield's advice -- and there seem to be more health-unconscious consumers than anyone could have guessed. ''Americans are eating hamburgers, doughnuts, French fries and fried chicken like never before,'' writes Pallavi Gogoi. In fact, she adds, KFC is thinking of going back to its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
 Given how intensely the food industry was scrambling just months ago to pander to low-carbers and South Beachers, it's startling to witness the sudden collective decision to pander instead to supersizers. While sales in all fast-food categories are rising, KFC's in particular are flying high. Last month, Ms. Gogoi reports, ''sales at stores open for a year or more soared 6 percent versus a 3 percent drop in the year-ago period.'' 
 Other chains are increasing their offerings of artery-choking fare, with great success. 
 What's going on here?
 ''Fat is mainstream, which is why everyone has become complacent,'' Marion Nestle, the author, nutrition professor and food-industry critic, told Ms. Gogoi. ''What used to be considered pudgy before isn't even worthy of a comment today.'' 
 GO WEST? -- By just about every measure, New West, the online magazine, is a success: It features great writing and reporting, presented via a smart blend of magazine and bloglike articles covering the Rocky Mountain states. Traffic is growing. Critics are raving. It recently won two Online Journalism Awards. 
 But as pointed out this week by Mark Glaser in the Online Journalism Review, the nine-month-old site, owned and edited by the experienced journalist Jonathan Weber (who was at the helm of the late, lamented Industry Standard magazine) will have a tough time making a go of it. 
 John Temple, editor and publisher of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, told Mr. Glaser, ''New West will have a huge challenge breaking into the market because it has no name ID and no ability to market itself except on the Web.''
 The real challenge is to find enough people interested in a concept as amorphous as ''the West'' to become regular readers.
 GHOST SITE -- Speaking of The Industry Standard: The magazine may be dead, but thestandard.com, its Web site, lives on. It now has news flashes about eBay's acquisition of Shopping.com and about the .xxx top-level Internet domain. 
 Eh? What's that? Those things happened more than seven months ago? Ah, right. It seems that after a period of trying to resurrect the site with guest bloggers and shovelware from its trade magazines, its owner, the International Data Group, pulled the plug -- not on the site, but on its content. When it restartedthestandard.com in 2003, the company promised to replace the archive, which would serve as an encyclopedic history of the rise and fall of the ''Internet economy.'' Alas, that may never happen. But could they at least pull the site down, or cover it with a blanket?
 TRADING UP -- Kyle MacDonald, a blogger in Montreal, started with a red paper clip and a dream. Could he trade the paper clip for something better, and trade that for something better still, eventually trading his way into a new house? We don't know yet; he's made four trades and now owns a gas-powered generator. A red one. Track his progress on oneredpaperclip.com. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Many in Jordan See Old Enemy In Attack: Israel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el Naggar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ZARQA, Jordan, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The Maktoum Mosque was crowded with worshipers for Friday Prayer as the imam sharply criticized the suicide attacks on three hotels in Amman, saying those who committed the crimes were not Muslims, no matter what they called themselves.
 Afterward, on the street, people agreed that whoever committed such an act could not be a Muslim. But many meant this literally, that the attack must have been carried out by outsiders, namely Israeli agents.
''Who said it is them?'' asked Ahmed al-Zawahrah, referring to claims that members of a radical Islamic group were behind the blasts. ''It could be Israel.'' 
 Zarqa is the birthplace of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. His relatives and neighbors prayed in the mosque, so one could imagine that it might be especially hard for them to accept that Mr. Zarqawi had taken responsibility for killing so many civilians. But the sentiment heard here is echoed across this country and region. 
 While most Arabs have long viewed Israel as their enemy, the extent to which Israel weighs on the regional psyche and diverts attention away from social, political, religious and economic issues that cannot be ignored, many social and political analysts say. Blaming Israel is not just a knee jerk, they say; for many Arabs, it is their reality.
 ''People don't blame Israel out of a vacuum,'' said Rami Khoury, a Jordanian political commentator and writer based in Lebanon. ''There is a very strong historical reason, because Israel has caused a lot of grief for Arab people one way or another.'' 
 But he added, ''The consequence is that this became an easy way not to deal with our problems that are based in our own society.''
 The suspicion of some here over the hotel killings mirrors the unfounded rumor that thousands of Jews did not show up for work at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, because Israel was behind those attacks.
 In Egypt, Israel was also widely blamed for the bombing attacks in Taba and Sharm el Sheik over the last year, and for the recent sectarian violence between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Alexandria. In Syria, officials at the highest levels of the government have blamed Israel for killing Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister. 
 While it appears that most Jordanians have accepted that Mr. Zarqawi was involved -- with many saying they are sickened by his actions -- there is little criticism for those who scapegoat Israel. A former prime minister, Tahir Masri, who said it was clear that Israel was not involved in this attack, said he understood why so many people blame Israel.
 ''You have to understand, Baghdad was the capital for Arabs and Muslims for 1,000 years,'' Mr. Masri said. ''It is occupied by Americans now. Jerusalem and Baghdad are both occupied. It is too much for ordinary people to bear. If you add to it the misery that people are facing because of the lack of democracy and humiliation by their rulers, that kind of scapegoat we have to have.''
 Whether it is the Sharm el Sheik bombings or the assassination of Mr. Hariri, the theory is almost always premised on two ideas. The first is a logic that says those who benefit must be behind the deed. 
 When Muslim residents of Alexandria in Egypt tried to attack a Coptic church last month after word spread that a play held in the church two years earlier denigrated Islam -- and that the play was being distributed on videodisc -- one local member of Parliament charged publicly that Israel was behind the strife.
 ''Israel is the only country in the region that does not want Egypt to be stable,'' said Muhammad al-Badrasheni, the member of Parliament. ''It wants to cause sectarian strife that would result in international intervention like what is happening in Iraq now.''
 The second factor routinely pointed to as proof of Israel's involvement is the idea that Egyptians, Syrians or other Arabs are not clever enough to have carried out such an effective attack.
 Gen. Fouad Allam, former director of state security in Egypt, said, for example, that the attack on a Hilton Hotel in Taba last year -- in which mostly Israelis were killed -- had to be the work of the Israeli secret service, the Mossad. ''It was very well planned, studied, professional, and with a very high capacity,'' he said. ''We never had this kind of capacity over the past 50 years.'' 
 One government official in Egypt, citing multiple military defeats, spoke of a deep-seated feeling of inferiority, even a kind of mental illness. The official also blamed Arab leaders who have deflected criticism of domestic issues by focusing public anger on Israel.
 Whatever the cause, the result is the same: ''In the first place, people don't even recognize the reality around them,'' said Muhammad el-Sayed Said, a political analyst at the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Egypt. ''Secondly, they continue to overlook and ignore the problem without supporting a consistent anti-terrorism campaign, which the government might be seeking.''
 Dawoud al-Shoryan, a prominent writer and journalist from Saudi Arabia, says he is not convinced that those who blame Israel really believe it. But, he added, many people are deeply angry at United States policy in the region, including its occupation of Iraq, and blaming Israel is a way of conferring some degree of legitimacy on a crime that would be considered unspeakable if committed by a Muslim.
 ''They try to hide the hideous face of terrorism by hanging it on the United States and Israel,'' he said. ''Shifting the accusation is nothing but a subconscious attempt to justify the act.''

HEADLINE: The History of Trade, Part 2

 BODY:
During the 1980's, the United States government, egged on by a Detroit auto industry terrified of Japan's low-cost, fuel-efficient cars, imposed quotas on imports of many Hondas and Toyotas. So Honda and Toyota -- and Mitsubishi and Mazda and Nissan -- started making luxury cars that could challenge Detroit in a far more profitable market. The results can be seen on the highways and byways of America: Acuras, Lexuses and boatloads of other high-end Japanese cars, which have steadily put the squeeze on a market niche previously dominated by the Americans and the Europeans. 
 Washington has apparently not heard that old chestnut about not learning from history and being doomed to repeat it. On Tuesday, the United States government, egged on by a textile and apparel industry terrified of imports of cheap Chinese T-shirts, bras and baby socks, announced that it had persuaded China to agree to export quotas for the next three years. Chinese officials say they will try to use the quotas to push their manufacturers toward producing more high-end garments. That will challenge American and European manufacturers in a far more profitable market, one in which American companies have staked their futures, and could hasten the demise of an already dying American textile and apparel industry.
But don't tell that to shortsighted American textile companies. They're too busy crowing and looking for other ways to limit Chinese imports. ''We know we have three years to come up with other strategies to deal with predatory imports,'' James Schollaert, a Washington representative of the Hosiery Association, told The Times this week. 
 What Mr. Schollaert and other American textile lobbyists should be looking for are other strategies to make the textile industry here more competitive in a globalized economy -- because China is not going to take three years to make up its mind. Indeed, all across the developing world, poor countries are increasingly starting to make a play for more high-end textile and apparel manufacturing. 
 Lafayette 148, a New York fashion house, sent a top knitwear expert to China two years ago to teach factory workers Italian knitting techniques. Celine, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is manufacturing $500 denim-and-leather handbags in China, according to The Wall Street Journal. It also reports that last year, Gucci began sewing some sneakers in Serbia, while Tod's, the fancy Italian shoemaker, is considering moving part of its Hogan sneaker line to China.
 It is extremely frustrating that political leaders refuse to recognize that all of the protections created in the last 40 years to shield American textile jobs from foreign competition have failed. Employment in textile mills has fallen to about 400,000, from approximately 1 million in 1974. It would be better to find ways to get those workers into growth areas rather than keeping them in dying ones.

HEADLINE: North Korea And U.S. Spar, Causing Talks to Stall

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea sparred over financial penalties and whether to negotiate a nuclear freeze or focus on full disarmament, as six-nation nuclear talks ended Friday on the same inconclusive and irresolute note they began with three days earlier.
 The meeting, the first since the parties reached a framework agreement in September on ending the North's atomic weapons efforts, failed to resolve even basic procedural issues, like setting up working groups to tackle technical problems pertaining to inspections and other matters. All sides agreed to resume discussion soon, but they did not set a date to do so, according to China, the host of the talks. 
North Korea accused the United States of ''spoiling the atmosphere'' of the negotiations because the Treasury Department imposed penalties on a bank in the Chinese territory of Macao on Sept. 15, a senior American official said. The bank, Banco Delta Asia, was accused of laundering money for North Korea. 
 The United States rejected a North Korean proposal simply to freeze production of nuclear fuel in return for aid. Washington insisted that the focus remain on complete disarmament rather than the interim steps that North Korea would have to take anyway if it intended to end its weapons program, the American official said.
 ''They are going to have to surrender the program anyway, so I'm not going to pay them for the same thing twice,'' said the official, who requested anonymity in exchange for speaking candidly about the talks. ''We would really like to avoid tit-for-tat negotiations that could take years.''
 The session gave an indication of the long and likely tortuous road to carrying out the broad and vaguely worded September agreement, in which the United States, North Korea, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia agreed to work toward North Korean nuclear disarmament in exchange for economic, diplomatic and security benefits for the Communist government.
 The parties all acknowledged that the latest talks had produced no results, but that they also had appeared to be mostly low-key and businesslike. Beijing emphasized the positive, calling the talks ''pragmatic and constructive'' and saying they would reconvene soon.
 ''The parties reaffirmed that they would fully implement the joint statement in line with the principle of 'commitment for commitment, action for action,' so as to realize the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula at an early date,'' the Chinese side said in a statement.
 Among issues that remain contentious are conflicting claims about the scope of North Korea's nuclear program. The United States says it has strong evidence that North Korea has pursued an underground effort to use enriched uranium for nuclear fuel in addition to its better known plutonium fuel program. The North denies having a uranium program.
 ''H.E.U. is going to be a major issue when we get to the declarative stage,'' said Chris Hill, the top American negotiator at the talks, using the abbreviation for highly enriched uranium.
 The latest round of talks was also sidetracked by North Korean complaints that the United States tried to poison the atmosphere of the talks when it imposed a ban on American financial institutions doing business with Banco Delta Asia in the former Portuguese colony of Macao, which is now Chinese controlled.
 The penalties, prompted by American allegations that the bank worked surreptitiously with North Korea for 20 years and helped it traffic in drugs, led to a run on the bank. That prompted the authorities in Macao to freeze the bank's assets.
 The United States agreed to send a team to explain the penalties to North Korea in the near future, Mr. Hill said. But he added that North Korea would continue to face such penalties unless it stopped trafficking in illicit arms and drugs.
 American officials said that they were determined to keep the talks moving, but that making progress depended mainly on the North Koreans' deciding that it was in their interest to end the nuclear standoff.
 ''I'm not going to be more concerned about getting an agreement than North Korea is,'' said the senior American official. ''They have to decide that it's in their interest as well.''

HEADLINE: With New Orleans's Future in Flux, Anxiety About a Life Without Roots

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
As a child, when Shantel Reddick dribbled her basketball up and down Delery Street in New Orleans, she drew comfort from the idea that the neighbors knew the very rhythm of her bounce. By college age, though, she longed to liberate herself from the vigilance of a community where everybody knew everybody else's business. She escaped to Atlanta on an athletic scholarship and started an independent life there.
 Last January, however, Ms. Reddick, 28, feeling adrift and unfulfilled in her job as a letter carrier in rural Georgia, moved back into her childhood home in the Lower Ninth Ward and joined the Orleans Parish sheriff's department. Her mission, as she saw it, was to take care of the grandmother who had raised her and the town that had shaped her. It was ''like the call of destiny,'' Ms. Reddick said, ''and I felt whole again.''
Then, in late August, destiny was foiled. Four days after Ms. Reddick graduated as the valedictorian of her class at the sheriff's academy, she fled Hurricane Katrina and entered that strange state of limbo in which many displaced residents of New Orleans now live. 
 The Reddicks made a family decision to rebuild their devastated home in the Lower Ninth Ward, but, more than two months after the storm, their ravaged neighborhood remained sealed by troops, its future, and theirs, uncertain.
 So on Friday, with considerable ambivalence, Ms. Reddick took the first step toward planting fledgling roots in Houston. She spent the day taking physical fitness, intelligence and psychometric tests at the Harris County sheriff's academy. And, although a third of the day's applicants, including a 20-year veteran of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, were eliminated, Ms. Reddick made the cut.
 But Ms. Reddick, who is fresh-faced and has buzzed short hair and zirconium studs on the top and bottom of each ear, did not evince any joy. The difficulty of starting over was sinking in -- she could not become a Harris County peace officer before the summer of 2007, she learned -- and it was sobering.
 ''It's confusing,'' she said. ''I have no history here. When I left Atlanta, I really thought the Lord had sent me to New Orleans with a purpose. Now I don't know what he has in mind. All I can say is that I'm tired of twiddling my thumbs. I might as well use this time to get some professional experience.''
 For older refugees from New Orleans, like Ms. Reddick's grandmother, there may be no moving beyond their little pocket of the Crescent City. For Lvinia Reddick, 68, the need to go home to Delery Street is almost physical, gnawing at her every day. 
 Those who are Ms. Reddick's age, however, feel a different anxiety, that of putting life on hold. They do not want to be evacuees forever, living on handouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, sleeping on air mattresses and pining for gumbo. Because the future of New Orleans is so unclear, many are impatient to establish something that feels like a forward-moving life.
 Nobody wants to betray New Orleans, Ms. Reddick said, but nobody wants to be betrayed, either, by a city that may not include everybody in its plans for redevelopment. Residents of the Lower Ninth Ward, in particular, fear that their low-lying neighborhood, a close-knit black community woven together by family and faith yet undermined by poverty and crime, may never be rebuilt.
 Ms. Reddick's attachment to the Lower Ninth Ward, while strong, is less sentimental than that of her family members. A few years ago, she said, she told her grandfather Charles Reddick Sr. that she was contemplating a return from Atlanta but that she wanted to live in a safer part of New Orleans. Mr. Reddick, a Baptist deacon and retired factory worker, responded that she should not bother coming home if she was going to abandon her family and her community. 
 ''That was heavy,'' Ms. Reddick said. ''I would never abandon my family. But do I have a responsibility to a place? I try not to talk too much because I get really spiritual or deep. But I don't want my life to be in vain. The wisdom and talents that God blessed me with -- I think I have a duty to use them for good. But, where? Does where matter?''
 Culturally, the Lower Ninth Ward was like a small town. Families rarely atomized into nuclear pods but stayed extended through generations, their lives interwoven with those of neighbors and church friends. Even now, when they are scattered, Lower Nine residents have managed to regroup in units large enough to allay some of the hardships of displacement. 
 Ms. Reddick remains ensconced in the warm and sometimes claustrophobic embrace of her family. Last week, she felt their familiar push and pull keenly as she tended to her hospitalized grandmother while preparing for her sheriff's department qualifying tests.
 When her grandmother underwent colon surgery, Ms. Reddick spent 14 hours by her side at a Houston hospital. She did go home to sleep, however, which meant that her grandmother woke up alone, a fact that displeased her enormously.
 ''I'm disappointed in y'all,'' Lvinia Reddick said on Thursday when her granddaughter arrived about 9:30 a.m. with other relatives. ''Where were you? My teeth haven't been cleaned. My hair hasn't been combed. They were beginning to think that I didn't have any people. I know my son would have been here first thing this morning if he was in town.''
 Ms. Reddick, who was wearing a pink Polo-style shirt with an upturned collar that said ''Preppy Scum,'' rolled her eyes, laughed and took out a comb. She gently lifted her grandmother from her pillow and started working through the knots in her gray hair. Her grandmother softened. ''That's my little love,'' she said. Then she started warbling a ditty, ''Good morning, sugar bridges.'' 
 Lvinia Reddick, a retired seamstress, used to wake her grandchildren with that song, tickling their toes and putting on their socks. 
 When Shantel Reddick was a bald-headed toddler, her mother, Yolanda, dropped her off at 2144 Delery Street to be raised by her grandparents. Yolanda Reddick, 48, who describes herself as the ''black sheep of the family,'' said she was young and immature, with three children under the age of 5 and a mother who disapproved of her. She wanted to ''run the streets,'' she said, so she ceded to her parents the upbringing of her children, who had different fathers.
 ''I don't know who my father is,'' Shantel Reddick said matter-of-factly at a recent family gathering. 
 This sent Charles Reddick, her barrel-chested uncle, dashing across the room to sling his arm around her and put his chubby cheek beside hers. ''Who's your daddy?'' he asked.
 Shantel Reddick calls her mother Yolanda and sends Mother's Day cards to her grandmother. ''My grandparents were such good people that I was probably better off with them,'' she said. ''But, man, were they strict.''
 As a child, Ms. Reddick spent much time by her grandfather's side. He would mow the lawn and she would sweep the grass into a bag; she would shoot free throws and he would catch the rebounds; they would munch on crawfish while watching football on Monday nights. 
 Her grandparents sent her to parochial school and Sunday school, where she excelled at Bible-flipping, in which children raced through a Bible looking for a particular passage of Scripture, and engaged all of Delery Street in a mission to watch over her.
 ''Delery Street was my whole life except for church and sports,'' she said.
 With the family's expectation that she would be their first college graduate, Ms. Reddick left New Orleans to attend Morris Brown College in Atlanta. On a full scholarship, she played three sports and intended to finish in five years. 
 At the end of the fourth year, however, Ms. Reddick and her teammates accused a male coach of sexual harassment. He was dismissed, she said, but with him went the quiet deal that she would get a fifth year of free tuition. 
 She dropped out just short of a degree in communications, entering a period of floundering, which ended when her grandfather's death started her on a path back to New Orleans.
 Ms. Reddick worked as a civilian jailer before she started at the sheriff's academy in Orleans Parish, where she impressed her teachers. ''I expected nothing but the best from her,'' Cpl. Walt Givens said. ''When the class was required to give 110 percent, I told her she needed to give 20 percent more.'' 
 Corporal Givens recommended Ms. Reddick for the mounted division, and she was supposed to start interviewing for placement on the day the floodwaters overtook New Orleans. 
 Ms. Reddick fled in her Chevrolet Cavalier with her grandfather's Bible, two plaques from the sheriff's academy -- valedictorian and most physically fit -- and a stuffed basketball pillow. She left behind 40 pairs of tennis shoes that she color-coordinated with her shirts -- and a future that was beginning to come into focus.
 At first, Ms. Reddick crowded into a cousin's apartment with dozens of relatives. Then she and her brother's family shared a place, and, a few weeks ago, Ms. Reddick finally moved into her ''bachelorette pad,'' a flavorless space that she furnished with a bench press, black futon, red carpet, television, Playstation and electric waterfall. FEMA covers her monthly rent of about $400. 
 Ms. Reddick's grandmother, who lives nearby, recently received the offer of a trailer from FEMA. She politely informed the government that she had nowhere -- yet -- to put the trailer because her property was in a neighborhood sealed by the government. When she hung up, she tsk-ed. 
 The thought of living in a trailer in a ruined Lower Ninth Ward depressed Ms. Reddick, and Orleans Parish was making no promises to its recent graduates. Stir crazy, she finally forced herself to show up at the sheriff's academy last Friday.
 Harris County is not Orleans Parish; the sheriff's office pays better, but it is also less diverse. Only 5 percent of the deputies are black women, and Ms. Reddick was the sole black woman to qualify last week. 
 There was a moment, when she was running around the barbed-wire perimeter of a jail with geese honking, crickets chirping and guns firing at a range in the background, that Ms. Reddick looked almost radiant. But by the time officials explained that applicants would work in the jail for a year before starting the academy and related stories of inmates masturbating to provoke ''lady jailers,'' her radiance had given way to anxious determination.
 ''I don't know where the Lord wants me to be,'' she said. ''But I really need a job.''

PERSON: Peter Ferdinand Drucker 

HEADLINE: Peter F. Drucker, a Pioneer in Social and Management Theory, Is Dead at 95

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Peter F. Drucker, the political economist and author, whose view that big business and nonprofit enterprises were the defining innovation of the 20th century led him to pioneering social and management theories, died yesterday at his home in Claremont, Calif. He was 95.
 His death was announced by Claremont Graduate University.
Mr. Drucker thought of himself, first and foremost, as a writer and teacher, though he eventually settled on the term ''social ecologist.'' He became internationally renowned for urging corporate leaders to agree with subordinates on objectives and goals and then get out of the way of decisions about how to achieve them.
 He challenged both business and labor leaders to search for ways to give workers more control over their work environment. He also argued that governments should turn many functions over to private enterprise and urged organizing in teams to exploit the rise of a technology-astute class of ''knowledge workers.'' 
 Mr. Drucker staunchly defended the need for businesses to be profitable but he preached that employees were a resource, not a cost. His constant focus on the human impact of management decisions did not always appeal to executives, but they could not help noticing how it helped him foresee many major trends in business and politics. 
 He began talking about such practices in the 1940's and 50's, decades before they became so widespread that they were taken for common sense. Mr. Drucker also foresaw that the 1970's would be a decade of inflation, that Japanese manufacturers would become major competitors for the United States and that union power would decline.
 For all his insights, he clearly owed much of his impact to his extraordinary energy and skills as a communicator. But while Mr. Drucker loved dazzling audiences with his wit and wisdom, his goal was not to be known as an oracle. Indeed, after writing a rosy-eyed article shortly before the stock market crash of 1929 in which he outlined why stocks prices would rise, he pledged to himself to stay away from gratuitous predictions. Instead, his views about where the world was headed generally arose out of advocacy for what he saw as moral action.
 His first book (''The End of Economic Man,'' 1939)was intended to strengthen the will of the free world to fight fascism. His later economic and social predictions were intended to encourage businesses and social groups to organize in ways that he felt would promote human dignity and vaccinate society against political and economic chaos.
 ''He is remarkable for his social imagination, not his futurism,'' said Jack Beatty in a 1998 review of Mr. Drucker's work ''The World According to Peter Drucker.''
 Mr. Drucker, who was born in Vienna and never completely shed his Austrian accent, worked in Germany as a reporter until Hitler rose to power and then in a London investment firm before emigrating to the United States in 1937. He became an American citizen in 1943. 
 Recalling the disasters that overran the Europe of his youth and watching the American response left him convinced that good managers were the true heroes of the century.
 The world, especially the developed world, had recovered from repeated catastrophe because ''ordinary people, people running the everyday concerns of business and institutions, took responsibility and kept on building for tomorrow while around them the world came crashing down,'' he wrote in 1986 in ''The Frontiers of Management.''
 Mr. Drucker never hesitated to make suggestions he knew would be viewed as radical. He advocated legalization of drugs and stimulating innovation by permitting new ventures to charge the government for the cost of regulations and paperwork. He was not surprised that General Motors for years ignored nearly every recommendation in ''The Concept of the Corporation,'' the book he published in 1946 after an 18-month study of G.M. that its own executives had commissioned. 
 From his early 20's to his death, Mr. Drucker held various teaching posts, including a 20-year stint at the Stern School of Management at New York University and, since 1971, a chair at the Claremont Graduate School of Management. He also consulted widely, devoting several days a month to such work into his 90's. His clients included G.M., General Electric and Sears, Roebuck but also the Archdiocese of New York and several Protestant churches; government agencies in the United States, Canada and Japan; universities; and entrepreneurs. 
 For over 50 years, at least half of the consulting work was done free for nonprofits and small businesses. As his career progressed and it became clearer that competitive pressures were keeping businesses from embracing many practices he advocated, like guaranteed wages and lifetime employment for industrial workers, he became increasingly interested in ''the social sector,'' as he called the nonprofit groups.
 Mr. Drucker counseled groups like the Girl Scouts to think like businesses even though their bottom line was ''changed lives'' rather than profits. He warned them that donors would increasingly judge them on results rather than intentions. In 1990, Frances Hesselbein, the former national director of the Girl Scouts, organized a group of admirers to honor him by setting up the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management in New York to expose nonprofits to Mr. Drucker's thinking and to new concepts in management. 
 Mr. Drucker's greatest impact came from his writing. His more than 30 books, which have sold tens of millions of copies in more than 30 languages, came on top of thousands of articles, including a monthly op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal from 1975 to 1995. 
 Among the sayings of Chairman Peter, as he was sometimes called, were these: 
 ''Marketing is a fashionable term. The sales manager becomes a marketing vice president. But a gravedigger is still a gravedigger even when it is called a mortician -- only the price of the burial goes up.''
 ''One either meets or one works.''
 ''The only things that evolve by themselves in an organization are disorder, friction and malperformance.'' 
 ''Stock option plans reward the executive for doing the wrong thing. Instead of asking, 'Are we making the right decision?' he asks, 'How did we close today?' It is encouragement to loot the corporation.''
 Mr. Drucker's thirst for new experiences never waned. He became so fascinated with Japanese art during his trips to Japan after World War II that he eventually helped write ''Adventures of the Brush: Japanese Paintings'' (1979), and lectured on Oriental art at Pomona College in Claremont from 1975 to 1985.
 Peter Ferdinand Drucker was born Nov. 19, 1909, one of two sons of Caroline and Adolph Drucker, a prominent lawyer and high-ranking civil servant in the Austro-Hungarian government. He left Vienna in 1927 to work for an export firm in Hamburg, Germany, and to study law. 
 Mr. Drucker then moved to Frankfurt, where he earned a doctorate in international and public law in 1931 from the University of Frankfurt, became a reporter and then senior editor in charge of financial and foreign news at the newspaper General-Anzeiger, and, while substitute teaching at the university, met Doris Schmitz, a 19-year-old student. They became reacquainted after waving madly while passing each other going opposite directions on a London subway escalator in 1933 and were married in 1937.
 Mr. Drucker had moved to England to work as a securities analyst and writer after watching the rise of the Nazis with increasing alarm. In England, he took an economics course from John Maynard Keynes in Cambridge, but was put off by how much the talk centered on commodities rather than people.
 Mr. Drucker's reputation as a political economist was firmly established with the publication in 1939 of ''The End of Economic Man.'' The New York Times said it brought a ''remarkable vision and freshness'' to the understanding of fascism. The book's observations, along with those in articles he wrote for Harpers and The New Republic, caught the eye of policy makers in the federal government and at corporations as the country prepared for war, and landed him a job teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. 
 Writing ''The Future of Industrial Man,'' published in 1942 after Mr. Drucker moved to Bennington College in Vermont, convinced him that he needed to understand big organizations from the inside. Rebuffed in his requests to work with several major companies, he was delighted when General Motors called in late 1943 proposing that he study its structure and policies. To avoid having him treated like a management spy, G.M. agreed to let him publish his findings.
 Neither G.M. nor Mr. Drucker expected the public to be interested because no one had ever written such a management profile, but ''The Concept of the Corporation'' became an overnight sensation when it was published in 1946. '' 'Concept of the Corporation' is a book about business the way 'Moby Dick' is a book about whaling,'' said Mr. Beatty, referring to the focus on social issues extending far beyond G.M.'s immediate operating challenges.
 In it, Mr. Drucker argued that profitability was crucial to a business's health but more importantly to full employment. Management could achieve sustainable profits only by treating employees like valuable resources. That, he argued, required decentralizing the power to make decisions, including giving hourly workers more control over factory life, and guaranteed wages.
 In the 1950's, Mr. Drucker began proclaiming that democratic governments had become too big to function effectively. This, he said, was a threat to the freedom of their citizens and to their economic well-being.
 Unlike many conservative thinkers, Mr. Drucker wanted to keep government regulation over areas like food and drugs and finance. Indeed, he argued that the rise of global businesses required stronger governments and stronger social institutions, including more powerful unions, to keep them from forgetting social interests. 
 According to Claremont Graduate University, Mr. Drucker's survivors include his wife, Doris, an inventor and physicist; his children, Audrey Drucker of Puyallup, Wash., Cecily Drucker of San Francisco, Joan Weinstein of Chicago, and Vincent Drucker of San Rafael, Calif.; and six grandchildren. 
 Early last year, in an interview with Forbes magazine, Mr. Drucker was asked if there was anything in his long career that he wished he had done but had not been able to do.
 ''Yes, quite a few things,'' he said. ''There are many books I could have written that are better than the ones I actually wrote. My best book would have been ''Managing Ignorance,'' and I'm very sorry I didn't write it.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: November 19, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the political economist and management consultant Peter F. Drucker on Saturday included erroneous names or hometowns listed by Claremont Graduate University for his surviving children. The children are Kathleen Spivack of Watertown, Mass.; Cecily Drucker of Mill Valley, Calif.; Joan Winstein of Oak Park, Ill.; and Vincent Drucker of Dallas.
An obituary last Saturday about the political economist and management consultant Peter F. Drucker misstated the source of a quotation about him -- ''He is remarkable for his social imagination, not his futurism'' -- and misstated the authorship of a book, ''The World According to Peter Drucker.'' The book was written by Jack Beatty, not by Mr. Drucker, and the quotation was from the book, not from a review of the book. 
 Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the source of a quotation from Mr. Drucker. It was Fortune magazine, not Forbes, in which he said: ''There are many books I could have written that are better than the ones I actually wrote. My best book would have been 'Managing Ignorance,' and I'm very sorry I didn't write it.''

HEADLINE: Postcards From a Tax Holiday

 BODY:
PepsiCo recently followed in the footsteps of Hewlett-Packard, Pfizer and other big American corporations by initiating layoffs -- even as it takes advantage of a huge tax break that was supposed to generate cash for hiring. 
 The tax break, passed by Congress last year as part of the American Jobs Creation Act, lets American companies bring foreign-held profits back to the United States this year at a discount of up to 85 percent off the normal tax rate. So far, nearly 100 companies have announced repatriations totaling more than $200 billion, all of which will be eligible for the reduced rate of 5.25 percent, instead of the usual top rate of 35 percent. As its critics warned at the outset, the ''tax holiday'' has proved to be a bigger gift to shareholders than to employees and job seekers.
PepsiCo, for instance, plans to give pink slips to 200 to 250 employees in its Frito-Lay unit a few weeks before Christmas. The company expects that the severance payments for laid-off workers and other belt-tightening measures will cost up to $85 million in 2005. But the company will save several times that amount in taxes this year by repatriating up to $7.5 billion in profits it has stashed abroad. So in effect, the Frito layoffs, like those at other companies with repatriated profits, are supported by taxpayers. 
 And that's not the only way that investors benefit from the tax holiday that was billed as a way to create more opportunities for workers. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal documented that even as American companies were repatriating huge sums under the cut-rate regime, they were using more cash than ever to buy back their own stock. Reducing the number of shares outstanding gives each remaining shareholder a bigger ownership stake in the company. Hewlett-Packard has announced a repatriation of $14.5 billion, layoffs of 14,500 workers and stock buybacks of more than $4 billion for the first half of 2005, about three times the size of its buybacks in the period a year earlier. 
 Since stock repurchases are not a legal use of repatriated funds, companies are claiming that the convergence of big buybacks and huge repatriations is a mere coincidence. Be that as it may, Congress wrote the law in a way that gives companies tremendous leeway to spend the profits as they see fit. 
 Companies cannot be blamed for doing whatever is allowed to cut taxes, increase profits and reward shareholders. The real villains are the members of Congress who use phony labels like ''job creation'' -- and, more recently, ''economic growth'' -- to justify excessive tax cuts that increasingly serve to concentrate wealth among the few.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Traffic Fees Are Not on City's Agenda

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he was not considering any plan for congestion pricing, which would charge drivers for entering the most heavily traveled areas of Manhattan at the busiest times of day. 
 ''It's not on our agenda to look at it,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters before marching in the annual Veterans Day parade along Fifth Avenue. ''The city is always trying to solve traffic problems, and we'll continue to do that, but congestion pricing is not something that we're talking about.''
The Partnership for New York City, a leading business association, has been looking into congestion pricing along with other ideas to improve traffic flow since the spring. Congestion pricing would create a financial incentive for drivers to carpool or use mass transportation. While raising revenue for the city, it could reduce delays and improve air quality.
 Advocates of congestion pricing have pointed out that a similar approach has worked successfully in London and elsewhere.
 But Mr. Bloomberg cautioned that because every city was different, a successful traffic plan in London might not necessarily work in New York. 
 Instead, Mr. Bloomberg called for restoring the so-called commuter tax, which raised money by imposing a tax on people who work in the city but live elsewhere.
 ''What we need is a commuter tax, and I've fought for that a long time, and will continue to fight for a commuter tax,'' he said. ''That's the way to solve some of these problems.'' 
 The commuter tax was repealed by the state in 1999, and reinstating it would require state approval. So far, leaders of both parties in Albany have refused to consider it. 
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the partnership, said the group had not yet taken a position for or against a congestion pricing plan, but instead was in the midst of a study on how it might work in New York City. She said she hoped that when the study was completed city officials would review the findings.
 ''The partnership agrees with the mayor's second-term agenda focused on education, economic development and security,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''Congestion pricing is not one of our top priorities either.''

HEADLINE: In First for Africa, Woman Wins Election as President of Liberia 

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated economist and former World Bank official who waged a fierce presidential campaign against the soccer star George Weah, emerged victorious on Friday in her quest to lead war-torn Liberia and become the first woman elected head of state in modern African history. 
 ''Everything is on our side,'' said Morris Dukuly, a spokesman for Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf. ''The voters have chosen a new and brighter future.''
With 97 percent of the runoff vote counted on Friday, Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf achieved an insurmountable lead with 59 percent, compared with Mr. Weah's 41 percent, in a nation where women make up more than half the electorate. 
 Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf's victory propels her into an old boys' club unlike any other. From the Cape to Cairo, from Dar es Salaam to Dakar, men have dominated African politics from the earliest days of the anticolonial struggle. 
 ''There are so many capable women,'' said Yassine Fall, a Senegalese economist and feminist working on women's rights in Africa. ''But they just don't get the chance to lead.''
 Indeed, when supporters of Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, 66, a onetime United Nations official and Liberian finance minister, marched through the broken streets of Monrovia in the final, frantic days of the campaign for Liberia's presidency, they shouted and waved signs that read, ''Ellen -- she's our man.'' 
 Mr. Dukuly said Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf held off formally declaring victory because Mr. Weah, who won the first round of the election last month and enjoys broad support among Liberia's huge youth population, had alleged that the results were tainted by fraud. 
 Mr. Weah told reporters in Monrovia that he had submitted a formal complaint to the Supreme Court, which will investigate. International observers said that while there were some minor irregularities, they were too small to change the outcome. 
 Mr. Weah, speaking Friday to a crowd of supporters at his campaign headquarters, appealed for calm, but hundreds of supporters wielding branches marched through the streets in protest, chanting, ''No Weah, no peace!'' 
 They threw stones at police officers in front of the National Elections Commission, and United Nations peacekeepers fired tear gas to keep protesters from storming the United States Embassy, according to Reuters.
 Mr. Weah, whose base was the young, discontented population who idolized him for his exploits on the soccer field and his rags-to-riches life story, was seen as a favorite because young voters make up 40 percent of the electorate. 
 But the women's vote appears to have been stronger. There were slightly more women registered to vote in Liberia, and while there were no reliable surveys of voters leaving the polls, women appeared to be a strong presence. 
 Political strategy played a role as well. In the final weeks of the campaign, Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf formed crucial alliances with parties whose candidates had lost in the first round, which winnowed the field of 22 presidential contenders to 2. 
 The impact of her victory went well beyond Liberia, a nation still trying to recover from more than a decade of civil war. 
 The history of the continent rings with the names of heroes like Kwame Nkrumah, Nelson Mandela and Jomo Kenyatta, fathers of the modern African states they helped form, and villains like Mobutu Sese Seko, Idi Amin and Sani Abacha, the despotic ''big men'' who ruled ruthlessly over their subjects, enriching themselves along the way. 
 Despite the large role women played in many national struggles for independence, they were largely relegated to the sidelines in the post-colonial era. The most ambitious women often went abroad, and some, like Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, rose to prominence in international organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank. 
 But in recent years, African women have gained power and visibility. In 2004 a Kenyan environmentalist, Wangari Muta Maathai, won the Nobel Peace Prize, while Nigeria's finance minister and feared corruption fighter, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has emerged as one of that country's most respected officials.
 Women have also made gains at the ballot box. The prime minister of Mozambique, Luisa Dias Diogo, is widely seen as a likely future president. In Rwanda, there is a greater proportion of women serving in Parliament than in any other nation; they occupy nearly half the seats. 
 Indeed, Africa leads the developing world in the percentage of women in legislative positions, at about 16 percent, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization of parliamentary bodies worldwide. 
 Yet having more women leaders does not necessarily bring decisions that benefit women. While women generally make decisions that favor women and children, they often gain political power as an embattled minority that feels it must follow men's lead in order to maintain power, said Geeta Rao Gupta, president of the International Center for Research on Women, a Washington-based research group.
 ''When there is a critical mass of women leaders, they gain confidence over time and are more likely to exhibit diversity of experience as women in their decisions,'' Ms. Rao Gupta said. ''It takes a few cycles to really sink in.'' 
 Liberia's presidential election came two years after the nation emerged from a brutal civil war that claimed more than 200,000 lives and displaced a third of the population. Pushed from power by rebels, Charles Taylor, the warlord who became Liberia's president and fomented bloody wars that racked the region for more than a decade, went into exile in 2003 and is now in Nigeria. 
 He left behind a nation shattered by war, with the entire infrastructure, from roads to electric wires to water pipes, rotted away or looted. Despite its natural wealth in gems, rubber and timber, Liberia is one of the poorest nations. 
 Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, who has been known as Liberia's Iron Lady since she ran against Mr. Taylor for president in 1997 and was jailed for more than a year under the former dictator Samuel Doe, will have no trouble fitting into the all-male club of African heads of state, said Ms. Fall, the economist, who has known her for years. 
 ''She is fearless,'' Ms. Fall said. ''No men intimidate her.''

Move to Arrest Ex-Dictator
 UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 11 (Reuters) -- The Security Council voted unanimously on Friday to authorize peacekeepers to arrest Charles Taylor, the former president, if he returns to Liberia and turn him over to a special tribunal in Sierra Leone.
 Mr. Taylor, in exile in Nigeria, was indicted in Sierra Leone in March 2003 on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
 In addition to calling for Mr. Taylor's arrest, the resolution referred to his stay in Nigeria as temporary, which rights activists said could clear the way for Nigeria to turn him over for trial in Sierra Leone.

If there was a message to be drawn from this week's Republican meltdown over tax and spending cuts, it was this: Conservative hopes for an economic agenda of big ideas and sweeping change are in tatters for the moment.
 The failure of House Republicans to agree on painful but modest spending cuts and the inability of Senate Republicans to agree on extending President Bush's tax cuts exposed a deep and increasingly bitter battle between ardent and ideological conservatives and emboldened Republican moderates.
The battle is being fueled by fears about the political environment going into next year's elections. Conservatives argue that the best way to secure the Republican base is renewed dedication to fiscal austerity; moderates fear that cuts in social programs could alienate independent voters crucial in swing districts. 
 The anger in the party was palpable on Friday, one day after House Republicans retreated on a bill to cut spending by more than $50 billion over five years. 
 ''This would have reduced the growth in mandatory spending by one-tenth of 1 percent over five years,'' said Patrick J. Toomey, a former Republican member of Congress who now heads the Club for Growth, a conservative fund-raising group. ''This is trivial. This is symbolic. And if we can't get enough votes for this, I'm afraid we won't be able to retain a Republican majority in Congress.''
 But Republican moderates, taking their cue from President Bush's plunging popularity and their status as the decisive bloc, given solid Democratic opposition, are pushing back with increased bluntness and confidence against the policy proposals of their party leaders.
 ''I don't know how anyone can say with a straight face that when we voted to cut spending last week to help deficit reduction we can now then turn around two weeks later to provide tax cuts that exceed the reductions we just made in spending,'' said Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, who this week pledged to oppose tax cuts.
 The divisions and dissension among rank-and-file Republicans have been building for months, and the list of stalled priorities is long and growing.
 President Bush quietly abandoned his campaign to overhaul Social Security months ago. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, predicted this week that the effort would go nowhere until at least 2009.
 In September, Senate Republican leaders dropped their effort to repeal the estate tax permanently, a change that would benefit the wealthiest 1 percent of families but would cost about $90 billion a year once it was fully repealed.
 On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee failed to line up enough votes to pass a $68-billion package of tax cuts. The stumbling block: objections from Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine, who said that she could not swallow a provision that would extend the tax cut for stock dividends by one year. 
 Then House Republican leaders accustomed to getting their legislative way were forced to confess that they were short a ''handful'' of votes to gain initial approval of their spending cuts despite major concessions, including a decision to delete a proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. The budget cuts were left teetering, a decision that did not bode well for a pending effort to trim current spending across the board.
 The fight over tax and spending cuts is far from over, but Republican ambitions have been greatly diminished. On Friday, House Republicans unveiled their own package of tax cuts, including a two-year extension of the lower tax on stock dividends. 
 But the cuts most likely to succeed were those that were incremental and familiar: an extension of tax credits for research; an extension of tax breaks for college tuition; an extension of tax breaks for companies that hire troubled teenagers and people on welfare.
 The Republican ruptures over budget and tax priorities stem in large part from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Conservative Republicans were alarmed by rushed approval of more than $60 billion in federal aid and complained that no effort was being made to compensate for the burst of new spending. 
 They became angry when Representative Tom DeLay, the powerful Texas Republican, seemed to suggest that years of Republican control of Congress had already pared the budget to the bone. 
 ''I think Hurricane Katrina was a small tipping point,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonprofit group that advocates stricter budget discipline. Ms. MacGuineas said ''the goal of fiscal responsibility or deficit reduction has been elevated from where it was a few months ago.''
 President Bush and Republican leaders quickly came around to the conservatives' view on hurricane spending, in part to rally House Republicans after Mr. DeLay's indictment on criminal charges in Texas. . Indeed, House leaders upped the ante, seeking cuts beyond targets agreed to earlier this year -- raising the level to $50 billion from $35 billion. 
 That set off the Republican moderates, who viewed the new goal as too much to ask. ''I think the panic of what Katrina could cost kind of got out of hand,'' said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, a foe of the budget-cutting plan. ''I philosophically don't agree with their belief that in order to balance the budget we have to up this year's goals.'' 
 The upshot of all the chaos could turn out to be smaller spending reductions than hard-liners demand and bigger tax cuts than the moderates want. House Republicans are expected to try to rework their budget proposal early next week to entice more moderate support, and officials expect the scope of the cuts to be scaled back.
 At the same time, House and Senate tax panels are set to begin getting serious about their tax bills. To lessen the opposition, the Senate Finance Committee is expected to omit an extension of Mr. Bush's tax cuts on stock dividends when it begins drafting a tax cutting measure Monday night. But House lawmakers have included the stock provision in their bill, and it could become a point of contention should it end up in any final measure worked out in House-Senate negotiations.
 The House bill omits two sets of tax cuts that many lawmakers in both parties view as must-pass legislation: tax breaks to help Gulf Coast areas hit by the hurricanes, and a provision to prevent the alternative minimum tax from engulfing millions of additional families next year.
 Those provisions cost nearly $19 billion in the Senate approach, and few lawmakers expect them to be lost in the shuffle next week, driving up the price of the tax cuts.
 ''The rhetoric about fiscal restraint turns out be Orwellian, because the net effect is going to be to increase deficits rather than reducing them,'' predicted Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington.
 Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, serving as the No. 2 Republican, said the difficulties faced by Republicans as they tried to enact the intertwined budget and tax cuts illustrated why Congress had not tried to advance a similar package since 1997.
 ''This is hard,'' Mr. Blunt said.

HEADLINE: Are Trams Going the Way of Wooden Skis?

BYLINE: By GRACE LICHTENSTEIN

 BODY:
LIKE rope tows, wooden skis and cable bindings, the aerial tram may soon be obsolete in American ski resorts -- if the news coming out of Jackson Hole is any indication.
 Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming stunned its passholders and visitors by announcing last June that it would shut down its iconic 39-year-old aerial tram after this ski season. Taking that tram in order to challenge some of the most famous double-diamond expert slopes in the West has long been a rite of passage for skiers.
Which is leading some skiers to wonder: If the Jackson Hole tram is not fit to run past its 40th birthday, how safe are others that skiers and boarders climb aboard?
 The answer is: very safe. Since 1973, when the National Ski Areas Association began keeping statistics, there has been a single tram incident, in which four people died at Squaw Valley, in California, in 1978, when a supporting cable came off the tower and crushed the car. But still, the association says, visitors are far more likely to die in an accident driving to a ski area than riding a lift. In 25 years, said Sid Roslund, director of technical services at the association, there have been 12 ''ropeway-related'' deaths. 
 While trams are a familiar sight in Chamonix, Zermatt and many other European ski areas, there are only 19 public tramways in the United States and several have no connection with skiing, like the Roosevelt Island tram in New York. Yet, no major tram has been built in a United States ski area in 13 years, according to Mr. Roslund. 
 The main problem with trams, he said, is that in many cases they are just not efficient enough in the new, high-tech world of gondolas, detachable quads and six-packs. ''A tram might be a dramatic statement, but it's not as efficient as a gondola'' in terms of ''cost or capacity,'' said Michael Berry, president of the ski areas association. Originally, trams were the solution to specific topographical problems, since they could carry people to the peak of a rocky, concave or extremely steep mountain, ''leaping chasms in a single bound,'' as Mr. Roslund put it. 
 At Jackson Hole, the tram provides access to the longest continuous vertical drop in the United States, including such storied runs as Corbet's Couloir and the Hobacks. 
 ''It's a source of local pride,'' said David Gonzales, a resident of Jackson and the author of ''Jackson Hole: On a Grand Scale.'' ''The ski bums love it. There's a shared feeling of anticipation. To get on the first tram on a powder morning packed with 50 other maniacs is exciting.''
 Thanks to the tram, Jackson is one of the few places in the country where a single lift takes you to 4,000 vertical feet of slopes, so you can ski or ride ''tram laps'' for ''as long as your legs hold out,'' he said.
 The trams at Snowbird in Utah, Sandia Peak in New Mexico and Squaw Valley in California, like the one at Jackson Hole, were built before 1972. Back then, the maximum speed of conventional ''fixed grip'' chairlifts was about 500 feet a minute, compared with a tram's 2,000 feet a minute, explained Buddy Loux, lift operations manager at Jay Peak in Vermont, whose tram dates back to 1966 but has since been rebuilt. So a tram was the ''only way to get to the top of a mountain in a hurry.'' 
 But in the 1980's, engineers introduced a new version of ''detachable grip'' technology, a method of carrying chairs or gondola cars via overhead cables at a much higher speed. This meant they could build multipassenger chairlifts or gondolas that sped skiers and snowboarders up most terrain much faster than old chairs or trams.
 Thus at Jackson Hole, the 66 eight-passenger cabins of the Bridger gondola, opened in 1997, transport 2,000 passengers an hour to a terminal at 9,025 feet up Rendezvous Mountain, more than the 52-passenger tram carries to the summit all day. At Jay Peak, The Flyer detachable quad chairlift runs 2,400 people an hour up the slopes while its tram, built a year after Jackson Hole's, takes only 360.
 ''A tram is high maintenance, low efficiency,'' Mr. Loux said. ''Being the person who has to maintain it, I'd just as soon have chairlifts to the top of the mountain.''
 COMFORT, too, is an issue. Waiting for and then riding a tram can sometimes feel like being stuffed into a subway car with 50 strangers, all with ski equipment. Gondola cabins, which carry 4 to 12 passengers, have seats, windows and outside slots for stowing skis or boards for the trip. 
 But no one underestimates the symbolic -- and nostalgic -- importance of the tram at Jackson Hole. And if trams are so safe, why, then, did Jackson Hole say that the resort's tram is being retired ''to minimize safety concerns''? Because, according to the resort, it would cost a fortune to keep it up to code. Standards for lifts nationwide are set by a committee of more than 60 specialists supervised by Mr. Roslund. 
 Jerry Blann, president of Jackson Hole, says that it spends about $100,000 a year keeping the tram in shape. In the last few years, the entire gear box has been replaced, but the next parts to be upgraded would be the huge track cables, ''and then we would have to change everything but the cabins,'' he said.
 A brand new tram, Mr. Blann said, would cost about $20 million (the Bridger gondola cost $8 million). That may be the long-term solution, but the resort expects to seek help -- in the form of bonds or loans -- from the state. Indeed, the Jackson tram was initially financed through a federal government program that lent money to depressed communities relying on seasonal economies. 
 At Snowbird, Bob Bonar, the president, says the average annual maintenance bill for its tram is $250,000. ''We have basically rebuilt the tram,'' he said, enumerating upgrades from cables to cabins to control systems. 
 Sandia Peak, which operates the longest single-section cable tram in the world, carrying people from Albuquerque to the ridgeline of the Sandia Mountains, spent more than $3 million in 1997 replacing its cables, according to Jay Blackwood, assistant tram manager. Jay Peak refurbished its tram in 2000 and 2003. No other resort has publicly declared its intention to retire a tram.
 ''It's a year-round attraction,'' said Rob Arey, the sales manager at Cannon Mountain where the tram rides are a key summer attraction in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. ''Not to be trite, but it's a big part of our brand,'' said Steve Wright, the marketing and sales director at Jay Peak. ''Not every decision, at least we feel here, should be made with an eye on how it directly impacts the bottom line.''
 As Jackson holds talks with state officials about a replacement tram, it is floating the notion of Sno-Cat access, high-speed surface lifts or both for an interim period. Meanwhile, the resort has turned its announcement into a promotional opportunity, offering a ''Last Tram'' vacation package.
 Mr. Gonzales says people in Jackson Hole are worried about losing the tram since it is a symbol of their mountain's famous steeps. ''I can't get too worked up about it, though,'' he said. ''The tram is only important because it's the fastest way up this magnificent mountain.''

HEADLINE: Strength in Numbers on the Internet

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THREE years ago, with her three children grown, Rose Ann Hermann, who had been a stay-at-home mother, was looking for a new venture. ''I knew there was something out there,'' she said recently, ''but I didn't think it would involve technology.''
 Certainly not computer technology. Ms. Hermann, who turned 50 yesterday, had never even used a computer until she bought one for herself in 1999. Until then, she said, she did her writing on a pink Royal typewriter from the 1950's. 
But once her fingertips danced across the keyboard of her new iMac, she quickly appreciated the reach and speed of online research. And after her computer-savvy son, Gabriel Blau, graduated from Bard College in 2002, ''we began brainstorming,'' she said, coming up with the idea for the Internet marketing, consulting and technical services business they now run. 
 They named it Visible Shops, a reference to its flagship operation: a collective Web site comprising the sites of small retail and service businesses. 
 The umbrella site was originally called larchmontshops.com, reflecting the brick-and-mortar location of all 25 constituent businesses when it began operating in October 2003. Today it is westchestershops.com, indicating its expansion over the last year to more than 50 businesses in a dozen cities and villages in southern Westchester County. 
 Visible Shops operates out of a converted bedroom in the large apartment in Larchmont, in Westchester County, where Ms. Hermann lives with her husband, George A. Hermann. 
 Visible Shops became the second business to have its quarters in the seven-room apartment. In 2002 Mr. Hermann, a longtime veteran of the computer world, established his own Internet consulting business at one end of the 22-foot-long dining room. That business, E-World Consultants, generally advises small and medium-size manufacturers and distributors on using the Internet to expand their sales. 
 Ms. Hermann and Mr. Blau, her son from a previous marriage who lives in Manhattan, sell space on their collective site the way operators of similar ventures do: by persuading small-business owners that having a Web site will be good for attracting customers, and that having it as part of a joint site will cost less than a stand-alone Web site. The sites-within-a-site they offer do not include the capacity for online purchasing.While it is not expensive to set up a stand-alone site, Mr. Blau said, ''for it to be useful in marketing, you have to get people to go to it.'' That, he said, often involves paying a professional to manage the marketing of the site, including tracking the number of visitors, providing advice on how to increase the traffic and keeping the site up to date. The cost of that service can be $3,000 a year, he said, too much to interest many small merchants. 
 Westchestershops.com keeps count of the number of visitors to each site on it (the overall site averages 10,000 visitors a month, Ms. Hermann said) and makes it easier for the merchants to update their entries. The original charge to join was $800 a year, after a $250 fee to set up the individual site. Since March, the charge has been $365 a year and a $125 setup fee, made possible in part by improved operations, Mr. Blau said.
 The 52 businesses now on the mother site include food, clothing, flower, jewelry and pet supply shops and insurance, carpet cleaning and party planning companies.
 Andrea Assael, the owner of Avenue P, a women's clothing store in Larchmont, said she thought that being on the site had been good for her business. 
 Laurie Smith, the owner of Swanson Florist in Croton-on-Hudson, said she had not decided whether the site was beneficial for her. Visible Shops also offers design, marketing and other services to businesses that are not part of westchestershops.com. The company had about $30,000 in revenue, with a ''tiny profit,'' in 2004, its first full year of operation, Mr. Blau said. He expects revenue this year to be $120,000 to $150,000, with profit still small because costs have grown. 
 One cost the business does not have is rent, since it operates out of the apartment of Mr. and Ms. Hermann. But with Visible Shops having recently hired two part-time employees, it can get pretty crowded in that converted bedroom.
 The new employees, though, have taken over some of Ms. Hermann's duties, including installing the merchants' sites. That leaves her more time to do what she says she does best: getting them to sign up to begin with.
 While she has come a long way since the days of the pink typewriter, ''I'm not the technical brains of this venture,'' she said.

BYLINE: By AMY R. HUGHES

 BODY:
THE evolution of David Scott's Red Hook loft from party pad to stylishly designed apartment tracked the 38-year-old's personal growth. Once a stay-up-all-night bachelor, he is now a married entrepreneur who goes to bed around 9 p.m. so he can get an early start on his work -- making modern furniture for his own Brooklyn-based design firm.
 When Mr. Scott first moved to New York in 2000, his only possessions were a suitcase full of clothes, a bed and two chairs he'd thrown in the back of his truck for the cross-country trip from Los Angeles, where he'd lived since attending Southern California Institute of Architecture in 1994 (he left before graduating).
Mr. Scott had heard from Vince and Nida Chesonis Lee, married friends from graduate school who had already migrated East, about some loft apartments coming up for rent in the former Monarch Luggage Company plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. The 1920 brick building on Verona Street was still undergoing conversion from industrial to residential space, but several units in the first wave of construction were available. 
 So Mr. Scott, along with David Berk, a technology consultant who joined him on the drive from Los Angeles; Mr. and Mrs. Lee; and a fellow furniture designer, Douglas Fanning, snatched up four adjacent apartments. ''It was just like moving into the dorms,'' Mr. Scott said.
 His 1,000-square-foot loft had a new kitchen and bathroom. It also had wood floors with burn spots, deep gouges and other signs of industrial abuse; leaky pipes; and just one dim overhead light that cast an unflattering fluorescent glow. 
 When he got there, Red Hook's reputation was, as it had always been, rough and tumble. (Al Capone had begun his career there.) Once populated primarily by the families of longshoremen who unloaded cargo from ships docked along the East River, it had been in economic decline since the waterfront jobs started migrating to New Jersey in the 1950's. 
 Red Hook is also one of the more isolated neighborhoods in Brooklyn; to get to the nearest subway stop, the Smith and Ninth Street station in Carroll Gardens, residents have a good 15-minute walk, or have to rely on the B61 bus. Many residents have cars.
 For $990 a month, Mr. Scott was willing to overlook the neighborhood's shortcomings. The loft met his needs for a large live/work space where he could get his new furniture company, Desu Design, up and running. It was also an ideal venue for dance parties.
 ''We were obnoxious -- playing loud music well into the next morning,'' he said. ''Even on school nights. We'd open up the whole floor so you could just wander from one apartment to the next.'' 
 Besides his bed -- placed in the middle of the room -- and the two chairs he'd lugged from Los Angeles, the only other accouterment in those early days was a D.J. booth Mr. Scott built in an afternoon out of fiberboard panels.
 By the time he met Emily Schriebl -- a dancer who now works for a Brooklyn-based arts education provider called Create! -- through Nerve.com, the online dating service, in 2002, Mr. Scott had added a pool table and motorcycle to his short list of possessions. 
 Though a bit taken aback by Mr. Scott's sparse bachelor pad, Ms. Schriebl, a Vermont native, was intrigued by the notion of dating a ''Brooklyn designer.'' She was also impressed that he had been to a performance at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, a three-month-long modern-dance event staged each year in the Berkshires -- something Mr. Scott had mentioned in his first e-mail to her. ''And he was cute,'' she said.
 After dating for about a year, Mr. Scott and Ms. Schriebl began redesigning the loft together. The pool table was donated to a friend. The bed moved to a more private sleeping platform that Mr. Scott built using steel structural beams that are as strong as the standard wood beams, but thinner to provide enough headroom to stand upright in the space. 
 The platform's floor is made from 4-by-8-foot panels that were sanded smooth and screwed to the steel floor joists. ''We wanted cork, but it was too expensive,'' said Ms. Schriebl, who painstakingly filled every seam and screw hole with a homemade mixture of glue and sawdust. She then coated the entire floor with a clear acrylic polyurethane sealer so it would better hold up to wear and feel softer under bare feet. 
 Mr. Scott recently finished a staircase to the platform (which had previously been accessible only by a ladder), to make nighttime bathroom visits less perilous. The staircase's backbone is made of steel treated with an acid wash that gives it a graphite color; its treads, which appear to be floating on their bracket supports, are Brazilian cherry.
 To illuminate the front hallway, which was hemmed in by the new sleeping platform above, the couple installed low-voltage puck lights like the ones typically used under kitchen cabinets. 
 They also built a hall closet to store coats and cleaning supplies. But instead of the standard bifold doors, Mr. Scott built two steel out-swinging doors with recessed handles that, when closed, look like a Mark Rothko-inspired painting. 
 Among the artwork now hanging on the walls is a giant framed photograph taken by Ms. Schriebl's brother, Jamie, a small collection of African masks and two abstract paintings by one of Mr. Scott's former girlfriends -- a detail Ms. Schriebl doesn't seem to care much about. 
 Why should she? Mr. Scott's days as a freewheeling singleton ended when he met her -- a fact further evidenced by the transformation of the loft. ''Over the years, I started to care what the place looked like after all those parties,'' he said. ''I got more tame.''
 That doesn't mean the parties stopped. In September 2004, the couple invited 30 revelers over to their loft to celebrate their wedding. And in May, just days before Ms. Schriebl's watermelon-martini party to toast the coming of summer, Mr. Scott presented his wife with a walnut-topped dining table that can be expanded with leaves to seat 12. ''Once you have the neighbors over, you are already at near full capacity,'' Ms. Schriebl said.
 The atmosphere has certainly changed since Mr. Scott first moved into the loft. So has the neighborhood. More artists, young professionals and new parents are moving in, driving up rents. Mr. Scott negotiated his $990-a-month rent five years ago, before the building's conversion was complete, but newly renovated units now go for about $1,800.
 In the 76th Precinct, which includes Red Hook, major crimes have gone down 55 percent in the last 12 years, according to police statistics. But new arrivals don't always feel comfortable walking alone at night, and the isolation has driven some of them away, Mr. Scott said.
 Yet all of Mr. Scott's friends still live on the hall, and they too are mellowing out and coupling up. 
 ''This building has a high turnover rate,'' Ms. Schriebl said. ''But there's a core that has been here since the beginning. And we'll stay.''

HEADLINE: Relying on Computer, U.S. Seeks To Prove Iran's Nuclear Aims

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and DAVID E. SANGER; Dexter Filkins contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

 BODY:
In mid-July, senior American intelligence officials called the leaders of the international atomic inspection agency to the top of a skyscraper overlooking the Danube in Vienna and unveiled the contents of what they said was a stolen Iranian laptop computer. 
 The Americans flashed on a screen and spread over a conference table selections from more than a thousand pages of Iranian computer simulations and accounts of experiments, saying they showed a long effort to design a nuclear warhead, according to a half-dozen European and American participants in the meeting.
 The documents, the Americans acknowledged from the start, do not prove that Iran has an atomic bomb. They presented them as the strongest evidence yet that, despite Iran's insistence that its nuclear program is peaceful, the country is trying to develop a compact warhead to fit atop its Shahab missile, which can reach Israel and other countries in the Middle East.
 The briefing for officials of the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency, including its director Mohamed ElBaradei, was a secret part of an American campaign to increase international pressure on Iran. But while the intelligence has sold well among countries like Britain, France and Germany, which reviewed the documents as long as a year ago, it has been a tougher sell with countries outside the inner circle. 
 The computer contained studies for crucial features of a nuclear warhead, said European and American officials who had examined the material, including a telltale sphere of detonators to trigger an atomic explosion. The documents specified a blast roughly 2,000 feet above a target -- considered a prime altitude for a nuclear detonation.
 Nonetheless, doubts about the intelligence persist among some foreign analysts. In part, that is because American officials, citing the need to protect their source, have largely refused to provide details of the origins of the laptop computer beyond saying that they obtained it in mid-2004 from a longtime contact in Iran. Moreover, this chapter in the confrontation with Iran is infused with the memory of the faulty intelligence on Iraq's unconventional arms. In this atmosphere, though few countries are willing to believe Iran's denials about nuclear arms, few are willing to accept the United States' weapons intelligence without question.
 ''I can fabricate that data,'' a senior European diplomat said of the documents. ''It looks beautiful, but is open to doubt.'' 
 Robert G. Joseph, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, who led the July briefing, declined to discuss any classified material from the session but acknowledged the existence of the warhead intelligence. He called it one of many indicators ''that together lead to the conclusion Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability.''
 Even if the documents accurately reflect Iran's advances in designing a nuclear warhead, Western arms experts say that Iran is still far away from producing the radioactive bomb fuel that would form the warhead's heart. American intelligence agencies recently estimated that Iran would have a working nuclear weapon no sooner than the early years of the next decade.
 Still, nuclear analysts at the international atomic agency studied the laptop documents and found them to be credible evidence of Iranian strides, European diplomats said. A dozen officials and nuclear weapons experts in Europe and the United States with detailed knowledge of the intelligence said in interviews that they believed it reflected a concerted effort to develop a warhead. ''They've worked problems that you don't do unless you're very serious,'' said a European arms official. ''This stuff is deadly serious.'' 
 In fact, some nations that were skeptical of the intelligence on Iraq -- including France and Germany -- are deeply concerned about what the warhead discovery could portend, according to several officials. But the Bush administration, seeming to understand the depth of its credibility problem, is only talking about the laptop computer and its contents in secret briefings, more than a dozen so far. And even while President Bush is defending his pronouncements before the war about Iraq's unconventional weapons, he has never publicly referred to the Iran documents. 
 R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, who has coordinated the Iran issue with the Europeans, also declined to discuss the intelligence, but insisted that the Bush administration's approach was one of ''careful, quiet diplomacy designed to increase international pressure on Iran to do one thing: abandon its nuclear weapons designs and return to negotiations with European countries.'' 
 Until now, there has been only one official reference to them: a year ago in a conversation with reporters, Colin L. Powell, then secretary of state, briefly referred to new, missile-related intelligence on Iran. Since then, reports in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and other publications have revealed some details of the intelligence, including that the United States has obtained thousands of pages of Iranian documents on warhead development.
 In interviews in recent weeks, analysts and officials from six countries in Europe and Asia revealed a more extensive picture of the intelligence briefings. In turn, several American officials confirmed the intelligence. All who spoke did so on the condition of anonymity, saying they had pledged to keep the intelligence secret, though it is being discussed by an array of senior government officials and International Atomic Energy Agency board members. 
 Officials said scientists at the American weapons labs, as well as foreign analysts, had examined the documents for signs of fraud. It was a particular concern given the fake documents that emerged several years ago purporting to show that Saddam Hussein had sought uranium from Niger. Officials said they found the warhead documents, written in Persian, convincing because of their consistency and technical accuracy and because they showed a progression of developmental work from 2001 to early 2004. 
 Within the United States government, ''the nature and the history of the source has left everyone pretty confident that this is the real thing,'' said a former senior American intelligence official who was briefed on the laptop.
 But one nongovernment expert cautioned that the intelligence could simply represent the work of a faction in Iran. ''What we don't know is whether this is the uncoordinated effort of a particularly ambitious sector of the rocket program or is it, as some allege, a step-by-step effort to field a nuclear weapon within this decade,'' said Joseph Cirincione of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who said he had not seen the secret documents.
 The Iranians themselves deny any knowledge of the warhead plans. ''We are sure that there are no such documents in Iran,'' Ali A. Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and the country's chief nuclear negotiator, said in an interview in Tehran. ''I have no idea what they have or what they claim to have. We just hear the claims.''
 As a measure of the skepticism the Bush administration faces, officials said the American ambassador to the international atomic agency, Gregory L. Schulte, was urging other countries to consult with his French counterpart. ''On Iraq we disagreed, and on Iran we completely agree,'' a senior State Department official said. ''That gets attention.''

Inspectors and Secret Sites
 For years, American intelligence agencies argued that Iran was hiding a range of nuclear facilities. Then, in February 2003, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency went to Iran and confirmed reports of two secret sites under construction that could make concentrated uranium and plutonium, standard fuels for nuclear arms. At Natanz, in central Iran, they found preparations for more than 50,000 whirling centrifuges meant to purify uranium. At Arak, to the west, they found construction of a heavy-water plant and reactor meant to make plutonium. 
 Iran insisted the sites were for conducting peaceful research and making fuel for nuclear power, and were kept secret to evade American-led penalties on sales of atomic technology to Iran. 
 Over time, a string of revelations challenged that explanation, even as inspectors eventually uncovered at least seven secret nuclear sites.
 In August 2003, agency inspectors discovered traces of uranium concentrated to the high levels necessary for a bomb, rather than the low levels for a power-producing reactor. Some of the uranium was shown to have arrived in Iran on nuclear equipment purchased from Pakistan, but a European diplomat disclosed that the origin of the rest was still a mystery. 
 Then there were questions about what Iran had obtained from the atomic black market run by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani rogue nuclear engineer. Iran has acknowledged buying from Dr. Khan, but the extent of those dealings is still under investigation.
 By late 2003, many government and nongovernment experts agreed that Iran was rapidly progressing. ''Most people,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, ''believed that they had mastered the essential capabilities and had the potential to develop what they needed to make a bomb.''
 Diplomacy aimed at defusing Iran moved haltingly. Tehran agreed to suspend the enrichment of uranium as it negotiated with the West over the fate of its atom program, but months later began making uranium hexafluoride, the raw material for enrichment. 
 If Iran hid parts of its atomic program, it boldly displayed its missiles. And in August 2004, it conducted a test that deepened suspicions that it was at work on a nuclear warhead.
 Tehran test-fired an upgraded version of the Shahab -- shooting star in Persian -- in a flight that featured the first appearance of an advanced nose cone made up of three distinct shapes. Missile experts noted that such triconic nose cones have great range, accuracy and stability in flight, but less payload space. Therefore, experts say, they have typically been used to carry nuclear arms.
 Iran insists it is pursuing only peaceful energy, and notes that nations like Japan, South Korea and Brazil have advanced civilian nuclear programs and sophisticated missiles, but have been aided by the West in building their programs rather than being accused of trying to make atomic warheads.
 ''Second-class countries are allowed to produce only tomato paste,'' said Mr. Larijani, Iran's nuclear negotiator. ''The problem is that Iran has come out of its shell and is trying to have advanced technology.''

A Laptop's Contents
 American officials have said little in their briefings about the origins of the laptop, other than that they obtained it in mid-2004 from a source in Iran who they said had received it from a second person, now believed to be dead. Foreign officials who have reviewed the intelligence speculate that the laptop was used by someone who worked in the Iranian nuclear program or stole information from it. One senior arms expert said the material was so voluminous that it appeared to be the work of a team of engineers.
 Without revealing the source of the computer, American intelligence officials insisted that it had not come from any Iranian resistance groups, whose claims about Iran's nuclear program have had a mixed record for accuracy. 
 In July, as the Bush administration began stepping up the pressure on the United Nations to take punitive action against Tehran, it decided to brief Dr. ElBaradei on the contents of the laptop. The session on July 18 on the top floor of the American mission in Vienna was a meeting of former rivals. Before the Iraq war, Dr. ElBaradei had attracted the wrath of the Bush administration by declaring that his agency had found no evidence that Saddam Hussein was reconstituting his nuclear program. And the administration had tried to oust Dr. ElBaradei, an Egyptian, from his post, partly because they found him insufficiently tough on Iran. 
 The briefing primarily revealed computer simulations and studies of various warhead configurations rather than laboratory work or reports on test flights, according to officials in Europe and the United States. But one American official said notations indicated that the Iranians had performed experiments. ''This wasn't just some theoretical exercise,'' he said.
 In an interview, Dr. ElBaradei, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in October, declined to discuss the secret briefing.
 Assessing just how far the Iranians have gone from plan to product is difficult. ''It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that beautiful pictures represent reality,'' a senior intelligence official said. ''But that may not be the case.''
 One major revelation was work done on a sphere of detonators meant to ignite conventional explosives that, in turn, compress the radioactive fuel to start the nuclear chain reaction. The documents also wrestled with how to position a heavy ball -- presumably of nuclear fuel -- inside the warhead to ensure stability and accuracy during the fiery plunge toward a target. And a bomb exploding at a height of about 2,000 feet, as envisioned by the documents, suggests a nuclear weapon, analysts said, since that altitude is unsuitable for conventional, chemical or biological arms.
 After more than a year of analysis, questions remain about the trove's authenticity. ''Even with the best intelligence, you always ask yourself, 'Was this prepared for my eyes?' '' one American official said. Several intelligence experts said that a sophisticated Western spy agency could, in theory, have produced the contents of the laptop. But American officials insisted there was no evidence of such fraud.
 Gary Samore, the head of nonproliferation at the National Security Council in the Clinton administration, who recently directed a report on Iran that drew on interviews with government officials in many nations, said, ''The most convincing evidence that the material is genuine is that the technical work is so detailed that it would be difficult to fabricate.''

An Unclassified Briefing
 In August and September, as the United States was preparing for a showdown vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency on whether to recommend action by the United Nations Security Council against Iran, the Bush administration stepped up its campaign.
 The United States rarely shares raw intelligence outside a small circle of close allies. But it decided to disseminate a shortened version of the secret warhead briefing. Mr. Joseph and his colleagues presented it to the president of Ghana and to officials from Argentina, Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Nigeria, among other nations. 
 But the administration felt uncomfortable sharing any classified intelligence with another ring of countries. For them, it developed the equivalent of the white paper on Iraq that Britain and the United States published before the Iraq war. The 43-page unclassified briefing includes no reference to the warhead documents, but uses commercial satellite photos and economic analysis to argue that Iran has no need for nuclear power and has long hidden its true ambitions.
 Analysts from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory wrote the briefing paper for the State Department, which distributed it widely. In graphic detail, the paper offers a tour of the previously hidden sites, saying, for instance, that a ''dummy'' building at the centrifuge plant in Natanz hides a secret entrance ramp to an underground factory. 
 The briefing asserted that Iran did not have enough proven uranium reserves to fuel its nuclear power program beyond 2010. But it does have enough uranium, the report added, ''to give Iran a significant number of nuclear weapons.'' 
 The briefing landed with something of a thud. Some officials found its arguments superficial and inconclusive. ''Yeah, so what?'' said one European expert who heard the briefing. ''How do you know what you're shown on a slide is true given past experience?''
 Even so, the American campaign helped produce a consensus among International Atomic Energy Agency board members, although a fragile one. On Sept. 24, the board passed the resolution against Iran by a vote of 22 to 1, with 12 countries abstaining, including China and Russia.
 It cited Iran for ''a long history of concealment and deception'' and repeated failure to live up to its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which it signed in 1970. The resolution said Iran's failings had set it up for consideration by the Security Council for possible punishment with economic penalties, though it left the timing of the referral to a future meeting.
 Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's foreign minister, denounced the resolution as ''illegal and illogical'' and the result of a ''planned scenario determined by the United States.'' 

Debating the Next Step
 On Thanksgiving, Nov. 24, the board of the international atomic agency plans to meet again to confront the Iranian nuclear question -- and decide whether to take the next step and send the issue to the Security Council. 
 The Bush administration is confident in its evidence. ''There is not a single country we deal with that does not believe Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon,'' said Mr. Burns, the under secretary of state.
 The Iranians have taken steps to forestall any penalties. After months of delays, they have allowed inspectors into a secret military site, shared more information about the history of their program, and signaled a willingness to reopen negotiations, even while vowing to continue turning raw uranium into a gas that can be enriched. Those steps may convince some atomic agency board members. And at least two countries rotating onto the board for the next meeting -- Cuba and Syria -- are almost certain to defy Washington. (In September, only Venezuela voted with Tehran.)
 Given those politics, the fresh intelligence that the United States says proves Iran's true intentions may not be pivotal in the long confrontation with Tehran. One reason is that the United States has so far refused to declassify the warhead information, making it impossible to seek a detailed explanation from the Iranians.
 Dr. ElBaradei said his agency was bound to ''follow due process, which means I need to establish the veracity, consistency and authenticity of any intelligence, and share it with the country of concern.'' In this case, he added, ''That has not happened.''
 European nations and the international atomic agency are now working out details of a new proposal that offers Tehran the chance to conduct very limited nuclear activities in Iran, but move any enrichment of uranium to Russia -- part of the effort to keep the country from obtaining the nuclear fuel that could go atop the Shahab missile.
 Some European diplomats are concerned that confronting the Iranians with strong evidence of the warhead studies could cause Tehran to abandon negotiations with the West, expel international inspectors and move forward with its plans, whatever they may be.
 ''It's a card that will explode the system in place, so the question becomes when and how you play it,'' a senior European diplomat said. ''If there is information that can serve to make progress with the Iranians, without blowing up the system, that's better.''


Chart/Map: ''Clues About Iran's Nuclear Activity''
Despite scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy Agency, most of the nuclear-related sites in Iran were unknown until a string of disclosures that began in early 2003. One place of interest, the Lavizan-Shian Military Physics Research Center for Nuclear Defense, shown below, was bulldozed before inspectors were allowed to visit the site.

HEADLINE: The N.H.L.'s Diversity Program Is Beginning to Pay Dividends

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS

 BODY:
Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Gerald Coleman made N.H.L. history Thursday night simply by putting on his uniform.
 Coleman, 20, became the first participant in the N.H.L.'s diversity program to dress for a regular-season game, although he did not play in the Lightning's 5-2 home loss to the Rangers.
''I think it's great for the game,'' N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said last week. ''I think diversity is a strength. And I think the fact that we have lots of players of color in our game now is great for the game. And I hope that they serve as role models to people who are interested in our game -- both as fans and as young kids -- who are looking for role models to emulate. Hockey is for everyone.'' 
 The N.H.L. says there are 12 black players in the 30-team league; Coleman, who is from Romeoville, Ill., and Buffalo Sabres forward Mike Grier are the only two black players who were born in the United States.
 N.H.L. Diversity was founded in 1995 in conjunction with USA Hockey. The program was designed to offer support to nonprofit hockey organizations in North America that offer economically disadvantaged children the chance to play hockey. 
 Though the N.H.L. does not offer monetary support, several former and current N.H.L. players, including Calgary's Jarome Iginla, Vancouver's Anson Carter and the Rangers' Kevin Weekes, help the league throughout the year by having street and ice hockey demonstrations and instructional clinics.
 ''We've been committed to diversity,'' Bettman said. ''And actually, we are the most diverse league. If you look at where our players come from, we have the greatest diversity and background of any of the major sports.''
 On Thursday at Phoenix, Iginla, whose father is from Nigeria, was asked if he thought the N.H.L. had become more diverse in his nine seasons in the league.
 ''It has,'' said Iginla, 27, who led the league in goals and points in 2001-2, then tied for the league lead in goals, with 41, in 2003-4. ''Especially from when I was in junior and watching, and when I was younger. I followed as many black players and minorities as I could in the N.H.L.
 ''Now, there are blacks and minorities at all positions: role players, tough guys, scorers, goalies, every position; and young and up-and-coming guys that are just breaking in. I think it's great for the league. In everyone's dressing room, there are so many different cultures. I think it's great for hockey, and I do think there's more. Hopefully, it will continue.''
 Weekes recently pointed out the growing number of players whose ancestors came from the Caribbean.
 Weekes, Carter, St. Louis's Jamal Mayers, Peter Worrell (who is in the Rangers' minor league system), Shawn Belle (in Dallas's minor league system) and the former N.H.L. goalie Fred Brathwaite trace their roots to Barbados.
 Weekes also said that Ottawa's Ray Emery, Florida's Anthony Stewart and Jason Doig (in Vancouver's minor league system) could trace their roots to Jamaica.
 ''It's weird,'' Weekes said. ''Pretty much all of us that I mentioned, all of our grandparents moved to Canada, and I think every one of us was born there. With us being born there, we were Canadian kids and we pretty much followed all the kids, in terms of everybody wanted to play in the N.H.L., even though our parents, at the time, didn't really know much about it.''

HEADLINE: To Speak the Unspeakable, Try Alphabet Soap

In developing its dramatic series celebrating lesbian friendships and lifestyles, Showtime chose the perfect title: ''The L Word.'' Can viewers handle a show with ''lesbian'' in the title? Or is the network winking at those who can?
 Either way, Showtime used an increasingly popular construction. Well beyond the F-word we all grew up forbidden to utter, every letter of the alphabet now seems up for grabs to euphemize something unspeakable. Examples of all 26 can be found in the conventional press from the last 12 months. ALAN SCHWARZ

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid Chief Pledges Reforms

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush's signature foreign aid program was created to transform the economies of some of the world's poorest countries, but as John J. Danilovich, a businessman and former ambassador, took over its leadership this week, his first challenge is to change its reputation for moving at the pace of an ox cart. 
 The Millennium Challenge Corporation has spent only 2 percent of the $2.5 billion appropriated in its first two years and has signed accords with only five countries for less than half the total. Republican leaders in Congress recently halved the president's request for $3 billion next year.
Mr. Danilovich said the 21-month-old corporation had had the growing pains of an ambitious start-up, but he promised to speed its work by setting deadlines for proposals from poor countries and offering guidance.
 Unlike traditional programs that help countries in crisis or those that are strategically important, the goal of the corporation is to give grants on merit only to well-governed poor countries for projects that create economic growth and reduce poverty.
 The agency's prospects depend on whether Mr. Danilovich, a longtime Bush friend and supporter, can deliver results and persuade Republicans in Congress, lavish in their praise for the idea behind the program, to be equally generous with taxpayer dollars in coming years.
 ''There's a certain degree of disillusionment and disenchantment with how things stand today, but there's still a great love of the concept,'' Mr. Danilovich said Wednesday.
 He also must show development specialists and advocates that he can do the job. He acknowledges that he has no experience with poverty issues in Africa and has not dealt directly with development aid.
 He spent about 20 years in the maritime industry, based in London, and organized American voters living there in support of Mr. Bush and his father. Mr. Danilovich and his family contributed $21,425 to Republican candidates and committees from 1999 until he became ambassador to Costa Rica in 2001, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
 As ambassador to Costa Rica and then to Brazil, he was known as capable and well connected.

HEADLINE: How to Sell a Movie (or Fail) in Four Hours 

BYLINE: By ADAM LEIPZIG. 
Adam Leipzig is president of National Geographic Feature Films.

 BODY:
IF you think life is moving too fast -- hyped up with BlackBerries, blogs, podcasts and instant messages -- imagine what it is like to run a movie studio these days.
 It's bad enough that a movie's box-office gross revenues will decline about 50 percent each week and that the time between a film's release in the theater and its debut in the home-video market is shrinking rapidly. (That window is less than four months now, down from six months just a year ago; some industry leaders predict it will soon shrink to nothing.) Even more vexing, success or failure in theaters, often a break-even proposition at best, will be determined with near-certainty by early afternoon of the opening Friday -- and then by the turnout at a few bellwether theaters like Loews Lincoln Square and AMC Empire 25 in Manhattan.
There, if the ushers are napping, clandestine video-camera operators will also lift a shaky copy of the film at those same early showings and send it to disc factories nearby. By Saturday morning, vendors will be selling pirated DVD's on the A train, alongside cheap candy and batteries, even as a digital version is zipped off via the Internet to brethren who operate bigger factories in Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe. 
 But never mind all of that. Things get really scary when the studio chief puts his or her movie, often years in the making, on the legitimate home-video market -- and becomes a hero or a goat in a fraction of a day.
 The DVD release of a film is all-important because it is truly profitable, and studios have thus far been largely successful in keeping these profits to themselves. A typical studio movie costs nearly $100 million: an average of $63.6 million to make and $34.4 million to market. Theater exhibitors -- Regal, AMC, Loews, and the like -- generally keep 50 percent of their box-office sales, which means that a movie must sell nearly $200 million worth of tickets worldwide to return $100 million to the studio and thus break even in its theatrical release.
 Since few movies earn that much at the box office, the studios have increasingly relied on the home-video market, where the equation is much more in their favor, to help recover losses and make a profit. For example, a DVD costs about $2 to manufacture and $2 to market. It is then sold wholesale to retailers at $16 a unit, amounting to a $12 profit. Since manufacturers' suggested retail prices are usually $20 to $30 a DVD (typically discounted by 20 percent), a DVD can return tens of millions of dollars in profit to the studio.
 Once again, though, time is the enemy.
 Let's look at the week ahead. DVD's are traditionally released on Tuesdays, so this week you might be the head of Universal worrying about ''The Skeleton Key'' or the president of home video at Sony Pictures, concerned about ''Stealth.''
 Studios service about 30,000 retail outlets in America (roughly the same as the number of movie screens). You have already planned your strategy to get the right number of DVD's to each location, and to spend the right amount of marketing money to attract consumers.
 More than a third of all DVD's (and more than 50 percent of some titles) are sold at Wal-Mart stores, so you focus a lot there. Part of the genius of Wal-Mart's distribution system is its ability to keep track of every detail; Wal-Mart computers know exactly where every individual unit is, in which store, at any given time. This lets the chain maintain inventory at optimum levels -- neither too much on hand, nor too little.
 In today's world of computerized supply chains, the whole process of releasing a movie on DVD has become one in which success can be measured nearly instantly. At 8 a.m. Tuesday, you arrive in the Southern California office of Universal or Sony. Already, Wal-Mart stores in the East have been open for four hours; based on the number of sales in that short time frame, their computer programs will calculate projections, accurate to within 5 percent, of how many total units of ''The Skeleton Key'' or ''Stealth'' will be sold in the first week, the first month, the first six months.
 If your movie is performing below expectations, by the time you arrive at work Tuesday morning, already the unsold units are being loaded onto trucks to be returned. Something like this happened with DreamWorks Animation's ''Shrek 2.'' The movie was a hit by any measure, but last May, when DreamWorks reported that it had sold fewer DVD's than it anticipated, its stock tumbled 17 percent over two days.
 But, if your movie does better than expected, you still get no rest: Instead, you must immediately begin production of more units -- studios can manufacture up to half a million a day -- so retailers will have fresh stock by the weekend.
 Working backward a bit, the equation now comes down to the following: The movie business turns on DVD sales. Strong DVD sales are generally propelled by strong theatrical box office. And what propels theatrical box office? 
 In most cases, nearly half of a movie's total audience turns out in the first week of release, which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience. In other words, many people go to a movie without any real information about it -- without even reading a review. Or, put most cynically: Most of the time, there is no relationship between how good a film is, and how many people turn out to see it.
 So what makes people go to a movie? Generally, it is awareness -- or now, in Hollywood parlance, ''pre-awareness.'' Since studios cannot spend enough on advertising to buy awareness (there is so much advertising noise in the marketplace these days), there is a tendency to make movies with familiar titles, characters and stories: ''The Dukes of Hazzard,'' ''Spider-Man,'' ''War of the Worlds,'' ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'' In the past decade, most box-office revenue has come from pre-aware titles, which includes sequels (''X-Men 3,'' set for a May 2006 release) and remakes ( ''King Kong,'' Dec. 14).
 When word of mouth does happen, it moves with lightning speed: teenagers will send a text message to friends during the first show on Friday about whether a film is good or bad. While it might not be true -- yet -- that most people decide on the Thursday before a movie opens if they will see it in a theater or buy it on DVD, certainly 24 hours after a film's theatrical opening most of the audience has in effect made that decision.
 DVD's are a maturing industry, and -- though sales have slowed over all -- still an industry driven by quick and directed purchases. If a consumer wants to own a movie, he or she will probably buy it as soon as it is released. Movies are just entertainment commodities, after all, and instant commoditization feeds instant gratification; if the consumer's need isn't gratified immediately, the need wanes.
 What does this all mean? Other than the fact that the movie business is riskier than high-stakes Texas Hold 'Em, it means that the economics of the industry are being propelled by sweeping technological changes. Among them are digital projection (which allows films to be broadcast to theaters from secure servers, even possibly allowing different versions to be shown in different communities); shrinking distribution windows in which more films will open simultaneously in theaters, on home video and on cable television (on Jan. 27, the Steven Soderbergh film ''Bubble'' will be released at the same time in theaters, on cable television and DVD); and new forms of delivery (soon satellite radio services will be able to transmit video to cars). But the underlying business model of the motion-picture industry has not yet adjusted to the momentum or velocity of change.
 Until it catches up -- if it ever does -- we can expect to see more instant hits and instant failures, more Hollywood tales of overnight heroes and goats.

HEADLINE: Watching, Again, for the Katrina Effect

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ENERGY prices have retreated, and there has been no need lately to stay glued to the Weather Channel, but investors may discover this week that normality is not as comfortable as they had hoped. 
 Economists and traders will be poring over inflation reports for evidence of a lingering impact from higher energy prices or the summer hurricanes. But they may find more than they are prepared for, warned Anthony Karydakis, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
''There is a heightened sensitivity to inflation trends in the post-Katrina world,'' he said. ''All eyes will be focusing on the number, not just for October but for the coming months, to see if there is a pass-through effect from higher fuel prices.''
 That ''number'' is the change in the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy costs. It is to be released on Wednesday. Economists polled by Bloomberg News estimate an increase of 0.2 percent; in the previous six months, the core C.P.I. was unchanged in one month and rose by just 0.1 percent in each of the other five. 
 ''For the past few months, core C.P.I. has been surprisingly well behaved,'' Mr. Karydakis said. ''You would be very hard-pressed to find such a long stretch of benign numbers.''
 The forecast for the unadjusted C.P.I. is for no gain, after a 1.2 percent increase in September. Producer prices, to be reported Tuesday, are also predicted to show no gain for last month, versus a climb of 1.9 percent in September. If food and energy are excluded, a 0.2 percent increase is expected, versus 0.3 percent in September. 
 A core C.P.I. that exceeds forecasts could unsettle the bond market, Mr. Karydakis said. ''It doesn't mean the end of the world,'' he said. ''Nonetheless, the emotional nature of the bond market makes it very vulnerable to an outsized C.P.I. number because it confirms the market's worst fears.'' Mr. Karydakis says he is anticipating ''nothing particularly wacky'' in the report, but he predicted an increase as high as 0.4 percent. That could send bonds sharply lower, providing a buying opportunity, he said.
 But he advised investors not to jump the gun, even if bonds fall ahead of the report. ''The environment in the bond market is not particularly calm right now,'' Mr. Karydakis said. ''No one wants to catch a falling knife here. People will be hesitant to step in ahead of the number and try to be heroes.''

DATA WATCH -- Two indicators of the state of the nation's factories are due on Thursday. Industrial production is predicted to have risen by 1 percent last month, after falling 1.5 percent in September. Capacity utilization for October is forecast at 79.6 percent, versus 79 percent the previous month.

FLAT TAX REVOLUTION
 Using a Postcard to Abolish the IRS.
 By Steve Forbes.
 Illustrated. 216 pp. Regnery Publishing. $24.95.
Almost everyone agrees that our tax system could be a lot better -- simpler, fairer and less of a drag on the economy. However, opinions about how to fix it vary widely. Earlier this month, a bipartisan reform panel created by President Bush presented two reform options that straddle the standard liberal and conservative positions. While the headlines focused on the reduction or elimination of popular breaks like the mortgage interest deduction, the report also suggested fundamental changes in how business and capital income are to be taxed.
 These two new books, both coming from the right, suggest that merely reforming the current system is too timid. The correct policy medicine, the authors say, is to junk the income tax entirely and replace it with a consumption tax with a single tax rate for all Americans. 
 In ''The FairTax Book,'' the syndicated radio host Neal Boortz and Representative John Linder, Republican of Georgia, claim that replacing all federal taxes -- income, payroll and estate taxes -- with a national sales tax would increase the average household's purchasing power by about 20 percent, end the need for the I.R.S. and turn April 15 into just another spring day. ''Once the FairTax takes effect,'' they declare, ''you'll be receiving 100 percent of every paycheck, with no withholding of federal income taxes, Social Security taxes or Medicare taxes -- and you'll be paying just about the same price for T-shirts and other consumer goods and services that you were paying before the FairTax.'' 
 For a book that claims in its introduction to be ''about honesty,'' this statement falls far short. No reputable economist of any political stripe would support it. The honest truth is that replacing the current tax system with any system that raises the same amount of revenue (as Boortz and Linder claim their plan does) may make us better off, but only by redirecting our resources away from dealing with complex filing requirements and improving our incentives to work, save and innovate -- not by creating the kind of free-lunch miracle suggested here. 
 As for ''saying goodbye'' to the I.R.S., the authors' plan does so only by passing the responsibility for tax collection to the states. And what a responsibility it would be. In order to fully replace all federal taxes, the sales tax would probably have to be at least 40 percent -- possibly even more than twice the 23 percent rate the authors claim, and certainly far higher than anything ever levied by any country. The enforcement problems would be different than those the I.R.S. now faces, but they would not necessarily be smaller. Even at an average rate of around 5 percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer. Apparently the authors have not talked much to administrators who have to deal with, among other things, ineligible people declaring themselves to be businesses to qualify for the business exemption. 
 Oh, yes, Boortz and Linder's claim that their plan would make April 15 another ordinary day is true, because no individuals -- just retail businesses -- would have to file tax returns. Instead, every day is tax day as people pay their taxes on every trip to the grocery store, the car dealer or even the doctor, since the FairTax base extends to services that nearly all states exempt. 
 There's one more problem. Moving to a national sales tax would drastically shift the tax burden away from high-income families and toward low-income families. To remedy this, under the FairTax plan the government would send each taxpayer a monthly ''prebate'' based on family size, which would amount to $492 per month for a married couple with two children. But Boortz and Linder offer few details about the costs and complications of this vast system of transfers. 
 Steve Forbes is also pushing a tax plan, one he claims would ''free America'' from ''the tyranny of the federal tax code.'' At first glance, his ''flat tax'' -- which he has been pushing at least since his unsuccessful 1996 presidential campaign -- looks like the current income tax, in that both businesses and individuals would file an annual return. But there are some big differences. Under the flat tax, there would be no deduction for mortgage interest, state and local taxes or charitable contributions. A 17 percent rate would apply to all taxable income, whether the taxpayer is Bill Gates, Steve Forbes or the mechanic who fixes their cars. Investment income would not be taxed at all under the individual tax, which by itself benefits predominantly higher-income taxpayers. The flat tax would indeed represent a significant simplification over the current system. (On the book's cover, Forbes is shown brandishing a postcard printed with ''The Steve Forbes Flat Tax Form'' -- though, to be fair, the current 1040EZ would fit on the same card.) And cleaning up the tax base would, on balance, allow the economy to operate more efficiently and reduce the extent to which one's tax burden depended on arguably irrelevant factors such as whether one rented or owned a home. These benefits, however, have nothing to do with having a single tax rate. In fact, one of the architects of the flat tax, Robert E. Hall of Stanford University, now favors a plan, known as the X-Tax, that would apply a graduated rate structure to this simplified tax base. 
 Aspects of the flat tax deserve serious consideration. Unfortunately, Forbes's book does not provide it. Instead, like ''The FairTax Book,'' it promises a free lunch. ''Everyone'' gets a tax cut under his plan. To guarantee that sound-bite feature, he would give people the choice of computing taxes under the flat tax or staying with the old tax system. That stunning concession guarantees that the nine million words of the current tax code and regulations would not go away after all but would be expanded by hundreds of thousands of new words laying out the flat tax rules and, inevitably, the new rules governing the consequences of going back and forth between the two systems. And then there's the hundreds of billions of dollars that Forbes's plan would add to the deficit. Forbes says that his plan will stimulate the economy so much that the apparent revenue shortfall doesn't materialize. If only this were true. Serious analyses suggest that a flat tax would be good for the economy, but would not produce the economic nirvana needed to close the huge revenue gap. 
 Tax reform deserves objective analysis of the sort these books do not provide. Fortunately, the president's tax reform panel has done a much better job. They considered the retail sales tax, but dismissed it. Both the proposals they outline simplify the tax base, though they retain a reduced mortgage interest break (in the form of a flat credit rather than an itemized deduction, which reduces the tilting of the benefits toward wealthier taxpayers). Both retain a graduated personal rate structure and try to maintain the current distribution of the tax burden. As the criticism following the panel report reminds us, truly revenue-neutral tax reform creates winners and losers, and the losers cry louder than the winners sing. To be sure, the Bush administration's tax cuts have in no way prepared Americans for fiscal sacrifice.
 Contemplation of radical tax alternatives is exhilarating, and could help to avoid the kind of loophole-to-loophole combat that tax war veterans recall from 1986, the last time we made wholesale changes in the system. But much progress toward these goals -- including eliminating the need for most Americans to file tax returns -- can be made within the basic framework of the current system.
 These books, to use the language on the jacket of ''Flat Tax Revolution,'' are calls to join a crusade. We'd be better off just starting a conversation.

HEADLINE: Medal Fatigue

BYLINE: By A. O. Scott. 
A. O. Scott is a film critic for The Times.

 BODY:
I AM proud -- but also deeply humbled -- to deliver this unofficial and unsolicited reminder that next Wednesday, Nov. 16, the National Book Awards will be distributed in New York City. (I know! I can hardly wait, either.) These awards will, as always, add incomparable and well-deserved luster to the reputations of the lucky -- that is to say, the absolutely worthy and painstakingly chosen -- winners, and also reveal the vibrancy and diversity of American literary endeavor in all its forms. (All four of its forms, that is, since that is how many categories the N.B.A. has these days. Sometimes there have been as many as 27, sometimes as few as two. But now there are four: fiction, nonfiction, ''young people's literature'' and poetry.) 
Or, to put it another way, the prizes, transparently trivial, implicitly corrupt and utterly detached from any meaningful notion of literary value, will be greeted with cynicism, derision and, if we're lucky, a burst of controversy. It will escape no one's attention -- not even the winners' -- that the very idea of handing out medals and cash for aesthetic and intellectual achievement is absurd, if not obscene. Furthermore, the selections will inevitably reflect the rottenness of the literary status quo, which is either hopelessly stodgy and out of touch, or else distracted by modish extraliterary considerations -- hobbled, that is, either by conservative complacency or by political correctness. As if that weren't bad enough, the N.B.A.'s will force upon the public the startling revelation that book publishing is a commercial enterprise. Unless of course they uphold the idealistic principle that it isn't. Anyway, the winners will be the obvious choices, authors who have already won plenty of prizes and acclaim, in which case what's the point? (Does John Ashbery really need another medal to accompany the N.B.A., the Pulitzer and the National Book Critics Circle Award he won for ''Self-Portrait in a Convex-Mirror''?) Either that, or the winners will be people nobody outside a tiny elite has ever heard of (Vern Rutsala? Rene Steinke?), in which case . . . well, see above. 
 No offense to Rutsala, Steinke and Ashbery, by the way, who may for all I know someday make up the jury judging a prize for which I might be eligible (and for which I'd like, in advance, to thank my parents, my wife and His Holiness the Dalai Lama). My point, really, is that the National Book Awards, like every other prize in the crowded field of global cultural honormongering, rest upon some intrinsic paradoxes. Prizes are both eagerly sought after and reflexively disdained. They are covered in the media with breathless awe and, at the same time, with savage mockery. They affirm the disinterested autonomy of artistic labor even as they undermine it by placing a cash value on its products. The winners chosen are either too obvious or too obscure, too safe or too scandalous. There are more awards every year, but their proliferation, rather than diluting their importance, only seems to increase it. 
 These contradictions are the subject of ''The Economy of Prestige: Prizes, Awards, and the Circulation of Cultural Value'' (Harvard University Press, $29.95), a new book by James F. English. ''Why has no historian attempted a history of the modern cultural prize?'' English wonders, and by the end of his closely argued, unfailingly astute book, it does not seem like a silly question at all. Not that English, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania department that bears his name, has written such a history. He has some interesting, occasionally esoteric, stories to tell: about the undistinguished birth and tantrum-filled childhood of the Booker Prize; about how the music awards system in apartheid-era South Africa influenced the career of Ladysmith Black Mambazo; about the origin and development of the Nobel-giving Swedish Academy. But this is not a book either for collectors of gossip or devotees of institutional lore. While he does mention the comic Irwin Corey's appearance, as ''Professor Irwin Corey,'' at the 1974 National Book Awards dinner -- to deliver a memorably nonsensical acceptance speech on behalf of the fiction winner (and no-surprise no-show) Thomas Pynchon -- English forgoes the opportunity to retell the saga of Sacheen Littlefeather, who pulled a similar stunt on behalf of Marlon Brando at the Oscar ceremony a year earlier. 
 For that kind of scuttlebutt, you can turn to dishers like Damien Bona or Tom O'Neil, who serve as tireless rhapsodes and statisticians of the showbiz awards biz. By contrast English, according to his online curriculum vitae a one-time co-winner of Penn's Mortar Board Alumni Association Outstanding Teacher Award, is relentlessly analytical. He takes his methodological cues from the late French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, whose anatomies of contemporary life are at once loftily abstract and grittily detailed. As his book's title suggests, English is especially interested in the manufacture and distribution of prestige, a quality that turns out to be both valuable and elusive, and one whose main form of currency, he argues, is the prize. 
 It will immediately be noted that no one really takes prizes seriously. It will, indeed, be noted most frequently and publicly by those involved with the prizes themselves. Winners and judges deprecate the idea of competition; pundits find ideological fault with the selections; scandals erupt. And the peanut gallery is always full of commentators taking easy potshots at the number of prizes, the stupidity of most of them, the hype that attends them and so on. (Really, is there a lower form of cultural discourse? I certainly hope not.) 
 But the brilliant, irrefutable crux of English's argument is that, rather than tarnishing the luster of the cultural prize, such debunkery actually -- oh, no! -- constitutes a primary source of the prize's legitimacy and power. ''It is difficult to find anyone of any stature,'' he writes, ''who speaks with unalloyed respect for prizes, and still more difficult to find books or articles (other than those underwritten by the prize sponsors themselves) that do not strike the familiar chords of amused indifference, jocular condescension or outright disgust.'' But this familiar disrespect is what Bourdieu would call a ''strategy of condescension,'' which, in English's account, ''enables one to enjoy both the rewards of the game and the rewards due to those who are seen as standing above the game.''
 In other words, prizes flourish to the extent that they are not taken seriously, but this does not mean they are all a big joke. Rather, they exist in a limbo of anxiety and uncertainty about the status of artistic and intellectual endeavor in a global consumer economy. We assume -- we know -- that art and thought have value, but we lack agreed-upon means to measure that value, so we come up with tools that are transparently and grandly inadequate to the task. Prestige, that is, functions as a poor substitute for even less tangible attributes; it is not necessarily the same as excellence, but it is not necessarily not the same. It is not ratified by commercial success, except on those occasions when it is. And prizes sometimes do go to the best candidates, which are sometimes (and sometimes not) also the most popular. 
 My only prediction for the coming N.B.A.'s is the same one I offer each year when, in my day job, I am asked about the Oscars. I have, at the moment, no idea who will win, and a year from now I will not be able to remember who won. I would hope, though, that in the near future English's book wins some prize for which it is eligible. This shouldn't be hard, given that there are now, he writes, around a hundred prizes for every thousand books published in the United States. (If he had made a movie, his chances would be even better, since, as he writes, ''by the end of the 20th century, the number of film awards distributed each year exceeded the number of full-length films being produced.'') A prize for the best book about prizes! In the tradition of Irwin Corey and Sacheen Littlefeather, English should send a proxy to collect his medal: the obvious choice would be Cosmo Kramer, the fictional author of a prestigious coffeetable book about coffee tables.

HEADLINE: Want to Make Millions? First, Get the Loan

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
NELL MERLINO winced when the last census showed that women owned nearly half of the nation's privately held businesses -- but that four times as many men as women owned companies that raked in more than $1 million a year. 
 She laughs at the notion that men are just better at business. As she sees it, men have been socialized to be more aggressive in going after clients, and to be more comfortable asking family members for seed money.
''Women's financial independence is the missing piece in the evolution of equal rights,'' she said. 
 So Ms. Merlino, 52 -- probably best known for dreaming up Take Our Daughters to Work Day -- has made it a personal cause to narrow the gap. She and Susan Sobbott, the president of OPEN, the division of American Express that serves small businesses, have just formed Make Mine a $Million Business -- complete with a cutesy use of the dollar sign -- to funnel money and mentoring to women whose businesses seem to have a viable shot at the $1 million milestone. 
 It sounds like a lowball goal -- after all, a $1 million blackmail demand was a big laugh line in the first ''Austin Powers'' movie. But Ms. Merlino says that it is more than a psychological magic number.
 ''It's the point at which banks are more likely to lend you the money you need to grow even more,'' she says. 
 Even as a child, Ms. Merlino balked when adults treated girls with condescension. ''In kindergarten, my report card said I was bossy,'' she recalled. ''That's what they always say about a girl who has leadership qualities.''
 The second of five children, Ms. Merlino grew up in Trenton. Her father was a lawyer and sometime politician, and her mother juggled homemaking, painting and teaching art. ''They were Democrats and political activists,'' she said. ''I had one uncle who was a Republican businessman, but we didn't talk about him much.''
 Ms. Merlino remembers herself as a young rebel. As a second grader, she horrified the nuns in her Catholic school by challenging the idea of doing good to please God. ''I thought helping others should be reason enough,'' she said. Neither high school nor college mellowed her. At Antioch, where she majored in political economy and labor relations, she hung out with ''Maoists, Black Panthers, lots of Vietnam protesters,'' she said. Business was the furthest thing from her mind. ''I wanted to be an activist labor lawyer,'' she said. 
 That idea was quickly derailed when she was studying for the law school admissions tests. ''I realized I did not want to know what the rules were, or how to play by them,'' she said. So she became a union organizer, with an emphasis on asking underpaid women in the clothing and health care fields to unite. ''Some 85 percent of hospital workers were women, but guys were running the show,'' she said. ''It was astounding how the women still thought their bosses would take care of them.'' Ms. Merlino worked in various state jobs in New Jersey, trying to better the lot of the mentally ill and of abused children and women. Then, in 1980, ''Reagan got elected and a lot of the programs I worked for got bounced,'' Ms. Merlino said. She moved to Manhattan, and spent about five years at various jobs and on the unemployment line. Then, in 1988, she was an advance person for the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. ''I had an awful time persuading the people that I, a woman, was in charge,'' she recalled. ''I figured, 'If I've got to fight so hard, I might as well make money at it.' ''
 So, at 35, Ms. Merlino set herself up in public relations. Most of her clients were environmentalists, feminists, gay rights organizations and other groups she had come to know in her activist days. In 1993, she said, the Ms. Foundation hired her to run a campaign to ''smash patriarchy.'' She came up with Take Our Daughters to Work Day. 
 A year later, she married Gary Conger, a printing services consultant, whom she met on a blind date in 1992. Through it all, Ms. Merlino kept running into women who were depending on men. ''I kept wondering, Why can't women be more financially independent?'' she said, noting that she and her husband do not commingle finances. One answer, she concluded, is that the process of getting business loans was skewed in favor of men. So, in 1999, she started Count Me In, a nonprofit group that makes small loans to women who are entrepreneurs. 
 ''Banks would ask how long you've been in business,'' she said. ''We'd ask, 'How long have you made your product or delivered your services?' '' For example, Count Me In readily lent money to caterers who were successfully selling cookies from their kitchens, but had not incorporated, and were thus ''flying below bank credit radar.'' 
 NOT surprisingly, Ms. Merlino has a lot of advice for starting a business. And during a recent lunch at Restaurant 44 in Manhattan, she proffered the following tips -- some aimed at women, others at anyone with entrepreneurial aspirations: 
 Don't be afraid to impose on people's time. ''People are really flattered when asked to mentor new businesses,'' she said. Talk to people whose businesses have failed, too. They can warn you of potential pitfalls and tell you how to exit a business gracefully before it drains you emotionally and financially. 
 Realize that your name may not be your best asset. Sure, Donald Trump and Tom Carvel did well by slapping their names on the door -- but Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway did all right, too. And, Ms. Merlino said, ''it is easier to attract talent to a more corporate-sounding entity.'' If you sell the company, and the buyer insists on the rights to the name, you can't capitalize on your own reputation if you want to start another business. 
 Don't think you have to look prosperous from the get-go. Loan officers are as impressed with good numbers in a plain black binder as they are with flashy PowerPoint presentations. And money spent on market research and product development will woo more customers than money spent on advertising and fancy furniture. ''It's silly to go into debt to pretend that you already are what you are aspiring to be,'' she said. 
 Check yourself out with the credit agencies at least twice a year. ''A meeting with your banker is not the time to discover that there is some old problem,'' she said. 
 Apply for a loan, even if you have enough personal credit to get by. The obvious reason is to ensure that your personal credit rating is not trashed if your business fails. But there is also real value, she said, ''in being forced to lay out your plans for the money to a professional.'' 
 Don't go to more than one lender at a time. Banks can easily find out how many applications you have made. Say you've asked 10 banks for $1 million each. ''Lenders may accept that you could easily pay back $1 million,'' she said, ''but they'll balk if there's a chance you'll be on the hook for $10 million.'' 
 Steer clear of do-it-yourself planning and accounting software packages. Yes, accountants and planners are more expensive. But they are worth it. ''They will catch it right away if you inadvertently enter a wrong number,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''With software, the error will go on in perpetuity.'' If you must use software, she said, at least hire a professional to double-check your entries. 
 Don't think that itemization is just for tax returns. The clearer you are about why you need money, the more likely you are to get a loan. ''If you need $1 million for a marketing campaign, $1 million for new technology and $1 million to build inventory, then say so,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''It's tempting to just ask for $3 million, but it's a lot less effective.''

HEADLINE: Not Invented Here

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: Baltimore 

 BODY:
WHEN James E. West was 8 years old, he propped himself on his bed's brass footboard one afternoon and stretched to plug the cord of a radio he had repaired into a ceiling outlet. It was one of his first experiments. Mr. West's hand sealed to the light socket as 120 volts of electricity shimmied through his body, freezing him in place until his brother knocked him from the footboard and onto the floor. 
 Like more storied inventors who preceded him, he was quickly hooked on the juice -- even as he lay shivering from that first encounter. ''I became fascinated by electricity after that, just completely fascinated,'' recalled Mr. West, now 74 and an award-winning research professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''I needed to learn everything I could about it.''
Over the past several decades, he has secured 50 domestic and more than 200 foreign patents on inventions relating to his pioneering explorations of electrically charged materials and recording devices. According to the National Inventors Hall of Fame, an organization in Akron, Ohio, that counts Mr. West among its inductees, about 90 percent of all microphones used today in devices like cellphones, acoustic equipment and toys derive from electronic transducers that he helped to develop in the early 1960's. 
 Inventors have always held a special place in American history and business lore, embodying innovation and economic progress in a country that has long prized individual creativity and the power of great ideas. In recent decades, tinkerers and researchers have given society microchips, personal computers, the Internet, balloon catheters, bar codes, fiber optics, e-mail systems, hearing aids, air bags and automated teller machines, among a bevy of other devices.
 Mr. West stands firmly in this tradition -- a tradition that he said may soon be upended. He fears that corporate and public nurturing of inventors and scientific research is faltering and that America will pay a serious economic and intellectual penalty for this lapse.
 A larger pool of Mr. West's colleagues echoes his concerns. ''The scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength,'' the National Academy of Sciences observed in a report released last month. ''Although many people assume that the United States will always be a world leader in science and technology, this may not continue to be the case inasmuch as great minds and ideas exist throughout the world. We fear the abruptness with which a lead in science and technology can be lost -- and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if indeed it can be regained at all.''
 A COMMITTEE of leading scientists, corporate executives and educators oversaw the drafting of the report, entitled ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future.'' To spur American innovation, it recommends enhanced math and science education in grade school and high school, a more hospitable environment for scientific research and training at the college and graduate levels, an increase in federal funds for basic scientific research and a mix of tax incentives and other measures to foster high-paying jobs in groundbreaking industries. The report cites China and India among a number of economically promising countries that may be poised to usurp America's leadership in innovation and job growth.
 ''For the first time in generations, the nation's children could face poorer prospects than their parents and grandparents did,'' the report said. ''We owe our current prosperity, security and good health to the investments of past generations, and we are obliged to renew those commitments.''
 The Industrial Research Institute, an organization in Arlington, Va., that represents some of the nation's largest corporations, is also concerned that the academic and financial support for scientific innovation is lagging in the United States. The group's most recent data indicate that from 1986 to 2001, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan all awarded more doctoral degrees in science and engineering than did the United States. Between 1991 and 2003, research and development spending in America trailed that of China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan -- in China's case by billions of dollars.
 Mr. West's personal journey has involved overcoming school segregation and racism, a reading disability and the downsizing of Bell Labs, the legendary New Jersey research center where he once worked, and he fantasizes about a day when children hold inventors and scientists in higher esteem than hip-hop stars and professional athletes. 
 ''We need to bring the view back in this country that we're willing to make investments for the future because everything that's in the cellphone and the iPod today was known 20 years ago,'' he said. ''I think scientists and inventors are a very peculiar breed in that we're not in it for the money -- we're in it for the knowledge.''
 IT all begins with a tingle of curiosity. ''If I had a screwdriver and a pair of pliers, anything that could be opened was in danger,'' Mr. West recalled of his childhood. ''I had this need to know what was inside.''
 That need links Mr. West to a rich tradition in American life and civilization. Benjamin Franklin, his kite lofted into the sky to coax electricity from the clouds, is the totemic American inventor whose financial acumen gave him time to ponder and then spout a series of inventions that included a stove, catheter, glass harmonica, bifocals and, of course, the lightning rod -- which he declined to patent so it would be freely available to the public. 
 No less a figure than Abraham Lincoln regarded the patent system, and the protections it offered for what he called the ''fire of genius,'' as one of history's signature achievements. Shortly after President Lincoln's death, Thomas Alva Edison filed a patent for his first invention, an electric vote recorder. Edison became widely heralded not only as the creator of a longer-lasting light bulb and the phonograph but also as the inventor of the invention factory.
 When the conglomerate that eventually became General Electric began buying out Mr. Edison's operations in the 1890's, it represented the beginning of the corporate absorption of the inventive act. ''Edison marks the end of the individual inventor and the precorporate phase of invention,'' said Randall E. Stross, a contributor to The New York Times who is also working on an Edison biography titled ''The Wizard,'' which Crown Publishing plans to release in 2007.
 In 1932, a year after Edison died, corporations secured more patents than individuals for the first time, and a year later the Census Bureau eliminated ''inventor'' as a job class, according to Technology Review, a trade publication. During the golden era of corporate research and development that followed Edison's death, G.E., DuPont, AT&T and eventually Lockheed, Eli Lilly, Intel and other corporate giants came to dominate innovation. And as that happened, some tensions arose between corporations and independent inventors and researchers. 
 While tipping their hats to the scores of breakthroughs that have emerged from corporate labs, inventors also say they are concerned that bottom-line pressures at many companies may cause pure research to be eclipsed by innovation tied to rapid commercialization -- leading to routine refinements of existing products rather than to breathtaking advances.
 A tug of war has emerged between individual inventors and corporations over proposed legislative changes in patent laws, with the inventors arguing that possible revisions would benefit the business giants. Corporations have argued that the system is equitable but flawed. Dean Kamen, an inventor whose creations include the wearable insulin pump and the Segway transporter, recently testified before Congress, calling for changes in the patent system that also preserve protections for individual inventors.
 Despite those tussles, Mr. Stross says he believes that recent technological advancements have helped to move innovation out of the corporate sphere and to ''give the lone inventor access to inexpensive tools and resources to once again be master of one's own lab.''
 Robert S. Langer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a biotechnology pioneer, says that he shares the concerns raised in the National Academy of Sciences report but that he remains confident about the country's prospects. ''While I think we can always do better, I am optimistic about the spirit of innovation in this country,'' he said. ''I think we hold a lead, but no lead is unassailable.'' 
 For Mr. West, whose career has spanned stretches in creative havens like Bell Labs, inventing has meant brainstorming sessions with fellow tinkerers and long hours walking the corridors of his own mind. ''I spend a great deal of the hours that I'm awake within myself,'' he said. ''You never want to stop doing it, especially when it's a pleasure. It's vital to my existence and I couldn't live if I wasn't an inventor.''
 Ilene Busch-Vishniac, a Johns Hopkins professor and inventor who has collaborated with Mr. West for more than two decades, most recently on acoustical research, called him the quintessential explorer. ''For an inventor to be successful they have to think outside of the box and propose things that are wildly different,'' she said. ''Secondly, you need to be able to figure out how to do the tests that evaluate whether something is plausible. Jim is great at both of those things, but especially at figuring out the tests.'' 
 Mr. West began testing his limits at an early age, defying his family's wishes that he become a dentist and setting his sights on a doctorate in physics. To dissuade him, his father introduced him to other African-American friends with doctorates -- all of whom had failed to land university posts and held blue-collar jobs instead. Still, Mr. West pressed on, coached by a series of mentors, memorizing text and numbers to mask his reading problems, building on his mathematical gifts and eventually enrolling as an undergraduate in physics at Temple University. 
 AFTER a summer internship at Bell Labs, he invented a pair of headphones; enthralled by his lab work, he decided to forgo his physics studies and to stay on at Bell Labs, where he developed microphone technologies and explored a range of interests in acoustics. When Bell Labs became part of Lucent after AT&T reorganized, the scope of its research operations shifted, and Mr. West eventually moved on as well. At Ms. Busch-Vishniac's invitation, he joined Johns Hopkins in 2000.
 Although he walks with a slight limp caused by a series of lower back surgeries, Mr. West looks much younger than his age. Like all inspired inventors whose fertile imaginations make them both researchers and artists, Mr. West also still manages to bring a Zen-like focus to his endeavors. ''If I'm concerned about what an electron does in an amorphous mass then I become an electron,'' he allowed. ''I try to have that picture in my mind and to behave like an electron, looking at the problem in all its dimensions and scales.'' 
 He and Ms. Busch-Vishniac are currently analyzing solutions to noise problems in hospitals, and they are mentoring two local high school students and a Johns Hopkins graduate student who have joined their team as young inventors. The graduate student, Emily Nalven, 22, said she decided to join Mr. West after taking classes with him.
 ''Even on the days he didn't lecture, he came to class, sat in the front row, took notes and spent his time after class answering student questions,'' she said in an e-mail message. ''One day, I asked him something about sound waves and he answered my question, then came back the next day with an even more detailed explanation to ensure that I truly understood.''
 The seeds of future inventions are sown in these kinds of interactions, but the possible erosion of fertile academic and financial soil in America concerns Mr. West and many others in science.
 ''The inventiveness of individuals depends on the context, including sociopolitical, economic, cultural and institutional factors,'' said Merton C. Flemings, a professor emeritus at M.I.T. who holds 28 patents and oversees the Lemelson-M.I.T. Program for inventors. ''We remain one of the most inventive countries in the world. But all the signs suggest that we won't retain that pre-eminence much longer. The future is very bleak, I'm afraid.''
 Mr. Flemings said that private and public capital was not being adequately funneled to the kinds of projects and people that foster invention. The study of science is not valued in enough homes, he observed, and science education in grade school and high school is sorely lacking. 
 But quantitative goals, he said, are not enough. Singapore posts high national scores in mathematics, he said, but does not have a reputation for churning out new inventions. In fact, he added, researchers from Singapore have studied school systems in America to try to glean the source of something ineffable and not really quantifiable: creativity.
 ''In addition to openness, tolerance is essential in an inventive modern society,'' a report sponsored by the Lemelson-M.I.T. Program said last year. ''Creative people, whether artists or inventive engineers, are often nonconformists and rebels. Indeed, invention itself can be perceived as an act of rebellion against the status quo.''
 THOSE who keep an eye on corporate behavior say they think that sober-minded risk taking -- and the support of daring research for research's sake -- also needs to be on the strategic menus of more companies. ''When inventors work independently, the invention itself is seen as an opportunity, whereas in the corporate world accidents are seen as failures,'' said Peter Arnell, a marketing consultant who coaches companies about innovation. ''When people exist outside of the corporate model and have vision and passion, then accidents and getting lost are beautiful things.''
 Nathan Myhrvold, part of Microsoft's early brain trust and the former head of its heavily endowed research arm, founded Intellectual Ventures, a fund that he says spends ''millions of dollars'' annually to support individual inventors in long-term projects. Mr. Myhrvold started his fund about five years ago after he retired from Microsoft; he now backs about 20 inventors in such fields as nanotechnology, optics, computing, biotechnology and medical devices.
 ''As far as we know, we're the only people who are doing this -- which means we're either incredibly smart or incredibly dumb,'' Mr. Myhrvold said. ''There's a network of venture capitalists for start-ups that have created thousands and thousands of businesses, but very little for inventors.''
 Mr. Myhrvold says that most public and academic grants are for investigating well-defined research problems -- and not for backing, as he does, ''an invention before it exists.'' His staff of about 50 people files about 25 patent applications a month on behalf of inventors and his fund. He and his staff also help inventors refine ideas, pay for their time and labor and share ownership stakes in projects with them. 
 ''We all love the goose that lays the golden eggs but somehow we've forgotten about the goose,'' Mr. Myhrvold said. ''This decade I'm hoping will be the decade of the invention.''
 Whether or not a new inventive age is coming in America, Mr. West says he plans to continue doing what he's always done. He and Ms. Busch-Vishniac debate, regularly and vociferously, the merits of their respective ideas. But both say their debates are authentic exchanges of viewpoints, not games of one-upmanship.
 ''You can't have a big ego and be a great inventor,'' Mr. West said. ''You constantly have to be listening and evaluating.''
 Even though he is halfway through his eighth decade, he is pursuing other new projects -- collaborating with a colleague at Georgia Tech, for example, to explore improved methods of teleconferencing. Inventing, he says, is the intellectual bicycle that he rides each day.
 Looking back over the years, Mr. West says he has often gone down the wrong intellectual path. But, he says, that's just how inventors do their thing.
 ''I think I've had more failures than successes, but I don't see the failures as mistakes because I always learned something from those experiences,'' Mr. West said. ''I see them as having not achieved the initial goal, nothing more than that.''

HEADLINE: Why Should the Boss Pay for Your Health Care?

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to health insurance, Americans agree on one thing: someone else should pay for it. 
 This syndrome is neatly illustrated in the confluence of two seemingly disparate developments. First, several large employers, including Wal-Mart, General Motors and the Philadelphia regional transit agency, have been in the news for their struggles with rising health insurance costs. And, second, the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform has put out a list of the costliest tax exemptions or deductions received by Americans. The No. 1 category, by a long shot, was health insurance.
Obviously, this is no coincidence. The nation has made health insurance a tax-exempt form of compensation, so employees and employers will tend to prefer it to cash. The deduction, a form of which is also enjoyed by the self-employed, means that the government picks up a big chunk of health insurance costs. ''The exclusion for employer-provided health care is the largest preference in the tax code, with an estimated 2006 value of roughly $126 billion,'' said the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group. 
 Consider it national health insurance for the affluent. Most of the benefit goes to the prosperous -- 27 percent to families earning more than $100,000 annually. But if you are unemployed or have the kind of low-wage job that doesn't come with coverage, you're out of luck. Your income taxes not only subsidize coverage for others, but they also help make it less affordable for you.
 Big business, which is more likely than small business to provide health benefits, likes this preferred tax treatment, but it is a deduction that only the truly myopic can love. This federal tax subsidy, in the panel's words, ''removes many incentives for cost controls, driving up health care costs for everyone, including those whose employers do not offer the same benefits.'' And it does this in a nation where per capita medical spending already far exceeds that in other industrialized nations (which typically enjoy better health). 
 ''Estimates are imprecise,'' the tax panel says in its report, ''but removing subsidies for employer-provided health insurance could lower private spending on health care by 5 to 20 percent.''
 The president's tax panel lacked the nerve to call for an end to these deductions. Instead, it proposed allowing employers and individuals to buy coverage with pretax dollars, up to the amount of the average annual premium. But this still lets individuals and businesses socialize most of their premiums and still benefits mostly the affluent, for whom tax deductions always have the greatest value. 
 What's needed is a dish of cold turkey. Tax reform offers a golden opportunity to move employers out of the health insurance business. That would solve a big problem for companies like General Motors, which are burdened with huge costs in this area, in contrast to foreign competitors whose workers receive government-paid health benefits. And ending employer coverage should dampen the rapid rate of increase in health care costs.
 About 160 million Americans have employer coverage, so it cannot be eliminated without some other comprehensive system to take its place. But that's all to the good, because then it could take in the self-employed, the unemployed and the uninsured. Suddenly, workers wouldn't be afraid to change jobs or to start businesses or even to move to another state for fear of losing health insurance. Employers would no longer try to think of legal ways to discriminate against poor health risks. Who knows? The added economic efficiency arising from this change might even help cover the expense.
 But isn't this still a case of someone else paying? Not necessarily. Imagine what would happen if everyone received a federal voucher good for a typical plan -- and could keep any savings after buying a cheaper plan that still met basic standards. In that case, we would shop with an eye for value, instead of just giving the boss the bill. The well-to-do, meanwhile, could augment their vouchers with after-tax money. And to counteract the tendency of healthy people to opt out -- while sick people opt in -- coverage would be mandatory. 
 Sure, this will cost something. But so does the current system. In addition to the $126 billion that would be freed by ending the health-coverage tax deduction, there would be some savings in the nearly $150 billion spent every year to comply with and enforce the current income tax system. Tax simplification certainly would reap some of that -- not to mention, every April, untold additional savings on Excedrin.

HEADLINE: Steps to Take Before the Collective Well Runs Dry 

BYLINE: By BARRY REHFELD

 BODY:
BEFORE Doug Pushard, a software company manager, steps into the shower in his home in Austin, Tex., he puts a pail into the tub to catch the cold water that flows through the pipes before it turns hot. After showering, he bathes his garden with the cool gallons he has collected.
 But that's just the proverbial drop in the bucket when it comes to how far Mr. Pushard will go to use water efficiently. He also harvests rain from his roof into two covered 2,500-gallon tanks in the backyard. The water enters through pipes linked to the roof's gutters and exits to the garden's drip-irrigation channels.
His system cost considerable time and money -- $5,000 -- but there are benefits. The grass, plants and trees stay healthy naturally, and Mr. Pushard does not have to tap into the municipal water supply. By not using some 20,000 gallons annually from the city's reservoirs, his water bill has dropped by more than 30 percent, to $70 a month. His savings are likely to grow in coming years, and a bit of Austin's resources will be saved. 
 According to a Government Accountability Office report in 2003, some 36 of 47 states participating in its water survey expected shortages within 10 years; all but one said they expected shortages if they experienced a drought. And since 1996, water bills have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, said Peiffer Brandt, a vice president at Raftelis Financial Consultants, a financial consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C., for water and wastewater utilities. He said he expected costs to keep outpacing inflation.
 In New York City, rates have risen steadily for a decade, said Warren Liebold, a director of conservation at the city's Department of Environmental Protection. The average bill is $571 a year for a single-family home, and Mr. Liebold expects that to go up about 5 percent a year, largely because of infrastructure needs. 
 Even if many Americans are not building backyard reservoir systems, some are at least ''recognizing that water is a precious commodity,'' Mr. Brandt said, ''and they're trying to use less of it, spurred on by the utilities and government.''
 Homeowners are buying new versions of appliances and fixtures that use water more efficiently. Most of these products -- from toilets, faucets and shower heads to clothes washers and dishwashers -- are inside the house, where 70 percent of residential water is used.
 Some water-efficient fixtures cost no more than more wasteful ones. And because some local governments offer rebates for energy-saving appliances and fixtures, many homeowners have further incentives to upgrade.
 Toilets are easily the top water users in a home, at 28 percent of the indoor total. But new high-efficiency toilets use just 1.28 gallons a flush, or about 20 percent less than the 1.6-gallon standard set by Congress in 1992. 
 The most efficient toilets are dual-control models. They have two buttons -- one delivering 0.8 gallons, or three liters, and meant to flush liquid; and the other delivering 1.6 gallons, for solids. Those toilets may average less than a gallon a flush. 
 Roger Peugeot, a plumber in Overland Park, Kan., installs the Caroma dual-control toilet from Australia; it has been sold in the United States only in the last few years. He also has the Caroma in his own home. 
 ''It never clogs,'' he said. ''In fact, I have a customer with five who says he uses the three-liter flush for everything.'' 
 Some American makers of dual-flush toilets include the Kohler Company and Gerber Plumbing Fixtures. The basic dual-flush toilets offered by these companies cost from $200 to $500. 
 When it comes to shower heads, for which the government standard flow rate is 2.5 gallons a minute, the most efficient models can also be among the cheapest. Energy Technology Laboratories sells a model at the low end for $25.95 that uses just 1.5 gallons a minute and delivers much the same feel as the average shower head by charging the water with air. 
 For faucets, Omni Products takes a different approach to efficiency. It offers an adapter, priced at $10, that is screwed into a faucet head. The adapter delivers water as slowly as one gallon a minute in a flow with the look and feel of a solid stream. The trick is that the stream is hollow; its smooth appearance is achieved by combining pairs of minute streams around the adapter's circumference. 
 Clothes washers and dishwashers have no such standards to beat, which may help explain some sharp differences in water efficiency among various models. Two different clothes washers, for example, may receive the federal government's Energy Star label for their efficiency in using electricity, but one may still use five times as much water as the other: 15,000 versus 3,000 gallons annually. 
 ''You can't go wrong choosing water efficiency,'' says Amy Vickers, an engineer and the author of the 1992 standards and of a book, ''Handbook of Water Use and Conservation'' (WaterPlow Press). The less water you use, she noted, the less energy you will use heating it.
 Energy Star washers that are among the best at saving water are made by LG Electronics, Miele and Bosch and are priced at around $1,000. Among dishwashers, some machines from Kenmore, Whirlpool and Asko, at $400 to $700, will clean well and use less water and energy than most of the competition. 
 Homeowners are also buying a variety of new devices -- including pedal valves, sensors and recirculating pumps -- that are intended to save water. 
 Pedal valves, costing $300 to $450, are installed on the floor in front of the sink and enable users to turn faucets on and off with their feet. Peter Gilbert, president of Pedal Valves, a company based in Luling, La., says that one of his devices can pay for itself in three years because of the water it saves. 
 Shari Meyer, a retired operating room technician from Chester, Calif., likes the water savings, but also appreciates the pedal valve's hygienic convenience.
 ''It frees up your hands so you fill up a pot of water or work with food without spreading germs touching the handle,'' she said. 
 Homeowners are also buying faucets with sensors that automatically turn water on and off. These faucets are already common in commercial buildings, and Suzie Williford, vice president for sales at Westheimer Plumbing and Hardware in Houston, says she has been getting more requests from homeowners for them. They can cost about $300. 
 Parents ''want them for children's bathrooms,'' she said, ''so their kids won't leave faucets running brushing their teeth or just not turning them off right away.'' 
 A THIRD device is a recirculating pump, available for around $300 from companies like Metlund, Laing Thermotech and Grundfos. It works by circulating cold water out of the pipes and back into the water heater when the hot water is turned on, without losing cold water down the drain. Water down the drain, though, need not be a waste. Toto, a Japanese company, makes a sleek Rube Goldberg contraption that has a small sink in place of a toilet tank top. The water from hand-washing goes into the tank before it is used as part of the flush. But there is a catch to achieving efficiency by using gray water, as the drainage from the bathroom sink, shower and clothes washer is known: the systems are not very commercial. The Toto model is not sold in the United States.
 Still, enterprising homeowners can achieve similar results themselves. For less than $100, for example, hoses can be hooked up to 55-gallon drums to collect clothes-washer drainage for watering trees, said Art Ludwig of Oasis Design, which designs systems using gray water and sells books about them.
 More ambitious projects are likely to require professional help and more money -- sometimes a lot. An automated system, made by a private contractor, may use all of a home's gray water to fill toilet tanks and to water trees and plants; it will require the skills of plumbers and landscapers to install and can run upward of $10,000. 
 Mr. Ludwig directs anyone interested in a gray-water system to his Web site, oasisdesign.net/greywater, to buy books, but he turns away new homebuilders and retrofitters looking for designs. He's booked solid.

HEADLINE: The Unknown Mao

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was startled to read the conclusion of Nicholas D. Kristof's review of ''Mao: The Unknown Story,'' by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday (Oct. 23): ''Mao's ruthlessness was a catastrophe at the time . . . and yet there's more to the story: Mao also helped lay the groundwork for the rebirth and rise of China after five centuries of slumber.'' 
 I wonder if Kristof feels the same way about Hitler, who also unified Germany in chaotic times, nationalized industries and generated German economic growth. Or perhaps the reason Kristof reserves this note of praise for Mao is because Mao only brutalized his own countrymen?
 Had Mao not been in power, millions of Chinese people would have avoided death, and China would have been a world economic power much, much sooner, maybe even by a half-century.

BYLINE: By Tom Bissell. 
Tom Bissell has reported from Iraq for Harper's magazine. His essay on Solzhenitsyn and war appeared in The Believer.

 BODY:
In the middle of Peter Davis's Vietnam war documentary, ''Hearts and Minds,'' a large, pale, scarily eyebrowless face suddenly takes over the screen. It's the face of Col. George S. Patton III, son of the famous general, as he describes his attendance at a memorial service in Vietnam for some fallen American soldiers. When he gazed upon the faces of the memorial's attendees, Patton says: ''I was just proud. My feeling for America just soared.. . .They looked determined and reverent at the same time. But still'' -- and here Colonel Patton's abrupt, savage smile reveals a mouth packed with draft-horse-size choppers -- ''they're a bloody good bunch of killers.''
It is a moment you have to see to fully appreciate, which is to say it is a moment you have to see to believe. And it is the sort of completely defenseless moment you often see only in documentary films. No Hollywood dramatization could do justice to Patton's cheerful viciousness, and a print journalist would doubtless hoard Patton's words for some skeweringly perfect ending. But Davis allows Colonel Patton and reverent killers to float through his film like stray pieces of the dreadful shipwreck that was American aspiration in Vietnam. 
 ''Hearts and Minds'' hit theaters in 1974. Columbia Pictures, the original distributor of ''Hearts and Minds,'' refused to release the film, and Walt Rostow, who had been national security adviser under President Johnson, sued to block its distribution. Warner Brothers eventually brought the picture out, and it won an Academy Award for best documentary. 
 Davis made his documentary with three questions in mind: Why did we go to Vietnam? What did we do there? What did the doing in turn do to us? ''I didn't expect the film to answer these questions,'' Davis admits in the commentary on the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. ''I expected it to address those questions.'' Explanatory impotence is not unique to the documentary, but in some ways is abetted by the form. Inimitably vivid yet brutally compressed, documentaries often treasure image over information, proffer complications instead of conclusions and touch on rather than explore. But when a documentary film takes on the considerable subject of war, inconclusiveness can frustrate, though the viewer's frustration is not necessarily with the film. Even ''Hearts and Minds'' acknowledges its limitations: ''You were over there, too,'' one man angrily says to the filmmakers at a stateside parade, ''with your damn cameras.''
 The damn cameras have now been to Iraq and back. Few of the Iraq-war documentaries offer such self-awareness, though, and most neglect to address the war as a result of choices that might have been made differently. The one that comes closest is probably Stephen Marshall's ''Battleground.'' In showing us insurgents discussing their hatred of Americans while Humvees pass by, an Iraqi translator explaining that the invasion was due to the collapse of the American economy, a former anti-Saddam guerrilla reuniting with his mother after 13 years of exile and a U.S. officer marveling at the fact that Iraqis wear jeans (''They could be anywhere in the United States''), ''Battleground'' provides a movingly human and many-sided portrait of the war. It is, however, more the exception than the rule. In the grunt's-eye view offered in ''Occupation: Dreamland'' and ''Gunner Palace,'' the Iraq war functions as a savage reversal of American expectation. In ''Control Room,'' about Al Jazeera, the war is a rough beast sprinting toward Bethlehem. In ''The Dreams of Sparrows,'' a film made by Iraqis, the war is a fiery doorway into a hitherto unknown reality. But in all of these films the war just is. Matthew Arnold famously said that journalism was ''literature in a hurry.'' The analytic content of these Iraq documentaries sometimes feels like journalism in a hurry. These are partial maps drawn while still within the maze of war.
 Any honest documentary film about war must address the question of human suffering, given that human suffering is war's distillation. But whose suffering? In January 2004, we learn in Garrett Scott and Ian Olds's ''Occupation: Dreamland,'' soldiers from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne were living on the edge of Falluja in an abandoned Baathist resort called Dreamland. The 82nd's modest mission: maintain order and suppress resistance. The bloody Marine-led siege of Falluja in April 2004 would occur after the 82nd had been rotated out of the area. The film thus becomes an unlikely elegy, for the Falluja of ''Occupation: Dreamland,'' having been reduced to a Stalingradian ruin during its assorted American assaults, no longer exists. 
 The primary focus of ''Occupation: Dreamland'' is a handful of infantrymen who occupy a single crowded room papered with Maxim pinups and scattered with spittoons. In their modest billet these young men flex and pose in their mirrors, don their flak vests and goggles while listening to the metal band Slayer, mockingly read aloud from letters of stateside support and heatedly argue politics until their staff sergeant reminds them of the camera. These soldiers' political diversity may -- but should not -- surprise many viewers. Last summer I spent a month in Iraq embedded with the Marines and found men and women of widely divergent opinions about the war. Some were thoughtful, others clerics of ignorance. The soldiers in ''Occupation: Dreamland'' are equally afflicted and afflicting, and you quietly grieve for those soldiers given to more searching turns of mind: ''I want some answers,'' Pfc. Thomas Turner (an avowed Democrat) says early in the film. ''I want some clarification of what we're doing.. . .I guess somebody smarter than me knows what's going on.''
 Soon enough the mood turns ominous. One suspected insurgent explains to an American through a platoon interpreter: ''I'm not opposed. Do you understand me? I'm not opposed.'' The soldier responds, ''Zip him up.'' The Iraqi is next shown being hooded and cuffed and pushed into the back of a truck while some young Iraqis watch mutely. Later, while an outraged Iraqi buttonholes the camera about the ''indecent'' actions of Americans, like taking Iraqi women from local homes, a nearby soldier explains where he is from to two supremely unmoved Iraqis. ''What is 'California'?'' one Iraqi asks the other in Arabic. The soldiers themselves realize that these pathetic public-relations attempts are scarcely worth the oxygen, yet one of the film's most heartbreaking scenes -- filmed in night-vision-goggle green -- shows an American stopping to make small talk with an Iraqi man near Dreamland's perimeter. An effortful, translation-error-ridden conversation ensues, and you sense that this soldier is so urgently trying to communicate because he feels that his very humanity is at stake. Many of the soldiers acknowledge the legitimacy of Iraqi anger and fear. As one says, ''If this was home in Chicago, and there were some Iraqi soldiers comin' up and shovin' on my door, I'd be running up there with a couple guns myself.'' 
 The overall atmosphere in ''Occupation: Dreamland'' is churchy, Skoal-drooling, almost exaggeratedly heterosexual and not quite Southern so much as southern Indianan. In ''Gunner Palace,'' the overall atmosphere is pass-the-mike ebullience. Several soldiers freestyle some not-too-swift rhymes (''We live from Baghdad / Man, it's so sad'') and another plays ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' on his electric guitar before a molten Baghdad sun. Narrated by its whiskey-voiced director, Mike Tucker, ''Gunner Palace'' takes a markedly different view of the war than ''Occupation: Dreamland.'' In ''Gunner Palace'' the war is presented as deadly but vaguely ennobling. Gunner Palace itself, a ruined and colonnaded home that once belonged to Uday Hussein, is described by its commanding officer as an ''adult's paradise.'' Tucker never really steps back to examine the wisdom of American soldiers being billeted in the opulent mansion of a murderous regime they came to depose. Instead he employs his most pointed ironies by overlaying Donald Rumsfeld saying things like ''Baghdad is bustling with commerce'' upon scenes of a Baghdad bustling with flying lead. Which is not to say that ''Gunner Palace'' lacks a moral measuring tape. In the film's most moving interview, a young Army intelligence analyst, clearly frustrated by the war, says, ''I don't think, anywhere in history, has somebody killed somebody else and something better has come out of it.'' 
 Many of the subjects in ''Gunner Palace'' talk about how no one can understand what they are going through; how to their friends back home, Baghdad is one big action film. ''For y'all it's just a show,'' Specialist Richmond Shaw, the ''palace poet,'' tells the camera. ''But we live in this movie.'' Tucker's narration also addresses this ontological quandary: ''Unlike a movie, war has no end.'' But by the end of the film, you're fairly sure that viewing the Iraq war as a movie is less our problem than that of these soldiers. Enriched by its metal and hip-hop soundtrack and littered with dramatic comeuppances, ''Gunner Palace'' feels just like a movie, and moreover appears to know it: one of its wittier touches updates the famous ''Ride of the Valkyries'' scene from ''Apocalypse Now.'' What is strangest about ''Gunner Palace'' is its appeal to both the ardently pro-war and militantly antiwar. No doubt this is because of its obvious affection for its subjects alongside its unblinking portrayal of what they are forced to do. 
 There are only a few species of American soldier to be found in ''Control Room'': shouting brutes, grinning rationalizers and incompetent morons. The brutes all come to us through third-party footage, the rationalizers through intimate interviews, the morons from behind press-briefing podiums. Directed by Jehane Noujaim, ''Control Room'' is a sleek inquiry into the nature of the news media in a time of war, and what Noujaim discovers amounts to a murky casserole of McLuhanesque ingredients. Unlike the makers of ''Occupation: Dreamland'' and ''Gunner Palace,'' the makers of ''Control Room'' were never in actual physical danger, which probably explains the film's icier gaze. But in telling the story of the Iraq war through the prism of Al Jazeera (with 40 million Arab viewers, the largest and most influential news-media force in the region), ''Control Room'' achieves a tone as apocalyptic as that of ''Gunner Palace'' and ''Occupation: Dreamland,'' but in a far quieter key. It is an assassin to their blundering grunts.
 Donald Rumsfeld groused that Al Jazeera ''has a pattern of playing propaganda over and over and over again. What they do is when there's a bomb that goes down, they grab some children and some women and pretend that the bomb hit the women and the children.'' At one point in ''Control Room,'' the winningly bitter Al Jazeera producer Samir Khader points to a television screen that holds the image of a wounded Iraqi child. ''Rumsfeld called this incitement,'' he says. ''I call it true journalism.''
 In most of the Iraq-war films, this is as close as we get to the victims of American violence and insurgent terror. The war Peter Davis filmed in ''Hearts and Minds'' is not the sort of war American filmmakers in Iraq are privy to -- at least not without risking their heads. Davis could, and did, talk to average Vietnamese who had been bombed and maimed. Such victims are virtually absent in ''Occupation: Dreamland'' and ''Gunner Palace,'' and they are footage of footage in ''Control Room.''
 What ''Control Room'' seeks to illuminate (where truth devolves into propaganda and where war and media join hands) is much less interesting than its incidental illuminations -- among them the ineptitude of the United States military's press office, as when an American press officer obliviously tries to interest a roomful of hostile Arab reporters in the story of Jessica Lynch's rescue. ''We're not here to give coverage to the press,'' announces a Navy press officer giving coverage to the press. ''We're here to liberate the people of Iraq.'' It all builds into a frieze of cluelessness. 
 Noujaim's method is to wait around until something happens. Her patience is both dreadfully and movingly rewarded. An Al Jazeera reporter is killed by American forces, perhaps intentionally, and an unlikely friendship develops between Hassan Ibrahim, a portly Al Jazeera producer, and Lt. Josh Rushing, a sensitive Marine Corps press officer. Rushing's moral awakening provides ''Control Room'' with much of its arc. Routinely slaughtered by Ibrahim in conversation, Rushing struggles with his memorized talking points and the reality of what he sees, ultimately recognizing that Fox News and Al Jazeera are simply two sides of the same cathode and deciding that improving Arab-American relations is the duty of his generation. (Rushing now works for Al Jazeera.)
 ''The Dreams of Sparrows,'' the Iraqi director Hayder Mousa Daffar's account of life under the occupation, opens with a re-enactment (the film's only obvious fictional interlude) of a mother giving birth during the invasion; she dies. ''This movie,'' Daffar tells us, ''is about what happened to that child, to the new Iraq.'' The new Iraq is not of much interest to Scott and Olds, Tucker or Noujaim. Nor are they much interested in the old Iraq. They are concerned with the minute-to-minute Iraq, which their cameras devour. Through the eyes of Iraqis, in ''The Dreams of Sparrows,'' we can finally divine what emerges from the war's digestive tract.
 Daffar notes that, before the invasion, filmmaking in Iraq was completely controlled by the Baathists, and you can sense not only his excitement but also the unfamiliarity of his excitement (''I couldn't believe I was finally making a documentary about Iraq!'') at being able to drive around Baghdad photographing everything from smiling American soldiers to fly-covered animal carcasses lying roadside amid empty Pepsi cans.
 If ''The Dreams of Sparrows'' has a fault, it is that it too consciously addresses Western viewers and too reductively assumes the worst of them. But it is when Daffar is thinking less of his presumed audience and more of his subjects that his film stuns. Perhaps most notably, ''The Dreams of Sparrows'' suggests an emotional complexity about the war that few Americans, whatever their feelings, appear willing to entertain. Daffar's sweet, huggable, pro-America cameraman, Hayder Jabbar, carries a picture of Bush in his wallet: ''I love him as much as I love my father.'' Khariya Mansour, a red-haired Iraqi filmmaker, tells Daffar, ''The occupation is bad, and Saddam is bad.'' Daffar asks her about the portrait of Bush in her living room. ''I like Bush,'' she says. ''I like him so much I am in love with him. I love him because he gave us freedom.''
 From Baghdad's necropolis of slums and nightmarish refugee camps we travel with Daffar to its middle-class apartments, artists' hangouts, mosques and the headquarters of the Communist Party. This is a city of armed men and of stylish women nervously chain-smoking in their apartments; a city where children studying in a private school hold up crayon drawings and say, ''Here the tank is aiming at the helicopter, and they exchange shells and rockets.'' Some Baghdad taxi drivers complain about the Americans (''God willing, [Saddam] will come back and will bring peace to the country''), while former Iraqi soldiers trained to kill Americans are interestingly divided. One calls America a ''by the book'' terrorist state, while another says: ''Saddam's party was a terrorist regime. He was strangling us. It was an unbearable regime.'' Daffar does not soft-pedal the issue of Baathist brutality. ''Do you have any cases affected by the regime?'' he asks a doctor at an insane asylum. ''They are all affected by it'' is the response. Here Daffar's moral vision is unassailable, and the viewer realizes the truly flea-market nature of American anti-Baathism.
 When asked if cinema is necessary for Iraqi society, Daffar's cameraman Jabbar says: ''Cinema is very necessary. Cinema is a language. . .the fastest way to reach the people.'' I suspect that the makers of ''Occupation: Dreamland,'' ''Gunner Palace'' or ''Control Room'' did not have ''reaching the people'' in mind while cutting together their footage, and perhaps consequently, around the edges of their films lingers a grim irrelevance. ''Control Room'' in particular is so resigned to its futility that it achieves a kind of depressed self-hypnosis.
 In the closing minutes of ''The Dreams of Sparrows,'' lovable, pro-American Hayder Jabbar tells us that, because of a misunderstanding, a friend of his and Daffar's has been killed by American soldiers, who accidentally pumped more than a hundred bullets into the friend's car. ''He was,'' Jabbar says of his dead friend, ''the first one to be happy at the fall of Saddam's regime.'' The film cuts to Daffar, who is smoking, raccoon-eyed, wearing a tank top and addressing the camera directly.
 ''Baghdad,'' Daffar says, ''Baghdad is hell, really is hell.'' He laughs bitterly. ''U.S. troops and government of U.S.A. is very dirty here. In start, when Baghdad is fall, when Saddam is gone, I am very happy. Not just me. Believe me. All Iraqi people.. . .U.S. troops is very hardhearted.'' This shattering film ends with Daffar shaking his head, unable to remember his English. His despair does not come off as predatory, but as personally and harshly earned. Very few of us live in this movie.

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
THIS is Tania's second appearance in the New Jersey section. Nine years ago, a brief review in the Quick Bite column spoke in awestruck tones about the restaurant's cold borscht: ''fluorescent refreshingly tangy criminally cheap.''
 Those words are as apt today as they were in 1996. There were only two things wrong with the review: the words ''quick'' and ''bite.'' A meal at Tania's, a Polish institution well into its second decade, is anything but.
The cold borscht -- offered as a special appetizer, available on only one of our two visits -- is only the beginning. (Its fluorescent tang, refreshing indeed on a sultry evening in mid-autumn, came from the potent interaction of buttermilk, beets and dill.) For no matter what the weather, how could you conclude an excursion to Tania's without visiting the hulking landmarks of Eastern European cuisine: pirogi, stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes, blintzes? 
 It helps to take a group. While criminality is in the eye of the courts, Tania's is a certifiable steal, ranking with library book sales and the Staten Island ferry in the annals of bargain hunting. Six of you would be hard-pressed to spend more than $150, even with a sampling of terrific Polish beers with chewy names like Zywiec, Okocim and Hevelius Kaper. 
 Ask the waiter for extra spoons, and pass around several bowls of soup -- not just the cold borscht but the warm variety called Ukrainian (always available), mushroom barley, potato and if you have the courage, tripe. In particular, the Ukrainian borscht is a revelation: a melange of root vegetables, legumes and herbs in which beets play only a minor role and the dominant player is first-rate chicken broth. And the tripe is dense and peppery, with a visceral swamplike pungency that can bring tears even if you only smell it.
 The potato pancakes, known in Polish as placki, deserve to be sampled, if only to provoke passionate comparisons with the output of various Jewish restaurants and grandmothers. To my taste they were ordinary, lifted by their distinct potato flavor but dragged down by pasty heaviness. Others disagreed. 
 But with blintzes, there was no debate. Fried for maximum crispness, they enclosed such elemental fillings as chopped meat (a combination of veal and pork), sweet farmer's cheese, apples and blueberries. Only the cherry filling, with the cloying sweetness and starchy texture of canned pie filling, is to be avoided; the others hit the center of the target. 
 The same went for pirogi, either fried or boiled. We ordered both, and each had its partisans; I preferred the boiled, with its tender wrappers evoking large ravioli. Here, the fillings were uniformly fine: potato, cheese, mushroom-sauerkraut and chopped meat.
 At this point, with main courses looming before you like alps, you may want to consider a palate cleanser, in the form of tart, crisp cucumber salad, expertly made coleslaw, or a few forkfuls of Tania's sauerkraut. Tekla Pawlowska, the chef and longtime owner, insisted in a phone interview that the sauerkraut involved no cabbage, only shredded and sauteed onions with butter, margarine and garlic. I found that odd; perhaps the language barrier stood in our way. In any event, it was excellent: sharp and forceful, with plenty of crunch and an almost winy flavor.
 The chief sins of Eastern European cooking are heaviness and blandness, and Tania's entrees did not avoid them. Stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage were tender and easy to eat, with a homey filling of meat and rice, but they had little character. Lamb shank came in a thick tomato-and-onion sauce, but the meat itself was disappointingly short on taste. Half a roasted chicken was dry, and its off-putting garnish was a single leaf of iceberg lettuce. 
 Still, it was hard to complain too loudly about entrees that cost $9.50 with a vegetable and a choice of sides like sauerkraut, cucumber salad and earthy boiled potatoes. And there were some pleasant surprises, including tender fresh ham under a viscous but vividly flavored mushroom gravy; and a Polish combination platter that incorporated stuffed cabbage, potato pirogis and brawny, garlicky kielbasa that had just stepped off the plane from Warsaw.
 For dessert, the obvious choice is a plate of blintzes with sour cream, followed closely by a homey apple cake. By this time you will have forgotten the word quick, or the notion that bite can be a singular noun.
 Ms. Pawlowska (pronounced pahv-WOHV-skuh) is not called Tania; the restaurant's name comes from a Polish word for inexpensive. She came to the United States with her family in 1983, when Poland's Communist government began issuing visas during the early stirrings of Solidarity. She opened Tania's six years later, in what must have been a considerable gamble: the neighborhood, with its graceful four-story brick buildings, is gentrifying now but was gritty and uninviting then. 
 The gamble has been paying off for 16 years, and now Ms. Pawlowska is moving on. In a lovely example of the kind of immigrant-to-immigrant handoff that has invigorated Hudson County's economic and social fabric for generations, she has sold Tania's to two Turkish-American partners, Vecdi Bilgin and Hakan Iskifoglu. Mr. Bilgin said Ms. Pawlowska would remain in the kitchen until a new Polish chef could be recruited and trained. ''We're not going to change a thing,'' he added. That looks like a very sound business plan.

HEADLINE: When a Church Is Not a Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Six years ago, Philipp Angermeyer bought an apartment in the Carroll Gardens Landmark Condominiums, a 19th-century Romanesque church turned residential building on Court Street in Brooklyn. In part, the appeal of living in the landmark church is architectural: stained-glass windows, high ceilings and a certain monastic quietude. 
 Over the summer, however, the owner of the building's ground-floor atrium leased that space to the nondenominational Sovereign Grace City Church. As a result, Mr. Angermeyer and his neighbors found themselves in an odd position: Having paid a significant amount of money to reside in a former house of God, they were now living above an active congregation, one in which Sunday morning guitar strum-alongs seemed an integral part of worshiping. 
Last month, the condominium's board filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn against both Sovereign Grace, the church, and Jean Miele, the owner of the atrium. In renting to the church, the suit charges, Mr. Miele diminished property values and violated the building's bylaws, which the suit states permit commercial tenants like law offices but not a church. 
 ''This isn't about the fact that it's a religious organization,'' said Randall Lazzaro, a lawyer who represents the condominium's board and whose firm rents an office in the building's basement. ''The operation of a church is in violation of the regulations of the building.'' 
 Mr. Angermeyer, who lives in the apartment next to the new church, added, ''The resale value is the main issue.''
 The three-story brick church was built as the home of South Congregational Church in 1851, when Carroll Gardens was largely Scandinavian. In 1940, the church had 2,400 members; by 1982 that number had dwindled to 20. At the time, Mr. Miele's father, Jean G. Miele, an architect and developer, struck a deal with the congregation to convert the building into apartments while allowing the church a room for worship.
 By the time the building became a condominium in the mid-90's, South Congregational was long gone, and the atrium had become the province of the tenants, who paid a monthly fee in return for the right to use the space as a lobby. 
 That, according to the younger Mr. Miele, is the real problem. ''We would have loved to rent to a law office or an architect,'' he said. ''But I think the people who are unhappy would have been unhappy no matter who the tenant was.''
 Mr. Miele, a photographer, said he had bought the atrium to use as a photo studio, but after that use proved economically unfeasible, he began looking for a tenant. The only interested party was Sovereign Grace, which initially rented the space as an office but began holding services there in August after it could no longer use a middle school in Park Slope. Mr. Miele maintains that the church is there legally. 
 The minister of Sovereign Grace, the Rev. Randy Stewart, described the lawsuit as ''unfortunate'' but said that because his church had signed a three-year lease and invested $80,000 in renovations, it couldn't simply walk away. 
 ''Our hope,'' he said, ''is that if we sit down in a peaceful manner, we could all come to a resolution that would serve everybody.'' STEVEN KURUTZ

HEADLINE: The Need for Speed

BYLINE: By Robert Winkler. 
Robert Winkler is the author of ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness.''

 BODY:
THE closest we come to free flight in our lives is not when we take off in an airplane. It is when we drive our cars. The speed, altitude, centrifugal forces and sensations of flying that we experience behind the wheel of an S.U.V., a sports car or, in my case, an economy box, let us feel what it is like to be a bird. This partly explains why we love our cars, preferring this mode of locomotion to any other, even walking and running, for which we are supremely adapted.
 Despite the high price of gas and President Bush's call for all Americans to conserve, we go everywhere in our cars, and, for most of us, the faster we go the better. Posted speed limits are one of life's great fictions. Virtually no one observes them. Whenever I do I can be sure a tailgater will magically appear in my rearview mirror. Speeding is the norm, the de facto law, and many drivers view anyone who observes speed limits as a de facto lawbreaker or a wimp who deserves to be run off the road. Police enforcement of speed limits is spotty at best. Meanwhile, road improvements, car redesigns and automaker advertisements are always nudging us to speed up. 
But the problem is that, unlike birds, man wasn't meant to fly. When we get behind the wheel of a car, we may think we gain a bird's power of flight, but actually we are poor, pathetic imitators of birds. Each year, speeding drivers who are unable to stop in time cause thousands of fatal accidents. 
 In New York City and on the highways that feed into it, traffic volume alone keeps speeding in check. Here in the suburbs, however, it's the Wild West. I frequently observe motorists going 40 miles an hour or faster on winding side streets. Many can't control their cars at such speeds, even those who drive luxury sports cars. As they come around a sharp curve, they go into the lane of oncoming traffic to combat the centrifugal force that threatens to fling them off the road. If they encounter your car coming from the other direction, too bad. You'll just have to get out of the way. 
 Speed has become the driving force is our lives. Everyone is in a hurry -- to get to work, to get home, to drop off the children, to pick them up, to get to the supermarket, the post office, the dump, Wal-Mart. We must go ever faster, and we must build gas-guzzling cars ever bigger and stronger to protect us in the reckless chase for money and status. We pay lip service to the environment, then fill up at the gas station. God help those who get in our way.
 Thousands of people and millions of wild and domestic animals die every year in this country because motorists lack the perceptual adaptations of birds. Drivers cannot avoid accidents because they are incapable of reacting quickly enough when moving at high speed. Their flicker fusion frequency -- the point at which an increasingly rapid flashing light is seen as a continuous beam -- is too slow.
 The northern goshawk, in contrast, zooms around its wild neighborhood in relative safety. It lives in deep forests and earns its living by chasing down other birds. It has nearly a four-foot wingspan and can travel through thick woods just a few feet off the ground at perhaps 40 miles an hour in pursuit of a ruffed grouse or a wood duck. It follows the unpredictable twists and turns of its prey, avoiding collisions with countless branches. Its flicker fusion frequency is thought to be much higher than that of humans. A goshawk flying at high speed can probably perceive an obstacle, and react to it by veering away, in a fraction of the time it would take a motorist to avoid an accident. 
 A road-hugging Porsche is probably more responsive than a Ford Focus. But when you're going 40 and a deer steps right in front of your car, the great equalizer comes into play. If the deer is only a few yards away, both cars will collide with it, because neither driver can escape the physiological limitations of being human.
 The power we feel when we get into a Porsche or an S.U.V. is illusory. When we become motorists, we actually get weaker. We leave our natural bipedal realm for an airborne one in which we are out of control. Our self-absorption prevents us from accepting our limitations, though every day we see the consequences in untold deaths of humans and non-human animals.
 Minimizing the ill effects of this hubris is simple enough: slow down.

HEADLINE: A Building Boom For the Over-55 Crowd

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
REGIONAL planning meetings can be a snore. That is until they sound an alarm, and wake up the neighborhood.
 That is what happened on Nov. 2, when the Council of Governments of the Central Naugatuck Valley held a luncheon meeting to talk about the explosion of age-restricted housing in its member communities. To towns dependent on property taxes to pay bills, age-restricted housing had pretty much looked as if it was created by a property-tax Einstein. No children are allowed, meaning there would be no demand for new schools. Combine that with higher revenues from taxes, and the money would be coming in, but not going out.
Do not be so sure, the planners from the council of governments told those attending. They handed out a brief questionnaire to the town planners. ''Does your town have sufficient senior services? Would your town build this if it weren't age-restricted? What could these units be used for after the baby boomers are gone?''
 Mary Barton, the town planner in Watertown, where a proposal for a 350-unit age-restricted development was being considered along with zoning changes to accommodate it, did not have to think long to get her answers. No, no and not sure, she said. 
 ''It seems this is the wave of the future of development,'' she said. ''The thing that concerns me is: What happens when there's no longer a call for this type of housing?''
 Town planners and regional planners have recently been raising issues like this about age-restricted developments being built or proposed in towns throughout the state. The issues range from concerns that a glut of the units will create empty neighborhoods 30 to 40 years down the road when baby boomers have moved on or died, to worries about a greater demand for services as residents age, to how to deal with a lack of zoning regulations regarding the proposals, to concerns that turning towns into havens for the elderly will irrevocably change their character.
 Such developments might not be a worry but for their sheer numbers in the state. Although there have been a crush of proposals in the past few years, the first so-called active-adult communities, which differ from nursing homes and retirement housing in that they do not generally provide health services and that they focus on activities and social events, were being built in the 1960's.
 One of the state's oldest and largest age-restricted developments, Heritage Village, was built in Southbury in the late 1960's. But Heritage Village has what most newer developments are not offering now: its own ambulance service and its own security officers. With 2,580 units and almost 4,000 residents on 1,000 acres, Heritage Village is bigger than some Connecticut towns. 
 More than 7,000 units of housing ranging from apartment-style condominiums to single-family homes are for sale in about 150 new neighborhoods, targeted at buyers 55 and older, according to 55-Plus LLC, a Massachusetts-based marketing firm that has surveyed dozens of towns in Connecticut. That does not take into account the dozens of proposals that are before zoning boards, or the age-restricted housing that already has been built. ''The way these things are popping up all over the place, it's eventually going to glut the market,'' said Daniel Tuba, Monroe town planner and the immediate past president of the Connecticut chapter of the American Planning Association, which is a professional organization for town planners.
 ''Right now, there's a lot of anti-residential development sentiment in Connecticut, and developers have latched onto this active-adult community idea as a way to try to convince a community that something is worth approving,'' Mr. Tuba continued. ''I have to laugh, because they use the term active adults, and it kind of draws attention to the whole issue. The active-adult community becomes the passive-adult community 20 years from now. That community will demand a lot of services in terms of public safety, ambulance service, fire service. 
 ''And when the baby-boomer wave goes through, you're going to see a dramatic drop-off in that age group,'' Mr. Tuba added. ''All of a sudden these communities are going to say, 'We can't fill our units, and we have no alternative but to open them up and sell them to whomever.' And what has been billed as a positive tax flow and a positive for the community will start to reverse. This has not been a well-thought-out concept. It's one of these hot ideas that everybody is hooking their stars to and trying to follow.''
 Before the beginning of this year, the town of Berlin, population 18,215 from the 2000 census, had no age-restricted housing, said Hellyn Riggins, Berlin's director of development services. Between Jan. 1 and May 19, it approved 860 units. Then it declared a moratorium on construction of such housing until its planning department could update its zoning regulations. 
 ''The town needed time to sit back and say, Oh! We've just been hit with all age-restricted units,'' Ms. Riggins said. ''Is it just good for us right now? What's going to happen 20 years from now, when we have all these units and maybe the demand isn't there? It's also a worry, that they could become regular condos, that the owners might come back to us and request regular zoning. What are the demographics of the 55 and older community? Will it drop sharply after 20 years? When do you saturate the market?''
 Because age-restricted housing is relatively new to Connecticut, many of these questions are unanswered. Many developments require zoning changes to be built, and in several towns, developers of age-restricted are the ones writing them. 
 In New Milford and East Lyme, for example, Karl Frey, a Stamford developer whose firm, Vespera, proposed Dunham Farm, a 508-unit active-adult housing project, created the town's zoning amendments. Instead of 508 units on 600 acres, the units will be built on about 60 acres, with 100 acres for open space. But the proposal ran into significant community opposition in 2004, with opponents saying it did not take sufficient account of conservation and environmental issues. Construction has not yet begun. 
 ''It's a true smart-growth community,'' Mr. Frey said. ''We have a mix of small-lot single-family homes, townhouses and condominiums. But we were negligent in preparing the community for this, and we made a mistake assuming that folks understood what we were trying to do. Conservation comes first in everything we do.''
 Mr. Frey scoffed at the idea that the market for age-restricted communities would dissolve in the future. 
 ''If you were 40 in 1850, you were an old guy,'' he said. ''If you made it to retirement in 1950, and got another couple of good years before you dropped dead of a heart attack, you were doing well. Now life expectancy has risen dramatically. There's no way we will end up with an overabundance of 55 and older housing.'' Covenants within the bylaws of the developments also can stipulate permanent restrictions, for example, making the community perpetually responsible for trash pickup, or clearing its own roads.
 ''The town can't impose that upon the developer, but if the developers are smart, they can put it to the zoning board that they will put those restrictions in their bylaws as a condition of approval,'' Mr. Frey said. ''As long as you spell up front that the community is responsible for its own trash pickup, etc., those costs should never rise with inflation. So it's not the kind of revolt the town should ever worry about, if they think up front about ways to accommodate the extraordinary demand for 55 and older housing in a new way.''
 Town planners are not so sure. No matter what covenants say, they worry that as maintenance fees rise and fixed incomes stay fixed, homeowners will approach the towns to pick up some costs like snow and trash removal. For example, services for seniors are already strained in East Windsor and South Windsor, where hundreds of age-restricted housing units were built in the past decade. Both towns have established caps on the number of age-restricted units allowed, although South Windsor has raised its cap twice.
 ''These active-adult residents are demanding more senior services as the years go by,'' said Laurie Whitten, vice president of the Connecticut Association of Zoning Enforcement Officials and director of planning and development in East Windsor, which went from 33 age-restricted proposals in 2005 to 700 in 2005, before the town enacted a building moratorium on Sept. 16. ''Our senior services have increased drastically because of all the active adults in town.''
 Marcia Banach, South Windsor's director of planning, said the town's senior center has become overburdened from the number of 55-and-older residents who have moved into the new developments.
 ''We've also had more frequent medical calls to the complexes,'' she said. ''Everyone thinks they're really great because there will be no impact on services, but we're seeing more impact.''
 Despite naysayers, Heritage Village integrated well into Southbury, said DeLoris Curtis, the town's planning administrator. A spokeswoman for the community, Leola Lee, said that when the village first went up, some critics said it would become a slum soon enough. 
 ''It is far from that,'' Ms. Lee said. ''It is one of the most beautiful places to live, and our maintenance fees are far from high. That's why people are moving here in such large numbers now. It's nothing like what you have to pay in Westchester.'' 
 But concerns have arisen over the years. Housing prices there have not kept up with comparable homes in Southbury, said Virginia Mason of the Council of Governments in Naugatuck. Heritage Village also made up 31 percent of all the housing units in Southbury in 2004, creating a huge voting bloc of 55-and-older residents. Some years ago, before residential development increased in Southbury, the voting bloc at Heritage Village was greater than any other in Southbury, Mrs. Curtis said. The construction of age-restricted communities has been prohibited in Southbury since the 1980's. ''We don't want the balance of the population to tip,'' Mrs. Curtis said. 
 Such large developments have a slim chance of being approved nowadays. But hundreds of small ones in a small state will make the same kind of dent, said Samuel Gold, a planner with the Council of Governments in Naugatuck. 
 ''This isn't planning,'' he said. ''This is land use as fiscal remedy. Connecticut towns are chasing after active-adult housing as a cash cow. Developers are selling this to people in their late 50's who aren't old yet, and they don't have elderly needs yet. When they're in their 70's and 80's, the towns will be ill-equipped to provide services. And typically older people vote a lot more consistently than younger people, and you may have a population that has no direct connection to the schools and will vote that way. These towns are willfully become more geriatric. They're subscribing to a geriatric future.''

HEADLINE: The Need for Speed

BYLINE: By Robert Winkler. 
Robert Winkler is the author of ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness.''

 BODY:
THE closest we come to free flight in our lives is not when we take off in an airplane. It is when we drive our cars. The speed, altitude, centrifugal forces and sensations of flying that we experience behind the wheel of an S.U.V., a sports car or, in my case, an economy box, let us feel what it is like to be a bird. This partly explains why we love our cars, preferring this mode of locomotion to any other, even walking and running, for which we are supremely adapted.
 Despite the high price of gas and President Bush's call for all Americans to conserve, we go everywhere in our cars, and, for most of us, the faster we go the better. Posted speed limits are one of life's great fictions. Virtually no one observes them. Whenever I do I can be sure a tailgater will magically appear in my rearview mirror. Speeding is the norm, the de facto law, and many drivers view anyone who observes speed limits as a de facto lawbreaker or a wimp who deserves to be run off the road. Police enforcement of speed limits is spotty at best. Meanwhile, road improvements, car redesigns and automaker advertisements are always nudging us to speed up. 
But the problem is that, unlike birds, man wasn't meant to fly. When we get behind the wheel of a car, we may think we gain a bird's power of flight, but actually we are poor, pathetic imitators of birds. Each year, speeding drivers who are unable to stop in time cause thousands of fatal accidents. 
 In New York City and on the highways that feed into it, traffic volume alone keeps speeding in check. Here in the suburbs, however, it's the Wild West. I frequently observe motorists going 40 miles an hour or faster on winding side streets. Many can't control their cars at such speeds, even those who drive luxury sports cars. As they come around a sharp curve, they go into the lane of oncoming traffic to combat the centrifugal force that threatens to fling them off the road. If they encounter your car coming from the other direction, too bad. You'll just have to get out of the way. 
 Speed has become the driving force is our lives. Everyone is in a hurry -- to get to work, to get home, to drop off the children, to pick them up, to get to the supermarket, the post office, the dump, Wal-Mart. We must go ever faster, and we must build gas-guzzling cars ever bigger and stronger to protect us in the reckless chase for money and status. We pay lip service to the environment, then fill up at the gas station. God help those who get in our way.
 Thousands of people and millions of wild and domestic animals die every year in this country because motorists lack the perceptual adaptations of birds. Drivers cannot avoid accidents because they are incapable of reacting quickly enough when moving at high speed. Their flicker fusion frequency -- the point at which an increasingly rapid flashing light is seen as a continuous beam -- is too slow.
 The northern goshawk, in contrast, zooms around its wild neighborhood in relative safety. It lives in deep forests and earns its living by chasing down other birds. It has nearly a four-foot wingspan and can travel through thick woods just a few feet off the ground at perhaps 40 miles an hour in pursuit of a ruffed grouse or a wood duck. It follows the unpredictable twists and turns of its prey, avoiding collisions with countless branches. Its flicker fusion frequency is thought to be much higher than that of humans. A goshawk flying at high speed can probably perceive an obstacle, and react to it by veering away, in a fraction of the time it would take a motorist to avoid an accident. 
 A road-hugging Porsche is probably more responsive than a Ford Focus. But when you're going 40 and a deer steps right in front of your car, the great equalizer comes into play. If the deer is only a few yards away, both cars will collide with it, because neither driver can escape the physiological limitations of being human.
 The power we feel when we get into a Porsche or an S.U.V. is illusory. When we become motorists, we actually get weaker. We leave our natural bipedal realm for an airborne one in which we are out of control. Our self-absorption prevents us from accepting our limitations, though every day we see the consequences in untold deaths of humans and non-human animals.
 Minimizing the ill effects of this hubris is simple enough: slow down.

HEADLINE: University Expansion: Upside and Downside

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY, Long Island's largest, has taken giant steps toward getting even bigger, earning praise from local and state officials but raising concerns among its neighbors about further expansion plans.
 In a move that Stony Brook's president, Shirley Strum Kenny, called ''very much an economic development program,'' the university said on Nov. 3 that it had taken title to a lush, green 246-acre site known as Flowerfield, just west of its main campus, and would go ahead with plans to build 10 three- and four-story research buildings there over the next 20 years. The site had been owned by the Gyrodyne Corporation.
''It's the best thing to happen to this town in decades, without question,'' said John Jay LaValle, the supervisor of the Town of Brookhaven. The research center ''being planned at this site will be a tremendous boost to our economy and our quality of life.'' 
 The same day that it announced the plans for the center, Stony Brook said it would buy the 81-acre Southampton campus of Long Island University for $35 million in state money. The campus's 42 buildings and ocean frontage will be used mainly for Stony Brook's expanding marine sciences program and ecology studies, Dr. Kenny said.
 In Stony Brook, the university acquired the Gyrodyne property by using the state's power of eminent domain after trying unsuccessfully for two years to negotiate a purchase. Gyrodyne rejected a $26.3 million offer, saying the land was worth much more; the final amount the university will pay has not yet been set. A court ruling in late April cleared the way for the eminent domain action. 
 Despite the hopes that the research center will transform Stony Brook into a hub of research and development yielding more high-paying jobs for Long Islanders, some residents were uneasy about the expansion's effects.
 ''Once the state has control of it, they can do whatever they want with it,'' Dr. Richard Rugen, a chiropractor, said as he raked leaves off the driveway at his house on Stony Brook Road next to the Gyrodyne property. ''And that keeps the people of the town from having a chance to say what they want done with it.''
 Only about 73 acres of the site are planned for development. The rest will be managed for preservation and environmental studies by university researchers, Dr. Kenny said.
 The university has no intention of building dormitories or other residential housing on the site, she said, adding that she ''cannot foresee how that would possibly change in the future.''
 Researchers, students and technology company employees will work in the research center's 22 labs to create products and applications in an array of technological fields, including biotechnology, communications and homeland security. Thirty-five companies are contributing $150 million to the center, and the state has budgeted $50 million toward its construction.
 Angelo and Susann Cuccia and their three children live across Route 25A from the Gyrodyne property in a development of spacious two-story homes.
 ''Probably our biggest concern would be the traffic,'' Ms. Cuccia said. ''Stony Brook Road is the main road for us to get to the stores -- Target and all the shopping on Route 347.''
 The university has proposed a bridge over Stony Brook Road to link the site directly to the campus, but if that is approved, it will not affect traffic, said Patrick Vecchio, the Smithtown supervisor.
 Mr. Cuccia said he did not worry much when the university and Gyrodyne began negotiating two years ago. ''I just thought they'd be fighting forever, and never do anything,'' he said.
 But now the carnivals and arts and crafts fairs held on the property for more than 15 years will most likely come to an end. Stony Brook is to break ground next spring for the first building, the Center for Excellence in Wireless Information Technology.
 ''The fact that the state could come in and say we're taking 246 acres is crazy,'' Mr. Cuccia said. Gyrodyne is ''kind of getting the rug swept out from underneath them.''
 Gyrodyne stopped operations on the site in 1975 and tried unsuccessfully last year to change the zoning from light industrial to residential so it could build houses surrounding an 18-hole golf course. 
 That proposal, some say, would bring more tax revenue to local school districts. ''Taxes are crazy here,'' Ms. Cuccia said. 
 Mr. Rugen said his property taxes have risen nearly 20 percent in recent years. He said he favored the Gyrodyne proposal and the revenue it would bring to Brookhaven and Smithtown, whose border the site straddles. 
 But Joanne Gray, a Smithtown councilwoman, said new houses would bring in school-age children and thus higher property taxes.
 ''Unless you have very high-end housing, $1 million and up, there's going to be a burden on the schools,'' Ms. Gray said. ''We're at capacity for the schools out here right now.''
 Private companies that use the university's research center will make payments to the towns in lieu of taxes, Dr. Kenny said, but how much money that might mean was unclear.
 The best use of the land from the perspective of high tax revenue and low tax burden would be by a private company or an industrial developer, said Mitchell Pally, vice president of the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group. ''The state should pay real property taxes on the property as if it had been developed by a private entity,'' he said.
 But Mr. LaValle, the Brookhaven supervisor, contends that concerns about tax revenue are shortsighted. ''Companies will flock to our community,'' he said. ''These are high-end jobs. We're not talking about strip-mall jobs.''

HEADLINE: Psst! 'Human Capital'

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Help! I'm turning into the ''plastics'' guy from ''The Graduate.'' I'm pulling people aside at parties and whispering that if they want to understand the future, it's just two words: ''Human Capital.''
 If we want to keep up with the Chinese and the Indians, we've got to develop our Human Capital. If we want to remain a just, fluid society: Human Capital. If we want to head off underclass riots: Human Capital. 
 As people drift away from me at these parties by pretending to recognize long-lost friends across the room, I'm convinced that they don't really understand what human capital is.
 Most people think of human capital the way economists and policy makers do -- as the skills and knowledge people need to get jobs and thrive in a modern economy. When President Bush proposed his big education reform, he insisted on tests to measure skills and knowledge. When commissions issue reports, they call for longer school years, revamped curriculums and more funds so teachers can transmit skills and knowledge. 
 But skills and knowledge -- the stuff you can measure with tests -- is only the most superficial component of human capital. U.S. education reforms have generally failed because they try to improve the skills of students without addressing the underlying components of human capital.
 These underlying components are hard to measure and uncomfortable to talk about, but they are the foundation of everything that follows.
 There's cultural capital: the habits, assumptions, emotional dispositions and linguistic capacities we unconsciously pick up from families, neighbors and ethnic groups -- usually by age 3. In a classic study, James S. Coleman found that what happens in the family shapes a child's educational achievement more than what happens in school. In more recent research, James Heckman and Pedro Carneiro found that ''most of the gaps in college attendance and delay are determined by early family factors.''
 There's social capital: the knowledge of how to behave in groups and within institutions. This can mean, for example, knowing what to do if your community college loses your transcript. Or it can mean knowing the basic rules of politeness. The University of North Carolina now offers seminars to poorer students so they'll know how to behave in restaurants. 
 There's moral capital: the ability to be trustworthy. Students who drop out of high school, but take the G.E.D. exam, tend to be smarter than high school dropouts. But their lifetime wages tend to be no higher than they are for those with no high school diplomas. That's because many people who pass the G.E.D. are less organized and less dependable than their less educated peers -- as employers soon discover. Brains and skills don't matter if you don't show up on time. 
 There's cognitive capital. This can mean pure, inherited brainpower. But important cognitive skills are not measured by IQ tests and are not fixed. Some people know how to evaluate themselves and their abilities, while others with higher IQ's are clueless. Some low-IQ people can sense what others are feeling, while brainier peers cannot. Such skills can be improved over a lifetime.
 Then there's aspirational capital: the fire-in-the-belly ambition to achieve. In his book ''The Millionaire Mind,'' Thomas J. Stanley reports that the average millionaire had a B-minus collegiate G.P.A. -- not very good. But millionaires often had this experience: People told them they were too stupid to achieve something, so they set out to prove the naysayers wrong.
 Over the past quarter-century, researchers have done a lot of work trying to understand the different parts of human capital. Their work has been almost completely ignored by policy makers, who continue to treat human capital as just skills and knowledge. The result? A series of expensive policy failures.
 We now spend more per capita on education than just about any other country on earth, and the results are mediocre. No Child Left Behind treats students as skill-acquiring cogs in an economic wheel, and the results have been disappointing. We pour money into Title 1 and Head Start, but the long-term gains are insignificant.
 These programs are not designed for the way people really are. The only things that work are local, human-to-human immersions that transform the students down to their very beings. Extraordinary schools, which create intense cultures of achievement, work. Extraordinary teachers, who inspire students to transform their lives, work. The programs that work touch all the components of human capital.
 There's a great future in Human Capital, buddy. Enough said.

HEADLINE: A Constant Struggle

BYLINE: By Gordon S. Wood. 
Gordon S. Wood is the Alva O. Way University professor and professor of history at Brown University. His most recent book is ''The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin.''

 BODY:
The Rise of American Democracy
 Jefferson to Lincoln.
 By Sean Wilentz.
 Illustrated. 1,044 pp. 
 W. W. Norton & Company. $35.
This enormous book by Sean Wilentz has been in the works a long time, and the results are nothing less than monumental. An old-fashioned account of the rise of democracy during the first half of the 19th century, it is a tour de force of historical compilation and construction that more than justifies all the articles and monographs on antebellum politics written by historians over the past several decades. Wilentz, the Dayton-Stockton professor of history at Princeton, has drawn extensively on these secondary sources and on his own research. He has brought it all together into a clear and generally readable narrative. 
 Coming in at just over a thousand pages, ''The Rise of American Democracy'' is one of the longest works of history to appear recently, and this at a time when most histories and biographies are getting shorter, presumably because of our reduced attention spans. Wilentz makes no concessions to his readers' patience. He has filled his book with an extraordinary multitude of details about nearly every conceivable aspect of antebellum politics, both at the state and federal levels. Of course, since context is everything in history, excessive detail of this kind warms a historian's heart, though whether anyone except a few scholars and information-hungry graduate students will have the stamina actually to slog through such an enormous work remains to be seen. Awesome in its coverage of political events, this is a long, long read.
 Wilentz's first book, ''Chants Democratic'' (1984), was a celebrated study of the rise of the working class in the early Republic, an especially appropriate subject for a scholar known for his devotion to liberal causes and the Democratic Party. This new book is an outgrowth of that earlier work, but it is not likely to receive similar acclaim from the scholarly left; for it very much runs against the flow of current academic trends. Most historians today, especially those writing about the period Wilentz is concerned with -- the period of the early Republic from Jefferson to Lincoln -- are interested in what they call ''the new political history.'' They seek to transcend the usual stuff of politics -- elections, parties and the political maneuvering of elite white males in government -- and to provide a history that views politics through the lenses of race, gender and popular culture. So they devote themselves primarily to the symbols and theatrics of politics -- the various ways common people, including women and blacks, expressed themselves and participated in the political process, whether in parades, costume or drinking toasts. These historians believe culture trumps policy and power. They explicitly reject any sort of narrative of dead white males bringing about the triumph of democracy within the two-party system. This, however, is the very subject of Wilentz's book.
 Wilentz is well aware of the new political history. Indeed, elsewhere he has expressed his contempt for it, assailing it as filled with ''bargain basement Nietzsche and Foucault, admixed with earnest American do-goodism, that still passes for 'theory' in much of the academy.'' In opposition to the fashionable emphasis on culture, he wants, he says, to highlight the independent existence and importance of politics. However significant social and cultural developments were to the American people in the early Republic, these developments, he claims, were perceived primarily in political terms -- ''as struggles over contending ideas of democracy.'' From the late 19th century to our own day we are apt to see economics, society or culture as the ground for politics and political institutions. But, Wilentz says, for the people of the early Republic, politics, government and constitutional order, not economics, not society, not culture, were still the major means by which the world and the men who ran it were interpreted.
 He therefore feels justified in making this in-your-face challenge to the new political historians and in writing this old-fashioned narrative. By focusing on men like Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln, however, he does ''not mean to say the presidents and other great men were solely responsible for the vicissitudes of American politics,'' since ordinary Americans had a profound influence on the exercise of power. ''But just as political leaders did not create American democracy out of thin air, so the masses of Americans did not simply force their way into the corridors of power.'' Leaders were always important. It is a fact of life, he writes, ''that some individuals have more influence on history than others,'' even if they cannot make history as they please.
 Conceived as a narrative, his book, Wilentz explains, ''can be read as a chronicle of American politics from the Revolution to the Civil War with the history of democracy at its center, or as an account of how democracy arose in the United States (and with what consequences) in the context of its time.'' His huge work is divided into three sections, each a good-sized book in itself: the first (almost 200 pages), entitled ''The Crisis of the New Order,'' on the Jeffersonians; the second and the heart of the book (340 pages), entitled ''Democracy Ascendant,'' on the Jacksonians; and the third (270 pages), entitled ''Slavery and the Crisis of American Democracy,'' on the coming of the Civil War. These sections are bounded by a prologue and an epilogue. 
 The rise of democracy, Wilentz points out, was not a given from the outset. It ''developed piecemeal, by fits and starts, at the state and local as well as the national level.'' It emerged, he says, through a constant struggle among different groups that cut across distinctions of wealth, power and interest (though they often claim the same democratic ideals). In order to demonstrate this struggle, Wilentz takes us through all the national elections (and some of the state ones), the presidential administrations, many of the Congressional bills passed and defeated, and much of the complicated political maneuvering of the period. This accumulation of detail nicely recaptures some of the contingency of day-to-day politics that the participants experienced. Along the way Wilentz offers some beautifully drawn and concise vignettes of important events -- like the antislavery printer Elijah Lovejoy's martyrdom, the Amistad affair, the Dorr Rebellion of dissidents in Rhode Island and John Brown's raid -- that are better than many book-length accounts. 
 We can get some idea of where Wilentz is coming from by noting the book that seems to have most influenced him -- Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s Pulitzer Prize-winning history, ''The Age of Jackson.'' Before Schlesinger's book appeared in 1945, Wilentz writes, ''historians thought of American democracy as the product of an almost mystical frontier or agrarian egalitarianism.'' But Schlesinger, reflecting the New Deal perspective of the time, ''toppled that interpretation by placing democracy's origins firmly in the context of the founding generation's ideas about the few and the many, and by seeing democracy's expansion as an outcome of struggles between classes, not sections.'' ''The Age of Jackson,'' Wilentz says, located the origin of modern liberal politics in the belief of Jefferson and Jackson that the demands of the future, in Schlesinger's words, ''will best be met by a society in which no single group is able to sacrifice democracy and liberty to its own interests.'' In 1945, the interest group Schlesinger was most worried about was what he labeled ''the business community'' or ''the capitalists.''
 Although Wilentz is too sophisticated to posit something as crude as ''the business community,'' he nevertheless believes that some sort of class struggle lay behind the politics of the antebellum period. In other words, he writes as a good liberal, but an old-fashioned New Deal one. Like Schlesinger in 1945, he wants in 2005 to speak to the liberalism of the modern Democratic Party. By suggesting that the race, gender and cultural issues that drive much of the modern left are not central to the age of Jackson, Wilentz seems to imply that they should not be central to the future of the present-day Democratic Party. 
 A S he was for Schlesinger, Andrew Jackson is Wilentz's hero. Jackson's presidential victory in 1828, he writes, ''marked the culmination of more than 30 years of American democratic development.'' In fact, Wilentz may help to recover the descriptive rubric ''the age of Jackson,'' which has fallen out of favor since Schlesinger wrote his book. In his account of the politics of the time, Wilentz includes all the usual personalities and anecdotes -- the Eaton affair, the clashes with Calhoun, the Bank veto -- and he generally comes down on the side of Jackson and the Jacksonians. He even makes credible Jackson's radical monetary actions, including the bizarre policy of removing all the federal government's specie deposits from state banks and placing them in the Treasury vaults, where they would have little effect on the money supply or the economy. 
 In 1957, Bray Hammond, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning study, ''Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War,'' severely criticized Jackson's banking and monetary policies, suggesting that they were backed by state bankers and others who wanted a free hand in running their commercial affairs. But Wilentz shows that Jackson, unlike Jefferson, was no promoter of laissez-faire economics. Instead, his antibank policies were devised to keep private interests, particularly speculative and business interests, out of the government. ''The key to Jacksonian politics,'' Wilentz says, was ''a belief that relatively small groups of self-interested men were out to destroy majority rule and, with it, the Constitution.'' The Jacksonian Democrats ''assumed that politics and government institutions remained the primary locus of power,'' and that power was to be used to protect the majority of ''producers'' -- farmers, mechanics and other workers in the society -- from ''a nonproducer elite'' composed of bankers, speculators and other moneyed men. ''If they did not invent democracy,'' he writes, ''the Jacksonians did make this way of thinking the basic credo of American liberal democracy.'' There's a hint in all this history that the present-day Democratic Party might greatly improve its bearings by going back to its Jacksonian roots. 
 These days, most historians would not look to Jackson for anything worthwhile. Indeed, modern scholars have bashed Jackson nearly as much as they have Jefferson, picturing him as a raging fanatic, a passionate slaveholder and a violent Indian-hater who removed Native Americans to the trans-Mississippi West and created the ''trail of tears.'' This sort of criticism did not exist 60 years ago. Schlesinger never even mentioned Indian removal in ''The Age of Jackson''; in fact, he has no entry for Indians in his index. Unlike Schlesinger, however, Wilentz confronts the issue head on, offering a generally impartial account. Nor does he deny the many contradictions and dilemmas of Jacksonian egalitarianism, especially on racial matters and slavery. He concedes, for example, that the Jacksonians celebrated the expansion of white suffrage in some of the Northern states in the 1830's, giving the vote even to white aliens, at the very time they were taking the franchise away from free blacks who had voted for a generation or more (mostly for Federalists and Whigs). Wilentz also admits that the Jacksonians tolerated slavery and were friendlier than their opponents to efforts that would widen its spread. But he denies the charge of some historians that this made the Jacksonians a proslavery party. In short, he makes no attempt to hide the flaws of either Jackson or the Jacksonian Democrats.
 He does, however, provide as powerful a defense of Jackson and Jacksonianism as we are likely to get in this day and age. Wilentz insists that the various recent interpretations of the Jacksonian era contain only partial truths. These are the studies that emphasize an entrepreneurial consensus over economic conflicts; that believe religion, ethnicity and other cultural issues drove Jacksonian politics; that contend the Jacksonian Democratic Party was an alliance of slaveholders and racists eager to clear out the Indians in order to make the imperial republic safe for slavery; and that depict Jacksonianism as a movement of subsistence farmers and urban workers resisting capitalism. ''All of them,'' he says, ''slight the dynamic and unstable character of the Democracy's rise and development, and the primacy of politics and political thinking in the conflicts of the era.'' And none of them can take away from the fact that the Jacksonians ''created the first mass democratic national political party in modern history.''
 Wilentz is especially anxious to distinguish the Jacksonian Democrats from the Whigs. The Democrats, he writes, were economic radicals intent on creating a hard-money currency regulated by the federal government. By contrast, the Whigs believed in a ''credit-and-paper, boom-and-bust'' economic system. Moreover, he denies the claim of some historians that the Whigs were the optimistic party of active government and the Democrats the pessimistic party of laissez-faire. If anything, he says, the opposite was true. To Wilentz the Whigs resemble the Republicans of today. ''As long as the Whigs appeared to be the party of the rich and privileged,'' he says, ''they would never win a national election.'' But in 1840 they reinvented themselves as the party of the people. ''For the Whigs to purport to represent the people,'' Wilentz says, ''they had to talk more like the people, or how they thought the people talked.'' So they stressed American exceptionalism, denied the existence of classes and ''with a combination of calculation and improvisation'' mastered the art of popular flattery, repackaging their message in order to bamboozle the public. The Whigs even had their own boy genius, the 43-year-old insider-manipulator Thurlow Weed. The Whigs, Wilentz writes, were especially successful in ''reorienting debates along ethical and cultural lines that cut across differences of wealth and class.'' If they could have conceived of gay marriage, they would have used the issue.
 Good Democrat that he is, Wilentz cannot quite believe that the Whigs in 1840 (any more than the present-day Republicans) truly represented the majority of the people. The Democrats were natural democrats, the Whigs artificial ones. The Democrats never doubted that ''they were the constitutional party of the sovereign people.'' Thus it was only a matter of time before the fraudulence of the Whigs would be exposed. It was the issue of slavery that finally destroyed the Whig Party. (Although slavery broke the Democrats apart, it did not destroy them.) 
 A merica's politicians tried from the beginning to table the explosive issue of slavery -- to bury it, postpone it and hope against hope that it would just go away. But it would not disappear. By the 1840's the many-sided conflicts over American democracy, Wilentz says, came to focus on thefate of slavery. By then it had become increasingly clear that the free-labor North and the slave-ridden South had developed two very different systems of democracy. While those two systems often appealed to the same ideals and values, and were ''linked through the federal government and the national political parties,'' they were ''fundamentally antagonistic.'' Despite the leaders' attempts to suppress these antagonisms, ''by 1860 the conflict could no longer be contained, as a democratic election sparked Southern secession and the war that would determine American democracy's future.'' 
 It is one of the many ironies of American history that the wildfire spread of democratic politics in both the North and the South eventually made it impossible to solve the problem of slavery peaceably. To learn how the triumph of democracy nearly destroyed the United States, this book is a good place to start.

HEADLINE: How One Man Helped Revive New Brunswick

BYLINE: By Terry Golway. 
TerryGolway@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK 

 BODY:
JOHN HELDRICH will look you in the eye and tell you that he is ''trying to disengage.''
 ''I know what my role is now,'' he said. ''I'm the old sage.''
If this sounds like a man getting ready for daily tee times, early-bird specials and bus rides to Atlantic City, don't believe it. The old sage of New Brunswick, who will turn 80 in January, still has work to do -- maybe even more than he realizes. 
 Mr. Heldrich has been immersed in the revival of this Middlesex County city for nearly 40 years. And since 1989, he has served as founding chairman of the state Employment and Training Commission, which works with politicians, educators, labor leaders and corporate executives on workforce issues.
 On Tuesday, voters went to the polls to choose a new governor without hearing very much from the candidates about the cities or about how we are educating and training tomorrow's work force. Granted, neither of these issues can be easily resolved. Still, the absence of any debate on these issues suggests that Mr. Heldrich's work is far from done.
 Growing up in New Brunswick, this son of German immigrants learned as a child the importance of community. It ranked just after religion and family, he said. That lesson prepared him for an assignment he never anticipated, one given to him four decades ago as a young executive at Johnson & Johnson, the economic mainstay of his native city.
 In 1968, the chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, Philip B. Hoffman, summoned a rattled Mr. Heldrich to the company's fifth-floor executive suite. ''You went there only to be hired or fired,'' he said.
 But another kind of fate awaited Mr. Heldrich. His boss had just returned from the White House, where he met with President Lyndon B. Johnson and business leaders to discuss the plight of the nation's cities. (What a concept!) Businesses were fleeing to the suburbs, and there was some question about whether Johnson & Johnson would stay in New Brunswick. The city, like so many, bore the scars of riot and flight.
 The boss told Mr. Heldrich that he wanted somebody to work with community leaders to help pull New Brunswick from the abyss. Mr. Heldrich got the job, he said, because his boss knew he was a native of the city and knew something about it. As Mr. Heldrich nodded and headed toward the door, Mr. Hoffman pointed a well-chewed cigar at the younger man and reminded him: ''Just remember. I've never failed at anything.''
 The story of New Brunswick's transformation into the anti-Newark or anti-Camden -- a city that managed to retain enough jobs, people and capital to muddle through the 70's without collapsing -- has many personal and institutional heroes. 
 Of course, Johnson & Johnson and Rutgers University recommitted themselves to the city. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital focused on community service and economic development, rather than on political deal-making. Mayors John Lynch and James Cahill used their considerable power to staunch the bleeding.
 And then there was John Heldrich, charged with making sure that neither the city nor his boss failed.
 Mr. Heldrich's role in New Brunswick's revival is celebrated in the city of his birth, so much so that a $110-million office and residential building, which is expected to open downtown next year, will be called Heldrich Plaza. 
 Yet beyond the banks of the Raritan River, Mr. Heldrich's role as a civic savior is not well-known. In some ways, he is to New Brunswick what Felix Rohatyn is to New York: a civic-minded business leader who figured out how to bring people together to help heal a city.
 After getting his assignment, Mr. Heldrich met with executives from the Rouse Corporation, an urban planning company, and eventually formed an organization called New Brunswick Tomorrow to forge the city's revival. Another organization, New Brunswick Development Corp., turned those plans into reality.
 ''At the time, New Brunswick, like other cities, didn't have an economic development office,'' Mr. Heldrich recalled. ''We became a catalyst.''
 Working with community groups as well as politicians, executives and anybody who could offer help, Mr. Heldrich and others turned the tide in New Brunswick by the late 1980's.
 ''The experience taught me that big government is not the solution,'' he said. ''The local community has to stand up, too.''
 His work led directly to his current interest in workforce issues, from technical training to literacy. Still, he can't help himself when it comes to his favorite city.
 ''I spend a lot of time these days with people who come in to see me to talk about their ideas for the city,'' he said. ''I get excited by certain things, and I get upset about certain things.''
 In other words, the passion and drive are still there. It seems fair to believe that the old sage's attempts to ''disengage'' are doomed to failure.
 For New Brunswick, that is a good thing.

HEADLINE: Timed Deposits: Small Banks Finding a Niche, One Branch at a Time

BYLINE: By STACY ALBIN

 BODY:
OPENING a one-branch bank bucks the industry trend: big banks are in. But that is what Community National Bank has done in Great Neck.
 ''The reason we opened is there's really a void in the community banking arena in Long Island,'' Stuart H. Lubow, the bank's chief executive and president, said.
It is not unusual to see community banks -- generally those with less than $1 billion in assets -- swallowed up on Long Island by large national banking companies. For instance, Roslyn Savings Bank, a Long Island-based thrift, merged with New York Community Bancorp in 2003. Since then, New York Community Bancorp has said its assets have increased to $25 billion, making it the fifth-largest thrift in the country, and it is negotiating to buy two more banks, the Atlantic Bank of New York and the Long Island Financial Corporation.
 Fewer than 10 community bank companies remain on the Island. Despite this trend, Community National opened with a single branch, on Middle Neck Road, in April and plans to open a second branch on Franklin Avenue in Garden City in the first quarter next year. Community National had deposits of about $24 million, according to a June report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; by comparison, New York Community Bancorp had $11 billion. 
 Mr. Lubow said banks like Community National had a specific niche, with loans tailored to smaller businesses and more personal service for businesses and individuals.
 ''What we're all about is being the anti-big bank,'' he said. 
 Community National seeks to make loans from $5,000 to $5 million, Mr. Lubow said. The loans often involve commercial real-estate developers for projects like constructing strip malls, converting warehouses into condominiums in Brooklyn or turning Manhattan lofts into apartments, Mr. Lubow said. 
 As part of the small-bank culture, borrowers can talk directly to a senior commercial lender or the bank president about the intricacies of their business, Mr. Lubow said, rather than someone who passes information to a decision-maker. He also said there was less turnover among officials at community banks.
 Community National also has the ability to be ''flexible in terms of amortization rates or prepayment penalties,'' Mr. Lubow said. 
 Community National is not alone. The culture at Bridgehampton National Bank, which has 11 locations, is similar, except that its business customers are mainly marine businesses, landscapers and retail stores, all having fewer than 10 employees.
 Regional and community bank presidents say there is more to community banking than just ready access to the decision-makers, though. 
 ''Most banks offer some variant of the same products,'' said John Adam Kanas, the chairman, president and chief executive of North Fork Bancorp, a regional bank based in Melville. ''Interest rate structures are really the same and almost all banks offer the same products.'' 
 But service is another story, he said. ''The smaller banks have done a better job of hand-holding their customers,'' Mr. Kanas said. 
 At North Fork, for instance, employees greet customers with a handshake or by calling them by name, Mr. Kanas said. 
 And at the Bank of Smithtown, customers are acknowledged by representatives who ask, ''How can I help?'' and lead them to the appropriate area of the bank and handle the transaction, said Bradley E. Rock, the chairman, president and chief executive at Smithtown. 
 Even the setting has a personal feel, he said, noting that the interior of some branches resemble a living room, where customers sit next to the representative and directly view the bank's computer monitor.
 ''I think it's a much friendlier environment,'' Mr. Rock said. ''We find that customers like that a lot more.'' 
 As for its financial health, the Bank of Smithtown's earnings per share for the third quarter increased by 11 percent over the same period last year. Its deposits also grew by about 36 percent for the first nine months this year, an increase Mr. Rock attributed to the opening of three branches in the last year. The bank, which has its headquarters in Hauppauge, now has 13 branches.
 ''In other years, we have not opened that many offices,'' he said.
 Still, the Bank of Smithtown, with $704 million, had less than 1 percent of the deposits among Long Island banks as of June, according to a report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The report ranked the Bank of Smithtown 16th in market share of Long Island deposits. 
 North Fork, which has 126 Long Island branches, was ranked No. 1, with more than 20 percent of Long Island deposits, followed by J. P. Morgan Chase with about 14 percent and Citibank with about 10 percent. New York Community Bank, with 62 Long Island branches, came in at No. 6 with slightly more than 7 percent of the market. 
 According to the insurance corporation's June report, banks with fewer than five locations each had less than 1 percent of the deposit market. A Glen Cove company, American Community Bank, for instance, had slightly less than $70 million in deposits, the report said. 
 Community banks emphasize word of mouth as one of the best means of advertising. And to gain the attention of new customers, community banks often emphasize their place in the community and sponsor cultural events, like a restaurant week or an art festival.
 Bridgehampton National Bank seems to have taken the idea a step further by promoting the local Community Preservation Fund. The fund is established by individual municipalities, and its coffers are filled by a tax on the sale of properties so the municipality will have money on hand to buy land for open-space preservation. 
 From a bank's perspective, the project is atypical, said Sandra Novick, Bridgehampton's director of marketing. ''It was somewhat unpopular in the first place because banks make money on developing properties, not preserving them,'' she said. 
 But Bridgehampton National, which has deposits of $193 million, looks on the project as helping to maintain the character of the East End as a marine and agricultural setting. 
 The bank has also issued a letter of credit to help preserve a Native American archaeological site, Fort Corchaug in Cutchogue. 
 Thomas J. Tobin, the bank's chief executive and president, said Bridgehampton National was the ''only financial institution providing cash flows to East End towns to purchase land.'' 
 ''Our understanding of land-preservation issues, be it municipal or private, sets us apart from any bank large or small,'' he said.
 While community programs are often part of marketing campaigns, they cannot always help community banks compete with national bank companies' advertising campaigns. 
 Mr. Rock said that was especially a problem in attracting new credit-card business. The Bank of Smithtown offers what Mr. Rock described as terms competitive with those of Capital One and Chase banks. But capturing more of the market would take a lot of marketing, he said. 
 ''We can't spend $10 million on a marketing campaign for our credit cards,'' Mr. Rock said.

HEADLINE: How to Make Employees Take Their 401(k) Medicine

BYLINE: By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
WITH more than $2 trillion invested in 401(k) retirement plans, it is hard to argue with their popularity. But a check under the hood of the 401(k), the primary retirement savings vehicle for Americans, shows a rash of problems that can send many plans back to the shop for overhauls.
 A sizable minority of eligible workers -- 30 percent -- do not participate in company plans, 401(k) specialists note. That fact, they say, combined with meager savings rates of those who do participate, poor allocation choices and misguided corporate policy decisions are evidence that 401(k)'s are not operating on all cylinders.
''That may not be surprising, but it is concerning,'' said Lori Lucas, director of participant research at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., ''especially when you consider the increasing role that the 401(k) plays in Americans' retirement.'' 
 According to Hewitt research, 64 percent of plan sponsors who responded to a recent survey said that the 401(k) was now their company's primary retirement vehicle, up from 35 percent a decade ago. ''Yet we have not seen a corresponding trend in the utilization of the plans,'' Ms. Lucas said.
 The failure of many employees even to participate in their 401(k)'s -- or to save enough in them for retirement when they do sign up -- now has the attention of corporate boards. ''A decade ago there was a laissez-faire attitude on the part of the corporate sponsor,'' said Russell K. Ivinjack, a principal at Ennis Knupp, a Chicago firm that provides consulting services to more than 50 defined-contribution plans. ''Now we try to avoid the word 'paternalism,' but that's what is going on. Corporations are taking action to make sure the participant does what is needed to succeed.'' 
 It involves more than tinkering. ''The paradigm has been fractured,'' said Stephen P. Utkus, director of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research. ''It used to be that we viewed the participant as the motivated manager, and the sponsor and plan provider would just supply the education. Now the participant is asking for help, not education.''
 It is easy to see why. ''In the beginning it took me less than a minute to explain to someone how their plan worked,'' said Ted Benna, chief operating officer at the Malvern Benefits Corporation in Williamsport, Pa. Mr. Benna designed the first 401(k) plan in 1981. ''Today if I tried, it would take forever to explain and I would still not get the job done well,'' said Mr. Benna. When 401(k)'s started, they offered one or two investment options, but many plans today carry 20 or more mutual funds, as well as company stock and self-directed brokerage options. 
 Starting in January, plans could have yet another option to explain: the new Roth 401(k), in which employees invest after-tax dollars but all withdrawals are tax-free. That can be an advantage over traditional 401(k)'s, in which contributions are made with pretax dollars but all withdrawals are taxed. The complexity of educating participants about this new twist, and the fact that the Roth option will expire in 2010 unless Congress extends current legislation, have dampened corporate enthusiasm for adding the Roth option to existing 401(k) plans. 
 Investors have also been less enthusiastic about managing their 401(k)'s since the bear market of 2000 to 2002. And overseeing a plan is also proving more difficult for companies. In the wake of the WorldCom and Enron meltdowns, which prompted huge 401(k) losses for employees who had company stock in their accounts, corporate boards are facing a steady stream of lawsuits challenging the suitability of having a company's own stock in a 401(k). 
 There is also a river of research showing how current plan policies fail to encourage participants' success. ''All the behavioral finance research that documents the pull of inertia and inaction in our investing decisions perfectly applies to 401(k)'s,'' said Mr. Utkus at Vanguard. ''In the past year or two, we are seeing sponsors and providers putting it all together and beginning to move toward 401(k) structures that address the shortcoming of human behavior.'' Companies are automatically enrolling workers in 401(k)'s, for example, and increasing their contribution rates over time.
 Academic research also suggests that corporate boards have their own 401(k) shortcomings. Two finance professors at Emory University, Amit Goyal and Sunil Wahal, examined the hiring and firing of investment managers by about 3,700 plan sponsors from 1994 through 2003. (Professor Wahal has since moved to Arizona State University.) They found that companies tended to choose investment firms to manage plans based on the firms' recent returns, but that those managers tended not to beat their benchmarks after the hiring. And when companies dismissed firms after underperformance, the firm's returns tended to bounce back. 
 So far, the biggest shift is toward automatic enrollment of employees into 401(k)'s; in other words, the opt-in model is being supplanted by the opt-out. Hewitt says that 19 percent of corporate sponsors use an automatic enrollment system, and that an additional 47 percent say they plan to start using such a system soon. 
 Sponsors are also concluding that too much choice may not be good; while just 35 percent of plans surveyed by Hewitt in 2001 offered a lifestyle fund -- a one-fund-does-all choice holding a mix of stocks and bonds -- 63 percent offer this simplified solution today. ''For the majority of participants this is the right choice,'' Mr. Benna said. 
 Another problem is that many employees who participate in 401(k)'s do not set aside enough money in them, specialists say. While the average amount saved is 7.9 percent of salary, some 22 percent of participants don't even save enough to get the maximum company match.
 Corporate sponsors aren't much help. In plans with automatic enrollment, 58 percent set the participant's default savings rate at just 3 percent of salary, while 22 percent set it at 2 percent. An automated system pioneered by two leading behavioral finance economists, Shlomo Benartzi of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago, increases a participant's savings rate by one percentage point or so at each pay raise. According to the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a nonprofit group that represents the interests of plan participants and sponsors, about one-third of plans that offer automatic enrollment also now include an automated increase of the savings rate. 
 ''Five years ago that was zero,'' said David Wray, president of the council. 
 Industry experts say corporate boards also need to change their approach to choosing their plans' default investment -- the one used when participants don't indicate where they want their money invested. Many plans use a money market or stable-value fund as the default. That may appear to be prudent, but it is hard to meet one's retirement goals by earning just 3 percent annually in a money market fund. ''Sponsors need to set the default to an age-appropriate mix of stocks and bonds,'' Mr. Ivinjack said. ''It's the hardest decision a board has to make, but if you are adhering to long-term diversification principles, you can be comfortable with making that decision.''
 Company stock in 401(k)'s also remains an issue. In the past, many companies matched employees' contributions with company stock and restricted the workers' ability to sell it. After the Enron and WorldCom debacles, sponsors loosened the rules to allow employees to sell the stock and move the proceeds to other investments. Still, few people make the choice to opt out of what they are put into.
 ''There is still way too much company stock in 401(k)'s,'' said Rick Meigs, who runs 401khelpcenter.com, a clearinghouse of information for plan participants and sponsors. ''It is inevitable we will see more Enrons.''
 THE growth in managed accounts is another controversial development. By signing up for a managed account, a participant cedes investing decisions to a third-party manager who charges an annual fee -- typically 0.5 to 1 percent of assets. That fee is on top of the expenses of the plan's underlying funds, so the combined fees paid by participants can add up to a hefty 2 percent or more a year. 
 ''I realize participants want help,'' said Matthew Gnabasik, a 401(k) consultant and the founder of the Blue Prairie Group in Chicago. ''But my question for sponsors is, what's the best way to give them that help? An expensive managed account, or a lifestyle fund that is substantially less expensive and can achieve a lot of the same diversification?'' 
 Mr. Ivinjack concurred, adding that only when the account manager charges 0.25 percent or less ''does it become attractive.'' 
 Fees in general are the next big pressure point for corporate boards, many of which have not done much bargaining with plan providers. Mr. Wray of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council says the emergence of consultants who focus solely on fees means that ''more plans are going to get the haggle rate rather than the rack rate.'' That could be a boon for 401(k) participants. 
 ''Sponsors are beginning to acknowledge that if you simply reduce plan expenses by half a percentage point a year,'' Mr. Meigs said, ''it is going to have a sizable impact on participants' success.''

HEADLINE: Real Energy Savers Don't Wear Cardigans. Or Do They?

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
WHEN oil and gas prices surged after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, President Bush appealed to Americans to conserve energy. He asked people to cut back on nonessential travel, for example, and to carpool to work. Then, in October, the White House started a campaign for energy conservation in American homes, dusting off some old ideas like switching to fluorescent light bulbs and installing better insulation in attics. 
 Some critics derided the program as a bizarre flashback from the 1970's -- a collection of worn-out ideas that evoked feelings of deprivation and gloom. It will be a pity, though, if an effective energy policy never gets off the ground. Much has been learned since the 70's about what works and what doesn't. Clearly, energy conservation isn't what it used to be. 
The preferred term these days, however, is energy efficiency -- something that economics and even chief executives can relate to. The phrase implies getting more out of what we have -- and that's not gloomy at all. Technology can deliver increased benefits with less energy, in effect replacing some of that electricity and oil with brain power. And efficiency holds the promise of greater satisfaction, not self-sacrifice.
 There are reasons for optimism. One is that market forces can help provide solutions: higher prices, on their own, can make people cut back. Just how responsive consumers are to price changes -- what economists call the elasticity of demand -- has been the focus of much research. Today, economists believe that they have developed a pretty good rule of thumb for energy use. In the case of electricity, which is relatively easy to measure, they have found that when the price rises 10 percent, electricity use falls roughly 3 percent. At the gas pump, a 10 percent increase in price leads to a decline of around 2 percent in demand.
 Consumer behavior can change quickly in a crisis. A study by Peter C. Reiss, a professor of economics at Stanford, and Matthew W. White, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, provides some recent evidence. In examining San Diego households during the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, they found that use of electricity dropped surprisingly fast. In the summer of 2000, within 60 days of seeing monthly electric bills rise by about $60 -- an increase of 130 percent -- the average household cut its use of electricity by 12 percent. 
 That kind of drop requires a big change in behavior. The authors found that households had turned off air-conditioners in the middle of summer and had invested in new energy-efficient appliances, among other things.
 High costs aren't the only force that will influence consumers to cut back. Although public appeals to save energy may be ridiculed by comedians on late-night television -- recall President Jimmy Carter's cardigan sweater -- the efforts can have a substantial impact. 
 Professors Reiss and White found that to be true in San Diego. In February 2001, with electricity prices capped, the state of California began a campaign to have households conserve electricity. It worked. ''It was clear by about six months into 2001 that public appeals were having a big impact,'' Professor White said. Such campaigns can have significant effects on consumer behavior, he said, if they offer a clear explanation of what people can do and how it will make a difference.
 Perhaps the most important reason for optimism is technology's role in promoting energy savings. From 1979 to 1985, in the aftermath of energy shortages, Americans reduced their oil consumption by 15 percent. The single biggest factor was a shift in car-buying habits. Americans found that driving fuel-efficient cars, instead of gas guzzlers, didn't stop them from going where they wanted to go. The shift also had a big macroeconomic effect, sending world oil prices tumbling and setting the stage for two decades of low energy costs.
 During those decades, energy conservation would gradually fade from public view. But higher prices are again capturing the public's attention. Big companies are finding ways to conserve energy to improve the bottom line. Last month, Wal-Mart announced a plan to cut energy use in its stores, to double the fuel efficiency of its trucks and to minimize the use of packaging. Consumers are changing their habits, too. Sales of S.U.V.'s, for example, have fallen and automakers that bet heavily on cheap energy are suffering declining fortunes.
 How much more energy-efficient can we become? Amory B. Lovins, chief executive of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research group in Snowmass, Colo., says that a barrel of oil today already does twice as much work as it did in 1975. Mr. Lovins calculates that by moving to vehicles that consume less fuel, the nation could double that efficiency again. 
 Because vehicles account for 40 percent of total domestic oil consumption, there is a big opportunity for savings. According to Mr. Lovins, hybrids like the Toyota Prius use just half the oil of typical vehicles, and an ultralight version of a hybrid could halve that consumption again. If everyone drove an ultralight hybrid, national oil consumption would drop 28 percent over all. And moving to new fuel technology for big trucks and aircraft could produce similar savings. 
 IN the case of electricity, waste is glaringly apparent. About 5 percent of the electricity consumed in United States households is simply lost to computers, televisions and other appliances that are turned off but still plugged in. The savings from using electricity more efficiently could be even larger than those from oil, Mr. Lovins says. Rate structures in most states, he says, still reward utilities for selling more electricity. One solution is to decouple the profits of utilities from their sales volumes, and to let utilities keep as profit some of the savings they achieve for their customers.
 Energy efficiency tends to increase as technology becomes better and cheaper. The prices of some energy-efficient kitchen appliances, for example, are now similar to those of other models. And the Internet, which wasn't around for the conservation efforts of the 1970's, can also be a powerful ally. Consider its potential for real-time billing of electricity consumption at home. If households can see at any moment how much they are spending on energy, they can better decide whether changing their habits makes economic sense. 
 In the end, the most effective energy policy won't be one that fights against market forces. It will be one that helps them work better.

HEADLINE: The Great Global Buyout Bubble

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
A YEAR ago this week, Henry R. Kravis, the legendary buyout mogul who invented the modern-day private equity industry, gave a rare speech to a group of investors in a ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. In describing how far the business had come, Mr. Kravis, a slight man with a dry wit, recounted how difficult it had been for him to raise $355 million to buy one of his first companies, Houdaille Industries, in 1979. 
 ''The availability of financing was our biggest challenge,'' he said. ''Literally, we had to add up the potential capital sources at that time, which consisted of several banks and insurance companies, and one by one go out and raise the money.''
Today, he has the opposite problem. Investors have been throwing money at the red-hot leveraged-buyout industry -- so much so that Mr. Kravis now has to turn away some of them, rejecting their cash as a mere ''commodity.'' 
 Private equity firms, it seems, now own everything: Hertz, Neiman Marcus, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Toys ''R'' Us and Warner Music, to name a few. So far this year, buyout firms have spent more than $130 billion gobbling up parts of corporate America. And with more than another $100 billion in unspent money this year still swirling around the industry, there is a lot more buying to be done. The boom isn't limited to America: in Britain buyout firms own so many companies that they now employ 18 percent of the private sector, according to the British Venture Capital Association.
 The trillion-dollar question is whether these shopaholics are setting themselves up for a giant fall. If the market begins to show even the faintest signs of strain, this bubble may pop, say many financial analysts as well as private equity players themselves. If that happens, the leveraged-buyout boom and bust that Michael Milken led in the 1980's could end up looking like a dress rehearsal for the mess to come. As Mr. Kravis said during his speech: ''Unfortunately, there is a flip side to having access to plentiful capital. It means that too many people without experience in building businesses have too much money.'' 
 The numbers tell the story. Over the last three years, private equity firms have had record returns through a series of quick flips, spurred in part by superlow interest rates that allowed them to borrow huge sums of money. As a result, big institutional investors like pension funds have poured $491 billion into the business, according to Thomson Venture Economics, a firm that tracks data for the industry. If you figure that the firms can borrow three to five times that amount -- a conservative assumption -- the industry has more than $2 trillion in purchasing power.
 But here's the rub: In the next three years, to reap returns on all those big-name investments they have been making, private equity firms are going to have to sell $500 billion worth of assets. The question is, to whom? Even in the last three years, in as big a bull market as they come, private equity has never sold more than $153.2 billion in a year, according to Freeman & Company. At the same time, the investment firms will have to keep spending. And the low-hanging fruit has already been taken.
 ''There's no question this is going to end badly for some,'' said Colin C. Blaydon, a professor at the Tuck School of Management at Dartmouth and the dean emeritus of its Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship. ''It's almost a classic boom-bust cycle. When you see a big boom, people see the returns, go rushing in, stuff more money in than can be dealt with. Suddenly, something will happen that makes people say: 'Oh, my God! Look at the leverage we've got on these things. Isn't this way too risky? Shouldn't we pull back?' And then the question becomes: Does it crash like a rock or is there an adjustment down over time?''
 ALREADY, there are reminders that the business can turn ugly overnight. Thomas H. Lee Partners, the Boston private equity firm famed for buying Snapple for $135 million in 1992 and selling it two years later to Quaker Oats for $1.7 billion, recently was badly burned on its investment in Refco, the commodities trader that filed for bankruptcy protection last month. While the setback has hardly sunk the Lee firm, it is an illustration of how risky these investments can be.
 Firms may have a particularly tough time exiting some of their investments because investors are taking a more skeptical view of initial public offerings backed by private equity. In recent months, several high-profile quick flips have left critics wondering whether buyout firms were using such offerings simply to line their pockets, rather than using the proceeds to support companies. 
 Earlier this year, the Blackstone Group sold a German chemicals company, the Celanese Corporation, to the public after owning it for less than 12 months. The firm quadrupled its money and all of the proceeds from the offering were used to pay out a special dividend to Blackstone. Mr. Kravis's firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, also quadrupled its money by flipping PanAmSat, the satellite company it owned for less than a year.
 Investor scrutiny of private equity-backed I.P.O.'s forced Warner Music, which is owned by a consortium of buyout firms led by Thomas H. Lee Partners, to scale back its offering significantly: the firms made several last-minute adjustments that kept them from cashing out as much as they had hoped, in part as a way to inspire confidence in the offering.
 According to Dealogic, which tracks the industry, initial public offerings backed by private equity firms have performed worse than other offerings; the average first-day return for a private-equity-backed I.P.O. this year is 8.3 percent, compared with 13.9 percent for other offerings. Analysts ascribe some of that discrepancy to concern by investors that private equity firms will later cash out of their position, depressing the stock price. Over time, though, that gap often narrows and some private equity offerings have outperformed other offerings.
 Then there is the issue of sky-high prices that some private equity firms have been willing to pay for acquisitions. According to Standard & Poor's, buyout firms now pay, on average, about eight times a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- or Ebitda, a common measure of cash flow -- for companies worth more than $1 billion. That is a significant increase from a multiple of about 6.5 only several years ago. Private equity firms have felt comfortable paying more because debt remains so cheap and banks have been willing to allow the firms to add ever-larger amounts of leverage to transactions.
 But if the debt market turns against them -- and it is bound to do so at some point -- potential buyers or public investors may not be willing to pay the same prices. In the consumer retail sector, where private equity firms have paid prices of more than 12 times Ebitda during frenzied auctions, selling may be especially tough. Tommy Hilfiger and Dunkin' Brands are both for sale, and some bidders have already left the auction, a sign that the price may be moving too high.
 ''I'm pessimistic about the economy, interest rates, credit markets, and all that,'' said Hamilton E. James, president of the Blackstone Group. ''I feel people are paying prices that are too full. I think some mistakes will be made. We've pulled in our horns a little. We've become more conservative about the types of companies we buy, the prices we pay, the exit multiple assumptions and so on and so forth.''
 Of course, many people in the industry disagree with the premise that there is a bubble ready to pop. They note that private equity is still only asmall part of the mergers-and-acquisitions and I.P.O. market, and they say that if they've done their homework, they will have made the right bet. 
 Even Mr. James, the economic bear, is still bullish on the overall leveraged-buyout market. ''I have no concern about the markets being big enough to accommodate L.B.O. sponsors getting liquidity for their successful, good-quality portfolio companies,'' he said. ''The very growth of private equity, don't forget, adds a whole other option: the secondary buyout,'' referring to a trend in which private equity firms buy and sell businesses to one another.
 YOU can't argue with that. But not everyone can make a brilliant bet, and headwinds can make things more difficult. 
 The advent of supersized deals also lurks below the surface. For years, buyout firms focused on businesses worth several billions of dollars at most. Today, flush with cash and under pressure to spend it, private equity firms are splurging on huge businesses like Hertz ($15 billion) or SunGard ($11.3 billion). The Computer Sciences Corporation is being eyed for a $12 billion takeover. But selling those businesses or putting them back in the public markets could be even more difficult because of their size.
 How will this shake out? Will the bubble pop? For some, absolutely. There will be bankruptcies, restructurings and fire sales. Others, who made the right bets, may be luckier and be able to ride out the bad years.
 ''In hot markets, you can sell crummy companies,'' Mr. James said. ''In less ebullient markets, the really marginal companies take more than their disproportionate share of the pain. That's where you'll see it.''

HEADLINE: A Comeback Kid for a Dead-End Town

BYLINE: By Paul Clemens. 
Paul Clemens is the author of ''Made in Detroit: A South of 8 Mile Memoir.''

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
ON Tuesday, in perhaps the one election with no national implications -- two black Democrats faced off, and President Bush didn't drop by -- Kwame Kilpatrick was re-elected mayor of Detroit. No real surprise there, as no incumbent has lost in Detroit since 1961. Then again, Mayor Kilpatrick had been well behind in the polls; early that night one of the local television channels projected that the challenger, Freman Hendrix, who was ahead by 19 points in its exit polling, would be Detroit's new mayor. I went to bed, feeling informed, and woke up, like much of Detroit, feeling flummoxed. 
 There are at least three possible things being referred to when someone says ''Detroit.'' There is the city proper, about 900,000 residents and falling, which on Tuesday cast ballots in the mayor's race; there is the metropolitan area of about four million living in uncomfortable coexistence; and there is the American auto industry, for which Detroit is the newspaper shorthand, and which has had a rough go of it lately. 
These three entities are by no means distinct; they are as conflictingly interconnected as a crime family beginning to crumble, and Mr. Kilpatrick -- ''America's first hip-hop mayor,'' a sobriquet he once seemed to relish and now wishes to shed -- finds himself in the position of Michael Corleone, sitting on that park bench at the end of ''Godfather II'': in control, after something of a scare, contemplating how to pick up the pieces. 
 On any warm day in Detroit, one will pass a number of young men in T-shirts bearing images of Al Pacino or Robert De Niro or Marlon Brando as the Don. Recently, shirts featuring the mug shots of actual Mafiosi have become popular, and staring out from an approaching Fruit of the Loom will be Capone or one of his cronies. This was the culture Mayor Kilpatrick came out of, and he embraced its ethos: taking office at 31, he wore pinstripe suits and a diamond earring and traveled with an entourage. Hip-hop trades in stereotypes, and he trotted them out so predictably that his detractors pegged him as a thug. 
 The scandals, when they arrived, were mostly standard issue, but ended up being perceived through a hip-hop lens: leasing a luxury S.U.V. for his wife on taxpayer money; watching as a member of his security detail roughed up an intrusive reporter; running up hefty tabs at taxpayer expense at select hotels and restaurants; and holding a wild party -- still unsubstantiated, intermittently investigated -- at the mayoral residence, the Manoogian Mansion. Little surprise he finished a disappointing second in the open mayoral primary in August, 10 points behind Mr. Hendrix.
 Two days before Tuesday's runoff, however, he said that his primary showing had been ''a message to me.'' From that night on, he said, he'd exhibited to the voters of Detroit ''a tremendous amount of maturation and growth.'' The earring came out, as did the scope of his accomplishments. Rhymes and beats don't cut the grass, plow the snow or pave the streets, but the city has been doing these things better under Mr. Kilpatrick than at any time in recent memory. 
 Though he has taken a great deal of grief for the city's budget deficit -- the auditor general claims Detroit is facing receivership, while Mr. Kilpatrick says the situation is not nearly so dire -- his defense of how the city came to be in this situation is at least partly persuasive. ''We should be getting awards,'' Mr. Kilpatrick said of how his administration has handled a city budget overburdened, as in the auto industry, with too many workers, unsustainable union expectations and spiraling pension and health care costs. (Like the auto industry, Detroit is also losing market share: during the day, Detroit's dwindling population actually drops further, as city residents leave to work in the suburbs.) He may not deserve an award, but with the auto-parts maker Delphi bankrupt, the credit rating at G.M. and Ford junk, and Michigan having the country's highest rate of joblessness, he deserves to at least be graded on a curve.
 The best shot landed against the mayor by Mr. Hendrix -- a former deputy mayor endorsed by the conservative Detroit News, the liberal Detroit Free Press and, unofficially, the Detroit suburbs -- came during a debate. After Mayor Kilpatrick mentioned Coleman Young, the city's first black mayor, Mr. Hendrix snapped back, ''Stop invoking the name of Mayor Young as though you have something in common with him.'' 
 Mr. Hendrix is the mayor's senior by two decades, and his retort was the equivalent of Lloyd Bentsen's ''I knew Jack Kennedy you're no Jack Kennedy'' rebuke to Dan Quayle. Coleman Young is a mythic figure who will forever haunt the city's political landscape; he can play kingmaker from beyond the grave. 
 The best book on an American politician remains A. J. Liebling's ''Earl of Louisiana,'' his 1961 profile of Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana, and its first lines are justly famous: ''Southern political personalities, like sweet corn, travel badly. They lose flavor with every hundred yards away from the patch.'' The same can be said of Detroit political personalities. Coleman Young's appeal couldn't travel beyond the city's 8 Mile Road border, or even into the few remaining white areas of the city itself. 
 Among Detroit's whites, a voting bloc now approaching the nonexistent, Mr. Kilpatrick has proved as unpopular as Coleman Young, getting a negligible percent of their vote Tuesday. His campaign slogan called him ''Our Mayor,'' but whites didn't see themselves included in the plural possessive, nor did those white suburbanites looking for a detente between city and suburb. Yet despite such evidence suggesting that his charms are specific to black Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick's political personality could carry him beyond the city's boundaries, should he choose to try. He is such a talented politician -- so charismatic in person, so knowledgeable on policy, so lacking in discipline in precisely those areas where his detractors wish to see him stumble -- that he puts one in mind of a young Arkansas governor, also elected in his early 30's, who went on to become the first black president of the United States.
 Bill Clinton took the stage with Mayor Kilpatrick at the Rosa Parks memorial in Detroit six days before the vote. If Mr. Kilpatrick, the lawyer son of Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, had little in common with the up-from-Alabama Young, what common ground did he share with ''Mother Parks,'' as he called her, a woman whose last public move had been a lawsuit against the hip-hop duo Outkast? 
 Yet his frequent encomiums of the civil rights icon helped soften his image and close the gap in the polls. ''Service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy,'' Mr. Kilpatrick said, quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his Parks eulogy. Only the worst white racist would deny the legacies of Mrs. Parks and Dr. King, but even the most progressive white voter might have difficulty accepting such a sentiment from a mayor seen as representing a very different movement in black America -- one that, to many, can make no such moral claim. 
 In the closing weeks of the campaign, an ad appeared in a black newspaper accusing four local journalists -- three of them white -- of ''lynching'' the mayor. (No one has yet taken responsibility for the lynching ad: call it the campaign's Swift Boat Veterans moment.) The racism charge, alternately a legitimate complaint and a too-convenient crutch, looked to bea political placebo: the believers bought it, the skeptics scoffed, and the polls moved about an inch. 
 But the election results held evidence that the ad had an impact. The mainstream news media in Detroit is perceived as white and suburban, and by and large it is. Even legitimate criticisms of Mr. Kilpatrick can thus be seen as attacks by outside interests against our mayor. Particularly among younger voters, who overwhelmingly supported the incumbent. 
 ''Fundamentally, modern Detroit exists to build and sell motor cars,'' the historian Arthur Pond wrote in 1940, a quote Coleman Young used in his autobiography, ''and once it quits doing that it will lose its chief reason for existence.'' The most chilling comment of the campaign came from Mr. Kilpatrick last Sunday, when he said Detroit has switched from a ''manufacturing economy to a casino economy.'' Call it postmodern Detroit, one searching for a new reason -- and means -- to exist. 
 The same day Mr. Kilpatrick was elected, voters in suburban Livonia -- the whitest community of more than 100,000 residents in America -- voted to opt out of our regional bus authority, which is as close as metro Detroit comes to mass transit. (The Big Three have never been big fans of mass transit -- this Detroit continues to exist to build and sell motor cars.) ''There's going to be people who'll have to give up their jobs, because they can't afford a car,'' said one proponent of the bus network. ''I don't know what will happen to those people.'' It's pretty clear what will happen: instead of living in Detroit and working in the suburbs, they'll live in Detroit and not work anywhere. 
 Having run as a divider, not a uniter, Kwame Kilpatrick will now have to find a way to work with the suburbs -- to which, according to a recent poll, one-third of Detroiters would move tomorrow if they could -- on these matters and more. That's the bad news. The good news is that Mr. Kilpatrick has now shown he might be politician enough to do it.

HEADLINE: Pity the Rich In Politics: They Tend To Fare Poorly

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
In the first political races of the Republic, virtually every candidate paid his own way -- from handbills and newspaper ads to wining and dining other landowners. Fund-raising was scarce. The campaign staff might have been a horse.
 But personal wealth did not guarantee victory. As the story goes, a young George Washington lost a seat in the Virginia House of Burgesses because he would not spend money on a little merrymaking for voters.
''He said he did not stoop to providing Election Day spirits,'' said Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar. In the next race, Washington provided rum, punch, wine, and hard cider. ''Rookies do learn,'' Mr. Smith said.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg may not have bought a round for New Yorkers on Tuesday, but he added his own twists to this tradition of self-financed political victory as he won re-election by 20 points in a campaign that cost him more than $70 million. He carried half of the black vote, one-third of Hispanics and some working-class neighborhoods, even though he faced a Hispanic Democrat who ran as a man of the people. 
 In triumph, Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $6 billion, has become the new gold standard for the growing number of megamillionaire candidates nationwide who are in need of ideas and images that project a common touch and can win over middle-class voters. Both the mayor and Senator Jon S. Corzine, who spent $43 million to become governor of New Jersey last week, turned their personal fortunes into political assets -- without shouldering the liabilities that self-financing frequently brings.
 This is unusual and reflects savvy and strategy on the part of those two. Wealthy candidates, who bankroll their own campaigns to scare off rivals and avoid fund-raising, lose more often than they win, sometimes losing spectacularly. 
 Tom Golisano, an upstate billionaire, spent $74 million to run for governor in 2002 and won only 14 percent of the vote; he may run again next year. Blair Hull spent $29 million last year against Barack Obama in the Illinois Senate race, but could not even win the nomination. 
 Steve Forbes and Ross Perot lavished tens of millions of dollars on their failed attempts to leap from board rooms to the White House.
 There are roughly 45 millionaires in the United States Senate, but there are other megamillionaires who spent heavily on a campaign and lost. In 2002, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the top 10 self-financed candidates were all defeated; in 2004, so were nearly all of the candidates who spent $1 million or more of their own money.
 ''The number of these candidates keeps getting a little bit greater, because the system is not particularly encouraging to people without money,'' said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a campaign finance expert and lawyer.
 Yet the challenges for self-financed candidates can pile up as high as the $100 bills. Opponents usually lampoon them as aloof, elitist, and out of-touch -- three favorite Democratic adjectives for Mr. Bloomberg. They tend to run as warriors against the status quo, as Mr. Golisano did, but incumbents often have power and influence that money can't beat. And self-financed candidates often bristle under the press scrutiny of their tax returns or their motives for running. Foot-in-mouth disease is not uncommon for moguls-cum-candidates who are used to speaking their mind.
 At worst, they can be seen as trying to buy an election, as some voters said about Michael Huffington, a United States representative who spent $28 million against Dianne Feinstein in the 1994 California Senate race.
 ''Voters can spot a phony a mile away, especially rich phonies,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report in Washington. ''So the bar is very, very high for these guys to win.''
 And spending rules are increasingly complicated, too. A so-called ''millionaire amendment'' in the new federal campaign finance law lets candidates raise more money than usually allowed if their wealthy opponents spend large sums of their own money. Rules for state and local races are all over the map. And the United States Supreme Court is preparing to hear arguments in a case that could prompt justices to reconsider a major precedent in campaign finance law, Buckley v. Valeo, which opened the door widely to self-financed candidates. 
 ''For other wealthy people who look at Bloomberg and think, 'Maybe I'll try too,' they need to know you almost always need more than money,'' Ms. Duffy said.
 To be sure, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Corzine spent overwhelming sums of money on television advertising and other forms of electioneering, and the mayor's opponent, Fernando Ferrer, was hugely outspent. (Mr. Corzine ran against another millionaire, Douglas R. Forrester, who spent less.)
 But they also won over some voters by running as independent, unbeholden free agents. They spent money to identify subgroups of voters and lavish attention on people who never felt political love. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, for example, produced television ads in which the mayor spoke in Mandarin, Russian and Urdu.
 They did not deny their wealth, nor did they embrace it. They simply sought to come across as average Mikes and Jons, humbling themselves by asking people for their vote. At Mr. Bloomberg's victory party on Tuesday night, hot dogs and popcorn were the main courses -- a smart way to avoid embarrassing media stories about a fancy menu.
 ''It's when these candidates seem especially patrician or upper class in their manner or instincts that they have real problems,'' said Andrew J. Polsky, a professor of political science at Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center. ''These two guys go out of their way to be as ordinary as possible. Their diction doesn't set them apart. And voters don't see Bloomberg's jet very much.''
 Humility also goes a long way. ''Nelson Rockefeller would say to people, 'Thanks a thousand,' instead of, 'Thanks a million,' because it made seem more down to earth,'' said Mr. Smith, the executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, who is writing a biography of Mr. Rockefeller, the former New York governor.
 ''His family was behind his campaign, but people didn't just see the wealth -- they saw him asking you, Joe Public, for your vote,'' Mr. Smith said. ''He had a genuine curiosity about people, and he liked people, and voters responded to that.''
 Unlike the very rich who aim for the presidency, the Senate, or state houses, Mr. Bloomberg focused on a job that he thought was a natural fit, and believed voters would see the same. Before politics, Bloomberg the businessman was a successful manager of a communications empire; Bloomberg the candidate offered himself as a manager as well, for a city in economic crisis before and especially after 9/11.
 And given his media savvy from years at Bloomberg L.P., he appreciated the huge role that television can play for wealthy candidates.
 ''For most of American history, businessmen didn't want to climb the political party ladder to high office,'' Mr. Polsky said. ''But all the new mass media made it possible for wealthy candidates to reach people without knocking on their doors.''
 Mr. Bloomberg spent heavily on advertising to ensure a major victory, but Mr. Smith found it telling that he did not claim a new mandate last week. He recalled how President Bush said, after his 2004 re-election, that he had new political capital to spend, and that some voters found this arrogant. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has had both political capital and financial capital, but, Mr. Smith argued, the mayor wins good will for not shoving either in people's faces.
 ''Having money and not coming off as an arrogant snob,'' he said, ''is quite appealing to voters.''

HEADLINE: Tony Blair in Decline

 BODY:
Tony Blair has seen better weeks. While he is still highly popular among Americans, his political standing at home is much diminished, despite having led his Labor Party to a third consecutive electoral victory last spring. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Blair lost his first parliamentary vote since becoming prime minister in 1997, when 49 Labor members revolted against his ill-advised bid to extend the time police can hold terrorism suspects without charges to 90 days from 14. That came as British newspapers were serializing a memoir, written by Mr. Blair's own former ambassador to Washington, which is highly critical of his Iraq diplomacy. The week before, one of Mr. Blair's closest Labor Party political and ideological allies, the pensions minister, David Blunkett, had to quit the cabinet a second time over an embarrassing ethics scandal.
There is a consistent theme to all this. Each setback revolves around foreign or domestic issues on which Mr. Blair stands clearly to the right of much of his own party. 
 When Mr. Blair's own electoral appeal was at its peak, Labor members of Parliament tended to go along grudgingly with his policy initiatives anyway. And in those days, Labor's parliamentary majority was large enough that a few defections scarcely mattered. Now, with reduced support in Parliament and the country, Mr. Blair needs to pay more heed to his critics if he hopes to push through the education, health care and pension reforms he favors before leaving office. 
 The prime minister has already declared that his current term will be his last, and he is expected to step down at some point in the next few years in favor of the man who has capably guided the British economy for the past eight years, the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown. The two men have a complicated relationship, with the intellectually formidable but politically less agile Mr. Brown managing to be both Mr. Blair's chief cabinet partner and chief cabinet rival. 
 Anticipation of this succession is one reason that Mr. Blair's political clout has been ebbing within his own party. But the underlying problem is Mr. Blair's identification with an unpopular and unending war in Iraq. 
 Mr. Blair took a skeptical Britain to war in uncritical partnership with President Bush, invoking the same kind of shoddy intelligence and exaggerated warnings of imminent danger. Support for the war in Britain was always thin. Those who initially backed the decision to invade did so mainly on the basis of Mr. Blair's claims that Iraq had active unconventional weapons programs. When those claims proved empty, Mr. Blair's personal credibility took an enormous hit from which it has never fully recovered. 
 Tony Blair's greatest political strength has always been his remarkable, gifted way with words. In comparison with tongue-twisted American leaders like President Bush, Mr. Blair sounds positively eloquent. But even before the Iraq fiasco, British listeners, who hear him far more frequently, were beginning to find him glib.
 Despite his latest troubles, Mr. Blair is not doomed to becoming a lame duck. But to avoid that, he will need to make peace with his party by adjusting his high-flying leadership style to the new political realities.

HEADLINE: Buy a Home, and Drag Society Down

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
THE recent proposals by President Bush's panel on tax reform led to a debate on whether the mortgage interest deduction was unfair, providing a huge subsidy for the rich while doing little for low-income Americans. But that debate poses a more fundamental question: Is homeownership a social good? 
 It has long been an article of faith among policymakers that homeownership produces a big beneficial spillover to society at large. In the 1920's, Herbert Hoover said a family that owned a home had ''a more wholesome, healthful and happy atmosphere in which to bring up children.'' Franklin Delano Roosevelt said that ''a nation of homeowners is unconquerable.'' 
The government's use of tax incentives to encourage homeownership has a cost, however. The mortgage interest deduction and other subsidies will cost the government roughly $716 billion in lost taxes over the next five years, the president's tax panel said. And the subsidy distorts incentives to invest, pulling money into housing from other parts of the economy. So, are Americans getting value for their money?
 ''Theory suggests there are social benefits to homeownership, but we don't know whether they are large enough to justify the size of the subsidy,'' said Joseph Gyourko, professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ''My gut feeling is that we are oversubsidizing.''
 Arguments for the positive effects from a society of homeowners -- what economists call positive externalities -- stem mainly from the fact that homeowners have a bigger financial stake in their homes than renters do. This motivates them, so the theory goes, to take better care of their houses and communities. In short, it will make them better Americans. 
 The argument seems to be supported by compelling evidence. In a 1998 study, Edward Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard, and Denise DiPasquale, then a social scientist at the University of Chicago who now heads the housing research firm City Research, analyzed data from the General Social Survey, a big national study carried out annually since 1972, and concluded that homeownership did relate to heightened civic activity. 
 For instance, they found that 77 percent of homeowners said they had at some point voted in local elections, while only 52 percent of renters said they had. About 20 percent of renters knew the name of their representative on the school board; 38 percent of homeowners did. Homeowners went to church more, and invested more in the upkeep of their homes.
 But as alluring as the data may be, economists and social scientists haven't been able to determine whether homeownership is actually generating all the positive statistics or whether, instead, it's just that people who vote more are more likely to buy homes. 
 Owning a home relates to a bunch of other things, too, and it doesn't necessarily mean that homeownership causes or encourages them. For instance, according to the 1998 study, homeowners are older, richer, more likely to vote Republican, and more than half of them own guns, while only a quarter of renters do. 
 ''There's a pervasive problem in trying to sort out whether there is something intrinsic about homeownership that causes these externalities or whether the people that become homeowners are the kind of people that generate these externalities,'' said James Poterba, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 A study in 1996 by two economists, Richard K. Green at the University of Wisconsin and Michelle J. White at the University of Michigan, found that children of homeowners had a better chance of finishing high school than the children of renters, especially among low-income populations. And the daughters of homeowners were less likely to become pregnant before turning 18. But social scientists are hard-pressed to explain why homeownership would have this effect.
 Beyond the difficulty of proving that owning a home generates positive social spillover, homeownership may also affect society in negative ways.
 Homeownership limits mobility. According to census data, 31 percent of renters moved in 2003, compared with about 7 percent of homeowners. While this stability can be good for a community, the reduced mobility can become a problem in the face of a local economic downturn. 
 And homeowners may influence social policy to benefit themselves, at the expense of others. In a study of voters in California in 2000, Mr. Glaeser found that homeowners were more likely to restrict new home-building, voting for tough zoning rules and land-use controls. 
 ''Homeowners have spearheaded the movement to limit new housing supply that has artificially inflated housing throughout the U.S.,'' Mr. Glaeser wrote. ''This is the downside to having individuals who have incentives to keep price up.''
 The tax incentives might even be hurting America's inner cities, increasing the segregation of rich and poor. 
 Mr. Gyourko and Richard Voith, a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who is now a partner in Econsult, a consulting firm, have argued that the mortgage interest deduction encourages richer families to buy bigger places in the suburbs and leave the more cramped cities to the poor. 
 ''It reinforces the ability of people to segregate out between higher and lower income,'' Mr. Voith said. ''Whether this outweighs the benefits of homeownership is an open question.''
 Regardless of the debate, little change is likely. President Bush's tax panel proposed only modest changes in housing subsidies: capping the amount of eligible interest and replacing the deduction with a tax credit worth 15 percent of a homeowner's mortgage interest. This plan, the panel said, would be more equitable. But, whatever its merit, the proposal has little chance of becoming law. Trimming the tax deduction would most likely reduce the value of houses of much of the middle and upper classes. 
 Those homeowners are unlikely to appreciate that. Indeed, they are likely to put all the political clout associated with homeownership in the service of protecting the value of their homes.

HEADLINE: Health Economics 101

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

 BODY:
Several readers have asked me a good question: we rely on free markets to deliver most goods and services, so why shouldn't we do the same thing for health care? Some correspondents were belligerent, others honestly curious. Either way, they deserve an answer.
 It comes down to three things: risk, selection and social justice. 
First, about risk: in any given year, a small fraction of the population accounts for the bulk of medical expenses. In 2002 a mere 5 percent of Americans incurred almost half of U.S. medical costs. If you find yourself one of the unlucky 5 percent, your medical expenses will be crushing, unless you're very wealthy -- or you have good insurance.
 But good insurance is hard to come by, because private markets for health insurance suffer from a severe case of the economic problem known as ''adverse selection,'' in which bad risks drive out good.
 To understand adverse selection, imagine what would happen if there were only one health insurance company, and everyone was required to buy the same insurance policy. In that case, the insurance company could charge a price reflecting the medical costs of the average American, plus a small extra charge for administrative expenses.
 But in the real insurance market, a company that offered such a policy to anyone who wanted it would lose money hand over fist. Healthy people, who don't expect to face high medical bills, would go elsewhere, or go without insurance. Meanwhile, those who bought the policy would be a self-selected group of people likely to have high medical costs. And if the company responded to this selection bias by charging a higher price for insurance, it would drive away even more healthy people.
 That's why insurance companies don't offer a standard health insurance policy, available to anyone willing to buy it. Instead, they devote a lot of effort and money to screening applicants, selling insurance only to those considered unlikely to have high costs, while rejecting those with pre-existing conditions or other indicators of high future expenses.
 This screening process is the main reason private health insurers spend a much higher share of their revenue on administrative costs than do government insurance programs like Medicare, which doesn't try to screen anyone out. That is, private insurance companies spend large sums not on providing medical care, but on denying insurance to those who need it most. 
 What happens to those denied coverage? Citizens of advanced countries -- the United States included -- don't believe that their fellow citizens should be denied essential health care because they can't afford it. And this belief in social justice gets translated into action, however imperfectly. Some of those unable to get private health insurance are covered by Medicaid. Others receive ''uncompensated'' treatment, which ends up being paid for either by the government or by higher medical bills for the insured. So we have a huge private health care bureaucracy whose main purpose is, in effect, to pass the buck to taxpayers.
 At this point some readers may object that I'm painting too dark a picture. After all, most Americans too young to receive Medicare do have private health insurance. So does the free market work better than I've suggested? No: to the extent that we do have a working system of private health insurance, it's the result of huge though hidden subsidies. 
 Private health insurance in America comes almost entirely in the form of employment-based coverage: insurance provided by corporations as part of their pay packages. The key to this coverage is the fact that compensation in the form of health benefits, as opposed to wages, isn't taxed. One recent study suggests that this tax subsidy may be as large as $190 billion per year. And even with this subsidy, employment-based coverage is in rapid decline.
 I'm not an opponent of markets. On the contrary, I've spent a lot of my career defending their virtues. But the fact is that the free market doesn't work for health insurance, and never did. All we ever had was a patchwork, semiprivate system supported by large government subsidies. 
 That system is now failing. And a rigid belief that markets are always superior to government programs -- a belief that ignores basic economics as well as experience -- stands in the way of rational thinking about what should replace it.

HEADLINE: Heavy Hand of the Secret Police Slows Reform in the Arab World 

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Suha Maayeh contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
At a cultural festival last year, Sameer al-Qudah recited a poem of his depicting Arab rulers as a notch below pirates and highwaymen on the scale of honorable professions. Within days, Jordan's intelligence police summoned him. 
 Mr. Qudah, sentenced to a year in jail for a similar offense in 1996, was apprehensive but not surprised. The secret police, or mukhabarat in Arabic, is one of the most powerful and ubiquitous forces in the Arab world. Jordan's network had surreptitiously videotaped his reading.
''We are hungry for freedoms like the right to express ourselves,'' said Mr. Qudah, 35, whose day job is supervising construction projects as a civil engineer. ''But our country lives under the fist of the mukhabarat.''
 In Jordan and across the region, those seeking democratic reform say the central role of each country's secret police force, with its stealthy, octopuslike reach, is one of the biggest impediments. In the decades since World War II, as military leaders and monarchs smothered democratic life, the security agencies have become a law unto themselves. 
 Last week's terror attacks in Amman accentuate one reason that even some Jordanians who consider themselves reformers justify the secret police's blanket presence -- the fear that violence can spill across the border. But others argue that the mukhabarat would be more effective if it narrowed its scope to its original mandate of ensuring security. 
 ''The department has become so big that its ability to concentrate is diluted,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a businessman active in human rights. ''The fact that the intelligence is involved in almost everything on the political and economic level, as well as security, might have loosened its grip on security.''
 In Jordan, one of the region's most liberal countries, the intelligence agencies vet the appointment of every university professor, ambassador and important editor. The mukhabarat eavesdrops with the help of evidently thousands of Jordanians on its payroll, similar to the informant networks in the Soviet bloc. 
 The secret police chiefs live above the law. The last head of the Jordanian mukhabarat routinely overruled the smoking ban on Royal Jordanian Airways, lighting up as he pleased. No one dared challenge him.
 The State Department's annual human rights report, unusually critical of a staunch ally, particularly one that offers widespread cooperation on terrorism issues, said the lack of accountability within the mukhabarat and the police resulted ''in a climate of impunity'' and underscored ''significant restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly and association.'' It said the agents ''sometimes abuse detainees physically and verbally'' and ''allegedly also use torture.'' 
 Although the Bush administration has cited the need for democratic change in the Middle East as a reason for going to war in Iraq, the threat of instability on Jordan's border may actually be restricting democratic freedoms there. 
 Even with the bombings in Amman as the latest reminder of the threats to Jordan's security, many activists deem progress impossible unless the influence of the mukhabarat is curbed. 
 ''The issue of security has become a nightmare,'' Mr. Kamhawi said, contending that Jordan had failed to find the balance between democracy and security. ''If you give a speech against the policy of the government, this is a threat to security. If you demonstrate against this or that, it is a threat to security. It hits on all aspects of life and it is a severe hindrance to any change.'' 
 Getting a senior mukhabarat officer to speak to a journalist is extremely rare. The Jordanian mukhabarat made the head of its domestic affairs branch available for this article on condition that he not be identified, but what he said offered meager insight into the agency's inner workings. 
 ''There is no freedom like that in Jordan,'' he said with enthusiasm in Arabic. ''You are a free man in a free country.''
 However, Mahmoud A. al-Kharabsheh, a maverick member of Parliament who joined the mukhabarat in 1974 and retired as its head in 1991, spoke candidly. The mukhabarat, he said, runs Jordan's politics.
 ''Some Parliament members allow the mukhabarat to intervene in how they vote because they depend on them for help in getting re-elected,'' he said. ''They enter into 90 percent of the political decisions in this country.''

Keeping Watch
 Omnipresent secret police exist in every Arab country. Indeed, mukhabarat (pronounced moo-kah-bah-RAHT) is among the first Arabic words expatriates learn, particularly reporters.
 This reporter's experience in Egypt is telling: 
 Once in late 2001, I was loitering outside the Cairo headquarters of the secret police, an unfamiliar building, and was detained. My Egyptian assistant and I were ushered into the office of a polite major, whose walls were hung with roughly 10 diplomas from the F.B.I., including one for interrogation. 
 ''Is this an interrogation?'' I asked. 
 ''No, it's just tea,'' the major responded, grinning. 
 After a brief, friendly conversation about my impressions of Egypt, we were released. 
 But in the years since, whenever I was involved in any reporting in Egypt that state security considered dubious, the major would call to inquire. 
 In Jordan, interviews over three weeks recently with dozens of people -- including members of Parliament, former ministers, journalists, professional association leaders and businessmen -- turned up tales of frequent encounters with the secret police. 
 Muhammad Atiyeh, 51 , described two encounters, the first after he undertook the seemingly innocuous task of trying to set up an organization of single parents. The group was denied a license, he said, then the Ministry of the Interior's security arm rejected him as president for seven months. 
 The organization ''had nothing to do with politics, and yet they interfered,'' said Mr. Atiyeh, who thinks Jordanian citizens should have a right to know what their secret police files contain. ''I have never done anything against the society or the government or the regime, so I am still waiting for someone to explain why.'' 
 In another incident, Mr. Atiyeh and a few friends, in a puckish mood on a winter weekend in 2004, decided to decorate a stretch of exterior wall at his house with graffiti. 
 One man wrote a line from the Constitution stating that that personal freedom is protected. Another wrote, ''Love is immeasurable.'' A third scrawled, ''Life comes first.'' Mr. Atiyeh himself wrote an Arab proverb about the absence of choice. 
 Three days later, the phone rang. The secret police summoned him and ultimately ordered him to paint over the graffiti because it might be ''misinterpreted.'' 
 In a recent poll by the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan, more than 80 percent of the respondents said they feared criticizing the government publicly. More than three quarters said they feared taking part in any political activity. 
 Jordan has never been a police state on the gory scale of neighbors like Iraq, and it is not surprising to find Jordanians who feel they can speak openly about political issues. But for most Jordanians, the mukhabarat remains a source of fear. Some Jordanians avoid uttering the word, whispering ''the friends'' instead. 
 Maj. Gen. Rouhi Hikmet Rasheed, a 33-year army veteran and former top military dentist, ran for Parliament in 2003 on a platform calling for a constitutional monarchy. His campaign drew the attention of the head of the mukhabarat, Maj. Gen. Saad Kheir, who warned him to stop, Dr. Rasheed said. 
 ''He told me that if I meant we should have a monarch like Britain's, this is not in the best interests of the country,'' Dr. Rasheed, 62, now a Parliament member, recalled. He was shocked by what came next: ''He said, 'You are a son of the regime, we trust you, but if your sons want to work in Jordan in the future, it might affect them.' '' 
 General Kheir declined a written request for an interview, and the senior mukhabarat official interviewed for this article said he was unaware of such a call. 

Poetry and Politics
 Mr. Qudah, the poet, said the secret police summoned him for the first time in high school. His offense was helping to lead a 1988 protest against the death of Khalil al-Wazir, a Palestinian guerrilla leader assassinated by Israeli commandos in Tunis. 
 But he notes that there are far worse places in the region than Jordan. ''It's not that we are better than the countries around us,'' he said. ''We are just less bad.'' 
 Mr. Qudah was born in 1970 in Ajloun, about 30 miles north of the capital, into a sprawling east Jordanian tribal clan. The oldest of nine children, he remembers his first poem was an ode to the snow falling on the local reservoir that fed the surrounding orchards of apples, figs and olives. 
 Mr. Qudah's political education started in grade school, when he was particularly engaged by the history lessons surrounding the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, the British-French pact that divided the Arab world into separate countries and laid the groundwork for a Jewish homeland. 
 He said he eventually absorbed every history book in the school library, and grew up yearning for a pan-Arab state. Unlike many native Jordanians, Mr. Qudah takes no issue with Palestinian refugees settling here permanently.
 Expressing topical ideas through poetry is an Arab tradition. Criticism of Jordan's stagnant political situation always brings an enthusiastic crowd response, Mr. Qudah notes. ''It is like music, you are making a speech but in a musical way.''
 It also brings another kind of attention. As an undergraduate, he said, the mukhabarat questioned him 20 times after poetry recitals critical of the government. 
 Still, he notes, ''you cannot form a political party by reciting poetry,'' something he would like to do to push for bigger, specific demands, like appointing the prime minister from among elected members of Parliament, rather than by the king. 
 Political parties were banned here for decades. Most are legal again, but are either religious or promote failed ideologies like Baathism, a vision of a secular Arab renaissance hijacked by the likes of Saddam Hussein and Hafez al-Assad. 
 The personal costs of any serious organizing effort hobbles reformers, Mr. Qudah and others said. 
 ''If you work in the daylight you might be imprisoned for a year or two, but you can still come back and work,'' Mr. Qudah said about overt political organizing. ''But to work in the daylight you have to be very persuasive, serious, honest, and you can't quit as soon as the government offers temptations, so you compromise.'' 
 Today, the drab headquarters of six major professional associations are the hub of Jordan's unofficial opposition, a role the government has sought to curb by writing a draft law that bans their political activity. The proposed law was heavily criticized by Human Rights Watch as a step backward for democratic change. For the moment, the building is still a host of endless political seminars. On a recent night, the minister of political development showed up to discuss reform. Participants mocked his ministry as an absurd example of the top-down attempts to change the system that are doomed for lack of public participation. 
 Still, Mr. Qudah says he wants to change the reality that most Arabs have no say in how their countries are run. Nor can such reforms be held hostage by the likely deranged types who carry out terrorist attacks like those here last week, he believes. Good security is a separate issue. 
 ''Why does this part of the world lack any kind of democratic practices?'' he asked. ''To respect your own intelligence means you cannot accept the way things are, you cannot live with the official lie that all is well in the Arab world.''

An Expanding Influence
 Reformers believe that King Abdullah II is ambivalent about political openness. 
 On his frequent visits to the United States, the king asserts he wants Jordan to become a constitutional monarchy. Yet at home, he decreed intolerable any public discussion about returning to the 1952 constitution, with its more extensive checks on royal power. 
 The king, the reformers note, was educated partly in the West and inculcated to a degree with democratic values. But he was thrust onto the throne unexpectedly -- King Hussein designated him the heir just two weeks before he died in 1999 -- so the 43-year-old king relishes the chance to rule alone, they believe. 
 Reformers say they are disappointed that he has not enacted more tangible changes. They often place blame for this lack of change on the mukhabarat's influence, which has expanded since the 1990's, with the death of King Hussein and Jordan's peace treaty with Israel.
 While peace diminished the need for the military, the mukhabarat expanded its role to monitor widespread opposition to the agreement. After the king died, the mukhabarat helped provide stability and support while the young heir found his feet. 
 Many reformers, including some members of Parliament, believe a crucial reason the legislative branch of government remains so weak is that the mukhabarat grew accustomed to interfering not only in elections, but also in parliamentary votes. 
 The mukhabarat spokesman denied any such interference, but members of Parliament said the mukhabarat could sway any electoral campaign by getting hundreds of voters to the polls, as well as providing access to government jobs for constituents, money and other facilities. 
 ''It's a carrot and stick,'' said Mr. Kharabsheh, the former mukhabarat chief and current member of Parliament. ''They tell the M.P.'s that whatever they want in the future, they will support them. It is well understood that they will turn against any M.P. who fails to do what they ask.''
 He also expressed concern about the mukhabarat branching into business -- financing companies like Al-Haq Agriculture, a major farming enterprise, as well as overseas investments, all of which involve hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of employees. He has asked for details of all mukhabarat investments, but has yet to receive an answer, he said. 
 One longtime head of the agency, Samih Batikhi, was sentenced to four years in jail in July 2003 after being found guilty of fraud and embezzlement in a case involving shady loans to businessmen. 
 The last head, General Kheir, was replaced this year. Amman's overheated rumor mill -- a symptom of its muted news media -- suggests that his role in lobbying for government contracts played a role, but there is no public case. 
 The agency spokesman declined to detail its business investments, but said they were all registered and strictly legal. 

'In the Eye of a Hurricane'
 Senior security officials like the former interior minister Samir Habashneh argue that freedoms taken for granted in Western democracies cannot be practiced in Jordan because it sits, as he put it, ''in the eye of a hurricane.'' With an unstable Iraq across one border and frequent violence across another in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, senior officials say Jordan's secret police must work overtime to ensure the kingdom's stability, its main selling point. 
 If the security agencies relaxed their vigilance and civil liberties were granted without condition, it would lead to more bloody chaos like the bombings here, they argue. 
 Any conversation with senior security officials invariably harks back to 1970, when the Hashemite dynasty held onto the throne by facing down armed Palestinian factions on Amman's streets. Security officials say that their vigilance prevents a repeat, and that with Palestinians making up 50 percent of the population, political reform must await a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute.
 Jordanians pushing for reform call this a pretext for hanging onto power. For Mr. Qudah, nothing underscores this more than his yearlong imprisonment after reciting a poem in August 1996 that criticized the way ''The Manager'' runs an unidentified country. It included these lines: 
 He has never taken any decision 
 Without asking for the public's permission
 Or without a public referendum 
 What a public
 Whenever something urgent comes up
 The public assembles
 Then there is a comprehensive speech, whipped up by the Manager
 Followed by an ululation and a blessing
 And the auction is open for whistling, drumming and for honking
 And afterwards, the audience claps
 And this is the consensus in my state
 And this is freedom of expression
 His 10-day interrogation, though civil, focused on whether he was trying to incite anti-government unrest and whether he belonged to any secret organization. He believes the jail sentence from the military-run State Security Court was preordained after he was charged with slander. 
 He spent the year at Suwaga prison in the southern desert playing soccer and leading seminars on the need for political and social change. ''That year just deepened my sense that reform is necessary and made me want to challenge the system more,'' he said.
 Trouble with the security services creates a ripple effect. Mr. Qudah says he has never been allowed to publish anything here, although Jordanian critics find his work subtle and witty. 
 When he was arrested again in 2004 he expected another jail sentence, but a tribal elder who represents his district in Parliament and is a government ally intervened. Mr. Qudah was sprung after 24 hours. 
 The spokesman said he was unfamiliar with the case, but denied the mukhabarat would jail someone for poetry alone. 
 Like many Arabs seeking reform, Mr. Qudah is torn by Washington pushing the issue. The pressure helps bring change, but the model offered by the Americans is Iraq. 
 He finds a certain hypocrisy in the official American outlook. ''They gave the green light to all these Arab leaders to create police states, then the reaction was religious extremism,'' he said. ''You raise someone for 50 years to go the wrong way down a one-way street and then suddenly tell them that they have to respect the law. I don't think any of these regimes are capable of creating a democratic reality.'' 
 Mr. Qudah wants Arabs to be able to live without fear of the mukhabarat or other forms of repression. 
 ''If you have stability, but life is desperate, what does that bring you?'' he said. ''We Arabs, all of us, we are marrying, drinking, laughing, making love. So why can't we live in a free environment? Why can't our freedom just be one aspect among many in our lives. Why do we have to wait? What for? We've been waiting for more than 50 years.''

HEADLINE: Looking for the Burmese Junta? Sorry, It's Gone Into Hiding 

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
At precisely 6:37 a.m. last Sunday, according to one account -- with a shout of ''Let's go!'' -- a convoy of trucks began a huge, expensive and baffling transfer of the government of Myanmar from the capital to a secret mountain compound 200 miles to the north.
 Diplomats and foreign analysts were left groping a week later for an explanation of the unannounced move. In a country as secretive and eccentric as Myanmar, it is a full-time job to try to tease the truth from the swirl of rumors and guesswork, relying on few facts and many theories. The leading theories now have to do with astrological predictions and fears of invasion by the United States. The relocation, which the government announced to reporters and foreign diplomats a day after it began, but not yet to the public through the state-controlled media, had been rumored for years. 
But according to reports from the capital, Yangon, officials and civil servants were given only a day or two to pack and say goodbye to their families.
 When they arrived at the new site, called Pyinmanaa, it was still under construction, and there were shortages of water, telephone lines and even sleeping quarters and food, according to family members quoted by news agencies and exile groups that monitor Myanmar. 
 Foreign diplomats said they were told that if they had urgent business with the relocated government, they could send a fax but that no number was yet available.
 According to diplomats and other unofficial sources inside Myanmar, the vast, fortified compound is to contain military headquarters, government ministries, huge meeting halls, residences, hotels, a hospital, an airport, underground bunkers and, not surprisingly in this golf-mad region, a golf course.
 The minister of information, U Kyaw Hsan, told reporters in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, that the transfer of the government had begun with 9 of the 32 ministries. He gave no date for completing the move.
 The military junta that runs the former Burma offered little explanation for its mystery move. ''Due to changed circumstances, where Myanmar is trying to develop a modern nation, a more centrally located government seat has become a necessity,'' it said in a statement.
 That left plenty of room for theories, and it was difficult to find one that seemed rational. Astrology seemed to make as much sense as anything.
 Myanmar is a deeply superstitious nation that scheduled its ceremony marking independence from the British to follow astrological dictates, at exactly 4:20 a.m. on Jan. 4, 1948.
 The 6:37 a.m. departure was reported by U Aung Zaw, the editor of Irrawaddy Magazine, an emigre publication based in neighboring Thailand with a network of contacts inside Myanmar. He said this strangely precise departure time might well have been dictated by astrologers. 
 Astrological timing may also have been behind the abruptness of the move to a site that was not yet complete.
 One theory is that the move was prompted by astrologers who several years ago warned the ruling generals that the dilapidated capital on the Bay of Bengal would become a dangerous place for them.
 Seen from their perspective, the notion of an American invasion might not seem far-fetched. They are a ruling clique of soldiers whose background is jungle warfare and who know little of the outside world.
 For years they have been squeezed by economic sanctions and battered by relentless criticism from the West over their abuses of human rights, and they have responded by pulling further into their shells.
 In January, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice included Myanmar in a list of ''outposts of tyranny,'' along with North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Zimbabwe and Belarus.
 Officials in Myanmar sometimes offer visitors a list of their own: Panama, Grenada, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq -- places where the United States has sent armed forces.
 Not long ago, according to one story making the rounds in Myanmar, a military officer was asked the purpose of obligatory civil defense training for civilian men. ''You are the holding action against the Americans until the Chinese come to our aid,'' the officer said, according to David I. Steinberg, a professor at Georgetown University who is a leading expert on Myanmar.
 Mr. Steinberg said rumors of an American ''rescue'' circulate among opponents of the government -- a current of wishful thinking that is as extravagant as the fears of the ruling generals. 
 ''The joke going around is, 'After diamonds, gold,' '' he said. In the Burmese language, ''sein'' -- as in Saddam Hussein -- means diamonds. ''Shwe'' -- as in Gen. Than Shwe, the leader of the military junta -- means gold.
 There was no way to know whether there was a connection earlier this month when authorities in the capital reopened a road that passes by the entrance to the United States Embassy.
 Barbed wire and concrete security barriers were removed for the first time since they were put in place after the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
 ''Obviously, we are reviewing our security arrangements,'' an unidentified United States Embassy official told Reuters. ''We felt a lot safer with them in place.''
 For now, there appear to be no schools and little housing for families at Pyinmanaa. The move is likely to separate civil servants from their families, as well as from the second jobs that many found necessary to make ends meet in the country's minimal economy.
 The junta's physical move into a fortified retreat reflects what many experts on Myanmar say is a bunker mentality in the face of what it may see as a bewildering and antagonistic world.
 ''I keep hearing the same thing all the time,'' Mr. Steinberg said of the junta. ''Look, we don't need you guys. We can go it alone. We've done it before, and so what's new.''

HEADLINE: College Leaders' Earnings Top $1 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Donald E. Ross turned Lynn University, once a nearly bankrupt two-year Catholic school for women in Boca Raton, Fla., into a thriving four-year liberal arts college. Now, as Mr. Ross nears retirement after 34 years as president, it is apparent how much the board of trustees appreciates his work.
 Mr. Ross ranked first in total compensation among the nation's private university presidents for the 2003-4 academic year with a package worth $5,042,315, according to the latest annual survey of executive compensation by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Data from 2003-4 is the most recent available for private institutions. The results are to be released publicly on Monday. 
For the first time, the survey reported leaders of private universities earning $1 million in a single year. The four others identified were Audrey K. Doberstein, formerly of Wilmington College in Delaware ($1,370,973); E. Gordon Gee of Vanderbilt University ($1,326,786); John R. Silber of Boston University ($1,253,352); and John N. McCardell Jr., formerly of Middlebury College in Vermont ($1,213,141). 
 Overall, the survey said, nine presidents of private universities earned more than $900,000 each, compared with none the year before, and 50 presidents of private universities earned at least $500,000 each, a 19 percent increase over the previous year.
 The upward spiral serves as the latest reminder that effective college presidents are a hot commodity and that college boards are going to unusual lengths to recruit and retain them even as tuitions soar and Congress and the Internal Revenue Service examine the finances of nonprofit institutions. The I.R.S. is looking at the rise in compensation for executives working for nonprofit institutions and is in the process of auditing about 2,000 of them, some of them university officials.
 Universities defended the payment packages as crucial to their success, and Raymond D. Cotton, a lawyer who specializes in contract negotiations for college presidents, said high compensation for those at the top reflected a growing demand for a shrinking population of qualified people.
 The job of running a large university is growing in complexity, Mr. Cotton said, and the problems are even more demanding at public universities, where the president has to raise money from donors as well as from the state legislature.
 Further, a number of well-known and highly paid presidents have retired in recent years, putting pressure on their schools to find comparable replacements.
 ''There's an imbalance in the supply and demand in the marketplace,'' Mr. Cotton said. ''There is a growing demand for people who can do the job well but a diminished supply because of baby boomer retirements. What all universities are trying to do is find a successor who has been someplace else as president.''
 Pressures notwithstanding, critics of the trend say lofty compensation packages have spawned a new ultra class within academia that grows steadily disconnected from the masses and undermines public confidence.
 ''We've created a cadre of hired guns whose economic interests are totally divorced from students and faculty,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a nonprofit group based in San Jose, Calif. ''It creates a real problem for leadership, and does nothing to help higher education.''
 Presidents of public universities generally earn much less than their private counterparts. But the survey also showed a jump in the number of public university presidents earning more than $500,000, 23 for the current academic year, from 17 in 2003-4. The latest group is led by Mary Sue Coleman of the University of Michigan ($724,604), Mark G. Yudof of the University of Texas ($693,677) and Carl V. Patton of Georgia State University ($688,406). 
 David P. Roselle, president of the University of Delaware, was included on the list as ranking second, but his total compensation of $720,522 is based on the 2003-4 academic year. 
 For the first time, The Chronicle extended its survey of pay and benefits to include colleges that specialize in one field, and the top 10 presidents all made more than $500,000 for the 2003-4 academic year. Two cleared $1 million: Samuel H. Weese ($1,725,376), former president of the American College in Pennsylvania, which focuses almost exclusively on financial services; and Paula S. Wallace ($1,068,726) of the Savannah College of Art and Design. 
 The Chronicle's survey reflected responses from 589 private institutions, 139 public schools and 118 specialty schools.
 Concerned that Mr. Ross's compensation package would draw criticism, Lynn University's board chairwoman, Christine E. Lynn, whose family has been a major benefactor, wrote to students, faculty and donors last week to say that $4.5 million of the total represented accrued retirement benefits, based on Mr. Ross's years of service.
 Other universities portrayed the high compensation as an effort to stay competitive. Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, said Ms. Coleman was wooed from the University of Iowa in 2002 with a package that included an annual base salary of $475,000 but also deferred pay of $500,000 as a retention bonus and $375,000 in additional base pay if she stayed at Michigan for five years.
 Mr. Yudof, who is in his third year leading the University of Texas system, is limited by statute to a base salary of $70,231, according to the survey. But Michael Warden, a system spokesman, said Texas remained competitive by paying him an additional $615,000 through two major endowments.
 Some pay packages and spending practices of university presidents have become controversial in recent years. At American University, a private institution of 10,000 students in Washington, Benjamin Ladner, its president, recently resigned amid accusations that he spent large amounts of university money for his personal use. The board gave Mr. Ladner a $3.7 million severance package.

HEADLINE: With Gado, Green Bay Finds Cure to Its Struggles

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:

PACKERS 33, FALCONS 25
 Making his first start on his 23rd birthday, the Nigerian-born Samkon Gado scored three touchdowns and the Packers won for only the second time this season, upsetting the Falcons, 33-25, in Atlanta yesterday.
 With 3 minutes 34 seconds remaining, Gado put the game away with his third touchdown, which gave the Packers a 33-17 lead. He scored from the 2 after Nick Barnett picked up the Falcons' sixth fumble of the game and returned it 20 yards. 
 Gado, who was unemployed less than a month ago, was the fifth player to start at running back for Green Bay (2-7) after season-ending injuries to Ahman Green and Najeh Davenport. Gado started only two games at Division I-AA Liberty, where he was a pre-med major with hopes of becoming a doctor. 
 Gado rushed for 103 yards on 25 carries, and even a pair of fumbles did not hurt; teammates fell on the ball both times.
 Gado scored twice in the first quarter to give the Packers a 14-0 lead. The Falcons (6-3) fought back to tie the score, but Ryan Longwell's 46-yard field goal in the final minute of the first half put Green Bay ahead for good. Longwell booted three more field goals in the second half.

STEELERS 34, BROWNS 21 -- Ben Roethlisberger missed a second straight game with an injured knee, though it hardly mattered -- the other three quarterbacks for the Steelers (7-2) were just fine. Against visiting Cleveland (3-6), Charlie Batch improvised a 1-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter, and his passing led to another score before he left with a broken right hand.
 Tommy Maddox replaced Batch to run an efficient offense in the second half, and Antwaan Randle El threw a 51-yard scoring pass to Hines Ward on a reverse. 
 Ward had 8 catches for 124 yards to give him 543 receptions for his career, breaking the Hall of Famer John Stallworth's team record of 537.

JAGUARS 30, RAVENS 3 -- Greg Jones ran for a career-high 106 yards and a touchdown, and Matt Jones had a career-high 117 yards receiving and a score to help host Jacksonville snap its N.F.L.-record 58-game streak of not scoring at least 30 points.
 The Jaguars (6-3) needed a field goal and a late touchdown on an interception return to reach the 30-point mark for the first time since Dec. 23, 2001. 
 The Ravens (2-7) had quarterback Kyle Boller in the lineup for the first time since the season opener, but he was sacked four times and harassed into three interceptions. The Ravens extended their streak of not scoring a touchdown to 11 quarters.

BILLS 14, CHIEFS 3 -- Taking over after Kelly Holcomb sustained a severe concussion in the second quarter, J. P. Losman led touchdown drives on two of his first four possessions, leading host Buffalo.
 Losman looked nothing like the hesitant first-year starter who went 1-3 before being replaced by Holcomb. He finished 9 of 16 for 137 yards, hitting Lee Evans for both touchdowns. 
 Holcomb was shaken up when his head snapped back after he was sacked by Jared Allen and lost a fumble. 
 Without the injured defensive tackle Sam Adams and free safety Troy Vincent, the Bills (4-5) limited the Chiefs (5-4) to 316 yards while generating three interceptions, a fumble and six sacks. Trent Green had thrown only three interceptions in his previous eight games. 
 Larry Johnson had 132 yards rushing in his first start since the Chiefs placed Priest Holmes on injured reserve.

SEAHAWKS 31, RAMS 16 -- Seattle took command of the N.F.C. West, increasing its lead to three games with a victory over visiting St. Louis. Seattle (7-2) has won five straight over all for the first time since 1999.
 Shaun Alexander rushed for 165 yards on a season-high 33 carries and scored three touchdowns. 
 St. Louis (4-5) led by 3-0 with 11:09 left in the first half, but a botched fake field-goal attempt turned the game. The Seahawks outscored the Rams by 24-6 over the next two quarters. 
 Torry Holt played his first game in four weeks after being sidelined by strained knee ligaments. Marc Bulger was also playing for the first time in four weeks, coming off a strained shoulder.

LIONS 29, CARDINALS 21 -- Roy Williams caught a career-high three touchdown passes to lead Detroit (4-5) past visiting Arizona (2-7).
 Playing an entire game for the first time since Oct. 2, Williams had 7 receptions for 117 yards. The last Lion to catch three touchdown passes in a game was Herman Moore in 1995.

SIGN UP NOW! -- Enrollment for the new Medicare prescription-drug benefit starts tomorrow. Coverage begins Jan. 1. The deadline for signing up is May 15; those who miss it must pay a penalty, though not if they already have coverage of their own and decide to switch over at some point. Private companies are selling the plans. Premiums average about $32 a month, but range from $2 to $50 and up, depending on how comprehensive the coverage is. Details can be found on www.medicare.gov. 


AN ERA IS ENDING -- The Senate Banking Committee opens hearings tomorrow on the confirmation of Ben S. Bernanke, right, to succeed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Bernanke, currently the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, is expected to breeze through the proceedings and replace Mr. Greenspan on Jan. 31.

WHO RULES THE INTERNET? -- An effort to wrest Internet sovereignty from the United States will be played out at a conference that begins Wednesday in Tunis. At the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society, the European Union and other critics will lobby to put management of the Internet in U.N. hands and give countries control of their domain names, like .es for Spain and .cn for China. Washington is unsympathetic to the idea.

SPEAKING OF INFLATION -- Producer prices for October will be announced tomorrow and consumer prices on Wednesday. Whether they come in lower or higher than expected, the Fed is almost certain to continue raising interest rates at its December and January meetings -- and beyond.

COOLING MARKET -- Now that Toll Brothers, a luxury-home builder, has declared an end to soaring home prices, look for possible slippage in the housing market index when it is released on Wednesday. The index rose to 67 last month from 65 in September, but was down from this year's peak of 72 in June.

EARNINGS UPDATE -- With activist attacks against it growing as the crucial holiday shopping season approaches, Wal-Mart reports its earnings today. Hewlett-Packard and Walt Disney announce results on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The President's Trip to Asia

 BODY:
Fresh from his disastrous Latin American tour last week, President Bush is off again -- this time to Japan, South Korea, China and even Mongolia, presumably to thank the latter for the 131 soldiers it is contributing to America's Iraq efforts. ''My visit should send a signal to the people of Mongolia that you've got a friend in the United States and a friend in George W. Bush,'' the president recently told an American Christian and Mongolian TV station. 
 The White House seems to have trouble finding uncomplicated nations that support America's Iraq policy to which Air Force One can be pointed. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in Mongolia only a few weeks ago, expressing American gratitude for the same soldiers. We wish the president a nice trip, but before he gets to Mongolia, he has some other work to do: getting America's critically important relationship with China back on track.
For the last year, America's love-hate relationship with China has been more hate, less love. The United States seems to be on the run, fueled by the false perception that China's rapid economic rise poses an inevitable threat to America. This summer, a hostile United States Congress effectively blocked a Chinese government-owned company, Cnooc, from buying Unocal. A dozen or so proposals floated around Capitol Hill for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports. Just days ago, the textile industry got Washington to strike a deal with China limiting imports of bras and socks. 
 Last week, a bipartisan advisory group delivered a report to Congress that sharply criticized China's trade practices and endorsed imposing sanctions, including a tariff on imports, unless Beijing takes forceful steps to allow its currency to move in line with market forces.
 The White House has indicated that Mr. Bush plans to raise the currency issue when he meets the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, this weekend. Certainly Mr. Bush should urge China to move toward a more market-based currency. With China's yuan undervalued, Chinese goods are cheaper in the Unites States and American goods are more expensive in China, which is one reason the trade deficit with China is so big. 
 But Mr. Bush must resist the advisory group's shortsighted calls to hit Beijing over the head with the blunt instrument of trade sanctions. Smacking China until it complies with us on trade is a short-range policy that doesn't take into account that it is now a political as well as an economic global power. There is more at stake in the world than how many made-in-China T-shirts are on sale at Wal-Mart. 
 Part of the reason it was so hard for America and Britain to get the humanitarian crisis in Darfur onto the United Nations Security Council agenda last year was that China resisted calls to pressure the Sudanese government. Similarly, any attempt to impose United Nations economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program now risks running into opposition from Beijing. 
 We hope that Mr. Bush's talks with Mr. Hu will extend beyond the usual trade and yuan complaints and into the entire canvas of the relationship between these two global giants. Washington must start thinking smartly about how it deals with Beijing, and what, beyond China's vast market of 1.3 billion people, it wants out of this relationship.

HEADLINE: Big Givers Are Paying Bigger Tabs For a Table

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SHELBY WHITE

 BODY:
LAST April, about 400 guests poured into the Time Warner Center for a gala fund-raiser for Lincoln Center's 12 constituent organizations. Although it was just another New York black-tie evening, this event had an innovative twist. It was the first time Lincoln Center tapped into the city's newly minted hedge-fund elite.
 A committee led by Eric Mindich and Dan Stern, both highly visible hedge-fund managers, was able to persuade colleagues and rivals whose social schedules were already overloaded to plunk down as much as $100,000 for a table of 10 guests, who could rub shoulders with people they buy and sell from during the workday. 
New York City fund-raisers are finding that they can raise ticket prices for existing charitable events and add new ones on the Manhattan calendar with little resistance. As with Vuitton bags, Verdura jewelry and New York apartments, inflation is hitting the charity circuit, say some charitable institutions and organizations that work with the fund-raisers.
 Why are people so willing to pay up? Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a charity watchdog, says: ''There's a certain snobbery. People often do want to go to events where they have the opportunity to be with heavy hitters. The more expensive the benefit, the more cachet, like luxury goods.''
 And Nixon Richman, president of Nixon Richman Associates, an event planner, says that benefit tickets are becoming more expensive. ''It used to be $500 a ticket, and it was tiered up from there. Now the base ticket price is more likely to be $1,000 to $1,500 with tables ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.'' And up.
 The Juilliard School, which holds its benefits every other year, is raising its top levels for its spring benefit with underwriting tables going for a staggering $1 million. A few years ago, the top level was $100,000.
 Other groups are betting they can sell more of the high-end tables at the expense of midpriced tickets. At the Big Apple Circus, Thomas M. Exton, vice president for development, says the organization has generally not raised ticket prices, but is noticing an increase in sales of the $50,000 boxes, compared with the $25,000 boxes. 
 Some organizations are changing their price structure more subtly. Karen Tumelty, manager of special events at Human Rights First, a United States-based human rights advocacy group, said that two years ago the organization effectively raised its prices by reducing the number of seats at each table to 8 from 10, while keeping its $5,000 to $50,000 price range. 
 Not everyone got the message. People who called and asked the number of seats at the table were told eight, but some people sent in their guest lists assuming the tables were for 10. ''We accepted their lists,'' Ms. Tumelty said. ''I would never call somebody up and say, 'No, you can't have your guest list.' ''
 Now the Committee to Protect Journalists, which two years ago eliminated $5,000 tables for all but its own board members, is considering reducing the number of seats at its tables, said its chief fund-raiser, John Weis.
 ''I am going to talk about an eight-person table for $10,000 as a way to raise prices without raising prices,'' Mr. Weis said. ''That is what they do when your can of coffee is no longer a pound. It is only 12 ounces. Even if we wanted to raise prices, you can only do that once in a while.''
 Benefits that have been around for a long time worry about increasing prices, although new events have no such constraints. The Russian National Orchestra will hold its first benefit in March. Edythe Holbrook, its director for New York City events, said that top tables would be $50,000 for 10, and would include concert tickets for four and a cruise for two with the orchestra on the Volga (transportation to Russia not included). 
 While ticket prices are soaring, benefits are not the most efficient way of raising money. Timothy Seiler, director of the Fund Raising School at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, said studies showed that special events returned about $3 for every dollar invested. Direct mail recoups $10 for every dollar, and major gifts bring $24 for every dollar. Benefits serve other purposes, like raising visibility, building awareness of a cause and generating publicity. A benefit might have a payoff that is not immediate.
 With hedge-fund money pouring in, Mr. Richman says, ''I haven't heard anyone complaining that benefits are too extravagant.''

 BODY:
ACROSS the country, nonprofit leaders who battle poverty saw hope in Hurricane Katrina, which starkly illustrated how even something as evenhanded as a natural disaster can discriminate against the have-nots.
 ''Suddenly, everyone was talking about poor people,'' said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, a former nun who has devoted herself to the poor as a public official and is now a charity executive. ''It seemed to dawn on everyone that we didn't win the war on poverty.''
 Yet, among the many who had been turning away from Americans most in need of charity was the philanthropic sector itself. Last year, the share of giving going to organizations most directly related to helping the poor hit a record low, accounting for less than 10 percent of the $248 billion donated by Americans and their philanthropic institutions.
 Adjusted for inflation, gifts to health groups have almost tripled over the last four decades, and those to educational institutions have risen almost fourfold, while donations to human services groups are up only 28 percent. 
 Other statistics also suggest that the nonprofit sector has drifted from core notions of charity. Nonprofit hospitals provide no more charity care than taxpaying counterparts do. While university assets soar, tuition continues to outpace inflation. Only a sliver of giving to churches is spent on social services. Last year, of the 14 gifts that exceeded $100 million, only one -- a $1.5 billion bequest to the Salvation Army from Joan B. Kroc, the widow of the founder of McDonald's -- went to a human services organization, Forbes magazine says. 
 ''In general, philanthropy seems to have stopped talking about poverty and race,'' said Jan Masaoka, executive director of CompassPoint Nonprofit Services, which tries to strengthen charities. Small groups still get funding, but the sector ''in some ways has retreated from taking on poverty in a larger-scale, more direct way.''
 So what is charity today if it is not aimed primarily at the have-nots? Has its definition been stretched so broadly that it no longer has meaning? If so, are the tax breaks that propel our philanthropy justified? Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, has raised those questions in a series of hearings examining whether tax exemption is justified for certain types of nonprofits.
 The question, in his words, is, ''What is the taxpayer getting in return for the tens of billions of dollars per year in tax subsidy'' offered to donors through tax write-offs or to nonprofits through their tax exemptions? According to the Treasury Department, the charitable deduction will amount this year to a $40 billion tax subsidy, mostly to upper-income households -- overshadowing the roughly $20 billion the human services sector is likely to raise. No official estimates exist for the cost of the tax exemption covering money that nonprofits spend and for the property they own.
 The hearings have received little public notice but have terrified nonprofit leaders, more than a Senate Finance Committee threat to tighten regulation of charities.
 ''When you start to ask what is the fundamental underlying rationale for tax exemption and the charitable deduction for donors, it leads to questions that are far more difficult to answer than questions about greater disclosure and better governance,'' said John D. Colombo, a tax-law professor at the University of Illinois who testified before Rep. Thomas. ''It gets you to questions like, why should an institution with billions in the bank get tax exemption?''
 Relieving the plight of the poor is the bedrock of charity, dating as far back as when the Roman Empire became Christian, and donations that had honored the gods were instead aimed at the underprivileged. But the English code that grew into the foundation for laws governing nonprofit organizations, the 1601 Statute of Charitable Uses, better known as the Statute of Elizabeth, defined charity's purposes much more broadly, covering everything from bridge repairs and the education of orphans to the ''marriage of poor maids.'' From this seed grew the current vibrant nonprofit sector, and the murkiness that now equates a university with a multibillion-dollar endowment with a local Boys and Girls Club.
 ''We simply don't have a coherent rationale for what it is we call charity,'' Professor Colombo said. ''So we have these vastly different sorts of organizations doing vastly different things and calling it charity.''
 Representative Thomas and others are particularly vexed by nonprofit hospitals, often noting that data from the American Hospital Association calculated that their average spending on uncompensated care was 4.4 percent of their costs in 2002, compared with 4.5 percent for their commercial cousins.
 Representative Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, has asked whether a better target may be universities, which sit on tens of billions of dollars in assets while tuition increases are outpacing inflation.
 Of course, some portion of contributions made to health, education and religious institutions, which are the recipients of most philanthropy, do benefit the poor. Universities provide tuition assistance to students from low-income families, medical research can alleviate problems like asthma, which is a particular issue for the poor, and churches engage in a variety of activities to help the needy. 
 Experts say, however, that the money trickling down that far is usually quite limited. ''There is a big debate about how much of the giving in those sectors eventually flows to charity, as in day care centers, family counseling, drug abuse counseling and after-school youth programs,'' said Lester M. Salamon, director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ''I'm not for a really narrow definition of charity, but at the end of the day, it's distressing that human services attracts such a small slice of overall giving.''
 Research by Mark Chaves, a sociology professor at the University of Arizona who was principal investigator of the 1998 National Congregations Study, the first comprehensive study of churches and their spending, showed that less than 3 percent of the average congregation's total budget was spent on social services.
 The average university spent 4.8 percent of its endowment on its operations last year, according to the 2005 Commonfund Benchmark Study, an annual look at education endowments. But its return on investments increased 14.7 percent. At Harvard University's current rate of growth, its endowment will be larger than the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest foundation, in three years. And while Harvard increased its spending last year on financial aid for undergraduates to $80 million a year, that figure represents less than .5 percent of its $22 billion endowment, and only about 2 percent of the approximately $4 billion it earned last year on its investments.
 ''For the past 15 to 20 years, educational institutions have been funded primarily by tuition and fees, not donations,'' Professor Colombo said. ''We're conditioned to think of them as charities, but they aren't.''
 Not surprisingly, leaders of nonprofit institutions take exception to the criticisms being aired in Congress. In a statement submitted to the Ways and Means Committee, the Alliance for Advancing Nonprofit Hospitals called the figures on charitable care a ''cursory'' analysis that missed crucial differences with commercial hospitals. Sheldon Steinbach, the general counsel of the American Council on Education, called the focus on endowments ''an easy cheap shot.'' Universities, he said, may be legally prohibited from spending their endowments to reduce the costs of college.
 But beyond the question of what large institutions do with their money is another debate: why donors are giving less to charities focused on America's poor. 
 Many of the biggest foundations fighting poverty have turned their focus overseas. The Gates Foundation, for instance, has given more than $5 billion for health issues abroad. But it also does work at home. It has spent heavily around the country on education, particularly at high schools, and in the Pacific Northwest donated $556 million to food banks, transitional housing for homeless families, shelters for battered women and other human services. Greg Shaw, who oversees the group's giving in that region, sees a link in these different spheres. ''The one thing that really cuts across all areas of our giving is inequity,'' he said.
 What's more, the foundation has a category it calls ''special projects,'' $562 million dispensed solely at the discretion of the Gateses themselves. While part of that money has gone to universities, much of it has been given to groups like the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law and the Society of St. Vincent De Paul.
 When it comes to raising money directly, most human services groups have weak fund-raising operations, if any, and their board members typically lack the resources of those who serve as trustees of universities or museums.
 Their missions also hamper their fund-raising efforts. ''You can build compassion for certain things, but there are things we work with like substance abuse, child abuse and domestic violence that the average donor just can't relate to,'' Ms. Barrios-Paoli, the former nun, said.
 Ms. Barrios-Paoli is the executive director of Safe Space, a charity that operates group homes for foster children, services for abused children and health and mental health services for poor families in New York City. It holds two benefits a year, generating $70,000 to $80,000 each, a fraction of what most private schools in Manhattan raise at a single similar event. It has one fund-raising executive and two other employees who solicit grants from foundations.
 Over all, private donations account for roughly 3 percent of Safe Space's $18.5 million budget. The rest comes from contracts it has with the state and local governments.
 Its board members are professionals who contribute what they can, but it does not require them to give a minimum amount each year like many of the city's more elite charities do. ''They're great, very dedicated and committed, but it's not the board of the Met,'' Ms. Barrios-Paoli said, referring to the Metropolitan Opera, whose board includes one Forbes 400 member, the wives of two others and the son of another.
 Ms. Barrios-Paoli listed the benefits of being a Met board member, from special seats to audiences with Placido Domingo. ''All I can offer my board is a tour of a foster home or a community kitchen,'' she said. 
 James S. Tisch, president and chief executive of the Loews Corporation, whose family cuts a wide swath in philanthropic circles, agreed. ''That's always part of it, putting together a board and creating an aura that it's a group that other people want to be part of,'' he said. ''Museums have done that very well, and hospitals.''
 Mr. Tisch is a trustee at Mount Sinai Hospital, where his family has given enough money to have its name on a building, but he has also served on the board of FEGS, a cluster of charities offering a range of social services, for more than two decades.
 FEGS, like Safe Spaces, is mostly supported by income from government contracts, and Mr. Tisch cited that as the biggest reason giving to human services has shrunk. ''Why should a philanthropist pay if the government will?'' he asked.
 The federal budget for health and human services rose 183 percent, adjusted for inflation, to $459.4 billion in 2002 from $68.3 billion in 1980, according to research by Patrick Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. 
 Nonprofit leaders counter that they have been forced to seek more government support as donations have declined. ''It becomes a chicken and egg kind of thing,'' said Peter B. Goldberg, chief executive of Alliance for Families and Children, which represents more than 300 family service groups nationwide. ''I'd argue that my agencies have become increasingly dependent on public sector funding because nongovernmental funding simply hasn't kept pace.''
 One reason for that failure, Mr. Goldberg says, is the increased demand by donors for proof of some return on their dollars. ''This is a tremendous challenge for human services,'' he said. ''We don't have good ways of measuring what we do, yet that's what donors want from us.''
 The few social service agencies that have found ways of demonstrating the benefits of their services get at least some positive responses. Lifetrack Resources Inc., a Minnesota nonprofit that helps poor families, has increased the portion of its budget underwritten by donations. Terry Anderson, its vice president for development, attributes some of the growth to its increasing reliance on metrics to prove its success.
 Using a 42-year study of the effect of preschool programs on children who are developmentally delayed because of abuse or neglect, Lifetrack calculates that every dollar invested in its own preschool program produces a $17 return in services the children will not need in the future.
 Similarly, for every dollar spent on employment services, Lifetrack says it saves the public $2.34 that would have been spent on welfare, not to mention the increase in tax revenue generated by the people it helps to find work.
 ''This kind of metric is becoming part of our brand, and it came as a result of our board asking why we weren't looking at ourselves that way,'' Ms. Anderson said.
 Ms. Anderson was hired by Lifetrack in 1987 to increase support from foundations and corporations, which totals about 6 percent of its $10 million budget. Recently she has turned her attention to individual donors, whose contributions have doubled over the last couple of years, but only to $70,000.
 ''If there's one thing that's true, it's that people give to people because they have a personal connection to the place they're giving to, and people who have personal connections to human service organizations are not usually people with money, '' Ms. Anderson said.
 That assertion is supported by demographic data showing that older donors, particularly women, have been the biggest supporters of groups helping the poor, said Robert F. Sharpe, a fund-raising consultant. Those donors are dying out, he said, and the emerging generation of baby boomer donors is less likely to support social service organizations. ''People who grew up in comfortable, clean, prosperous suburbs have just never had as much familiarity with how many others live,'' Mr. Sharpe said. 
 ''Many commentators talked about how the Katrina disaster pulled back the curtain and exposed the extent of poverty that exists in many American communities,'' he said. ''Perhaps one effect of that may be renewed interest among younger Americans in organizations that are working to meet the needs of the poor and otherwise disadvantaged among us.''

HEADLINE: In Ord, Neb., the Latest Success Is 20 New Residents

BYLINE: By KENNETH J. STIER

 BODY:
ORD, a town in Nebraska that is smack in the middle of the country, set on the edge of the state's vast sand hills, has been losing residents since its heyday in the 1930's, including 10 percent during the 90's.
 So when 10 young couples -- all professionals -- recently moved to this town of about 2,200, it was seen as a good omen that perhaps the long decline was ending. It is also a tribute to a new approach of grass-roots philanthropy -- one that mobilizes as many residents as possible, not just the rich, to support community foundations. The goal of this new philanthropy is to help stem the debilitating demographic downturn that afflicts much of rural America. 
 Six of the 10 couples who moved to Ord received some relocation assistance from the new Valley County Foundation, as well as from the county's economic development board. Although it is unclear how this help affected their decision to move directly, it was a factor for all of them. That includes Farrah Plate, a 28-year-old recent dental school graduate who was given money to buy the practice of a retiring local dentist, Dr. Chuck Blaha, who stayed on for a year to coach Ms. Plate. Such business help, which the foundation will increase in the future, is critical in preserving the role that Ord plays as the service hub of Valley County and its eight neighboring counties. 
 The arrival of the new residents and other improvements paid for by the foundation have revitalized local attitudes. ''There is a renewed sense of hope in this community that we can help ourselves, we have to help ourselves because no one else is going to,'' said Bethanne Kunz, executive director of the Valley County Economic Development Board, which also helps oversee the foundation. 
 She says this new can-do spirit recently helped Ord win (against three other competing towns) a $75 million investment from a Minnesota company to build a new ethanol plant that will provide 35 permanent jobs (200 during construction) and inject $50 million in tax revenue over the next 10 years.
 The Nebraska Community Foundation, a statewide nonprofit organization based in Lincoln, was instrumental is setting up the Ord foundation and dozens of others, and is considered a national model. There are hundreds of community foundations nationwide, and efforts to spawn more locally based foundations have been spreading.
 The Maine Community Foundation, a nonprofit group in Ellsworth, began establishing foundations in 1986, and now there are permanent endowments in 11 of the state's 16 counties. The goal has been to create endowments of $1 million, which, at 5 percent of earnings, could yield $50,000 a year for local spending; extra earnings are reinvested. 
 The state's local endowments total $6 million, but the figures vary widely, from $165,000 to $1.4 million. Full-time residents in Cumberland County, the state's most urbanized county, are collectively the most generous donors, and second-home owners from out of state are the second-largest group, said Andrea Perry, director of regional networks for the foundation. 
 Nebraska does not have a large pool of part-time residents to tap, and it has an outflow of young residents -- the children of potential donors -- who move away when they go to college and do not return. So virtually every town has tracked down alumni networks, even for grade schools, to draw from the huge intergenerational wealth transfer that could be coming in the next decades. 
 The critical part of creating an endowment is to involve as many residents as possible, through a local founders club that requires a minimum commitment of $1,000. In Ord, 55 donors signed up within the first two weeks. 
 Even smaller towns have gotten involved. Shickley, a village in Fillmore County in the southeastern part of the state, with a population of 363, has built an endowment of $300,000 in just four years, after a local banking family posted a $105,000 challenge grant. If the town can raise $1 million -- by 2011 it is hoped -- it will provide more than the present annual property tax intake of $42,000. This year, the endowment's extra $13,000 helped renovate the Fillmore County Courthouse, support a local history project and maintain a new library and public swimming pool. 
 But the biggest goal is to build economic opportunities by stimulating entrepreneurship, the real source of growth in rural areas in recent years -- most of it unrelated to agriculture. The Center for Rural Affairs in Lyons, Neb., supplements financing by the Small Business Administration with its own endowment earnings to run statewide microenterprise programs offering business development training to mostly low-income women. 
 ''It's one thing for someone to get a job; it's another for people to start to build assets because this ownership gives you a certain stability, a certain security to ride out tough times,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, executive director of the Center for Rural Affairs.
 ''That gives them a degree of control over their lives,'' he said, ''because it keeps more control of the local economy in the hands of people who actually live in the community.'' Many of the social problems associated with cities -- including crime and widespread drug abuse -- are now common in rural communities, even though many of these trends are under the radar of the national news media. About 340 of the country's 380 poorest counties are in rural areas. 
 Yet these areas are finding relatively little help from the large foundations, which focus on such problems in urban settings. There are many reasons for this. For one, most major foundations are far from rural areas, said Rick Cohen, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a nonprofit research group.
 About 50 million Americans live in rural regions, but they receive a small fraction of the $30 billion that charities in the United States sprinkle around the country each year. More than 42 percent of rural spending comes from just two organizations, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich., and the Ford Foundation in New York City. The Kellogg Foundation gives about $100 million each year to rural communities -- three times as much as Ford -- which is roughly 40 percent of its total annual giving of $260 million.
 The Kellogg board's commitment to rural areas is based on the view that they are a national treasure, providing a critical resource for food, livestock and other essentials, and are an incubator of American values, said Dr. Richard Foster, the foundation's vice president for food systems and rural development. ''The key right now is not to look at rural America as 'poor me, poor us,' but to look at it as a significant part of the fabric of American society.'' 
 In the so-called ''philanthropic divide'' states -- those ranking near the bottom of philanthropic assets or per capita spending -- the situation is particularly grim. In Montana, for instance, nonprofits are being overwhelmed by the swelling ranks of working poor whose wages no longer make ends meet, and who no longer have federal help to turn to, said Michael D. Schechtman, executive director of the Big Sky Institute for the Advancement of Nonprofits, in Helena. The needs are so pressing that they thwart endowment building efforts. The most promising glimmer of hope, he said, is the influx of rich out-of-staters who have to be approached gingerly.
 But competition is keen; community-based organizations are up against local universities and the state's entire hospital system. To make matters worse, Mr. Schechtman said, on a recent visit to the Montana State Library in Helena, he could not get important grant reference material. Because of budget cuts, the library had discontinued its subscription to the Foundation Center, a major research group that tracks and analyzes grants.
 ''This is life in a philanthropic divide state,'' Mr. Schechtman said with a sigh.

HEADLINE: After the Storm, One Town Finds 1,000 Ways to Give

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: ST. FRANCISVILLE, La. 

 BODY:
THAT Saturday, Aug. 27, Rose Parsee, or Mother Rose to her church and her three younger generations, got a call from a daughter, Kathlyn Locke. Ms. Locke, Ms. Parsee and most of the clan lived in two houses and an apartment in Harvey, just south of New Orleans on the city's west bank. A hardy brick of a woman, intense and passionate, Ms. Parsee had never been out of the area in her 65 years.
 ''What are you going to do?'' she said Ms. Locke asked.
''About what? Ms. Parsee said, putting her on. 
 ''About the storm coming,'' Kathlyn said. ''It's a Category 4.''
 ''I'm going,'' she said. ''Don't count me out.'' 
 One hundred and eighteen miles north of Harvey is St. Francisville, a Mississippi River town of 1,700 where John Audubon painted many birds. The seat of West Feliciana Parish, it is the home of one of Louisiana's best public school systems, of poor rural blacks living in trailers and one-bathroom cinderblock houses, of stately plantation homes under canopies of skyscraping oaks, of cotton and poisonous snakes and a few stubborn artifacts of segregation, like the array of flapping Confederate flags for sale on Highway 61, the town's commercial artery.
 That Saturday, the Rev. Joe Ratcliff called the 15 deacons of his wide red-brick, predominantly white First Baptist Church. On a slight knoll, encircled by acres of lawn and asphalt and near the intersections of Highways 61 and 10, the church is a conspicuous port in a storm.
 ''They all said, 'Open the shelter,' '' Mr. Ratcliff said. ''We chose not to be a Red Cross or FEMA shelter. We wanted our own people to sacrifice to take care of the needy.'' 
 With that, First Baptist threw St. Francisville's first spark to ignite the kind of ad-hoc, small-town philanthropy that would help hundreds of thousands of Hurricane Katrina's accidental homeless restart their lives. For two months, West Feliciana Parish went to such lengths to succor evacuees -- like scrubbing their clothes and commandeering a New Orleans school bus to deliver their meals -- that some 300 are expected to try to settle here. 
 At the peak of the exodus, weeks before the arrival of the cavalry -- the household names of charity and federal government assistance -- the parish's half white, half black population of 15,000 would serve close to 1,000 evacuees. Hundreds scattered to private homes. After First Baptist took in 57, the parish Police Jury -- the local government -- signed up all 101 rooms of the Best Western motel for a shelter and set up a parish community center to take 46 evacuees. The second week after the storm, the Rev. Ronald E. Hardy Sr. and his wife, Robbin, known in the church as First Lady, opened the sanctuary of their black Faith, Hope and Love Worship Center to 23 more. 
 Help sprang up everywhere. Anne Butler, owner of the Butler-Greenwood Plantation, a bed and breakfast, used $2,000 that former guests had donated to buy $25 gift certificates for 80 children to get clothes at Fred's Super Dollar Store. Facing a surge of new shoppers, Fred's manager, Susan Hammer, gave 10 evacuees $5.35-an-hour cashier jobs. 
 One was Evelyn Roach, 47, who spent three days on New Orleans rooftops before a helicopter lifted her out. ''That Saturday I left on a bus,'' Ms. Roach said. ''I thought it was going to Dallas. But Dallas was full, so we went to Fort Smith, Ark. They checked us into the Army base up there.'' She caught a ride to the bus station and went to Shreveport. Her nephew picked her up at 1:30 a.m. and took her to St. Francisville, where her sister lives with her husband, three children and two grandchildren. ''I felt,'' she said, ''I'm back home!''
 Her sister gave her a room. At Fred's, ''I filled out an application, and Susan hired me,'' she said. Her brother-in law lent her a truck to get to work. 
 At Fred's Pharmacy, the Police Jury picked up the tab for filling prescriptions for the week until a foundation took over. The sick turned to the splendid new clinic of Chaillie P. Daniel and Timothy R. Lindsey, young family doctors. 
 ''Everyone was seen,'' Dr. Lindsey said. ''In September we saw 250 evacuees. Of the 250, about half could not pay and had no insurance. For the most part they were people running out of medicines or needing preventive care, routine labs, tetanus, hepatitis.''
 Dr. Daniel said, ''We treated postoperative people.'' One lady had had two knees replaced 48 hours earlier. ''She had no follow up,'' he said. ''She came in in a wheelchair. We had a lady with acute pancreatitis, in a lot of pain. She definitely would have required a hospital. She wanted to fly to San Francisco. We looked up a doctor in San Francisco, and she had surgery the next day.''
 As for the payments, Dr. Lindsey said: ''We have kept track of it as office overhead. We will probably turn in some charges to FEMA, but we don't know if we will be paid.'' 

Search for a Haven
 Sunday, the morning before the hurricane, Mother Rose; Ms. Locke; two other daughters, June Hollins and Niya Parsee; Ella Montgomery, a niece; and 10 others packed into two cars and a pickup for a grinding, often frantic 12-day search for asylum from their homes in the New Orleans area. Crossing Louisiana, they stalled in traffic entering Texas and turned back, to Georgia and Florida, then moved into New Orleans and out again.
 ''We were 'The Family of 15,' '' Ms. Parsee said, to motelkeepers and the manager of a Chick-fil-A in Valdosta, Ga., who fed them free breakfast and lunch. 
 Their cash dwindling, the caravan stopped in a working-class resort in Florida near Disney World, where Ms. Locke owned a time share allowing them to stay.
 Ms. Parsee said the developer offered her, Niya Parsee and Ms. Hollins $100 each to attend a 90-minute time-share sales pitch. Pitch over, the developer pressed the women to use their $100 for down payments. Instead, they took the money and ran. 
 Over the Labor Day weekend, the family heard that New Orleans was drying up. Hoping their odyssey was over, they returned and stopped at the house of June Hollins and her husband, Tim. ''It was like, gone,'' Ms. Hollins said. Mother Rose said, ''My house looked like a monster ripped it apart.''
 Then it was off to the long abandoned house that Mr. Hollins's late grandmother owned in La Place, 30 miles west of New Orleans.

A Town Pitches In
 In St. Francisville, volunteers were swarming. There were ladies doing 30 pounds each of evacuee laundry a day at First Baptist. A retired registered nurse, Carolyn Porche, visited shelters every day for six weeks. ''People just lined up,'' she said. ''It was hard to quit.'' 
 The Happi Llandiers, a charity of retired black schoolteachers, scrounged up uniforms, shoes and supplies for evacuee schoolchildren. To help evacuees register online for housing aid, Linda Fox, the parish librarian, brought in tutors and more computers and stretched the library's hours. Over the two weeks after the storm, evacuees filled out 2,658 FEMA forms, 160 unemployment forms, 85 food stamp forms and 40 missing person forms. 
 Anne Butler's cousin Bob Butler, 51, a courthouse lawyer in St. Francisville's pretty historic district downtown, thought about food. He got catfish nets stretched across the Mississippi. He went to the David family, owners of the town's two supermarkets. ''What do you have in your coolers?'' he said he asked them. ''They said: 'Take whatever you want. We've got 352 pounds of Boston butt,' '' or pork shoulder. 
 Wednesday morning, two days after the storm, Mr. Butler hurried over to the office of W. Conville Lemoine, executive vice president of the Bank of St. Francisville and a friend since first grade. ''We've got to feed those people,'' Mr. Butler told him. Mr. Lemoine set up a Katrina victim food fund to which donors gave $47,744 through Nov. 3. He called in the bank's executive secretary, Kim X. Riggle, and asked her to work full time overseeing food services.
 Wednesday evening, Mr. Butler and Ms. Riggle called a meeting in the West Feliciana Middle School dining room. Among those present were Bert F. Babers 3rd, president of the Police Jury, Floyd L. Younger Jr., the jury manager, Alline Baker, a school system food services manager, Lloyd Lindsey, the superintendent of schools, Pastor Ratcliff and clergy from three other churches. ''Here's my idea,'' Ms. Riggle said Mr. Butler told the group. ''We can feed these people.''
 For nearly six weeks, starting at 11 a.m. after students' meals had been prepared, volunteers took over the school's industrial kitchen. They cooked 1,000 biscuits a day. They pitched a wide meal tent outside First Baptist. Inmates from the city jail cleaned it up and made $5 and $10 contributions from their work accounts into Mr. Lemoine's fund. 
 Volunteers ferried meals in plastic-foam boxes to isolated homes that had taken in evacuees, like the widow Rosa Pate's 50-year-old place on eight acres up rural Parker Road. 
 One story, with one bath and two bedrooms, the house has cinder-block walls painted turquoise. Rosa planted the crape myrtle trees in front. Close to the house she also has live oaks, pin oaks, a gun tree, a pecan tree and a hickory tree.
 Darling, Ms. Pate's family nickname, took in her Williams family relatives -- blind and stooped James Sr., 94, his estranged wife, Katie, 88, both under the same roof for the first time in 41 years, and their sons, James Jr., 52, and Peter, 48, both ministers of churches in New Orleans that Katrina washed out. Ms. Pate, 63, moved to the living room couch.
 ''We stayed in Baton Rouge two nights,'' James Jr. said. ''My brother Peter said, 'Let's call Darling.' She said she was waiting for us to call. She said, 'Come on in, the door is open.' We were just blessed.''
 The Police Jury begged and borrowed to get out the food. Its cars and trucks tied up delivering meals and care packages of soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste, deodorant, washcloths and towels. The jury needed more vehicles. So it also stole. 
 On a rural road just out of town, the jury found a school bus from New Orleans. Evacuees had left the keys and sprayed off their fingerprints with the fire extinguisher. ''We decided we would acquire it,'' Mr. Babers said. The second week of October, he said, the Orleans Parish sheriff called. ''He said, 'Lock that bus up.' '' Mr. Babers declined. ''We said, 'We're using it to feed your people.' ''

Finding St. Francisville
 The Parsees thought they had found refuge in La Place. But that first night, Hurricane Rita ripped through town. Ms. Locke, her husband and children bailed out for Houston. Down to 11, the family drove to Baton Rouge where Didi, a former girlfriend of one of Ms. Parsee's three sons, put them up. 
 Didi's Uncle Roy is a deputy sheriff in St. Francisville, Mother Rose learned. Didi told her, ''They got a shelter opening.'' 
 So into the bleak rural night of Sept. 8, the clan set off north on 61. 
 ''Deers!'' Mother Rose recalled shouting. ''They have deers outside.'' 
 ''No streetlights,'' Ella Montgomery said she said. ''Cities have streetlights.'' 
 Terrified, June Hollins said, ''We have to stop.''
 ''In the name of Jesus,'' Mother Rose said, ''keep going.''
 Downtown, they came upon Faith, Hope and Love's wide, beige, one-story cinderblock church. 
 ''We made it,'' Ms. Hollins said later. ''It was mattresses, not cots. Sheets, nice blankets.'' Out of money, they didn't need any. ''They brought food, supplies, whatever we needed.'' 
 Ms. Parsee said: ''We had nurses show up and do checkups. We had flu shots.''

Some Help, Some Hindrance
 Hoary bureaucracies kept putting up road blocks in St. Francisville. The jury needed help reaching unknown evacuees in homes like Rosa Pate's. Mr. Babers asked the post office to deliver notices urging evacuees to register so they could get meals and rides to school. '' 'You could never do that,' '' he said the post office told him. 'You have to go to the board of governors in Washington.' ''
 At the parish's small community-center shelter where the Happi Llandiers has its office, Peggy Casanova, the secretary, said that departed evacuees without new addresses still use the shelter to pick up housing assistance checks from FEMA. 
 One day in late October a stack of letters, two from FEMA, arrived. Affixed to the stack was an unsigned handwritten note from the letter carrier. ''The people at this address needs to put up a box,'' it said, ''or I will have to return all the mail. Please correct address. Thanks.''
 The second week after the storm, Red Cross and FEMA officials began trickling through St. Francisville, but their help was slow. The Red Cross contracted with four local restaurants to prepare evacuee meals beginning Oct. 7. 
 The Police Jury needed FEMA's help with the Best Western bill that was running $150,000 a month. 
 ''They wanted us to project it for 60 days,'' Mr. Babers said. ''Then they went away with their little forms. We didn't hear anything at all for a while. Then they called and said, 'Within a day or two, we will send somebody with a form to fill out.' I said, 'Wait, I've already done that.' They gave us $23,000 as a first draw.''

'Thank You, Jesus'
 During the six weeks the Parsees lingered in the shelter, daughter Niya, fed up, drove off to Texas. Mother Rose, Ms. Hollins and Ms. Montgomery got 12-week state-financed jobs answering phones and cleaning in the Faith, Hope and Love Worship Center. Tim Hollins, who had been a postal worker in New Orleans, found work at the St. Francisville post office. 
 In late October, the shelter closed, and the Parsees settled in a three-bedroom, two-bath brick ranch house on a tidy subdivision street. A gift from the son of the church's late secretary, the house was fixed up by volunteers with new paint, carpets and appliances, except for the worn-out 1960's harvest gold refrigerator. First Lady Robbin Hardy put her plan for a displaced girls' home on hold.
 After church Oct. 23, Pastor Hardy dropped in. 
 ''I have a surprise,'' he said. 
 ''Thank you, Jesus, thank you Lord.'' Three joyful women and two teenage daughters whooped and clapped. 
 ''The refrigerator's out, right?'' he said.
 ''Thank you, Lord!'' Mother Rose said, taking to her feet. 
 ''So we're going to buy you a new one.''
 ''Thank you, Jesus!'' they said. 
 Outside, Pastor Hardy said: ''I did what I would have wanted done to me. If it was me, I'd want you to allow me a season when I can get back up. That's what I'm trying to do.''

HEADLINE: Their Mission: Spreading the Word Through Business

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
TOM SUDYK is not most people's idea of a missionary. 
 On paper, he looks like a modern global capitalist, which he is. Mr. Sudyk, an entrepreneur from Michigan, runs, among other things, an outsourcing company in Chennai, India, providing medical transcribers and software engineers to American businesses. In six years, the Indian company -- a subsidiary of EC Group International, a larger outsourcing company that Mr. Sudyk founded in Grand Rapids -- has grown to 75 employees and is moving into a building triple its present size.
But the Gospel, Mr. Sudyk says, illuminates every aspect of his business, from its ethics to its help to local ministries to the technical support it lends a Christian-run vocational school for polio victims in Chennai. Each afternoon at the Chennai office, there is a 10-minute prayer, and while the prayer is interdenominational, employees who ask to learn more about Jesus Christ -- as many have -- are gladly accommodated.
 ''We don't push our religion down their throat,'' Mr. Sudyk said. ''Our philosophy is that you're not going to talk anybody into it. But they clearly know it's a Christian-run company.'' 
 Christian-run companies are multiplying in just about every corner of the globe, reshaping overseas mission work. These businesses form a movement known variously as business as mission, kingdom business and great commission companies, after the biblical charge to ''make disciples of all the nations.''
 In Romania, for example, a Californian who runs a Tex-Mex restaurant and catering hall said that he expected to clear $250,000 in profit this year, most of which will be donated to local ministries. And in a Muslim country with a history of hostility to Christianity, a medical-supply importer from the Midwest leverages the trust she earns through her business dealings to quietly spread the word.
 Some supporters of business as mission set up microlending banks or fair-trade coffee companies. In countries where there is more hunger for economic development than for missionaries, some of these supporters think that a profit-oriented company centered around Christian values can be a powerful tool for building a Christian society. A job-creating, taxpaying enterprise, they say, will be more legitimate in the eyes of locals, harder for a government to expel and better for the resident economy than one propped up by handouts from back home. 
 ''The real power of the movement is that it's not donor-funded, it's basically globally funded,'' Mr. Sudyk said. ''There's no restraint in the capacity of this system, because you avert the donor and plug into globalization.'' 
 Business as mission grew from a 1980's mission movement to reach people in the ''resistant belt'' across North Africa, the Middle East and Asia where Muslim, Buddhist or antitheistic governments made it hard or impossible for religious workers to get visas. Missionaries with no business experience opened travel agencies, Internet cafes and other small companies, sometimes accused of being little more than fronts for proselytizing. 
 ''That model was about getting missionaries into these countries by whatever means you could, whether it's teaching or business or whatever,'' said Steven L. Rundle, an associate professor of economics at Biola University in La Mirada, Calif., and an author of a 2003 book, ''Great Commission Companies: The Emerging Role of Business in Missions.'' 
 Now, Professor Rundle said, evangelical groups are recognizing that mission-minded businesspeople can do things that traditional missionaries cannot. ''The future generation of missionary will be the rank-and-file businessman,'' he said. The wheel, he added, has come full circle: many of the first emissaries of the Gospel were tradesmen, not priests.
 One businessman from California, Jeri Little, visited Romania in 1988 on a church trip and was moved by the desperate conditions there. After the fall of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, Mr. Little went to Romania with $100,000 in medicine and supplies.
 But Mr. Little, a financial planner who now lives in Romania, wanted to do something beyond a quick fix. ''I realized that we needed to not just send them money and create another banana republic dependent on our aid,'' he said. ''We needed people to create business.'' The question was what kind.
 Mr. Little decided to open what he said was the first secondhand clothing store in Iasi (pronounced yahsh), Romania's second-largest city. ''Good used clothing from America at good prices,'' he recalled. ''And we introduced a number of new measures, like smiling.'' Soon there were three stores, and Mr. Little and his wife plowed the profits into local mission projects. 
 Then, Mr. Little said, God gave him a new assignment: open a restaurant. Why not, Mr. Little, thought, although he knew nothing about it. ''The most popular TV show after the revolution was 'Dallas,' '' Mr. Little said. ''So we said, 'Let's do a Texas theme, make it a Tex-Mex restaurant.' ''
 The Littles gave the clothing stores to local ministries, and in 1997 opened Little Texas, by all reliable accounts the most popular and authentic, not to mention only, Tex-Mex restaurant in northeastern Romania. As diners in the John Wayne dining room eat their enchiladas and homemade tortillas, they can study a passage on the wall from the 20th Psalm: ''Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.''
 The couple built a hotel above the restaurant, for Romanian business travelers, with 32 rooms. 
 Some of the restaurant's profit this year will be put back into expanding the business, but the rest will go to local aid and ministry projects, Mr. Little said. These have included opening a kindergarten and day-care center in one of Iasi's poorest neighborhoods. Soon, Mr. Little and his associates plan to open the first dental clinic in a town in Moldova, several hours from Iasi.
 Mr. Little also helped some Romanian friends start a housing company that gives 25 percent of its profit to evangelical ministries. ''If I'm going to be involved,'' he said, ''there's going to have to be a significant win for the ministry right off the top.''
 It is one thing to establish an evangelical presence in a Christian country, another to do it where opening a new Christian church is illegal and evangelizing is frowned upon. 
 Mary, a 52-year-old from the Midwest who imports medical products into a country she identified only as ''98.9 percent Muslim'' because she feared hurting her credibility, said that in her four years there she learned to let people come to her. 
 ''I get a call from a doctor working for one of the major drug companies here, a local guy,'' Mary said a few weeks ago. ''He said, 'I haven't seen you in a while, let's get something to drink after work.' '' Neither business nor romance was on his mind. 
 ''The real issue is he's empty inside,'' she said. ''And because I've earned the right to speak deeply into his life, I could say, 'God really loves you.' This door that was opened was not opened for any other reason than that I worked with him for a long time on a legitimate project that we both spent hours sweating over. 
 ''There has been this idea that it's not as spiritual to be a businessperson,'' Mary added. ''The truth is totally the opposite because this is genuinely how most people have to live their lives. People who work with me, when they see me lose my temper, or when I have to make a hard business decision, that's authentic Christianity.''

HEADLINE: Did the New Deal Kill Old Giving?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
LONG after the water has receded in New Orleans, students of philanthropy will be pondering a question posed by the surge in contributions that followed Hurricane Katrina: were Americans digging deeper into their pockets because they concluded the government wasn't up to the job?
 ''The absence of government prompted a response,'' said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. ''When the government seems so slow to respond, the only thing people can turn to are charities.'' 
The situation goes to the heart of the relationship between government and charitable giving. Will private citizens give more to a social cause that doesn't benefit from the government's largess? When the government steps in, will it cause philanthropic urges to wane? 
 Many American conservatives hold this line of thinking particularly dear, arguing that government welfare programs will crowd out private charities that generally do a much better job at it. 
 Marvin Olasky, the editor of the Christian magazine World, who advocates using charities to address social ills, said that charitable giving as a percentage of personal income dropped after President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced his Great Society programs in 1964, which increased welfare spending. 
 Russell D. Roberts, a professor of economics at George Mason University, contended in a 1984 paper that federal spending since the New Deal had replaced virtually all private charity to the poor. Although Americans donate billions of dollars to charities every year, he argued that since the government moved into poverty alleviation in the 1930's, private citizens have funneled their philanthropy into other causes. 
 ''What we call charity today is not the same as in 1900,'' Mr. Roberts said in an interview. ''In 1900 it helped poor people. Today it goes to NPR or to fund the cancer wing at the local hospital that saved your mom, or to the church or synagogue.''
 The contention that the government crowds out private charity is based on a simple premise: charity is driven by altruism. Thus, if the government uses our taxes for that purpose, we will no longer deem it necessary to give privately to that cause.
 But people rarely give to charity based on cool analytical considerations. And untangling the effect of government spending on private giving is devilishly hard. Both are affected by other factors, which might foster the illusion that one is influencing the other. Natural disasters will increase both. Recessions, on the other hand, may increase government spending even as they eat into the public's generosity. 
 But it is clear that there are more selfish motivations for charitable giving that are not switched off when the government chips in, experts say. People get a straightforward payback from charity. Giving generates praise, or helps avoid being labeled as stingy. Charity provides an internal reward, the feeling of helping change the world. 
 ''Donations are expressive,'' said James Andreoni, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies philanthropy. ''I agree with your mission. I support your ideals.'' 
 Recent research casts doubt on the extent that government spending crowds out charitable giving. In one study published in 1998, Abigail Payne, associate professor of economics at McMaster University in Ontario, found that private donations to nonprofits fell substantially when a group received government grants. But in a later study together, published two years ago, Ms. Payne and Mr. Andreoni concluded that the main reason for the drop was a reduction in the nonprofit's fund-raising efforts. ''If the charity is given government money, it goes less after private donations,'' Ms. Payne said. 
 More recent research suggests that charity survived the New Deal. In a study this year of spending by churches in the 30's, Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that the large increase in government aid did reduce churches' charitable spending by about 30 percent. But that equated to a reduction of three cents in church spending for every new dollar of government money.
 ''There was an enormous reduction in church-based charity, but on the other hand it wasn't that big,'' Mr. Gruber said. ''Crowd-out exists, but it's not a major factor.''

HEADLINE: Retired Doctors, Retired Nurses, Very Busy Clinics

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERGER

DATELINE: GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
AFTER working for years as a pediatric nurse practitioner here, Lynne Shiels was hardly naive about the costs of health care but nonetheless thought that everyone in this picturesque area had access to medical help. 
 This is Berkshire County, after all, a blue place in one of the bluest states, a magnet for music lovers and antiques collectors that seems to have as many government-financed medical programs as it does boarding schools and Colonial-era farms.
But Mrs. Shiels was astonished to learn, once she started helping at a new clinic run by Volunteers in Medicine Berkshires, just how many uninsured residents the county has -- not just recent immigrants but native sons and daughters whose medical benefits have vanished as factories have closed, or whose co-payments have become too expensive to carry. 
 ''The biggest thing that's been an eye-opener to me,'' said Mrs. Shiels, a volunteer nurse at the free clinic, ''is that a big part of our patients are not only undocumented workers but people who were insured at one time, lost their insurance, stopped going for any kind of ongoing health care and are coming to us with a variety of problems.'' 
 The clinic has been a revelation for nearly everyone involved since it opened less than a year ago. 
 Dr. Howard Arkans, a deeply tanned pediatrician and insurance company administrator who retired to pamper his grandchildren and play tennis, has been surprised by his own level of commitment, volunteering 20 hours a week or more as medical director. Leonard Simon, a retired bank executive who was among the clinic's founders and serves on its board, has been impressed by the local altruism that supplies a $300,000 yearly operating budget and a spreading circle of doctors, nurses and psychologists giving pro bono care. Estella Bodnar, a daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants who is one of the clinic's three Spanish-language interpreters, has been moved by the changing face of Berkshire County, where the population of 132,000 is thought to include 10,000 Latinos; more than half the clinic's patients so far are Hispanic.
 ''We've had people who've never had medical attention, ever,'' Ms. Bodnar said. ''Some are coming in because they haven't been to a doctor in many years. Some people haven't known what the blood pressure apparatus is or even what having a blood-pressure check means.''
 Berkshire County is hardly alone in its demographic shifts and economic stresses on even its longtime citizens. The clinic in Great Barrington is the newest in a growing network operated by Volunteers in Medicine, each clinic slightly different and tailored to local needs but all committed to helping people without medical insurance. All shun government funds so services cannot be limited. The clinics also rely on volunteers, especially the skills of retired health care workers, an ''untapped treasure trove,'' said Amy Hamlin, executive director of Volunteers in Medicine. 
 ''Many people who've been clinicians love the practice of medicine and hate the business end of it, that in many instances has quashed or cut back in the joy of practicing,'' Ms. Hamlin said by phone from the group's headquarters in Burlington, Vt. ''So by eliminating all that in our clinics, the retirees have the option to practice just good medicine and just care for people.'' 
 The nonprofit program began in 1993 in Hilton Head, S.C., when a recently retired doctor, Jack B. McConnell, was appalled by the lack of health care available to poor people in the region, many of whom provided services to prosperous retirees or second-home owners. His model has been followed at a steady pace -- there are 44 Volunteers in Medicine clinics -- as the number of uninsured Americans has grown to nearly 46 million. The American Medical Association recently recognized the achievement by creating the Jack McConnell Award for Volunteerism, to go to a doctor over 55 years old. (Nominations are due in December and the first award will be given in March.)
 Like Dr. McConnell, Mr. Simon and his friends were disturbed by the gap between their own comforts and their neighbors' hardships. 
 After some debate over the clinic's role within Berkshire County, and a few resignations from the board, the remaining founders decided to focus on preventive care. ''We are not a walk-in clinic,'' Mr. Simon said. Once patients are deemed eligible for the services -- they must be 19 to 65 years old, with an income of no more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level -- an hourlong physical is scheduled, which includes a complete medical history and blood work. All patients are screened for diabetes, high-blood pressure and high cholesterol. Many receive free medication and monitoring for those conditions and others, including depression. Women receive Pap tests on site and are referred for mammograms. 
 For now, treatments for all but the most basic diagnoses are referred elsewhere, but the clinic's volunteers drive patients without cars to their specialists or hospital visits and help them with paperwork. They have even gone door to door, including the time Mrs. Shiels found one of her patients, a homeless and unemployed housekeeper, asleep on a porch. ''I woke her up and told her why she had to go the emergency room immediately,'' Mrs. Shiels said.
 The woman had come into the clinic for severe bruising; a blood test revealed she had ITP, or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a condition in which the body produces a dangerously low number of blood platelets. Once seen by a hematologist and placed on medication, including more medicine to treat a thyroid imbalance, her condition stabilized and her depression and listlessness lifted. ''She's now renting an apartment, able to work and is a completely different person,'' Mrs. Shiels said. 
 The clinic is on Route 7, Great Barrington's main thoroughfare, across from two supermarkets and next to a popular bagel shop. Each of its three, completely private examination rooms includes a laptop because the clinic's record-keeping system is electronic. An expansion is planned to add an eye clinic and a second dental room. 
 Dr. David Kanter, a retired dentist from New Jersey who has been advising the clinic, is getting a Massachusetts license so he can work directly with patients. Dr. Kanter views good dental care as not only part of one's overall health, but also a ticket to a better job and better life.
 ''My goal,'' he said, ''is to provide not only good dental health but a cosmetically good smile because, after all, when we're interviewing someone to hire them, what do we look at? Oral health can influence heart disease and good health in general, but cosmetically it's important, too.'' 
 Other clinics operated by Volunteers in Medicine already provide more services on site. Over the last five years, the Parker Family Health Center in Red Bank, N.J., run by a retired oncologist, Dr. Gene Cheslock, has treated 30,000 adults and children. The clinic includes a diabetes center and eye clinic and has an operating budget of more than $600,000 a year, all locally financed. Like the clinic in the Berkshires, about 60 percent of its patients are Hispanic, most of them undocumented workers, and detractors have accused Dr. Cheslock and his staff of enabling a vast burden on the country's economy. But Dr. Cheslock is unmoved.
 ''If you actually dig into some of the statistics,'' he said, ''you'll know that they provided billions to the Social Security system last year. Even though the money was paid through a bogus number, it still went into the system and was used by the system. By paying rent, by shopping locally, they do kick into the system and make it run.''

HEADLINE: When 14 Hours of Help Equals Some Heavy Lifting

BYLINE: By BONNIE DeSIMONE

 BODY:
LEA CUTTER, a 33-year-old single mother, part-time artist and full-time student in Portland, Me., lives frugally, subsisting mainly on student loans and child support. She had been staying with friends while waiting to get her own two-bedroom apartment, and found a way to finance the move without spending a dime. 
 As a member of the Greater Portland Time Bank, Ms. Cutter accumulates ''time dollars'' by providing an eclectic array of services including child care and creating plaster ''body casts'' for women who want to document their pregnancies. Last month, she cashed in 10 hours in return for help painting her new apartment and packing and transporting her belongings there.
The people who helped her were all strangers before they arrived at her home, but ''If I hired people, they'd all be strangers, too,'' she said. 
 ''It's just so great -- I banked up some hours watching other people's children, doing what I want to do, and I get to meet people I'd never meet,'' said Ms. Cutter, whose next time-banking activity will be helping a member sort receipts for tax preparation.
 Time banking puts a simple yet unconventional twist on traditional concepts of volunteering and charity. 
 One hour of service of any kind earns a provider one time dollar. Those tax-free dollars can be spent on any service donated by another member. No paper changes hands. Records are maintained in a database at each bank, and members are matched either with staff assistance or by contacting one another through a directory.
 About 70 time banks are operating in 22 states, the District of Columbia and 10 foreign countries. A high percentage of members are low-income or older or disabled people. Services exchanged range from the mundane to the specialized. 
 Most members provide and request help with minor home repair, transportation, yard work, computer skills, child care and health care, said Auta Main, executive director of TimeBanks USA Network, the national organization, also in Portland. 
 One time bank in Chicago is devoted to tutoring; another in Washington enables teenagers to earn time dollars working at a juvenile court. In Portland, a wellness clinic and a midwives' group have agreed to accept time dollars for certain services.
 The structure takes cash out of the equation, puts value on talents and skills that aren't always worth much in a cash economy and fosters reciprocity rather than dependency, its advocates say.
 ''This turns volunteering from a one-way street to a two-way street,'' said Calvin Pearce, executive director of Time Dollar Tutoring in Chicago. ''There's an arrogance that comes along with traditional giving. I can give to you, but you have nothing I can use.''
 Mr. Pearce's 10-year-old organization trains students from elementary through high school age to tutor younger students in math and reading for one hour after school, five days a week for 28 weeks. Both tutors and pupils earn time dollars. Their parents are required to put in a total of four hours of volunteer work at the school. 
 When a student accumulates 100 time dollars and the parental obligation has been met, the family is presented with a refurbished computer. Mr. Pearce said that Time Dollar Tutoring had given away 5,375 computers to low-income families.
 Time banking is the creation of Edgar S. Cahn, who began his career as a speechwriter for Robert F. Kennedy. Mr. Cahn later founded the Antioch School of Law, which was known then for its novel community service requirement and is now part of the University of the District of Columbia.
 Mr. Cahn, 70, said the idea of time banking came to him while recovering from a heart attack in 1980. The organization began to take its current form in the mid-90's, when the philanthropist Dr. Richard Rockefeller and the Annie E. Casey Foundation made major grants to finance pilot projects.
 ''If we keep rewarding people for having problems, they'll continue to have problems,'' Mr. Cahn said. ''Time banking focuses not on what's wrong with people but what's right.''
 The Portland time bank, which has 600 active members, shares an address with TimeBanks USA Network, where membership and training inquiries are handled. Mr. Cahn remains head of the TimeBanks Institute in Washington, which he characterized as the ''think tank'' division of the group.
 Although time banks help meet people's economic needs, Mr. Cahn considers their social function -- ''Creating a web of strangers you can trust,'' as he puts it -- equally important. 
 Travis and Chika Burnham of Portland were new to the community when they began stockpiling more than 100 time dollars in a year to cover the hall, catering, dance instruction, hairstyling, photography and other services related to their wedding in January 2003. 
 Ms. Burnham, a student, tutored Japanese, cooked and gave origami lessons in a halfway house to earn her share, while Mr. Burnham, a high school biology teacher, built a deck for a fellow member and did other light contracting work. He likens drawing on his time-bank balance to ''having a friend you don't feel bad about inconveniencing.''
 Some safeguards are in place. The Portland time bank, among others, does criminal background and driver's license checks on members providing child care or transportation. But most members gain confidence in one another when they meet in orientation sessions or through social events, time bank administrators said. 
 The Community Exchange time bank in Allentown, Pa., is based in the Lehigh Valley Hospital and originated to address issues of personal isolation that affect public health, its director, Anne Rogers, said.
 Most of its 360 members are women 45 to 70 years old who swap transportation, cooking, housekeeping and companionship, Ms. Rogers said, ''But it can be anything, if you have knowledge and you're willing to share it.''
 Susanna Wolfe, a 78-year-old former music teacher, has earned time dollars by giving piano lessons to students who come to her home in the assisted living complex in Allentown. She spends her time dollars on help cataloging her large collection of books and music.
 Another Allentown member, Linda Epp, provides word-processing services, works on the Community Exchange newsletter and gives a blind woman -- whom she now considers a friend -- rides to appointments. She has used her time dollars on moving, yard work and computer troubleshooting. 
 Occasionally, people volunteer a service that is not in demand. One person offered badminton instruction but was never called, Ms. Rogers said. Some members pile up time dollars and don't spend them, defeating part of the purpose. 
 When Ms. Rogers sees a big imbalance, she calls and nudges the member. ''You have to keep time dollars moving, just like any other currency,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Shock of Katrina Pushes Black Charities To New Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
FOR Erica Hunt, it all began with an e-mail message. Like millions of Americans, Ms. Hunt, the president of an African-American philanthropy called the 21st Century Foundation, was stunned by the pictures of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the wretched conditions its victims confronted, the aid that never seemed to arrive. 
 Then she heard from LaTosha Brown, a former resident of the Gulf Coast in Alabama who helped mobilize black relief efforts through a group called the Saving Our Selves Coalition. Ms. Brown wrote of people evicted from condemned homes with nothing, of stranded groups that were not reached by emergency agencies, of gas-station owners refusing to sell to black and Hispanic customers.
''We got a clear picture of what the unmet needs were, and that there would continue to be an inequity issue,'' Ms. Hunt said. ''The images from Katrina were as searing for us as the images from Birmingham, Ala., during the civil rights era, of watching dogs set upon children. 
 ''It was a long letter,'' Ms. Hunt continued, ''and it was what got us started down the road.''
 Within a month, the 21st Century Foundation raised $400,000 for black Katrina victims and, within three weeks, it handed out grants to 30 organizations in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. More has come in and gone out since then. By contrast, in 2004, just more than $1 million flowed into the coffers of the foundation, which in its 35-year history of working for social and economic justice had never done relief work. 
 Katrina's trail of destruction, which fell disproportionately on African-Americans, has had a galvanizing effect on the 21st Century Foundation and other black philanthropies. But it is also changing how the Red Cross -- which has received the vast majority of Katrina donations, but whose first-response efforts were criticized by some blacks as discriminatory at worst and insensitive at best -- deals with the black community.
 Black Americans have a long and hearty history of giving. Some surveys show they give more, as a percentage of their income, than whites or Hispanics, though others have found fault with those studies' methodologies. No one, however, quarrels with one aspect of the research: ''Between two-thirds and 90 percent of black giving goes to churches, depending on who's counting,'' said Rodney M. Jackson, president and chief executive of the National Center for Black Philanthropy, which is also starting a Katrina relief and rebuilding fund. 
 That statistic may change in Katrina's wake. Some think that blacks may now rise to a new level of giving, specifically to relief organizations and other human services groups.
 ''It's our view that the pie can and should get bigger,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We're not taking anything away from churches.''
 Hurricane funds established by the National Center and the 21st Century Foundation are just two of the relief and recovery start-ups ready to accept new black largess. There are also funds started by groups as varied as BlackAmericaWeb.com, founded by Tom Joyner, a popular syndicated radio personality; the Harvard Business School African-American Alumni Association; and the National Urban League. 
 ''This has accelerated our learning about how we have to give,'' Ms. Hunt said, ''that the potential of black philanthropy is that we can lead and build a table of people who want to solve problems. This is a case study for us in black philanthropy of how we can make change happen.'' 
 Change is already afoot at the Red Cross, which in the eyes of many African-Americans stumbled badly. Hearing anecdotal reports about Red Cross money not going to black victims and how Red Cross shelters were not available to blacks, some black pastors thundered against the organization from their pulpits, warning churchgoers not to give to it. 
 The Red Cross says most of the criticism stems from a misunderstanding of how it works after disasters. It gives emergency aid, generally within the first 72 hours: shelter, food in the shelters and immediate financial assistance to individuals for emergency needs like clothing and food. In this case, the Red Cross said it had distributed some $1.2 billion through the end of October, benefiting nearly 1.3 million families. 
 But contrary to many African-Americans' expectations, the Red Cross does not give to organizations, including the black churches and community groups that Katrina's victims descended on for help. Nor does it provide housing or support rebuilding efforts, said Rick Pogue, the Red Cross's senior vice president for human resources and chief diversity officer. 
 Mr. Pogue said the Red Cross raised more money from blacks after Katrina than it ever had before, from donors large and small: businesses, civic organizations, affinity groups and fraternities and sororities. But he, too, has heard reports about angry pastors.
 ''There's a massive education piece of this that will go toward countering that,'' he said. 
 To explain exactly what it does, Mr. Pogue said, the Red Cross has already had several meetings with African-American organizations like 100 Black Men of America, a group of ministers convened by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Congressional Black Caucus and groups in the stricken areas. 
 ''At one meeting I attended in Houston and another in Memphis, people said, 'You didn't get to XYZ location,' '' Mr. Pogue recalled. ''We said, 'You're right.' We're saying, 'If you will partner with us, we'll have a greater sense of inclusion to get to all areas faster next time.' ''
 Last month, Mr. Pogue also met with 60 faith-based community organizations just for that purpose. 
 ''Even with our vast wingspan, we can't do everything,'' Mr. Pogue said. ''We want to partner with them to get faster relief in future disasters. We have a challenge of getting into every single area.''
 To do so, the Red Cross is working through other organizations to find and certify more African-American volunteers and more shelters in black areas. In January, it will meet with a group from the African Methodist Episcopal Church to talk about training its members and to discuss future cooperation.
 ''We have an opportunity here,'' Mr. Pogue said. ''When we look at recruiting statistics for volunteers, we have not gone to churches. The No. 1 way we get Red Cross volunteers is through a friend. To change that mix, we need to go where African-Americans are, and that's inside churches. Then we'll have a better mix and greater credibility.'' 
 If there is a silver lining in Katrina's dense clouds, it may be the changes that the disaster is creating in white and black philanthropy, as organizations like the Red Cross grow more sensitive and as blacks expand their reach with their growing wealth.
 ''There is an ascendancy of upper-middle-class black people who are more visibly philanthropic,'' said Charles Sheffield, a partner at the Carthage Capital Group, a private equity firm, and the chairman of the 21st Century Foundation. ''You've got some people who have gotten very wealthy.'' After Katrina, he said, ''there is a renewed emphasis among black folks to work on black folks' problems.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Agriculture Commissioner Supports New Ethanol 

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
A new form of ethanol, called cellulosic ethanol, could help revitalize two million acres of New York farmland, said Nathan L. Rudgers, the state agriculture commissioner. Typically, ethanol is made from corn, but cellulosic ethanol can be made from grasses and trees grown on marginal farmland. Mr. Rudgers said unused farmland in economically struggling regions could support such crops. Only a fraction of gas stations sell fuel from cellulosic ethanol, but he predicted it would become a commercial reality in about five years.

HEADLINE: Congo Band Finds an International Voice in a Junkyard

BYLINE: By WILL HERMES

 BODY:
When Mawangu Mingiedi, 72, a musician and truck driver from Kinshasa in Congo, built a sound system for his street band, Konono No. 1, years ago, he wasn't aiming for sonic innovation. 
 He played traditional music on the likembe, a ''thumb piano'' constructed of thin metal rods attached to a resonator box. When performing outdoors with his group of singers, percussionists and other likembe players, it was tough to compete with the street noise. So he fashioned instrument pickups using automobile alternator magnets and amplifiers using old car radios, and sent his music out over salvaged metal public-address speaker horns.
The sound, not surprisingly, was distorted. But it was an appealing distortion, giving his hypnotic music a raw, electric quality. And the conical loudspeakers, or ''lance voix'' (voice-throwers), proved more effective than anyone expected. ''I thought that amplification would promote my group in the neighboring streets when playing in public,'' Mr. Mingiedi (who generally uses just his last name) said through a translator in a recent interview. ''I never thought it would carry my sound all the way to Europe and the U.S.A.'' 
 Yet, in time, it did. The debut LP for the more than three-decade-old group, ''Congotronics,'' was released last year on the Belgian label Crammed Discs, and its clattering rhythms became a small international sensation, thanks in part to a performance video clip that made the rounds on the Internet. Having performed in Europe this past summer, the group is now on a short tour of the United States. (It performs tomorrow at Joe's Pub in the East Village and on Thursday at S.O.B.'s in the South Village.)
 Credit for the sonic transportation also goes to Vincent Kenis, a Belgian musician and producer who became obsessed with the group when he heard it on French radio in the 1980's. ''I went to Kinshasa in 1989 and tried to find them,'' Mr. Kenis said by phone from Brussels. ''I found other bands, but not them. In '96 I returned but still couldn't find them. There were no cellphones, no real public transportation. You'd walk 15 kilometers, leave a note, and not know if anyone would see it.''
 In fact, the group had disbanded, as had many groups initially supported by the despotic regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko in the 80's as part of the country's cultural ''authenticite'' campaign, which encouraged traditional music; Mobuto came to be widely blamed for looting the wealth of Zaire, as the country was then known, and was deposed in civil strife in 1997. 
 ''The only tradi-moderne groups that survived, once the economy went bad, were the ones from the Kasai region, because it has diamonds,'' Mr. Kenis pointed out. ''People come from Kasai with a diamond in their pocket to sell in Kinshasa, they have money and want to show off, so they hire a group from their region.'' (Mr. Kenis's latest project, ''Congotronics 2,'' due in early 2006, features some of these bands.)
 Konono No. 1, whose members hail from the Bikongo region, eventually re-formed, with younger players, when Mr. Kenis's messages finally reached Mr. Mingiedi. The group's distinctive audio equipment, however, remained mostly unchanged. To capture the sound vividly, Mr. Kenis recorded three tracks for each instrument -- one miked off the group's sound system, one from the Fender amplifiers that Mr. Kenis brought along, and one directly from the instrument -- and blended them. Similarly, the group's live shows have involved balancing the output of the Konono sound system with those in the performance halls.
 The result of this mix is music that makes surprising sense to fans of electronic music and experimental rock. ''The minute I heard it, it just clicked,'' said John McEntire of the eclectic Chicago group Tortoise, whose European tour with Konono No. 1 fell through last spring when visa problems left the African group stuck in Kinshasa. ''It's just a really good fusion.'' 
 San Francisco's Aquarius records, which for a time seemed to be the only domestic source for the recording, has sold nearly 500 copies, including 40 on vinyl -- the latter, one supposes, to unusually open-minded D.J.'s. (The CD has sold roughly 35,000 copies worldwide.) ''It's the sort of stuff we and our customers love,'' Aquarius's co-owner, Andee Connors, said in an e-mail message. ''Super personal, passionate, D.I.Y., raw and intense.''
 Like certain international groups (the early Buena Vista Social Club comes to mind), the revived Konono is bigger abroad than at home. ''Congolese people mostly consider them passe,'' Mr. Kenis said. ''In Kinshasa, they mostly just play in their neighborhood.'' The group's raw, electrified sound may also make it a tough sell to world music fans who like their music more refined. 
 For his part, Mr. Kenis hopes the band's hard-driving traditional rhythms will influence young musicians in Kinshasa's nascent hip-hop scene. In the meantime, he's glad to see the group appreciated wherever its music lands, even if that's in techno clubs. 
 ''Konono is not trying to mimic Western music,'' he said. ''They've had virtually no contact with it; the similarities are purely fortuitous. One thing I like about the electronic music world is that people don't care if the music comes from Africa or the planet Mars. If it sounds good, it's good.''

HEADLINE: Voters Showed Less Appetite For Tax Cuts 

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Has the American voter's ardor for cutting taxes and shrinking government cooled?
 Voters in California, Colorado and Washington State rejected ballot measures this month that would have rolled back tax increases or limited state spending. Some say the votes could mark a turning point in a decades-old revolt against high taxes that got its symbolic start in California in 1978 with Proposition 13, which sharply limited property tax increases for homeowners and cut deeply into state services.
It may be, some analysts suggested, that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and this year's Gulf Coast hurricanes, Americans saw the value of government investment in infrastructure, public safety and other services and are now more willing to pay for it.
 ''It looks like that to me,'' said John G. Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California Law School. ''The public sector did a lot of belt-tightening during the last recession, and the public now appears to be letting it out a few notches. I think we saw that in Washington State and Colorado.'' 
 On Nov. 1, Colorado voters approved a ballot proposition that would allow the state to keep a projected $3.7 billion in tax revenue over the next five years rather than return it to taxpayers.
 In California last Tuesday, voters resoundingly defeated Proposition 76, supported by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The measure would have limited state spending and given the governor broad new powers to cut spending when state revenue lagged.
 And in Washington, an initiative put on the ballot by antitax groups failed last week by a six-point margin, letting stand a 9.5-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax passed by the Legislature. 
 In California, Mr. Matsusaka said, voters ignored Mr. Schwarzenegger's appeals to give him more power to cut state spending and tuned out television advertisements warning that the rejection of Proposition 76 would mean a big tax increase next year.
 In New Jersey, which has the highest property taxes per person in the nation, voters elected Senator Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, as governor last week, even though he promised a more modest reduction in property taxes than his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester.
 ''People are still concerned about spending, but it's not a front-burner issue for them,'' Mr. Matsusaka said. ''They're more concerned about wanting to put money in for education.''
 Advocates of cutting taxes and limiting public spending said, however, that the three ballot results were responses to specific situations and did not mark the beginning of some sort of backlash.
 ''I don't see it,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the nation's most vocal tax opponents. ''I would be very sensitive to it and sweating over it if it were happening.''
 California voters, Mr. Norquist said, were in a sour mood over the special election last week when they voted down the spending cap and all seven other measures on the ballot. Washington voters succumbed to warnings that roads and bridges were crumbling and that the gas tax was needed to avert disaster.
 And, he said, Colorado voters were hoodwinked by a ''traitor'' Republican governor, Bill Owens, into voting for a huge tax increase. (Governor Owens's argument was that limits had locked spending at levels that were far too low to handle the state's increasing population and cost of services.)
 ''All trends start with small sets of data points,'' Mr. Norquist said when asked if the three votes could mark a major shift in public opinion. ''But if you flesh in the picture for the year, that's not the case at all.''
 Mr. Norquist pointed to a proposal in Oklahoma in September that would raise gasoline taxes to pay for highway construction and maintenance. It was defeated by 87 percent to 13 percent. He said that while Colorado residents voted to lift the spending cap, they also turned down a $2.1 billion bond issue for transportation. Voters in West Virginia also rejected a big bond issue to underwrite the state's pension funds.
 Mr. Norquist said he was working with tax-limitation groups in Maine, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma and Oregon to put spending limits before voters in 2006. He said lawmakers in several other states were also considering new caps on state spending, using a variety of formulas involving population growth and inflation.
 Kim Rueben, a public finance economist at the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said the outcome of the votes this year was not sufficient to establish a trend. But Ms. Rueben said that for the past several years voters had been willing to increase taxes or approve bond issues when they were designated for tangible improvements.
 On Tuesday, voters in Maine, New York and Ohio approved bond issues totaling nearly $5 billion to pay for transportation projects, water systems, college buildings and research programs.
 ''Starting in the late 1990's, there has been more emphasis on the state of state infrastructure, and effort to get new money in and new things built,'' Ms. Rueben said. ''I think in general people want roads and are happy to fund them. But they are less willing to just turn over money to the state and let officials decide how to spend it.''
 That was how Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, a Democrat, went about trying to save the gasoline tax increase that barely passed the Legislature on the last day of the session in May.
 After the tax bill squeaked through, opponents quickly gathered 400,000 signatures to put a measure on the Nov. 8 ballot to repeal the increase, which will take effect in increments over the next three years. The money is dedicated to the repairing and seismic retrofitting of the state's highways, bridges and tunnels.
 Governor Gregoire said in an interview that two rockslides that closed the Interstate 90 pass through the mountains of eastern Washington and the damage along the Gulf Coast from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita helped her cause, by showing what can happen when state infrastructure is in poor condition.
 ''Their levees are our bridges,'' Ms. Gregoire said, referring to New Orleans. ''People here were skeptical, but Katrina brought the message home loud and clear.''
 She added, ''People here who have been antitax for a number of years now said: 'We're not going to leave our safety at risk; we're not going to leave this to our kids. We're going to invest.' ''
 The repeal measure was voted down by 53 percent to 47 percent, but a look at a map of how Washington residents voted is revealing.
 Twenty-nine of Washington's 39 counties voted to repeal, many of them by margins of 20 or even 30 percentage points. The measure failed because the heavily populated, more liberal counties around Seattle and two college towns in eastern Washington voted against it.
 In other words, when it comes to taxes, Americans are still divided.

HEADLINE: The Mansion Wars

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
In the town where I live, a once-placid Washington suburb, the mayor has just sent out a letter asking the natives to stop throwing eggs at each other's homes. Such is life on the front lines of the anti-mansionization war.
 Until recently, I didn't know that ''mansionization'' was a word, much less that there was a growing national movement against it. I didn't fully appreciate the menace of big houses. I live innocently in one of the many small houses in the Town of Chevy Chase, Md. (not to be confused with our tonier neighbor, the Village of Chevy Chase, which for some time has tolerated palaces). 
Our townspeople have inhabited 2,000-square-foot brick colonials and wooden bungalows built from Sears kits. In the past few years, a For Sale sign has meant a death sentence. We'd walk by and mutter, ''Dead house standing,'' waiting for it to be torn down and replaced with a 6,000-square-foot neo-Victorian.
 Some locals were so appalled they persuaded the town council this year to impose a moratorium on tearing down homes or building large additions. That just enraged the rest of the town, leading to a complex class war. 
 In a front-page story in The Washington Post, a newcomer complained of reverse snobbery -- ''I feel I should be embarrassed that I need a mudroom'' -- while locals mocked their new neighbors for living in McMansions they derided with names like ''the Gucci House.'' One town veteran piously explained the problem with the people buying these $2 million houses: ''It's conspicuous consumption, meaning in a sense their values are all out of proportion."
 My first impulse was to side with the mansionizers. This was partly out of self-interest because my property would sell for a lot more if a bigger home could be built there, but it was mainly because of my knee-jerk libertarian reaction to the moralizers trying to boss their neighbors around. 
 Who were they to control other people's property? Who were they to impose their tastes on newcomers? As long as the builders were following the zoning rules, let them be guided by their customers' choices, not rules made by the neighborhood busybodies. The message from the market seemed clear enough: people want bigger houses.
 But when I talked to housing experts, they pointed to another message from the market: people want neighborhood busybodies. A majority of new homes in rapidly growing urban areas are in communities governed by private homeowners associations that impose much stricter rules than governments do. 
 Some people chafe at the restrictions, but most are willing to pay a premium for them, according to a study by Amanda Agan and Alexander Tabarrok, economists at George Mason University. They found that a home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington that was part of a private community typically sold for 5 percent more than a similar home nearby not governed by a homeowners association.
 More than 50 million Americans are now ruled by neighborhood associations, which regulate things like the size of the house, the architectural style, the color and the landscaping. The rules have always sounded creepy to me, but after my town's fight, I'm starting to see why people buy into these communities -- and why some economists suggest that towns like ours be allowed to turn themselves into private associations. 
 The fury in our town was triggered by people's powerlessness to control what their neighborhood looks like. They couldn't shape the zoning rules, which are dictated at the county level, and they couldn't stop newcomers from cutting down trees or building homes that looked out of place. When a builder challenged the moratorium, the judge ruled in his favor by citing the ''long line of cases that the government may not use its police powers to regulate aesthetics.'' 
 But most people apparently want aesthetics to be regulated -- not by politicians at the city or county level, but by homeowners in the neighborhood. That's why the developers of private communities write constitutions that give so much power to the homeowners associations. 
 Those founding fathers learned by trial and error that empowering local busybodies is the best way to maximize home values and minimize strife. If our town were ruled by a homeowners' association setting clear aesthetic guidelines, the homeowners could probably work out a compromise allowing bigger houses that would blend gracefully with the neighborhood. They wouldn't be reduced to throwing eggs at the ones they didn't like.

SECTION: Section C; Column 3; Business/Financial Desk; Natural Gas: Big Worry This Winter; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1570 words

HEADLINE: Both Price and Supply Are Cause for Concern 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Unexpectedly warm weather has bathed much of the United States in recent weeks, but fears persist that a classic energy shock may be unfolding as the nation heads into winter. 
 This time, though, the coming squeeze is in natural gas rather than oil.
 Executives at companies that consume large amounts of natural gas are warning -- almost screaming -- about the costs they expect to face over the coming months.
''Our monthly natural gas bill has doubled since August, from $700,000 to $1.4 million,'' said Fletcher Steele, president of Pine Hall Brick in Winston-Salem, N.C. Mr. Steele said he planned to shut half of his production in January, when natural gas prices are expected to resume climbing again because of cold weather.
 It is a problem that has been building for several years. 
 Thanks to a huge buildup of natural-gas-fired electricity plants in the 1990's even as exploration has slowed, demand has outstripped supply; the nation now depends on natural gas for 24 percent of its energy requirements, compared with 23 percent for coal and 40 percent for oil.
 The threat of higher prices and potential shortages has led to a showdown over the most ambitious push to expand domestic drilling since the 1970's. The energy industry and major consumers of natural gas have been aggressively pushing Congress to open areas for exploration.
 While they have been rebuffed so far -- Republican leaders in the House were forced to pull back on a budget bill that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and coastal waters off several other states to drilling -- energy suppliers are expected to keep pounding at the door.
 The dispute over expanding drilling is related to the fierce opposition from environmentalists, real estate investors and residents of areas where the industry would like to put operations intended to increase imports of natural gas.
 In the meantime, higher prices for the fuel are rippling through the economy. And with more than half of the nation's homes heated by natural gas, millions of Americans are already bracing for big price increases this winter. The Energy Information Administration recently predicted that the cost of heating a typical home with natural gas could rise by more than 40 percent in coming months, or an average of $306 a household.
 At the same time, officials are warning businesses that they face possible disruptions in the natural gas supply in some states this winter. Under long-established rules, utilities will give the highest priority to supplying natural gas to homes, possibly cutting off some companies and forcing some manufacturers to turn to other energy sources. 
 Beyond the fear of supply disruptions, higher natural gas prices have stoked concern of price increases cascading through the economy, with the most recent monthly inflation gauge at 1.2 percent in September, the largest increase in a quarter-century. The United States now has the highest natural gas prices of any industrial country, surpassing those in Germany, the Netherlands and China.
 The prices have been pulling back from a post-hurricane spike in October that sent them above $14 per thousand cubic feet, but they remain at unusually high levels, with the futures contract for December closing at $11.61 on Monday. Only three years ago, during a glut, natural gas was selling for as little as $2 per thousand cubic feet.
 High prices are inflicting pain across the country, hitting hard at utilities in the mountain states, grain elevators in the Midwest and chemical manufacturers along the Gulf Coast. Announcements of job losses in energy-intensive industries are mounting.
 For instance, Lyondell Chemical of Houston said last month that it was shutting a foam chemicals plant in Lake Charles, La., cutting about 280 jobs. The reason was higher energy costs, the company said, though Lyondell also cited damage from Hurricane Rita.
 Other companies unable to pass all their higher natural gas costs to customers are starting to announce big losses. For example, CMS Energy, Michigan's largest natural gas utility, reported a $263 million loss this month. 
 The hurricanes made a bad situation worse. The American Chemistry Council estimates that 100,000 jobs at companies that rely largely on natural gas have been lost since prices for the fuel began climbing in 2000. Chemical companies have been particularly outspoken in calls for the Bush administration and Congress to focus on curbing consumption and repairing energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 ''We need to declare a national crisis,'' Andrew N. Liveris, the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, said in recent testimony before the Senate. Dow, the nation's largest chemical maker, has shut 23 plants in the United States in the last three years in places like Somerset, N.J.; South Charleston, W.Va.; and Elizabethtown, Ky., as it shifted production to Kuwait, Argentina, Malaysia and Germany, where natural gas is cheaper. 
 ''Call it demand destruction,'' Mr. Liveris said. ''Dozens of plants around the country have closed their doors and gone away, and are never coming back.''
 The Bush administration has begun to urge conservation, in moves that draw comparisons to President Jimmy Carter's calls in the late 1970's to don a sweater and turn down the thermostat. But as officials contemplate further action, the energy industry is stepping ahead with plans of its own. 
 Long-contemplated projects have come back to life, including a $20 billion pipeline to bring gas from Alaska to the lower 48 states and a $3 billion pipeline to transport Rocky Mountain gas to big cities. Beyond the lobbying to overturn drilling bans off coastlines, the industry is redoubling its efforts to overcome objections to importing large amounts of natural gas from countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. 
 Some of these projects might eventually materialize, but none quickly enough to bring natural gas prices down substantially before this winter. Still, the proposals are part of a major push by the energy industry to raise imports and overturn decades of environmental limits on domestic exploration.
 If greater offshore drilling were allowed, ''we could move up by 50 percent to 100 percent of current production, a lot in natural gas,'' claimed John F. Hofmeister, president of the Shell Oil Company in the United States. 
 The current supply shortage results mainly from production disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, where nearly 40 percent of output remains shut. But it has also revealed two disturbing trends: disappointing production elsewhere in the United States and an inadequate imports via pipeline from Canada. 
 Wildcatters are frenetically trying to drill as much as possible in parts of the Rocky Mountain West, but these efforts have produced severe bottlenecks as companies have flooded the Bureau of Land Management with a 30 percent increase in drilling applications over last year. The result has been a backlog of two months or more for approval of hundreds of projects. 
 Some companies that rely on natural gas to generate electricity are, meanwhile, scrambling to find substitutes, creating greater demand for coal, fuel oil and even wind energy. Prices for coal from the Powder River basin of Wyoming have almost doubled since September, to about $19.50 a ton from $10 a ton, and railroads there are under strain to take more coal from the area.
 And in Colorado, the wind-energy customers of one Denver utility, Xcel Energy, will be paying about $10 less on average per month than customers who buy electricity made from natural gas. 
 The surge in prices is repositioning the debate over whether greater imports of natural gas are needed. Some officials, most notably Alan Greenspan, the departing chairman of the Federal Reserve, have warned repeatedly over the last two years about the risks of a supply shock because of too much reliance on domestic production.
 ''Our limited capacity to import liquefied natural gas effectively restricts our access to the world's abundant supplies of natural gas,'' Mr. Greenspan said in June 2003. ''If North American natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility exhibited by oil, unlimited access to the vast world reserves of gas is required.'' 
 The United States currently has five terminals for importing natural gas. Regulators have approved the construction of eight more; all but one are planned in coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas that are prone to hurricanes. 
 Rooted in fears over accidents or terrorist-induced explosions, opposition to terminal projects in other parts of the country raises the possibility that the United States might lose access to natural gas sources to other nations where governments can easily override local objections.
 In China, for instance, officials in Beijing recently determined that the country would build 10 L.N.G. terminals, paving the way for China to compete for natural gas reserves in Asia and Russia. 
 The scramble for those resources, of course, is less immediate than fears of a prolonged cold snap in the months ahead. William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said recently that natural gas prices were the biggest short-term risk to the economy.
 ''If we have a cold winter,'' Mr. Poole said with the typical reserve of central bankers, ''we may find ourselves with an unpleasant crunch.''

HEADLINE: Other Nations Hope to Loosen U.S. Grip on Internet 

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
When Libya lost the use of its Internet domain ''.ly'' for five days last year, it needed help from an agency in California that reports to the United States Commerce Department.
 Anyone looking to do business with an .ly Web site or e-mail an .ly address probably met with a ''file not found'' or ''no such person'' message. For anyone on the Internet, Libya was just not there.
 In a day when Internet access is critical to world commerce -- let alone casual communication -- even a five-day lapse is a hardship. And when one government needs the help of another to make its citizens visible again on that network, it can be a damaging blow to its sovereignty, and perhaps a matter of national security, even if the cause was a dispute over payments, as in the Libyan case. 
 What if, by historical chance, France or Britain controlled country domain names on the Internet? Would the United States settle for asking another government to fix its own addresses?
 That kind of power to hinder or foster freedom of the Internet, centralized in a single government, is the crucial issue for many of the 12,000 people expected in Tunis this week for a United Nations summit meeting on the information age.
 Four years of high-level talks on Internet governance will conclude with the meeting. On its eve, a figurative ocean separates the American position -- that the Internet works fine as it is -- from most of the rest of the world. That includes the European Union, which says the Internet is an international resource whose center of gravity must move away from Washington.
 Managing operators of country-level domain names like .ly, .de and .co.uk is one way the United States, through Icann, a nonprofit agency based in California, controls the Internet. This organization is a consequence of the network's development from research in American universities, laboratories and government agencies in the 1970's.
 Icann, which is short for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a central authority in an essentially decentralized, neutral and ungoverned global network of networks. So that one computer can easily find another, Icann runs the addressing system, giving out blocks of unique identifiers to countries and private registries.
 Whether this week's final debates break the deadlock and produce any agreement to give other governments more sway over Internet policy was in some doubt last week. Even a recent discussion of Internet governance between President Bush and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, did not bring the sides any closer.
 ''Our strong preference is to have a document that everyone can be proud of,'' said David Gross, deputy assistant secretary of state, who is leading the American delegation with Michael Gallagher, assistant secretary of commerce.
 ''We would be sorely disappointed not to have a document at all, but that would be better than to have a bad document,'' Mr. Gross said from Tunis, where the negotiations resumed Sunday before the official start of the summit meeting on Wednesday.
 A delegate from the European Union said that its call for a new intergovernmental body to set the principles for running the Internet still stands and that the solitary American relationship with Icann ''is not sustainable'' in the long term.
 The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified because he was not authorized to speak for the delegation, conceded that ''there is a need for clarification'' in the European Union statement. 
 But he said the 25-member European contingent was unanimous in its stance, which he called ''a middle ground between two extremes: those who are for a complete overhaul and those who are for the status quo.''
 Mr. Gross and other Americans dismiss the European view as ''top down'' control of the Internet, as opposed to the private-sector-led, ''bottom up'' approach of Icann.
 But the essential problem is that ''the United States holds most of the cards, and if it isn't willing to give any up, it can't be forced to,'' said Milton Mueller, a partner in the Internet Project, a nonprofit group. 
 When the first part of the summit meeting took place two years ago in Geneva, many participants feared that the United Nations, through the International Telecommunication Union, wanted to govern Internet issues.
 ''Today, the I.T.U. is off the table,'' Mr. Mueller said.
 But Mr. Mueller, a participant in the meeting and a longtime follower of developments at Icann, said the Americans had handled their position poorly in the face of global opposition since then. ''Americans are so parochial when it comes to these things,'' he said. ''They have no idea how it sounds to 200 other countries when they say, 'The Internet really is nongovernmental -- except for us.' Why were they so surprised? In the U.S., that contradiction becomes invisible to you.''
 The agreement that lets Icann operates under Commerce Department oversight expires in September. The United States government, however, said in June that it would not let its oversight of the master file that decodes Internet addresses lapse despite the agreement.
 But Mr. Mueller says the summit meeting fireworks may lead the Bush administration to consider other options that are not so unilateral.
 Such small, longer-term steps may not come soon enough for some developments. Two trends herald an enormous demand for unique Internet addresses of the kind that Icann manages, and global participants are eager that the policy and political questions be settled quickly.
 One trend is the move by media businesses to make their products available online. Each song, video clip, book or other digital product requires a unique identifier to locate it on the Internet, even if the file is not a Web site per se. 
 The other is the desire of manufacturers and wholesalers to put radio tags in their physical products for inventory and other supply-chain management. To be tracked over the Internet, each tag also needs its own Internet ''address,'' leading to what the I.T.U. is calling an ''Internet of things.''
 Paul Twomey, the Australian who is chief executive of Icann, said the cooperative and democratic Internet was unlike any other network that had been governed so far -- not like the world's railroads, the postal systems or telecommunications -- and so required a fresh, untried approach.

I USUALLY avoid Orlando, a place I associate with hopeless traffic, bottles of Snapple that cost $3.75, cab fares that seem to start at $25 and an airport where the security check-in gates, mobbed by the bewildered and manned by the hostile, add a mezzanine level to the seven circles of hell.
 But Hurricane Katrina forced the National Business Aviation Association to hurriedly switch its annual convention from New Orleans to the Orange County Convention Center here, so here I was last week. Besides, the business-aircraft trade show is the only time I can manage to get at least one demonstration ride on a corporate jet and see how the other half (or one-hundredth, or whatever) lives. 
This explains what I was doing the other afternoon in a plush 12-seat Embraer Legacy 600 business jet (price tag: $22.4 million) at 35,000 feet above southwest Florida, idly watching the Caloosahatchee River curl down into the Gulf of Mexico. My companions on the demonstration flight, two Embraer employees and a trade-news reporter, were more industriously engaged at their laptops, which were linked to a high-speed Internet connection. 
 A lot was happening at the show, held concurrently at the huge convention center and at the Orlando Executive Airport, where 110 business jets were on display. I'll thread some of the news I picked up through future columns, but here's the big story:
 Sales of business jets are surging, at prices from about $2 million to $45 million and more. Snappy models are coming online, including the so-called very light jets, priced in the $2 million range, that some enthusiasts say will be the foundation of an air-taxi business for short hauls.
 Honeywell International Inc. estimated that more than 800 business jets, a record, will be delivered next year, up from 745 this year and 589 in 2004, with growth reaching ''an industry peak'' in 2007. 
 There are clear signs that the business-jet phenomenon is spreading internationally. Rolls-Royce, which makes aircraft engines, estimated that buyers in China, India and Russia would take delivery of 500 to 700 business jets in the next 10 years. And Rolls-Royce currently projects that 7,500 very light jets will be delivered in the same period.
 The growing demand, fueled by the booming world economy, has been of great interest in Brazil, home of Embraer. Embraer made a name for itself as the maker of workhorse 30-to-70-seat regional jets that revolutionized commercial air travel on short and intermediate hauls. 
 More recently, the company introduced a line of so-called E-Jets, with 70 to 118 seats and more cabin space, and range, than those cramped regional jets. JetBlue, one customer, recently began flying new, roomier (and more fuel-efficient) 100-seat Embraer 190's and has ordered 100 in all. The last in that line, the Embraer 195, will arrive next year.
 And that is where Embraer has decided to stop in the commercial jet market, which is dominated by Boeing and Airbus, whose 737 and A320 lines are the next step up in size from E-Jets. So here's the second most interesting news: Embraer is jumping with both feet into the corporate jet market, the company's chief executive, Mauricio Novis Botelho, said in a 45-minute interview.
 Embraer dipped a big toe into that market when it introduced the Legacy in 2000. The Legacy is a derivative of the sturdy Embraer ERJ-135 and 145 regional jets, which seat up to 50. Reconfigured with about a dozen plush seats, including a divan that opens into a bed, and with extra fuel tanks that increase the range from about 2,000 nautical miles to over 3,200, the Legacy was a success after a slow start. About 60 are flying, Mr. Botelho said.
 Boeing and Airbus dominate the field for larger commercial aircraft -- ''the big dogs' market,'' as Mr. Botelho called it. ''We saw that we would not be developing a bigger aircraft than the 195,'' he said. Looking at the ''low-risk approach we took with the Legacy'' and convinced that the potential for growth in private jets justified a little more risk, ''we've decided to go into the executive jet market in depth,'' he added.
 Embraer introduced two new private jets here: the Phenom 300, a $6.65 million light jet to compete against entry-level models by industry giants like Bombardier, Raytheon and Cessna; and the Phenom 100, a $2.75 million very light jet, or so-called micro-jet, to join models in that new niche like Eclipse Aviation's 500, Adam Aircraft's 700 and Cessna's Citation Mustang.
 Embraer is also planning two additional business jet models, not yet announced, that will fit into niches between the Phenom 300 and the Legacy, Mr. Botelho said. In business aviation, that's where the some of the biggest dogs now play.

HEADLINE: Quiet Trading as Investors Await Key Consumer Data 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street wandered through a listless session yesterday, finishing little changed as investors cast aside upbeat earnings at Wal-Mart Stores and Lowe's ahead of critical inflation and spending data this week.
 Strong results from Wal-Mart and Lowe's came as a sign that consumers were still spending despite the recent increase in energy costs, brightening the holiday sales outlook. A pair of multibillion-dollar acquisitions also helped the market's mood: Georgia-Pacific is being taken private and Host Marriott is buying 38 upscale hotels.
 But with crucial government data on inflation and retail sales expected this week, investors are waiting for indications of whether higher costs are driving up prices on consumer goods, said John C. Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investments. 
 ''Now that gas prices have come down, there's more confidence that inflation will be kept at bay,'' Mr. Forelli said. ''But I'm not sure the market is really going to believe that'' until the Federal Reserve says so, he added.
 Forecasts for a cold snap in the Northeast pressured crude oil despite recent reports that supplies were adequate for increased demand this winter. A barrel of light crude gained 16 cents, to $57.69 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,697.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.01 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,233.71, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.52 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,200.95.
 Wall Street is coming off a three-week advance fed by lower oil prices and positive economic numbers, which have eased fears about the effect of recent hurricanes. But persistent inflation and interest rate worries have investors scouring for any hint of the economy's health. This week's economic data should determine if the market's recent rally will continue, said Richard A. Dickson, chief market strategist of Lowry's Research Reports.
 The market ''has more to go,'' Mr. Dickson said. ''Particularly if the market reacts well to all the data this week, it will give people who've been sitting on the sidelines a reason to get in.
 ''The reaction to those numbers should give us a better indication of what the remainder of the fourth quarter has in store.''
 Meanwhile, investors weighed comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who warned that the nation's trade deficit could not grow wider but said that any fallout should be countered by the economy's flexibility. Many fear that foreigners -- who finance the trade deficit -- will grow wary of dollar-denominated investments and unload United States stocks and bonds.
 Koch Industries offered to buy Georgia-Pacific for $13.2 billion in cash, forming the nation's largest private company, with annual sales of about $80 billion. Shares of Georgia-Pacific jumped $12.63, to $47.28.
 Host Marriott is paying Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide $3.4 billion to acquire 38 domestic and overseas properties under the Westin, Sheraton, W Hotel, Luxury Collection and St. Regis banners. Host Marriott slid 79 cents, to $16.65, while Starwood rose 76 cents, to $60.02.
 Knight Ridder said it might put itself up for sale amid pressure from its largest stockholders. Knight Ridder added 60 cents, to $63.10.
 In earnings news, Wal-Mart reported a 4 percent increase in third-quarter profit -- matching analysts' expectations -- with sales adding 10 percent despite the setback dealt by hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Wal-Mart gained 30 cents, to $49.30.
 Lowe's said its earnings swelled 26 percent and beat Wall Street estimates by 4 cents a share, helped by 17 percent sales growth. Lowe's climbed $2.92, to $64.89.
 Tyson Foods posted a 49 percent jump in quarterly profit. However, its results were below expectations and the company issued a weak annual outlook. Tyson sank $1.99, to $16.51.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note declined 10/32, to a price of 995/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.60 percent from 4.56 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of the three-month and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)


	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.011	97.879	High Rate	 3.910	 4.195	Investment Rate	 4.004	 4.345	Low Rate	 3.870	 4.170	Median Rate	 3.900	 4.180	Total applied for	$45,285,122	$44,532,215	Accepted	$25,201,748	$22,418,163	Noncompetitive	$1,987,499	$1,609,117	

Both issues are dated Nov. 17, 2005. The three-month bills mature on Feb. 16, 2006 and the six-month bills mature on May 18, 2006.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges China to Open Markets and Help Break an Impasse in Global Trade Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Senior United States officials exhorted China on Monday to open its markets further, but also asked for its help in breaking an impasse in global trade talks, displaying a combination of demands and pleas that increasingly characterizes the relationship between the countries.
 In speeches and interviews here just six days before President Bush arrives in Beijing, both Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, and David A. Sampson, the deputy secretary of commerce, repeated previous demands that China protect American copyrights, trademarks and patents and that more American companies be allowed to compete in China's domestic market. 
But Mr. Portman said he had also urged senior Chinese officials to become more active in World Trade Organization negotiations to produce a new global trade pact.
 ''I believe that China, being a major player now in the global trading system, and a major beneficiary of the multilateral trading system, has a responsibility to be more engaged in the talks,'' he said in an interview.
 The demands for changes to Chinese domestic policies coupled with a request for Chinese help in W.T.O. negotiations shows how the Chinese-American economic relationship is becoming as complex as the two countries' security relationship.
 Pentagon officials have struggled to balance their challenges to China's military policy -- particularly urging China to slow its rapid military buildup in coastal provinces facing Taiwan -- with appeals for China to use its influence to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. 
 On the economic front, the United States particularly hopes China will join demands from many countries for the European Union to accept deep reductions in its farm subsidies, Mr. Portman said. President Hu Jintao of China has been touring Europe for the last week, but has said nothing on trade.
 ''I haven't told them what to do, but I think it's fairly obvious: once becoming engaged, you can't help but see that the problem right now is that the European Union is not willing to agree to an agriculture proposal that provides for meaningful market access and until they do, it is impractical to think this round can be successful,'' he said.
 European Union officials have contended that the main obstacle lies in the reluctance of large developing countries like Brazil to cut tariffs sharply on imported industrial goods. They were also irritated by the eleventh-hour offer of cuts in farm subsidies from the United States, which had stalled on the issue.
 Mr. Portman's comments reflected growing American frustration with China's near silence on the global trade talks. Just four weeks remain until trade ministers from 148 countries and customs territories arrive for negotiations in Hong Kong, but Chinese officials have largely stayed on the sidelines.
 W.T.O. officials have long said their goal at the Hong Kong conference is to make progress toward a global deal, not to actually complete it, and they have ratcheted down their forecasts of how much progress can be achieved after unsuccessful talks in London and Geneva last week among ministers from the world's leading trading powers, including the United States, the European Union and China.
 China has unique influence in Europe, with the leaders of France, Britain and Germany making almost annual visits to Beijing in recent years, mainly to seek contracts for their exporters. President Hu stayed at Buckingham Palace as the guest of Queen Elizabeth last week and dined with King Juan Carlos at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid this week, but he has been silent on trade.
 China itself has begun experimenting with farm subsidies, notably through provincial governments providing sometimes lavish assistance to tea exporters. China's farmers have lagged behind city dwellers considerably as the economy has boomed over the last quarter century, and provincial governments are now trying, with strong encouragement from Beijing, to address that imbalance.
 In addition to seeking help with the trade talks, Mr. Portman also delivered a strongly worded speech here exhorting China to dismantle a variety of regulations that have limited the expansion of American companies in China's telecommunications, insurance and direct sales markets. He denounced China's policy of limiting multinational automakers to 50 percent stakes in assembly plants.
 ''There is no reason foreign automakers should not be able to own 100 percent of their Chinese joint ventures,'' Mr. Portman said. The Chinese policy is aimed at forcing the transfer of advanced technology to Chinese automakers, which may soon become large exporters of their own models.
 Mr. Sampson took a far less confrontational tone in a speech three hours later, urging China to limit counterfeiting, but also emphasizing successes in the bilateral relationship, like the profitable operations that many American companies have set up here. ''To focus exclusively on the U.S. trade deficit is, I think, to look at only one part'' of a broader trading relationship in which real progress is being made, he said.
 Liao Xiaoqi, China's vice minister of commerce, was conspicuously silent on W.T.O. issues in his remarks on a panel with Mr. Sampson. He highlighted the arrest of 4,080 people in less than a year on a variety of illegal copying charges. He said the American trade deficit with China was partly a result of American limits on the export to China of technologies that may have military as well as civilian applications.
 Mr. Liao also criticized the United States for already imposing some import limits; these have fallen on Chinese products ranging from socks to bedroom furniture. ''Trade protection measures by the U.S. have been on the rise,'' he said.
 Mr. Portman and Mr. Sampson spoke at a conference here on trade, diplomacy and scientific research. Former President George H. W. Bush and the presidential library foundation and public policy school named after him at Texas A&M University played large roles in organizing the conference.
 The four-day conference, which runs through Thursday, has attracted senior Chinese officials and many current and former top American government officials who are Bush family friends; the former president and his wife, Barbara, are attending some of the events.

HEADLINE: Name-Calling Erodes Ties Between Fox And Chavez

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Diplomatic relations between Mexico and Venezuela fell apart Monday after President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela refused to apologize for remarks about President Vicente Fox of Mexico.
 The two heads of state have been at loggerheads since this month's Summit of the Americas in Argentina, where Mr. Fox defended an American-backed proposal for a free trade zone throughout the Americas while Mr. Chavez declared it dead. Violent protests against the idea raged in the streets of Mar del Plata, Argentina, during the talks. 
The rift between Mexico and Venezuela reflects a wider gap between Canada, the United States and Mexico on one side and Latin American left-wing leaders, who have rejected President Bush's call for more free trade, preferring to strengthen their trade ties with China and the European Union. The presidents of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay have taken a stand similar to that of Mr. Chavez.
 Mr. Fox, a conservative, has been Mr. Bush's most outspoken ally in the effort to revive the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, standing up to the other large countries during the summit meeting. He has accused Argentina's left-leaning president, Nestor Kirchner, of pandering to opinion polls and suggested that Mr. Chavez was divorced from reality.
 Mr. Fox's position has led him into an escalating war of words with Mr. Chavez, a former soldier who presents his socialist revolution as an alternative to United States hegemony. Mr. Fox has said on several occasions that free trade is the only way to alleviate poverty in Latin America and has said those who oppose it, like Mr. Chavez, are fooling themselves and their constituents.
 In turn, Mr. Chavez, a left-wing populist unloved in Washington, has attacked Mr. Fox personally. On Friday, he called the Mexican president a ''puppy dog of the empire,'' and criticized his ''surrender'' to the United States. Then on his Sunday talk show, Mr. Chavez said that Mr. Fox had left the summit meeting ''bleeding from his wound.'' 
 Then Mr. Chavez recalled a folk song from Venezuela's cattle country about thorn bushes. After reciting the lyrics, he warned Mr. Fox: ''Don't mess with me, sir, because you'll come out pricked.''
 On Sunday night, Mexico demanded a formal apology and said if it did not get one it would withdraw its ambassador at midnight Monday. But Venezuela's foreign minister, Ali Rodriguez, beat the Mexican government to the punch, withdrawing the Venezuelan ambassador from Mexico on Monday afternoon. 
 Mr. Fox, appearing on CNN, said Mexico would reluctantly go ahead with plans to call its ambassador home as well. Taking the high road, Mr. Fox said Monday that he respected the opinions of those who were against free trade, but that he felt strongly that Mexico's free trade agreements had been an indispensable tool in raising the standard of living here. He said he felt compelled to make the case publicly.
 ''My discussions have been about themes, not about people,'' he said. ''What is not valid is to carry a institutional theme, an economic theme, a theme about the development of our countries, onto personal terrain, and to use adjectives that are not tolerable, nor acceptable for Mexico and for Mexicans.''

HEADLINE: Senate G.O.P. Pushes for Plan On Ending War

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
In a sign of increasing unease among Congressional Republicans over the war in Iraq, the Senate is to consider on Tuesday a Republican proposal that calls for Iraqi forces to take the lead next year in securing the nation and for the Bush administration to lay out its strategy for ending the war.
 The Senate is also scheduled to vote Tuesday on a compromise, announced Monday night, that would allow terror detainees some access to federal courts. The Senate had voted last week to prohibit those being held from challenging their detentions in federal court, despite a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary. 
Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is the author of the initial plan, said Monday that he had negotiated a compromise that would allow detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to challenge their designation as enemy combatants in federal courts and also allow automatic appeals of any convictions handed down by the military where detainees receive prison terms of 10 years or more or a death sentence.
 The proposal on the Iraq war, from Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, and Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, would require the administration to provide extensive new quarterly reports to Congress on subjects like progress in bringing in other countries to help stabilize Iraq. The other appeals related to Iraq are nonbinding and express the position of the Senate.
 The plan stops short of a competing Democratic proposal that moves toward establishing dates for a phased withdrawal of troops from Iraq. But it is built upon the Democratic approach and makes it clear that senators of both parties are increasingly eager for Iraqis to take control of their country in coming months and open the door to removing American troops.
 Mr. Warner said the underlying message was, ''we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it.'' The senator, an influential party voice on military issues, said he did not interpret the wording of his plan as critical of the administration, describing it as a ''forward-looking'' approach.
 ''It is not a question of satisfaction or dissatisfaction,'' he said. ''This reflects what has to be done.''
 Democrats said the plan represented a shift in Republican sentiment on Iraq and was an acknowledgment of growing public unrest with the course of the war and the administration's frequent call for patience. ''I think it signals the fact that the American people are demanding change, and the Republicans see that that's something that they have to follow,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. 
 Mr. Frist said an important reason for the Republican proposal was to offer an alternative to the Democratic call for a withdrawal timetable. ''The real objective was to get out of this timeline of cutting and running that the Democrats have in their amendment,'' he said.
 Mr. Warner said he decided to take the Democratic proposal and edit it to his satisfaction in an effort to find common ground between the parties on the issue.
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said he saw the proposal as a potential ''turning point'' in Congressional deliberation over Iraq and related issues.
 The competing amendments include some of the most specific and expansive Congressional statements on the war in months and are being proposed for inclusion in a measure that also wrestles with the issues of treatment of terror detainees and their rights in American courts.
 In announcing the compromise on the rights of detainees, Senator Graham said, ''We have brought legal certainty to legal confusion.'' He said detainees would still be barred from mounting a wide array of court challenges regarding their treatment or the conditions of their confinement.
 Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the compromise had eased some of his previous objections to the restrictions on the detainees.
 On the Iraq resolutions, the Democratic and Republican proposals say that ''2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.''
 The plan also seeks to put pressure on the Iraqis to find ways to resolve their internal political turmoil, saying the ''administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency.''
 The White House is also directed ''to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq.'' Democrats have complained persistently that the administration has failed to outline a plan.
 Lawmakers also seek much more specific regular reports from the administration covering ''the current military mission and the diplomatic, political, economic and military measures, if any, that are being or have been undertaken to successfully complete or support that mission.''
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said the provision would improve accountability. 
 ''The president needs to report to the American people and leaders in Congress as this war develops,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''It shouldn't be a matter of haphazard Congressional committee hearings.''
 The primary differences between the party approaches regards fixing dates for a withdrawal. The Democratic plan called for the administration to provide ''estimated dates'' for redeployment of American troops once a series of conditions was met, with the caveat that ''unexpected contingencies may arise.''
 But Republicans said that provision was cutting too close to setting a schedule for withdrawal. ''We are not going to have any timetable,'' Mr. Warner said.

HEADLINE: Inflation Sure To Dominate In Questioning Fed Nominee

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, President Bush's nominee to lead the Federal Reserve, will have to fend off two contradictory perceptions at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.
 Some Democratic lawmakers worry that Mr. Bernanke, who has contended for years that the Fed should set policy according to an explicit inflation target, will be too focused on price stability and not attentive to employment.
Some bond investors, by contrast, fret that Mr. Bernanke will be soft on inflation. As a Fed governor in 2003, he raised alarms about the ''jobless recovery'' and the dangers of deflation. As a top adviser to Mr. Bush since June, he has been more confident than many Fed officials that inflation would remain low. 
 Both images are likely to prove simplistic, but the way Mr. Bernanke deals with them could provide important clues to his long-term vision for the Fed and his efforts to establish credibility.
 Mr. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton University and a Fed governor from 2002 until earlier this year, is likely to win Senate confirmation without a major fight. 
 ''It's noncontroversial,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a member of the Senate Banking Committee. ''It's hard to argue about his qualifications.''
 But Mr. Bernanke will nonetheless face questioning on three basic questions:
 How would inflation-targeting work, and would it be more rigid and formulaic than policy making under Alan Greenspan? Based on his writings and his signals to lawmakers in recent days, Mr. Bernanke is likely to emphasize the need for flexibility and ''constrained discretion.'' 
 Is Mr. Bernanke a hawk or a dove on fighting inflation? His writings and his record at the Fed suggest he will be in line with the Fed consensus: the top priority will be to maintain price stability, even if it hurts.
 Would Mr. Bernanke lend his authority to Mr. Bush's goal of making his tax cuts permanent, even if that increases the federal budget deficit? Here, Mr. Bernanke may end up providing even more support to Mr. Bush than Mr. Greenspan has.
 As a White House adviser, Mr. Bernanke has already joined the call to make the tax cuts permanent. And unlike Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke has not argued that Congress should be required to offset the cost of tax cuts with savings in other areas.
 ''Low marginal tax rates are supportive of economic growth,'' Mr. Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee earlier this year. ''I would submit that we would want to look very hard at government spending -- make sure it's controlled -- before we raise taxes, which, in turn, would have negative impacts on the economy.'' 
 By almost all accounts, Mr. Bernanke would continue the Federal Reserve's political independence on monetary policy.
 Mr. Bernanke, though a Republican, spent most of his career as a politically nonpartisan academic economist. His pursuit of inflation targets and other predictable rules for policy making would, if anything, make the Fed less amenable to political influence.
 Mr. Bernanke has argued that the Fed policy would be less personalized, more open and more predictable if it were based on an explicit and public inflation target.
 Mr. Bernanke has gone so far as to suggest that inflation should be held to 1 to 2 percent a year, excluding the fluctuations of energy and food.
 Critics of inflation-targeting fall into two broad groups. Some, like Mr. Greenspan, contend that the practice would be too rigid and formulaic and would make it harder to deal with unexpected shocks.
 Other critics, including some Democrats, worry that inflation-targeting would conflict with the Fed's dual mandate of pursuing both price stability and full employment.
 In practice, Fed policy under Mr. Bernanke might not be all that different. Many analysts contend that the Fed already has an unstated inflation target, about 2 percent a year, and a preferred method of calculating inflation.
 Mr. Bernanke, for his part, has written that the Fed can deviate from its inflation target -- perhaps for several years, if necessary -- to cope with an unexpected shock to the economy.
 On inflation, many analysts predict that Mr. Bernanke would, at least at the beginning, err on the side of toughness and higher interest rates to establish his credibility with financial markets.
 But Mr. Bernanke was among the more dovish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, when policy makers were worried the United States might be headed toward a downward spiral in consumer prices.
 In August, as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Bernanke sounded more confident than Fed policy makers about inflation. 
 Fed officials had begun to fret that rising energy prices and other pressures might start to push up inflationary expectations. Partly as a result, Fed officials rebuffed speculation that they might pause in their gradual raising of interest rates.
 Mr. Bernanke, by contrast, told reporters at Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas that he saw no signs of a problem. ''I see inflation as remaining well contained going forward,'' he said.
 Investors are now betting that the Fed will raise the overnight Federal funds rate two more times before Mr. Greenspan steps down on Jan. 31, and that Mr. Bernanke will raise them at least one more time in his first two meetings as Fed chairman next year.
 But bond investors have been more jittery about the long term. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds have edged up significantly over the last several months, to almost 4.6 percent from about 4 percent, on expectations that inflation is picking up.
 As an academic economist and as a Fed governor, Mr. Bernanke prided himself on speaking clearly and sometimes even bluntly. But on Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke will face lawmakers who want ''flexibility'' and bond markets that want inflation-fighting credibility. 
 To satisfy both constituencies, he may have to sacrifice on his plain-speaking.

HEADLINE: Playoff Glory Would Be Real Reward

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BIG deal.
 Is it impolitic to say what many, if not most, Yankees fans are undoubtedly thinking? Is it fair to minimize the 48 home runs, the 130 runs batted in and a .610 slugging percentage that yesterday earned Alex Rodriguez his second American League Most Valuable Player award?
 Is it inappropriate or even unprincipled to be praiseworthy to a point, or to suggest the M.V.P. plaque be inscribed with a traditional newspaper disclaimer, ''The American League division series was played too late for this edition''? 
 Given the voting parameters, the issue is by no means whether Rodriguez is worthy of the award, which he won by outpolling the equally deserving David Ortiz. It is in part the conundrum of how his exceedingly robust regular season should be adjudicated in the national pastime's court of public opinion.
 But more important, even, than A-Rod's talk-radio fate is how the Yankees will rearrange the furniture around him in the Babe's house, in light of his failures during their five-game flop against the Angels -- a performance even he initially characterized as the work of a canine.
 ''My one regret is that I could have walked 10 or 12 times and passed along the baton, been a little more patient,'' he said yesterday from Miami on a conference call. 
 From the moment he muffed Orlando Cabrera's chopper in the sixth inning of Game 2, signaling the conclusion to a game and a half of the Yankees' road dominance, Rodriguez seemed destined to become the face of their despair, a deal that was sealed by his double-play bouncer in the ninth inning of Game 5.
 Of course, he had plenty of company in George Steinbrenner's doghouse, but singular blame goes with the territory he lobbied hard to live in two winters ago, when Rodriguez so willingly traded the treadmill of collective mediocrity in Texas for the ritual challenge of Yankee October. 
 ''Obviously the reason I came to New York and made the concessions I made,'' he said.
 So, yes, as Rodriguez's thirst for the postseason stage was his stated reason for surrendering shortstop -- his career-long position and one he fielded with greater aplomb than Derek Jeter -- then why wouldn't his ultimate evaluation be greatly, if not solely, based on how he has fared in the playoffs?
 Rodriguez was already the 2003 M.V.P. and a two-time runner-up as he hit New York, with little to prove from April through September. Heading toward the 2006 season, which will be his third with the Yankees, they know he is probably the best all-around talent in baseball. They know what a spectacular run-producer he is, no matter where they bat him. 
 They know that with A-Rod anchoring the lineup, with Jeter, Hideki Matsui (assuming he is re-signed), a rejuvenated Jason Giambi and the emerging Robinson Cano hitting around him, the Yankees should score more than enough runs in the regular season.
 They should also by now recognize that not all the baggage A-Rod brought to New York was filled with those pristine GQ suits, that some contained the residue of his being the highest-paid baseball player ever. The $252 million man wilted in the heat of the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Red Sox. He collapsed when the Angels nibbled him to pieces last month. His manager, Joe Torre, admitted that he had to give A-Rod a talking-to, in a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to help him pacify self-imposed pressures. 
 ''My benchmark is so high that no matter what I do, it's never going to be enough,'' Rodriguez said, after admitting that hitting .133 in the division series didn't even scratch the surface of postseason success.
 Fair or not, he now carries the biggest of individual Yankee burdens. Five years and counting, the Yankees have been unable to power their way to the promised land. With each passing season, they have spent more, reaching levels of historic salary inflation, while becoming less proficient in the art of the game. 
 Nobody can blame A-Rod for that, but the memories of him, Matsui and Gary Sheffield flailing and failing last month should have sounded the alarm for significant philosophical change. If Brian Giles, who has played sparingly in center field, is their replacement for Bernie Williams, then they are still dreaming. They would be less likely to crash again in October by sacrificing Sheffield in a deal with the Mets for Mike Cameron, and signing Giles, a high on-base-percentage hitter, to replace Sheffield in right.
 ''Defense is first and foremost,'' Rodriguez said. ''The White Sox showed us this year that pitching and defense wins.''
 A simple game often seems more complicated when it comes to A-Rod. Personality issues with the news media -- the sense that he is too polished, too scripted -- can blunt the beauty of what he achieves. Even as the playful gurgling of a young child provided a soundtrack to his commemorative conference call, the first question thrown was a high hard one under the chin: did he think that recent revelations of his gambling in illegal poker clubs would tarnish his image?
 A second query was in on the hands, challenging A-Rod to reveal what he'd give up for one championship ring. He said he'd gladly swap this M.V.P. award for the jewelry Ortiz won in Boston last year.
 He answered smoothly, as always, and stoically, as usual. After two seasons in New York, he knows the deal. Nothing of true redeeming value can be won across the summer, or two weeks into November.

HEADLINE: Commissioner's Tough Act to Follow Is His Own

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Raymond W. Kelly built the Police Department's counterterrorism program from scratch. He drove crime down further, against predictions and beyond national averages. He has improved relations with the city's black and Latino populations. And, a decade after his first, abbreviated term as New York City police commissioner, he did it all with a shrinking number of officers.
 Now, as Mr. Kelly makes good on his pledge to stay on for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's second term as the man widely seen as the second most powerful person in city government, people close to him say he will not be satisfied at having gone from underestimated to vindicated. He is, they say, intent on cementing his successes -- in fighting terror and in working to bring the department's technology into the 21st century, among others.
 Some, including admirers, question his decision to stay, noting that his carefully restored reputation, which came under harsh criticism during the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, could suffer if crime goes up or terrorists attack. Others suggest he might have his eyes on a bigger prize -- City Hall. Mr. Kelly, for his part, insists he has no political ambitions, and no great fear of setbacks to his reputation. 
 ''It sounds corny, but I never have avoided the challenges -- I relish them -- I think it's what make me tick, to a certain extent,'' Mr. Kelly, 64, said in an interview. ''That would be the last reason I would leave, because things would turn bad; that would be reason I would stay, quite frankly.''
 Some, however, who follow city government see Mr. Kelly's legacy, if not his accomplishments, at risk in a world where a terrorist attack may be inevitable, and an economic downturn could stall or reverse crime's decline. 
 ''You're really gambling against yourself at this point,'' said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University, ''because your chances of improving against your track record to date seem to dwindle by the day. If you wait long enough, something bad is going to happen no matter how good you are.''
 It is less of a mystery why Mr. Bloomberg, after being re-elected by a wide margin, wants Mr. Kelly at his side for another term. The commissioner provides bedrock credibility on crime and terrorism, two of the most important issues of Mr. Bloomberg's mayoralty.
 But theories abound on Mr. Kelly's thinking, and they are as multifaceted as the man himself. 
 He wants to run for mayor: Mr. Bloomberg has mentioned him as a potential candidate.
 He needs action: After decades at the highest ranks of the Police Department and the federal government, Mr. Kelly has had a seat at the table of power for much of his adult life.
 He wants to institutionalize his initiatives: Mr. Kelly has created a counterterrorism operation that is probably unmatched by any municipal police agency in the world. But much of it was built on his relationships and federal experience, and may not survive his departure.
 He is the duty-bound captain who does not want to leave the bridge: Mr. Kelly often talks in personal terms about protecting New York. He and his wife, Veronica, who have long lived in Battery Park City, watched their neighborhood collapse into a smoking ruin on Sept. 11, 2001. The sight, he has often said, propelled him back into public service from a job overseeing global security for Bear, Stearns & Company.
 Divining the true motivations of any person is seldom a matter of science. In Mr. Kelly's case, the endeavor is even more complicated. An intensely driven man, he is someone who both cares deeply about his image and who generally reveals little about himself.
 The son of a milkman, Mr. Kelly rose to acclaim by long hours working, negotiating and networking his way through a succession of police and increasingly demanding government posts. Along the way, he earned a series of graduate degrees: two in law, from New York University and St. John's, and a master's in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
 Yet his demeanor at the peak can sometimes be both moody and imperious, and his get-out-of-my-way-if-you-want-me-to-save-New-York attitude has alienated some federal officials who are angry that the New York Police Department now often acts like its own nation-state.
 ''If the stereotype is the grit of the New York cop who has been around the world and now comes home, his professional personality is much more complicated than that,'' said Christopher Stone, a professor at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, who knows Mr. Kelly well.
 In an interview in his office, Mr. Kelly rejected the notion that his crime fighter's mien of pug nose and square jaw conceals a man of mysterious intentions. In short, he said, he has no interest in running for mayor. 
 After a tour as a Marine commander in Vietnam and a career in law enforcement, he said, he is unaccustomed to the sort of compromise that comes with elective office. ''Maybe I don't have enough flexibility in my DNA,'' he said.
 In fact, Mr. Kelly seemed puzzled why anyone would think he would want to leave.
 He is staying, he said, for a combination of reasons: a sense of duty, the thrill of a challenge, the idea that he is well suited to deal with whatever may befall the city, and the prospect of codifying changes to the department that aim to prevent or prepare for terrorist attacks.
 ''I have no desire to declare victory and move on to something else -- I think this is the greatest job in the world,'' he said. ''And I'm going to be where the action is.''

Following the News
 It's not clear that Mr. Kelly is quite as blithe about news, good or bad, as his comments might suggest. In fact, colleagues and friends say he is intensely sensitive to how he and the department are perceived.
 He closely follows news media reports and can be surprisingly thin-skinned. His battles with one often critical columnist, Leonard Levitt, who recently left Newsday and continues to write largely about internal Police Department intrigues, are legend among police reporters. At one point two years ago, Mr. Kelly, whose son is a television journalist, went so far as to drive out to Newsday's offices on Long Island to complain to the editors about Mr. Levitt.
 ''He's clearly hypersensitive to criticism, and that hypersensitivity has prevented him from dealing constructively with some of the significant civil rights violations that have happened under his command,'' said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union.
 The organization has been a regular critic of the commissioner and has sued the department over a number of policies, including mass arrests during the 2004 Republican National Convention and antiterror subway bag searches.
 Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said Mr. Kelly was neither thin-skinned nor imperious. ''I have been with him probably a hundred times or more when he's entered a room to the sound of 'Ten-hut,' and in each and every instance he's motioned to the troops to remain seated,'' Mr. Browne said. Mr. Kelly strictly observes the Marine Corps dictum that officers eat last, Mr. Browne said, and in Haiti years ago he passed on an offer to stay at a deposed strongman's mansion to quarter himself instead in a ''fleabag hotel that had seen better days, even by Haitian standards.''
 As his busy public schedule suggests, Mr. Kelly often enjoys the spotlight, even though his downturned mouth sometimes projects an image of dutiful routine. He attends high-profile events like the Alfred E. Smith political dinner last month and areception for the Canadian prime minister and he makes regular appearances at community and police functions and on TV news shows.
 He is seldom expansive on camera, hewing closely to the facts and always on message: New York has been the target of terrorists four times -- two of the attacks succeeded; federal counterterrorism money should be distributed according to need; New York is putting measures in place to respond to the latest threat; crime continues to decline.
 In most of these settings, he dresses immaculately in dark, hand-tailored, three-button suits, ties from the French shirt-maker Charvet, white pocket handkerchiefs and black shoes polished to a blinding sheen.
 ''Ray Kelly doesn't wrinkle,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a friend and a professor of urban policy at New York University.

Attention to Details
 Mr. Kelly is similarly fastidious, co-workers say, in the way he delegates responsibility, choosing to monitor seemingly insignificant details like minor staff changes. Allies contend that Mr. Kelly's approach eliminates cronyism and irks only those who seek unfair advantage. But few dispute that Mr. Kelly is an executive who distributes power sparingly and relies on a tight circle of loyal, largely civilian aides to make decisions.
 Critics describe Mr. Kelly's approach as micromanaging and complain that he creates a management bottleneck, an assertion that Mr. Kelly denies. He calls himself ''a situational manager'' and maintains that the Police Department, with its 51,000 officers and civilian employees, cannot be micromanaged.
 Not that micromanagement is a pejorative term, he said. ''I see it as paying attention to detail when it's needed most,'' he said.
 In private, Mr. Kelly sometimes takes vacations from his buttoned-down style. Jeremy Travis, a former aide who is the president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he recalled walking into Mr. Kelly's office in 1992 to find him cooking jambalaya with calypso music blaring. These days, Mr. Kelly said, he enjoys cooking squid ''in a very good red sauce,'' which he sometimes does in a small kitchen attached to his office. He also has fun playing the drums. He swung the sticks the other night at a Police Foundation cocktail party, switching off to play the bongos on other numbers. He wore a suit throughout.
 Mr. Kelly may need every ounce of his management skills in the coming years. Some experts believe that crime could be driven back up by an economic downturn, and that another terrorist strike on New York is inevitable. But to be fair, they said, an attack would no more indicate a flaw in Mr. Kelly's policies than the absence of one would prove they were faultless.
 Either way, Mr. Kelly is intent on institutionalizing his antiterrorism initiatives, such as stationing officers in foreign cities like Tel Aviv, so that they continue after he has gone. This may be difficult since so much of the program has been built by two aides with unique experience who are likely to leave with Mr. Kelly, if not before.
 Michael Sheehan, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism, is a retired Army Special Forces colonel who served on the National Security Council, at the State Department and at the United Nations. David Cohen, the deputy commissioner for intelligence, rose to the highest ranks in the Central Intelligence Agency after 35 years there.
 Under them, the department gets real-time intelligence from the C.I.A. and from National Security Agency communications intercepts, and police officers troll the Internet for potential threats. 
 When Mr. Kelly does leave, he will be walking away from a law enforcement career that began more than 40 years ago when, as a police cadet, he sat at an enormous wall-size switchboard in the old police headquarters on Centre Street, learning the structure of the department, phone number by phone number, as he connected calls to precincts around the city.
 Since then, he has run the department twice -- the first time in 1992 and 1993 under Mayor David N. Dinkins -- and worked in 25 commands. He has served in Washington, first overseeing the Treasury Department's law enforcement agencies and then running the Customs Service, where he worked with Congress and the executive branch, as well as doing a stint on the executive committee at Interpol.

A Depth of Influence
 Today, no Bloomberg aide can match his power or influence. Unlike most other commissioners, he reports directly to the mayor, rather than through a senior mayoral aide. In the spring, two commissioners, Nicholas Scoppetta of the Fire Department and Joseph F. Bruno of the Office of Emergency Management, saw the depth of Mr. Kelly's influence when the mayor completely adopted his view in a dispute over who should control the scene at terrorist attacks and other emergencies.
 Supporters of Mr. Kelly's say they believe that most New Yorkers are happy that he has the self-confidence to use power as a tool.
 ''There are others who feel they're being displaced by that, by his claim of responsibility, but I think most New Yorkers are delighted that they have a police commissioner who takes this seriously and is willing to go to bat for us,'' said Mr. Travis, the John Jay College president.
 In Washington, Mr. Kelly's personality, achievements and federal experience also serve to give him special standing in comparison with other municipal police officials. In some ways, his stature and innovations have altered the very way city and federal law enforcement officials interact. Consider, for example, how times have changed since the days when police officials complained that the F.B.I. did not share its intelligence. This year, a senior F.B.I. official complained in a report that it was the Police Department that was not sharing the intelligence it generates.
 Mr. Kelly says that collecting such intelligence is essential to thwarting a foe like Al Qaeda and like-minded terrorist groups, which he says often take the long view in their plotting and think of tactics in terms of decades. Long enough, it would appear, to wait out Ray Kelly.
 But he's not ready to go just yet, Mr. Kelly says, committing to stick around for all of the next four years. 
 What will he do after the next mayor is inaugurated? Mr. Kelly sidestepped the question. ''I don't like to think that far ahead,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On the 'Frontier,' a New Approach to Public Health

BYLINE: By BEN DAITZ

DATELINE: LORDSBURG, N.M. 

 BODY:
Southwestern New Mexico's boot heel scuffs a low desert landscape at the end of the Rocky Mountain chain. Here, the Butterfield Stagecoach line once ran passengers and mail through starkly beautiful stands of ocotillo and cholla cactus to California, followed soon by the Southern Pacific Railroad and, ultimately, Interstate 10. 
 Lordsburg, with a population of 3,300, is a railroad town, the largest town in Hidalgo County, classified by federal health standards as a ''frontier county'' because of the paucity of population and health services. 
For years, the nearest doctors and dentists were in Tucson, 152 miles west, Las Cruces, 60 miles east, or Silver City, 45 miles north. Then Charlie Alfero came to town.
 A 52-year-old mandolin-picker with a laid-back style, Mr. Alfero had directed the state's Community Health Services Division and the University of New Mexico School of Medicine's rural outreach program, where he helped communities resurrect failing hospitals and develop clinics.
 Mr. Alfero spent four years in the late 1990's commuting 600 miles round trip from Albuquerque to Lordsburg, often weekly, helping a local volunteer board develop what has become Hidalgo Medical Services, a community partnership that has helped revitalize the health care and economic well-being of Hidalgo and southwestern New Mexico.
 The model for Mr. Alfero's vision is the health commons, a new take on a definition rooted in an age-old sharing of resources. For Mr. Alfero, that meant one-stop shopping for medical, dental and mental health care, family support and economic development. It also meant that the community voiced what it wanted to see in a health care system. 
 ''Samuel Clemens said the only real change happens locally, and that's been my motto forever,'' Mr. Alfero said, addressing more than 100 employees, patients and dignitaries here to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Hidalgo Medical Services. 
 The crowd gathered in the lobby of the new, 22,000-square-foot full-service center, which has exam rooms, social service offices and a dental clinic with a computer screen at each chair. 
 The crowd, like the community at large, was a mix of Hispanics and Anglos. They ate tamales, tacos, rice and beans, aware that just down the hall was the office of La Vida, the clinic's diabetes outreach program. 
 ''We're just taking a little break from our diets to celebrate,'' a patient said. ''This diabetes program and the promatoras turned my life around.''
 Promatoras de salud are community health workers, local residents trained in chronic disease management who serve patients in the rural areas and isolated ranches. Promatoras are the backbone of Hidalgo's health care delivery system, serving as liaisons and translators and as a much needed social support network.
 Elva Quimby, a 50-year-old former cosmetologist, said: ''I think I've always been a promatora. I just thrive on helping people.''
 Ms. Quimby paid a home visit to Frank Ogas, 44, a construction worker who fell off a roof last year. While recuperating, he had a major heart attack, which was further complicated by newly diagnosed diabetes. 
 ''The doctors say I'm a ticking time bomb,'' Mr. Ogas told Ms. Quimby. ''I'm under a lot of stress because I've got no income now, and I can't pay my bills.''
 ''Frank, I pull tricks out of my sleeve,'' Ms. Quimby said.
 ''This is the best job of my life,'' Ms. Quimby said. ''I've done everything from translating for a 14-year-old girl who was delivering a baby -- poor thing -- to combing the hair of a client who had died.''
 Hidalgo Medical Services now has seven state, federal and locally supported community health centers in two adjoining counties, and patient visits have increased to a projected 48,000 this year from 8,000 three years ago. Visits for family support services have jumped to more than 30,000 from 2,000 in the same time.
 The health initiatives have also resulted in substantial investments in housing and small businesses, state parks and international trade.
 ''We know that each doctor who comes to a rural town hires 18 folks directly and indirectly,'' said Dr. Arthur Kaufman, chairman of the department of family and community medicine at the University of New Mexico. ''That's big business in a small community, but Charlie's taken it one step further, using health as a catalyst for social and economic development in the region. 
 ''Now other communities in the state are wanting to replicate the model.'' 
 Mr. Alfero said the communities the health centers serve ''have come together with a common vision grounded in a commitment to systems of mutual support. That's a rare thing in a self-focused society.''

HEADLINE: Louisiana's Marshes Fight for Their Lives

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Shea Penland nosed his truck along a mud-covered street, past uprooted trees, cars leaning crazily on fences, torn-off roofs, and piles of ruined furniture, wallboard and shingles -- the waterlogged evidence that Hurricane Katrina had been through the New Orleans suburb of Chalmette.
 Twice, he turned to avoid streets blocked by brick houses apparently torn from their slab foundations and dumped blocks away. Finally, he spotted what he was seeking. ''Look at that,'' he said, pointing to what looked like misshaped bowling balls tufted with long strands of yellow grass, seemingly thrown onto the porch and through the gaping doorway of a wrecked brick ranch house. ''Marshballs.''
 For Dr. Penland, director of the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of New Orleans, these clumps of black mud knitted with roots and fronds are an alarming sight. The marshballs, some as large as a sofa, others as small as a shoebox, had floated from wetlands to the east. Dr. Penland says they are more evidence that after decades of human interference, the marshes of Louisiana are in deep, deep trouble. 
 ''A healthy marsh is pretty resilient,'' he said. ''A stressed marsh -- storms will physically break the marsh down.'' 
 Now, as Louisiana struggles to recover from the storm, scientists like Dr. Penland are studying this marsh wreckage and the marshes themselves for clues to what ails them and how they might recover. 
 The questions are complicated, and the answers turn on a number of factors, including the region's geology, the ways people have engineered the flow of the Mississippi River, and the marsh-killing activities of the oil and gas industry. These issues inevitably lead to a far more difficult question: whether some marshlands, even inhabited marshlands, must be given up to the encroaching Gulf of Mexico.
 Louisiana marshes are a nursery for many fish caught in the gulf, and they support the state's rich Cajun culture. Much of the nation's oil and gas passes through them. And though hurricane damage to New Orleans and other towns drew more attention, the storms ''have caused a significant loss of wetlands and marshes and massive coastal erosion throughout the entire region,'' S. Jeffress Williams, a coastal scientist with the United States Geological Survey, told a Congressional hearing last month.
 He said some marshy areas east of the Mississippi River lost 25 percent of their land areas in Hurricane Katrina, which came ashore more than 100 miles east of New Orleans. A strong hurricane that approached New Orleans from the south, along the path of the river, would do even more damage, he said. 
 Over the years, scores of scientists have struggled to determine the best way to approach Louisiana's vanishing wetlands. Last week, experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences reported their recommendations in an evaluation of the state's major marsh-restoration proposal.
 Though they praised most of the plan's major components as scientifically sound, they said that it would reduce annual wetland loss only about 20 percent and that it was time to consider what areas could be preserved and what areas could not.
 That attitude is anathema to much of the state's business and political establishment, according to Oliver Houck, a professor at the Tulane University School of Law who specializes in environmental issues.
 He said a large obstacle to confronting wetland loss was what he called the ''destroy and restore'' philosophy, the longstanding practice of interfering with the marsh -- for flood control, navigation, agriculture, oil or other gain -- in hopes that engineering could restore it. 
 That, more or less, has been the history of this coastal region since Europeans made their homes here more than 300 years ago.
 Coastal Louisiana is constructed of millenniums of mud, sediment carried by the Mississippi and deposited in its delta. The mud under the west side of New Orleans is about 200 feet thick; it compacts and sinks under its own weight. But when the river flowed naturally, regular floods carried silt from the heartland into the marshes, maintaining their elevation. 
 Levees and other flood-control and navigational efforts changed all that. Deprived of nourishing infusions of silt, the marshes began to sink, and this subsidence was accelerated when the petroleum industry began pumping out oil. According to the Geological Survey, since the 1930's Louisiana has lost more than 1,900 square miles of wetland, an area as large as Delaware. 
 Though the loss has slowed since the early 1980's, when a binge of canal-cutting and pipeline construction by the oil industry accelerated it to 40 square miles a year, it has not stopped. Dr. Penland, who has spent almost all of his career studying the coastal islands and marshes of Louisiana, estimates the annual loss at 12 square miles or so; others say 20 or more. The Geological Survey estimates that if things continue as they are, 700 square miles more will vanish by 2050. 
 ''The whole surface is sinking,'' said Abby Sallenger, another coastal scientist with the agency. ''It's almost changing before your eyes. It's grassland turning into open water, the ponds turn into lakes.'' 
 In theory, sea level rise from global climate change will only make things worse, although things in Louisiana are already so bad, Dr. Penland said, that ''for us that's insignificant.''
 Many hope controlled diversions of river water into the marshes, one remedy included in the state plan, will help restore the natural balance. Others are doubtful.
 Mr. Houck cited a project at Caernarvon, on a bend in the river south of Chalmette, where water is diverted into the marsh. After Hurricane Katrina, ''half of that marsh was destroyed outright and half of what remains is iffy,'' he said. ''A lot of it came off like hair ripped from someone's head'' and probably ended up in Chalmette, he continued. 
 Also, Dr. Penland said, diversion projects small enough to be feasible and locally acceptable are dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem. For example, when scientists at Louisiana State used computer models to study a diversion proposal for Maurepas Swamp, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, they said it would take 50 years to restore 5,000 to 10,000 acres to sustainability.
 Efforts like that, however valuable, will not be enough, Dr. Penland said. ''We have to not just mirror nature, we have to accelerate the way nature works. The solutions have to be proportional to the problem.''
 Much of the sediment that enters Mississippi River tributaries never makes it to Louisiana. By some estimates, 80 percent is trapped behind Missouri River dams. Plus, over the years the Louisiana economy has come to depend on the river's being constrained in its channel. Large infusions of fresh water would flood some homes and businesses and alter salt marsh habitats, with potentially harmful effects on commercially important species like oysters. 
 ''We want the dirt without the water,'' Dr. Penland said. The only way to get it, he said, is dredging and then transporting the dredged material to the marsh that needs it, possibly through the kind of slurry technology used to move coal. 
 This technology has been in use for decades, but it remains to be seen if these kinds of measures can or will be applied in time. ''There should be bolder, long-term projects for sediment delivery in areas in need than were put forth in the near-term plan,'' Robert G. Dean, a coastal engineer at the University of Florida who led the academy panel, said Wednesday at a news conference.
 The panel also discussed making major changes in the state's coastal geography by diverting enough water flow to cause the river's Birdfoot Delta area to disintegrate, a process that would end up redistributing its sediment along the coast to the west. Or engineers could construct a ''third delta'' (the second being the delta of the Atchafalaya River), by diverting it at Donaldsonville, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and sending it toward the gulf.
 Though large-scale projects like these offer potentially large benefits, the panel said, they also come with engineering challenges and likely opposition from property owners.
 As Dr. Dean said Wednesday, progress will require ''tiptoeing through the potential minefield of stakeholders.'' They should be involved in decisions as early as possible, scientists involved with the report said. 
 That will particularly be the case, they say, when it comes to deciding which settled areas can be preserved and which must be abandoned, an approach the academy implicitly endorsed even in the title of its report, ''Drawing Louisiana's New Map.'' 
 Mr. Houck said it might be possible to ''take major towns and ring them -- Houma, Morgan City, Thibodaux, places like that.'' But, he went on, ''if we aren't going to draw a line and try to protect every little town, we would have to do some serious people relocation, and that would humanely require compensation.''
 The alternative, he said, ''is to build the largest levee system in the world'' around the entire southern part of the state. ''We'd cut right through the marsh, a Maginot Line -- and about as effective, too,'' he said, referring to a French line of defense that infamously failed in World War II. 
 Where does this leave Louisiana? ''Doing the things we can do now,'' said Dr. Penland, once again behind the wheel of his truck, but this time en route to Port Fourchon, a major oil installation on the coast. ''What was proposed 20 years ago in the beginning of my career is coming around now.''
 He was heading south on Route 308, a two-lane strip that barely rises above the acres of salt-marsh grass and open water glimmering in the sun. Here and there, the leafless trunk of a dead oak tree rose from the grass. Dr. Penland said these gray skeletons signaled that this wetland was once a freshwater marsh dry enough for a tree to grow. 
 Every now and then, the truck would pass a house or trailer on stilts, marshballs lodged against its steps or under its porch. In places, piles of them had been pushed off the pavement onto the narrow shoulder. The beach at Port Fourchon, or what remains of it, is part of one of the major projects in the state plan. It lost what little remained of its sand in the hurricane, leaving a row of giant plasticized sandbags, perhaps 3 or 4 feet in diameter and 12 feet long, called ''boudin'' bags after the local sausage. Behind them, a sharp scarp marked the edge of a marsh, broken and buried under tons of grass and other plant debris.
 Dr. Penland got out of the truck and looked around. ''I have never seen such an extent of marsh wreckage,'' he said.
 The Port Fourchon effort, which Dr. Penland is leading, involves pumping replacement sand onto the beach and pumping in additional sediment to restore the marsh behind. Similar sediment-pumping efforts in 2004 restored 50 acres of nearby wetland at a cost of about $300,000, Dr. Penland said. ''That's cheap marsh.'' 
 But this kind of restoration works only when a marsh ''just needs to be enhanced a bit,'' he said, and results are temporary. ''There is no way you are going to fix any piece of coastal real estate forever,'' Dr. Penland said. ''That's the hard fact you just have to face.''

HEADLINE: From Diner to City Hall, and Always Ready to Help the Little Guy

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 11 

 BODY:
First, City Hall tried to raze her diner. Then the city put up a fence that cut off access to her parking lot and Dumpster. But last Tuesday, Maria Aposporos, a feisty woman with an accent as thick as the coffee of her native Greece, struck back, parlaying her celebrated battles with the city to a seat inside City Hall.
 Ms. Aposporos was elected to a four-year unsalaried term on the 40-member Stamford Board of Representatives after campaigning door-to-door and promising to look out for the little guy. On Friday, congratulations were still stacking up like hotcakes at her diner, Curley's, a fixture here since the 1940's. Here, the self-appointed doorman is homeless, the eggs are served any style, and the clientele -- a gumbo that includes lawyers, police officers and the unemployed -- was ebullient. 
''Only in America!'' proclaimed John Walker, a former police officer who is now a hospice counselor, after he hugged Ms. Aposporos. ''She's going to do great!''
 Yet despite her cap of platinum hair, ruby-stained lips and decollete leopard print blouse that fairly screamed, ''I'm ready for my close-up,'' Ms. Aposporos, 58, was not reveling. She was grousing. 
 ''Breakfast is O.K., but I lost lunch and dinner because I don't have no parking,'' she grumbled, as she sat in the first booth near the door, fielding compliments and keeping an eye on the cash register.
 The diner that she and her sister have owned since 1977, a boxy version of an AirStream trailer, may be a melting pot for the city's haves and have-nots, but it is also in the middle of an estimated $100 million redevelopment plan. 
 A few years ago, Ms. Aposporos and her sister, Eleni Anastos, turned down a $300,000 offer from the city for their property. The city then tried to seize it through its power of eminent domain, but the sisters defeated that effort in 2002 in Connecticut Supreme Court. Since then the city has razed the buildings around the diner, including one that shared a wall with the restaurant, forcing the sisters to replace the wall at a cost of $8,000.
 City workers erected the fence last year, the latest clash in her war with City Hall that extends to the 1980's. She has filed a lawsuit seeking a right of way to the property that the city had fenced in, which blocks access to her parking lot and Dumpster. 
 When local Republicans approached her this year about running for a seat on the Board of Representatives, she hesitated, worried that she was not fluent enough in English for the shoe-leather politicking of local elections. But after considering all she had been through, she agreed; never mind that she had been a registered Democrat for 35 years. 
 ''The Democrats abandoned me,'' she said, rubbing a shoulder still sore from carrying a bag laden with campaign fliers. ''When the city wanted to take this place, only three or four of them showed up.'' 
 As she recounted her battles, her daughter, Eleni LoDolce, bustled in, arms filled with candy for her children's school fund-raiser. A quick conversation in Greek followed. Ms. LoDolce's four children, including her 4-year-old twins, campaigned for their grandmother. So did the waitresses at Curley's, who called potential voters in Ms. Aposporos' district, known locally as the Cove.
 The target of much of Ms. Aposporos's rancor is Mayor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat who was elected to a fourth term last Tuesday. ''He only cares about corporations,'' she said.
 In an interview Friday, the mayor began by saying with a laugh, ''I guess she doesn't like me much.'' He conceded her election was ''democracy in action,'' but added, ''I always caution people who seek elective office: be careful what you wish for.''
 Ms. Aposporos was born in Sparta, and at 15 she married an engineer and emigrated to the United States. She was in her early 20's when her husband died. To provide for her children, she became a waitress and paid her mortgage by moving herself and two children, then 4 and 6, into the basement so she could rent out the rest of the house.
 Her childhood in a politically volatile Greece and her struggles as a single mother -- she said she has taken only two vacations in 43 years -- have forged a steely determination in Ms. Aposporos.
 ''I got phone calls,'' she recalled of the days she was battling to save her diner. She said the callers, who never identified themselves, ''told me they were going to cut off my head and throw it in the Mill River; but nothing scares me.'' 
 Intertwined with Ms. Aposporos's tenacity is a deep vein of generosity, according to customers and staff members, who say she is as willing to provide free soup as she is to lend $20,000 to a line cook.
 Patricia Kane, a Stamford lawyer, was Ms. Aposporos's campaign manager.
 ''She was here years ago, when the area had its prostitutes and drug addicts, the people no one wanted, and she took them in and fed them,'' Ms. Kane said. ''But she's also gotten to know doctors, lawyers and financial people -- everyone loves her.''
 So how does she plan to take her up-from-the-bootstraps but watch-out-for-the-little-guy brand of politics to City Hall?
 ''I don't know exactly what to do,'' she said, ''but I'm going to help people, look out for people. That's what you do in a democracy.''
 She added: ''I was robbed. I don't want anyone to rob the rest of the people.''

HEADLINE: What They Say Up There Is Who's Down Here

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER CAMPBELL stood on a Bronx sidewalk and said that all told, he owned about 18 pairs of sneakers. Then he looked up. ''Not counting the ones up there,'' he said. 
 Strung along a thick black wire across the street, a few dozen pairs of athletic shoes dangled by their laces about 25 feet above the ground for which they are manufactured. The utility line, near the intersection of Crotona Avenue and East 170th Street in the South Bronx, has acquired some 40 pairs of sneakers. They hang over the block like a rubber-soled welcome banner, Size 8 greetings from East 170th Street.
Six pairs belong to Christopher, one of a dozen teenagers in the neighborhood who have spent months -- years in some cases -- tossing their old, not-so-old and expensive footwear onto the wire. Some of them said they did it to claim the neighborhood as their own, to represent, one young man said, ''the ghetto where we come from.'' Christopher, 16, hopes that years from now, he will return to the block and see his shoes up there.
 ''We really don't care who likes it or not,'' he said. ''This is something for us.''
 Shoes-on-wires are a tradition as old as the notion of hanging utility lines on poles. No one knows who did it first or why. They decorate -- some say deface -- telephone, cable and power lines in neighborhoods from coast to coast. In the Bronx, the practice is particularly popular, one sign amid the borough's economic revitalization of its grittier past. 
 Theories about the meaning of shoe-tossing are countless. It has been rumored to be a marker of gang or drug territory, but Detective Walter Burnes, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, said he never heard of someone using sneakers to publicize a drug corner. ''I don't think it's the sort of thing that people advertise by leaving a sign,'' Detective Burnes said. (Another spokesman pointed out, though, that the practice itself could be considered criminal mischief.)
 People who live near shoe-lined wires speculate that it is a last-day-of-school tradition or a trophy collection of the shoes of mugging victims. Others said the ritual had no meaning beyond the fact that neighborhood youth were bored and not respectful. ''I think it's disgusting,'' said Elizabeth Dean, 52, who lives almost under the utility line crossing Crotona Avenue.
 Con Edison tries to keep its 36,000 miles of overhead electrical wires in New York City and Westchester County as shoe-free as possible, a spokesman said, and representatives for Verizon and Cablevision said the phenomenon was not a major problem for them. 
 Christopher and his friends noted that contrary to urban legend, the tradition on their block had nothing to do with criminal activity. They take pride in their project. 
 ''See how there's gaps?'' he said. ''We don't like that.'' 
 So the next afternoon, Christopher returned with a pair of black-and-white Charles Barkley edition Nikes. He tied the laces in a double knot. Then he flung them, and flung them again, until the long white laces caught the wire.

HEADLINE: Sept. 11 Report Card Assails U.S. Progress Against Terror

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The members of the Sept. 11 commission charged Monday that the Bush administration had made ''insufficient progress'' in trying to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons. They called on President Bush to make the issue ''his top national security priority and ride herd on the bureaucracy to maintain a sense of urgency.''
 In the latest of a series of privately financed ''report cards'' on government antiterrorism efforts, the five Democrats and five Republicans on the commission also warned that reports of the government's abusive treatment of terror suspects abroad were eliciting ''criticism from around the globe,'' and that the administration needed to adopt standards for treatment of detainees in line with international law. 
Though the report did not explicitly endorse legislation overwhelmingly adopted by the Senate and opposed by the White House that would bar abuse of any terror suspect in American custody, some commission members said widespread reports of abuse and even torture of Muslim suspects by American captors had served as a recruiting tool for Al Qaeda.
 ''The flames of extremism undoubtedly burn more brightly when we are the ones who deliver the gasoline,'' said Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor and a Democratic member of the Sept. 11 commission.
 The report, released by a private lobbying group created by the commissioners when their panel disbanded last year, focused on nuclear proliferation and foreign policy issues. It was the latest effort by the group to grade the government's response to the recommendations made in the commission's final, official report 16 months ago.
 While the report praised some of the government's efforts, finding that there had been ''good progress'' over the last year in cracking down on terrorist financing and in promoting economic policies to advance Arab and Muslim nations, it found ''minimal'' or ''insufficient progress'' in 7 of the 13 areas it surveyed.
 Asked about the report, Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman, said the Bush administration ''appreciated all the hard work of the commissioners, and our focus is on building upon the steps already taken.'' Ms. Perino said that by the White House count, President Bush had acted on 37 of the panel's 39 major recommendations.
 ''The administration holds prevention of a potential nuclear terrorism attack as an extremely high priority,'' she said, ''and we are implementing an aggressive and comprehensive strategy against such a possibility.'' She added that the administration had called for $316 million over the next year for a new Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.
 In its report last year, the commission warned that the Sept. 11 attacks would not be the last major terrorist strike on American soil, noting that Al Qaeda had tried for at least 10 years to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The panel said that control of worldwide nuclear stockpiles required a ''maximum effort'' by the government to prevent them from falling into terrorists' hands.
 In the report card on Monday, the commissioners said they were alarmed that so little had been done on the issue, even in light of what the Bush administration described as a landmark agreement this year with Russia to expand the number of nuclear sites there available for inspection and security improvements. 
 Proliferation specialists say that nuclear sites in Russia and other nations of the former Soviet Union are so poorly secured that weapons-grade material may be easily acquired by terrorists.
 ''The most striking thing to us is that the size of the problem still totally dwarfs the policy response,'' said Thomas H. Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and the chairman of the Sept. 11 commission. ''We have no greater fear than a terrorist who is inside the United States with a nuclear weapon. The consequences of such an attack would be catastrophic for our people, for our economy, for our liberties.'' 
 Mr. Kean said the agreement with Russia was among the ''good steps'' taken by the Bush administration to deal with nuclear threats, ''but they're not nearly enough.''
 The report said that accounts of abuse of terror suspects by American military and intelligence agencies had stirred controversy that ''only makes it harder to build the diplomatic, political and military alliances necessary to fight the war on terror effectively.''

HEADLINE: In Asia, Bush Hopes to Advance Trade, but Soft-Pedal Iraq and North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Tuesday, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The first time President Bush visited Asia as president, just two months after the Sept. 11 attacks, he had little time or patience for a summit meeting that traditionally focused on trade and globalization. He talked only about terrorism, and insisted that everyone else follow his lead.
 But when Mr. Bush arrives in this ancient Japanese capital tonight, his first stop on a four-nation tour, he will be embarking on a trip that sounds like those of his father's presidency and President Clinton's. 
 ''The president is traveling to Asia to advance the interests of American workers, businesses and entrepreneurs,'' his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, told reporters last week. Fighting terror and forcing North Korea to give up nuclear arms -- subjects that loomed over his three previous Asian trips -- will be raised, he said, but not stressed.
 Even inside the White House, some wonder whether the president, under renewed pressure to explain Iraq, will stay on message. As one of his aides noted recently, ''he doesn't even like to say the word 'globalization,' '' and rarely discusses its complex trade-offs.
 But after a protest-ridden tour of South America two weeks ago stalled his efforts to create a free-trade area of the Americas, and with his approval ratings at home at record lows, Mr. Bush may have little choice. 
 Among his Asian hosts, there is a growing sense that Mr. Bush's intense focus on Iraq and counterterrorism has left American policy toward the region adrift. While the White House disputes that characterization, there is no question that Mr. Bush's tone has changed.
 As Washington's dependence on trade with China has risen, Mr. Bush's criticism of its record on human rights and democratization has lost its edge. Similarly, his once-clear warnings that a nuclear-armed North Korea is ''intolerable'' or Vice President Cheney's observation, on a trip to China, that ''time is not on our side'' in negotiations have given way to a plea for patience. He and Mr. Hadley have deflected questions about the implications of the Central Intelligence Agency's estimate that over the past two years the North has produced enough nuclear fuel to make six weapons. 
 Mr. Bush's visit starts here among Japan's greatest cultural treasures, which the White House hopes will provide a quietly Zen antidote to the raucous reception he received in South America.
 But by the time he arrives Wednesday night in Pusan, South Korea, for the annual Asian economic summit meeting, protests are likely: anti-Americanism, particularly directed at Mr. Bush, is resurgent in South Korea. He then goes on to Beijing for a two-day visit, followed by a presidential first, a visit to Mongolia, which has contributed about 160 troops to Iraq. 
 Throughout, the trick for Mr. Bush is to counter his image in Asia as a man more consumed with Iraq and terror than such topics as assuring that China's rise does not threaten the region's security arrangements, and managing the renewal of bitterness between Japan and its onetime enemies in World War II, China and South Korea. 
 ''They are getting really tired of the one note that came out of the Bush administration for so many years, especially on counterterrorism'' said Edward Lincoln, a longtime Japan scholar. ''They think there is a lot more going on in the region than that.''
 Yet Mr. Bush finds himself in the same position his father did in a disastrous 1991 visit to Japan: while embracing open markets, he must make clear back home that he is not abandoning strategies to deal with the inexorable movement of manufacturing jobs to Asia. Fourteen years later, the deficits with China -- $146.3 billion through September -- are more than twice the level than with Japan. Yet, so far the administration has failed to convince the Chinese to let their undervalued currency float, a step that would likely make Chinese exports more expensive and thus less competitive. 
 Mr. Bush's biggest challenge may come in how he talks about China as a competitor -- for both economic and diplomatic influence, from Southeast Asia to the oil fields of the Middle East.
 So far, Mr. Bush has chosen to talk instead about memories from a simpler time: his visit to China exactly 30 years ago, as the ice was breaking with Beijing and his father was America's most senior representative in the country. 
 ''Everybody was on bicycles,'' he said last week in an interview on Phoenix Television, a Chinese broadcaster. ''I rode all over the place in Beijing, which was fascinating,'' he said, recalling ''how odd people thought I looked.''

HEADLINE: In Personal Move, Rice Pushes Mideast Talks Into a 2nd Day 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Greg Myre contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Tuesday, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice struggled into the early morning hours on Tuesday to conclude what the administration hoped would be a broad agreement between Israel and the Palestinians to move people and goods in and out of Gaza and to take other steps to enhance Gaza's economic viability. 
 Efforts to reach the agreement, which could serve as a breakthrough after more than two months of bitter impasse on technical issues related to access to Gaza, were aimed at opening several crossings from Gaza to Israel and Egypt, while giving Israel a role in checking trucks, buses and individuals to guard against terrorists. 
In an extraordinary personal effort in the Middle East that the Bush administration has not attempted in the last five years, Ms. Rice and her aides were closeted at 4 a.m. at her ninth-floor suite in the David Citadel Hotel here. 
 Her advisers shuttled back and forth to meet with top aides to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in one room and with assistants to Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, in another.
 Earlier Ms. Rice decided abruptly after a full day of talks to cancel her plans to travel to South Korea on Monday night, though she made a quick trip to Jordan to pay respects to those killed in hotel bombings in Amman last week. 
 Since President Bush took office, those advocating a more active role in the details of negotiating a Middle East peace agreement have been repeatedly rebuffed, in part because Mr. Bush and his aides had been disdainful of the highly visible but ultimately unsuccessful efforts by President Clinton in the last weeks of his administration.
 But now that Ms. Rice was thrust into the middle of negotiations herself, it appeared likely that she would stay in Jerusalem until there was at least a broad agreement, even if many details would have to be worked out later. She and her aides were understood to be working with all sides on a lengthy document to be released later Tuesday.
 Throughout most of the day and night, James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president and current Middle East envoy, had accompanied American officials in the negotiations. 
 He has been working on details related to the crossings since earlier in the year, when withdrawal from Gaza was announced by Mr. Sharon. The withdrawal was completed in late summer.
 But Mr. Wolfensohn more recently has been openly critical of the refusal of both sides to make concessions and to ensure Gaza's economic future by allowing it to export produce and other goods and send some of its people to jobs in Israel and the West Bank.
 On Monday Mr. Wolfensohn's frustrations burst forth in a talk at a conference in Jerusalem, when he said he would leave his post if the two sides ''want to blow each other up.''
 People close to the talks, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly, said Ms. Rice had in effect replaced Mr. Wolfensohn as the negotiator and had drafted her own compromise document.
 American, Israeli and Palestinian officials said the central issue that Ms. Rice hoped to resolve was who should monitor the passage of potential extremists in and out of Gaza.
 Earlier on Monday, Ms. Rice attended a memorial service for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was killed 10 years ago, and before that held a news conference in Ramallah, in the West Bank, with Mr. Abbas. There she said that ''with enough will and creativity,'' an agreement on the issue of immigration into Gaza through the Rafah border with Egypt was ''within sight.''
 The crossing dispute is a classic case in Middle East diplomacy of a small matter with large overtones. For Israel the concern is security and for Palestinians it is their control over Gaza, now that the pullout of Israeli forces and 9,000 settlers is complete.
 For Palestinians, gaining control of the one border crossing with Egypt, at Rafah, is perhaps the most important issue, because it would mean that Palestinians in Gaza could come and go from the territory without passing through Israeli security. 
 Negotiators are also seeking to reach a deal that would set the rules for other crossings. 
 The two sides have been discussing Karni, on the eastern side of Gaza, which is used to import and export goods. Palestinians complain that perishable agricultural products sometimes rot because of delays. 
 After the Israeli withdrawal, thousands of people flowed through Rafah, alarming Israeli security. Now Israel insists on retaining some control over the border by setting up cameras and computers to track travelers' identities, though Israeli security officials would not be present at the crossing.
 The Israelis fear that terrorists bearing arms or cash to be paid to suicide bombers could come into Gaza from Egypt and sneak into Israel. They are demanding the right to have cameras and computers at Rafah feeding information into Israeli information banks. 
 With some reluctance, Israel has also accepted the presence of monitors from the European Union to help staff the Rafah crossing, but the Israelis want more. ''We want to augment Palestinian weakness in a way that does not insult Palestinian independence,'' an Israeli official said. 
 Palestinians, on the other hand, say that such monitoring is offensive and unacceptable. 
 The compromise proposal being discussed by Ms. Rice would be to have the European Union retain effective control over the cameras so there would be no ''official'' Israeli presence. But there was no sign apparent that this proposal would win agreement on both sides.

HEADLINE: Director of Congressional Budget Office to Leave

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, a former White House economist who has often been a thorn in the side of the Bush administration since he became director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office nearly three years ago, announced on Monday that he planned to leave at the end of the year. 
 In a message to the budget office staff, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, 47, said he would join the staff of the Council on Foreign Relations here. He was a prominent academic economist at Columbia, Princeton and Syracuse Universities before he became chief economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers at the beginning of President Bush's first term.
 The Congressional Budget Office is a fiercely independent agency with a staff that prides itself in being iconoclastic. The director of the office is essentially the chief economist for Congress, and Mr. Holtz-Eakin is the most recent in a series to irritate Republican Congressional leaders by refusing to adopt a party line.
 Within weeks of his appointment by Republican leaders in early 2003, Mr. Holtz-Eakin declared, to their dismay, that Mr. Bush's tax and spending plans would do little or nothing to stimulate long-term economic growth.
 Subsequently, the budget office released a report that found that Mr. Bush's tax cuts were heavily skewed in favor of the wealthiest Americans. 
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin rejected Republican demands that budget forecasts take account of strengthened economic activity from tax cuts without analyzing the drag caused by increased spending.
 Under his direction, the budget office often took issue with the political goals of Republicans. It raised doubts about proposals to partly privatize the Social Security system, concluded that abolishing estate taxes would reduce charitable contributions and calculated that allowing same-sex marriages would slightly increase federal revenues.
 Donald B. Marron, the deputy director, will become the acting director of the budget office until Congressional leaders choose a replacement for Mr. Holtz-Eakin.

HEADLINE: For the Painted Soldiers of Gettysburg, the War Is Now Against Time

BYLINE: By LISANNE RENNER

DATELINE: GETTYSBURG, Pa. 

 BODY:
Just two decades removed from the horrors of the Civil War, throngs of sightseers stepped into the center of a gigantic painting-in-the-round to imagine what it might have felt like to be in the scrum of battle on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg. 
 The realism of this cyclorama, the story goes, brought some veterans to tears.
One part art and one part commercial venture when it opened in Boston in 1884, this colossal canvas, now in Gettysburg, has become as ragged as an old Army tent -- worn, torn, sagging and covered in grime. Art conservators here are embarking on a $9 million federally financed project to restore vigor to a painting that has lost its visceral power. On Sunday the cyclorama and the sound-and-light show that brings it to life will close to visitors at the Gettysburg National Military Park for two years of renewal. 
 This enormous undertaking -- the work is just under 365 feet in circumference and 27 feet tall -- is the largest conservation project for a single painting ever done in North America, according to the National Park Service and its private partner in the effort, the Gettysburg National Battlefield Museum Foundation. 
 The cyclorama is a major draw at the park, where it recreates Pickett's Charge, the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, which marked the beginning of the end for the Confederates. Conceived as a tourist attraction, the 360-degree vista was ''the Imax of its day,'' as Robert C. Wilburn, president of the Gettysburg National Battlefield Museum Foundation, likes to put it.
 Conservators face the challenge of preserving something that was never meant to last. Cycloramas depicting historical events had their heyday in the latter half of the 19th century, when entrepreneurs commissioned artists and installed their grand efforts temporarily in custom-designed buildings, sending them on tour much as a blockbuster art show today moves from museum to museum.
 ''These things were painted as economic ventures and then were discarded in a couple of years,'' said David L. Olin of Olin Conservation Inc., which is leading the project along with Perry Huston & Associates. Paul Philippoteaux, a French painter, and his team of 20 were hired to complete four nearly identical Gettysburg cycloramas; one has disappeared, one became tent material, one is in storage at Wake Forest University, and the other wound up at Gettysburg in 1913.
 It had a rough journey. In its early years, the cyclorama traveled from Boston to Philadelphia, then back to Boston, unrolled and then packed up again and again. It was stashed in a crate, stored in a parking lot, subjected to moisture and rot, and sliced into panels for display in a Newark department store, losing pieces along the way. Even when this bit of American heritage came under the park service's stewardship in the 1940's, the abuse continued: for decades it hung improperly in a museum with wildly fluctuating humidity, poor ventilation and a leaky roof. 
 All these indignities and more have sabotaged Philippoteaux's attempt to make his battle scene grippingly real. He wanted not so much to create fine art, but to spin the illusion, if just for an instant, that a viewer was in the midst of a historic moment. To do that, he surrounded viewers with a chaotic scene of thousands of soldiers charging with rifles and bayonets, ruin in their wake: splayed bodies, fallen horses, cannon-ravaged farmland and clouds of smoke and dust. More than 5,000 soldiers became casualties in one gruesome hour during Pickett's Charge.
 Long before movies and computer-generated special effects, Philippoteaux deployed optical tricks to create a stand-in for the real carnage of war. Now that the painting has been stripped of most of these devices, its potency has waned. The work feels almost quaint, wearing more the mantle of historical artifact than the veil of artifice.
 In its current condition, the painting ''really doesn't give the viewer any sort of feeling that they're out there'' on the battlefield, Mr. Olin said. ''Our intent is to bring back the artist's intent.''
 The conservators will try to evoke the you-are-there feeling. Mr. Wilburn of the foundation said: ''We're trying to get as close as we can to creating the illusion of being in the cyclorama in 1884. You'll get that total-immersion experience.''
 Preliminary work began two years ago on two of the cyclorama's 27 two-story-high panels, and has included consolidating flaking paint, removing overpaint, painstaking cleaning with cotton swabs and removing a wax-infused backing. But the project will go beyond traditional conservation, digging back into Philippoteaux's bag of tricks and venturing into a realm that is more the purview of scenery designers.
 ''We're going completely out of the bounds of conservation as we usually approach it,'' Mr. Olin said. 
 The team will recreate a foreground with props that once added depth and perspective by visually blending into the painting. The original three-dimensional elements -- wagon wheels, canvas stretchers, fence rails, guns, canteens, grass, rocks, dirt and the like -- have been missing for more than 40 years, but 19th-century photographs provide a model for conservationists.
 These props will disguise where painting and floor meet; similarly, a canopy will be added to blur the intersection of reality and make-believe where the sky in the painting meets the ceiling of the building. In addition, about 15 feet of sky, also missing for decades, will be replicated by muralists, and an elevated viewing area will shift the vantage point from the ground, where it is now, to the horizon, the artist's intended perspective.
 More subtle but especially important, Mr. Olin said, is restoring the canvas's hyperbolic shape. In its present setting, the heavy painting hangs straight down, losing the original convex curvature that influenced the viewer's perspective. 
 The cyclorama's makeover is part of a broader $95 million effort at the park -- which had 1.8 million visitors last year -- to build a new museum and visitors' center, rehabilitate parts of the battlefield and preserve archives and artifacts. The painting will reopen in the new visitors' center, less than a mile away. Its present home, atop Union battle lines, is slated for demolition. It opened in 1962, and because it was designed by the distinguished modernist Richard Neutra, architectural preservationists have challenged the demolition. 
 Regardless of the outcome of that dispute, the cyclorama will move, said Brion FitzGerald, chief ranger of the park. ''This building was not designed to provide the level of presentation and care the painting needs.'' 
 As scaffolding rises beside the painting, and a small army of conservators prepares to move in, one Union officer calmly leans against a tree, resting his sword on one knee while surveying the action on the canvas. He is a self-portrait of Philippoteaux, the artist, and now, in addition to watching the monumental clash, he is also seeing the cyclorama begin to come full circle.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Approves Special Tax On Oil Profits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
In a telling sign of the political impact of soaring energy prices, the Republican-controlled Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to impose a $5 billion tax next year on the nation's biggest oil companies.
 The measure amounts to a one-year windfall profits tax, a concept that most Republicans had until recently denounced as a discredited idea from the 1970's. It was added to a larger bill that would cut taxes by about $61 billion over the next five years.
 Conservative Senate Republicans who support the oil industry bitterly protested the measure, noting that Congress had just approved billions in new tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration. But every Republican voted for the overall package, which passed the committee 14 to 8 and which the full Senate is expected to take up on Wednesday. 
 Five of the largest oil companies recently reported that their combined profits for the third quarter surged to $33 billion as a result of skyrocketing oil prices. Last week, top oil executives testified at a Congressional hearing, defending their record results in the face of mounting criticism.
 Lawmakers have been prodding the oil companies to give up some of their profits and have floated the idea of a windfall profit tax. But party leaders and the White House have firmly opposed such a move. Many Senate Republicans are counting on their counterparts in the House to reverse the tax on oil companies and add back an extension of tax cuts. 
 The Senate bill was a setback for President Bush because it omits one of his most cherished tax priorities: an extension of his 2001 tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains.
 Those tax cuts expire at the end of 2008, and Republican leaders badly wanted to pass at least a one-year extension this year at a cost of about $11 billion. But Republican moderates rebelled at the idea of cutting taxes for investors at the same time they were voting on spending cuts for food stamps, Medicaid and programs to enforce payment of child support. 
 The Senate bill greatly aggravates the disarray among Republicans over both tax cuts and spending cuts. House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee began marking up their own $70 billion package of tax cuts on Tuesday, but House leaders adamantly opposed a long list of provisions in the Senate bill even before the oil tax surfaced.
 Senate Republicans refused to call their provision a ''windfall profits tax,'' a tax that was imposed after oil companies enjoyed a similar spike in profits in the early 1970's. Critics of the windfall profits tax contended that it merely discouraged production and contributed to severe gasoline shortages and long waiting lines.
 But in practice, the provision, drafted by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, would have much the same effect as the old tax.
 Technically, the provision would require major ''integrated'' oil companies -- those that do everything from drilling to running gasoline stations -- to revise the way they account for oil inventories next year.
 Under current law, if an oil company increases its inventories, it can book that increase as a cost against profits and value the new oil at current market prices. If oil prices shoot up, as they did this year, this approach allows big oil companies to increase their costs and reduce their taxable income by hundreds of millions of dollars each.
 Conservative Republicans on the Senate tax-writing committee complained bitterly about the measure.
 ''We can't just penalize these companies with an accounting gimmick, right at the same time that we're trying to give them incentives for investing in new facilities,'' said Senator James Bunning, Republican of Kentucky.
 Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, charged that his Republican colleagues were ''undermining the energy policy that we have been working on for years'' and would discourage exploration and production. ''I suppose,'' he said, ''it's because you found out that energy companies are making some money.''
 Mr. Grassley, who drafted the provision, said little about the issue himself -- a recognition of its unpopularity in many quarters of his own party. He also agreed to consider refinements to the bill before the full Senate took it up on Wednesday.
 Democratic lawmakers were elated, though most Democrats on the committee still voted against the overall package on the ground that it would increase the budget deficit. Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Charles E. Schumer of New York had proposed an amendment that would eliminate billions of dollars in tax breaks for energy companies that Congress passed recently. But they withdrew their amendment after receiving assurances from Mr. Grassley that he would look at striking $1 billion worth of tax breaks aimed at oil exploration.
 The overall Senate package would provide $7.6 billion in tax breaks for Gulf Coast areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. It would also allocate $28 billion to restrain the alternative minimum tax, which is not indexed for inflation and is poised to affect millions of additional families each year if left unchanged.
 But House leaders are working on a very different measure. That bill would include a two-year extension of Mr. Bush's tax cut on stock dividends but would not include any tax breaks for hurricane reconstruction or any reduction of the alternative minimum tax. House Republicans are betting that they can pass those provisions separately from the main package because those tax cuts are urgently sought by lawmakers in both parties.

HEADLINE: BMW North America Signs With GSD&M 

BYLINE: By Matt Richtel

 BODY:
BMW North America in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., part of BMW, has named GSD&M in Austin, Tex., as its national creative agency, replacing Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe. After a decade, Fallon parted ways with BMW in June, when the account was placed in review. BMW North America plans to spend $70 million to $80 million next year on advertising.
 The review had been narrowed to GSD&M, part of the Omnicom Group, and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, a unit of MDC Partners.

HEADLINE: Inflation Eased in October; Car and Energy Sales Drop

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Inflation at the wholesale level tapered off in October after surging in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes, the government reported yesterday, as energy and auto prices fell.
 Another report showed that weak auto sales and reduced gasoline prices drove down overall retail sales last month, which otherwise rose on the strength of building materials, clothing and general merchandise.
The reports signaled that the economy grew at a brisk pace in October and that inflation, while reduced, remains a concern particularly as colder weather sets in and leads to greater use of heating oil and natural gas. 
 Several economists said the Federal Reserve, which has raised short-term interest rates at 12 meetings in a row to head off inflation, might see the need to raise its benchmark rate, currently at 4 percent, when it meets again on Dec. 13.
 The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index climbed 0.7 percent in October after surging 1.9 percent the month before. The increase was driven mainly by rising natural gas, heating oil, diesel fuel and electricity prices even as gasoline prices fell by 3.3 percent.
 Excluding energy and food, the core index fell by 0.3 percent after a 0.3 percent increase the month before. It was the core index's biggest decline in more than two years and the third time it had fallen this year. 
 Economists attributed the drop to a 3 percent decline in the price of cars in October and said it would prove temporary. Detroit automakers have lowered the prices of new vehicles to try to increase sales.
 Elsewhere, however, price pressures appear to be building. The price of goods in the intermediate stage of production rose 3 percent in the month and the price of raw materials rose 6.7 percent. Many of these increases are energy-related and are building on steep jumps from earlier in the year. 
 ''The question is, how much of this feeds through all the way down the production process?'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. ''Do companies end up having to swallow the cost increases or can they pass it through?''
 A survey of manufacturers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that more producers were paying and passing on higher costs. The survey, released yesterday, also showed greater confidence about future business prospects.
 Compared with a year ago, the Producer Price Index was up 5.9 percent in October; excluding food and energy it was up 1.9 percent.
 Over all, retail sales fell 0.1 percent in October but excluding autos, sales rose 0.9 percent, the Commerce Department reported. Car and truck sales have fallen for the last three months because automakers have struggled to sell vehicles after a summer of heavy discounting.
 Retail sales rose 1.1 percent when purchases at gasoline stations were excluded; those sales were inflated in September by the surge in fuel prices after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted supplies.
 ''The resilience of the consumer really shines through in this data,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
 October's retail sales figures coupled with a positive outlook on Monday from Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, also indicate the holiday season will be far better for retailers than many analysts and companies feared when energy prices were soaring and the destruction of Hurricane Katrina was still fresh in people's minds.
 A major factor in consumer spending will be heating costs, which are expected to rise 30 percent to 60 percent this winter. A mild autumn has so far kept prices in check, said Brian Youngberg, a utilities analyst at Edward Jones. ''Heating costs will go up; how much will depend on how cold it is and who their utility is.''

HEADLINE: Adding Commercial Pizazz to a Chicago Suburb

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill. 

 BODY:
A new mixed-use development rising in the heart of the downtown here -- a close-in suburb of Chicago that is also home to Northwestern University -- is the latest step in this city's decade-long transformation from sleepy college town to major commercial center. 
 The project, called Sherman Plaza, is, at $190 million, the most expensive downtown development project in the city's history.
The developers are James Klutznick of the Klutznick-Fisher Development Company, based in Chicago, and Tim Anderson of Focus Development, based in suburban Northfield. 
 ''Evanston has the most densely populated urban core in the Chicago suburbs and has become a very hot market,'' Mr. Klutznick said.
 Sherman Plaza consists of an L-shaped 25-story condominium tower with a two-story base containing 153,000 square feet of retail space. The development also includes a 12-story, 1,585-space public parking garage. The design architect is Daniel P. Coffey & Associates in Chicago.
 Although the first tenants will not move in until next May, the developers say all but a handful of the 253 condominium units have been sold. Prices for the condos range from $224,000 for a 770-square-foot loft to $1.8 million for a 4,000-square-foot penthouse with three terraces. 
 ''This is the top of the market in Evanston,'' Mr. Anderson said. The buyers, he added, are a mix of older suburbanites and young professionals fleeing the high prices of comparable condominiums in downtown Chicago. 
 In both cases, he adds, Evanston's status as a halfway point between the density of the city and the sprawl of the suburbs is a critical selling point. ''It's a more urban experience here,'' he said. ''But at the same time you have high-quality schools and a great beach and park system.''
 The commercial space has also done well. ''We're 80 percent leased,'' Mr. Klutznick said. The project will be anchored by Barnes & Noble, which is relocating from its current 23,000-square-foot location cater-corner from the new project to a two-level 30,000-square-foot space. Other tenants include Pier 1, Ann Taylor Loft and Elizabeth Arden, all of them new to downtown Evanston.
 ''We're getting a little bigger in size,'' said Mitchell Klipper, chief operating officer of Barnes & Noble. ''We move 10 to 15 stores a year into better locations, and this just happens to be one of them.''
 Mr. Klipper noted that one peculiarity of doing business in college towns like Evanston is that the stores are designed to accommodate large numbers of students who use the store almost as a library but that the students themselves are not the target customers. ''Students generally don't have the money to buy trade books,'' he said. ''But around universities there's always a huge support staff of professors and administrators, and they're big readers.'' 
 All of this is welcome news to a downtown that a decade ago seemed on the verge of obsolescence. 
 Evanston, a city of about 75,000 residents on the shores of Lake Michigan, was founded in 1857, shortly after the creation of Northwestern University.
 During the first half of the 20th century, the downtown built up a solid commercial base, including one of the first Marshall Field's branch stores. That all changed, however, in the 1950's and 60's with the development of Old Orchard, a regional mall in neighboring Skokie that many say drained the life out of Evanston's central business district. 
 Old Orchard was developed by Phil Klutznick, a Chicago developer and the father of James Klutznick.
 By the late 70's and early 80's, Marshall Field's and the other major retailers had departed and downtown Evanston -- while not a ghost town -- had the familiar sleepy aura of many college towns. 
 ''There were a lot of vacancies at that point,'' said Dennis Marino, the city's planning director.
 This led to a major initiative in the 1990's to beef up the district through residential development and by focusing on entertainment and restaurants as opposed to general merchandise retailing. Since then, half a dozen major mixed-use projects containing more than 1,000 units of housing have either been completed or are under construction. 
 The turning point, many people say, was Church Street Plaza, a $120 million mixed-use project completed in May 2003 that includes 205 residential condominiums, a Hilton Garden Hotel and about 200,000 square feet of retail space anchored by an 18-screen multiplex cinema. The project also includes major national retailers like Borders, Urban Outfitters and Wolfgang Puck. 
 ''We were able to persuade not just the city but about $100 million in private capital that if a major destination was created in Evanston that people would come,'' said Arthur Hill, the Evanston-based developer of the project. ''It was a controversial idea at the time but it has come true.''
 The city has encouraged development in several ways, ranging from tax increment financing loans to financing parking and other improvements. In the case of Sherman Plaza, the city awarded the project $3.5 million in tax increment financing and contributed about $40 million to the $48 million total cost of the parking deck. 
 Evanston has benefited from several major social and demographic changes in recent years. 
 ''There's been a huge movement toward central business districts as opposed to malls in retailing,'' said Bruce Kaplan, president of the Northern Realty Group, a retail leasing firm in Chicago. ''Malls had a good 40-year run, and they're not going to disappear. But now downtowns across the country are bouncing back.''
 Mr. Kaplan added, ''Shoppers like downtowns because they tend to have more character than malls, and retailers like them because there are financial efficiencies in not having to pay mall management fees.''
 Downtown Evanston -- roughly a 20-square-block area -- has about 1.3 million square feet of retail space, which translates to about 300 individual businesses. According to Diane Williams, executive director of Evmark, a downtown property owners group, the current vacancy rate is 7 percent. 
 ''You can't walk a block in downtown Evanston without hitting at least two coffeehouses,'' said Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations at Northwestern University, which occupies 240 acres of prime lakefront northeast of downtown. 
 Mr. Cubbage noted that Northwestern at one time owned significant amounts of land downtown but had sold most of it over the last three decades. 
 Still, the university watches new development closely. ''A vibrant downtown is certainly a plus in terms of attracting students and faculty,'' he said. 
 The city is also a hotbed of New Urbanist planning ideas, most notably transit-oriented developments, or T.O.D.'s, which are mixed-use developments within easy walking or commuting distance of mass transit lines. 
 Most of the new development -- including Sherman Plaza -- is clustered around the Davis Street train station, which serves as a junction point for two commuter rail lines.
 ''This is the strongest transportation hub outside of downtown Chicago in the metro area,'' Mr. Klutznick said.

HEADLINE: America's Future Is Stuck Overseas

BYLINE: By Stuart Anderson. 
Stuart Anderson, the executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, was the executive associate commissioner for policy and planning at the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 2001 to 2003.

DATELINE: Arlington, Va. 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to a recent survey, more foreign graduate students enrolled in American universities this year than last, but their numbers remain far lower than they were in 2002. That international graduate student enrollment is no longer declining is welcome news. But it should not distract us from the obstacles the United States still faces in attracting top talent to its shores.
 Foreign graduate students, particularly those who study science or engineering, are a boon to the American economy and education system. They are critical to the United States' technological leadership in the world economy: according to a study by Keith Maskus, an economist at the University of Colorado, for every 100 international students who receive science or engineering Ph.D.'s from American universities, the nation gains 62 future patent applications. International students have founded many of America's most innovative companies, including Sun Microsystems and Intel. 
Moreover, without international students, certain science and engineering programs could not be offered at many American universities, because the foreign students populate classes and serve as teaching assistants. They also go on to supply faculty for those programs. About one-third of America's engineering professors are foreign-born. 
 Although it's easy to blame tightened post-9/11 visa policies for stagnating or declining international student enrollment figures, other factors have contributed to this unfortunate trend. Among them are fierce competition for students with Britain, Japan and other countries; improvements in the economies and universities of China and India, the countries that send the largest number of students here; the cost of an American education; and a perception that the United States is not interested in attracting international students. 
 Finally, and perhaps most avoidably, the United States makes it exceedingly difficult for our foreign-born science and engineering doctorates to stay in the country, where they might work in our private sector, conduct research in our labs or teach at our universities. It can take two years or more to gain permanent residency, and there are significant backlogs in applications for employment-based green cards.
 The good news is that relatively small changes in current policies can redress these problems. The recent Senate-passed budget bill is a step in the right direction: it expands the number of employment-based green cards and temporary visas available to highly skilled foreigners. But the Bush administration should build on that by offering employers the option of paying a fee to expedite the processing of their employees' applications, bringing processing time down to 30 to 60 days rather than the current two to four years. 
 Furthermore, Congress should eliminate the requirement that visa-seekers pursuing advanced degrees in the United States demonstrate that they will return to their home country. And a single, accountable administration official should coordinate policy and act as an ombudsman on international student issues, balancing admissions and security needs. 
 American universities, meanwhile, need to step up marketing efforts abroad if they wish to lure more students to their programs. Working with industry and government, universities should develop a marketing strategy that conveys the message that America is the world's best place to study. The United States can even provide some of its assistance to developing countries in the form of need-based vouchers to qualified international students who wish to study at American universities. 
 We still have a chance to improve our policies and enhance our standing with prospective graduate students abroad. If we don't seize it, America may lose its place as the global leader in science and technology.

HEADLINE: Low Inflation and Rising Wages Can Coexist, Fed Nominee Says

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jennifer Bayot contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the nominee to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers on Tuesday that it was a ''false dichotomy'' to assume that low inflation was at odds with rising wages and greater income equality.
 ''Middle-income living standards, and poverty for that matter, are best addressed through employment growth,'' Mr. Bernanke said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. ''By maintaining low inflation and low expectations of inflation, you can create new employment.'' 
In his first extended public appearance since President Bush nominated him to lead the Fed, Mr. Bernanke stoutly defended his proposal to base monetary policy on an explicit target for inflation and asserted that he would not weaken the central bank's ''dual mandate'' of promoting full employment as well as stable prices.
 But he said he would proceed cautiously and seek consensus within the Fed before moving toward setting an inflation target, one of the few areas of policy where Mr. Bernanke differs from Mr. Greenspan.
 And in describing his approach, he sharply distanced it from those of some central banks that focus almost exclusively on an inflation target and not at all on promoting growth. ''I don't agree with that,'' Mr. Bernanke declared flatly.
 Members of the committee made it clear that Mr. Bernanke enjoys overwhelming support in the Senate and is all but certain to be confirmed soon. But they also warned him to maintain independence from the White House, where he was President Bush's chief economic adviser.
 ''I assure this committee that, if I am confirmed, I will be strictly independent of all political influences,'' Mr. Bernanke said in his opening statement.
 Mr. Bernanke also strongly implied that the Federal Reserve did not necessarily need to raise interest rates in response to soaring energy prices, noting that long-term inflation expectations remain ''well anchored.''
 In so doing, he sought to smooth over the one topic that has made his nomination even slightly controversial: a concern among lawmakers, particularly Democrats, that he would be so fixated on preventing inflation and so wedded to mechanistic formulas that the Fed might arbitrarily choke off job creation. 
 ''I am not proposing any major change in policy or in the way policy is conducted,'' he declared. He repeatedly asserted a need to preserve the flexibility that became the hallmark of Mr. Greenspan's 18-year tenure. ''I do not subscribe to rigid or mechanistic rules in policy making,'' he said.
 Lawmakers appeared reassured. Senator Richard C. Shelby, a Republican from Alabama and the chairman of the committee, said Mr. Bernanke ''may well be the finest monetary economist of his generation.''
 Democrats praised his academic credentials and spent most of their time coaxing assurances from Mr. Bernanke about his support for employment and about his political independence.
 But in asserting his flexibility, Mr. Bernanke raised almost as many questions as he answered on how his proposal for a clear inflation objective would increase the Fed's credibility in financial markets.
 He said that there would be times when inflation climbed faster than the Fed's long-term goal and yet did not constitute a long-term threat, largely because investors and consumers today expect inflation to remain low in the long run. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, asked Mr. Bernanke how he would react if natural gas prices rose sharply this winter.
 ''The contrast between the 1970's and today is very marked,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Back then, we had high inflation expectations.'' He added that the Fed might have waited too long and then overreacted to higher oil prices, helping push the economy into recession.
 Today, by contrast, ''inflationary expectations remain well anchored'' and the Fed could respond gently as long as those expectations remained low, he said. 
 Mr. Bernanke did not imply that he would stop the Fed's policy of gradually raising short-term interest rates from their low point last year. The Fed has raised overnight rates on loans between banks 12 times since June 2004, to 4 percent from 1 percent, and Mr. Bernanke said nothing to dissuade investors from their view that he would probably nudge rates slightly higher at least once or twice in his first few months in office.
 In sharp contrast to Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke immediately made it clear that he did not want to comment on fiscal policy. Where Mr. Greenspan supported President Bush's tax cuts in 2001, a move that many lawmakers say set the stage for the huge deficits that followed, Mr. Bernanke said he would not comment on any tax or budget proposals.
 ''I'm going to begin now to avoid making specific recommendations,'' he said in response to questioning from Senator Dodd.
 When confronted with passages from a textbook he had written, in which he asserted that budget deficits tend to push up interest rates and ''crowd out'' private investments, he conceded that ''it's possible'' that tax cuts could cause more problems than they solve.
 But even as he sought to put some distance between himself and Mr. Greenspan on that issue, he repeatedly stated his respect for Mr. Greenspan and his determination to build on the monetary policies in place.
 ''One may aspire to succeed Chairman Greenspan,'' he said, ''but it will not be possible to replace him.''

HEADLINE: He Figured That Business Is So Good, Who Needs a Store?

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: RANDOLPH, Vt. 

 BODY:
AFTER three years of riding the Internet to steadily climbing sales, Eric Truran decided to use the Web to move his small manufacturing business, CourierWare, in another direction. He wanted it to shrink. 
 Like most small-business owners, Mr. Truran first viewed the World Wide Web as an opportunity to grow. But as time went by, he came to see it as the opposite -- a way to close up his Cambridge, Mass., retail store, move the business to his home in this Vermont village and accomplish his real goal: spending time on the things he wanted to do rather than running CourierWare.
''The Web part of the business was growing,'' said Mr. Truran, whose company is known for its high-quality, durable messenger bags. ''It was the only part of the business that was truly growing.'' CourierWare, which also stopped publishing its mail-order catalog in 2001, now takes only phone or online orders. 
 As his Internet choices show, Mr. Truran is not like most small-business owners. After 15 years of growth, CourierWare's retail business was stagnant, and corporate sales were starting to slip. The company's sales peaked around $500,000 in 2000. 
 He saw two options -- expand the business or reduce it. Fearing an economic downturn and unhappy at having to spend 80 to 90 hours a week working, Mr. Truran chose to downsize. He closed CourierWare's Harvard Square store, laid off his eight employees and focused exclusively on the Internet. 
 ''My whole business philosophy is, enough is enough,'' he said. ''Anything more than that and you just work all the time.''
 Mr. Truran now works part time, probably 15 or 20 hours a week. He is also selling fewer bags -- sales are about $100,000 a year now -- and earning about $50,000, about half of what he made in the mid-1990's. 
 He has better things to do now, like playing guitar with his two bands, a rock cover band that goes by various names, and the Kind Buds, a ''Jerry Garcia-inspired jam duet'' that plays original music.
 Life was quite different in 1983, when Mr. Truran moved to Boston after going to Trinity College in Hartford, hoping to make it as a musician. To pay the rent until he hit it big, he took a job as a bicycle messenger. 
 It soon became apparent to him that neighboring Cambridge could use its own courier company, so Mr. Truran and his friends started one. 
 He imagined spending his days answering the phone while he played the guitar. Instead, he spent entire days calming irate customers who demanded to know why their packages had arrived wet. 
 The answer was obvious, Mr. Truran said. After a few months of use, the seams on the couriers' bags would split and the liners would peel away, allowing moisture to seep in, Mr. Truran explained. 
 He could find no other supplier for courier bags, so Mr. Truran would pick apart the bags at home, deconstructing them to see which aspects worked and which didn't. 
 He knew the retail business -- his family owned a furniture and gift emporium in East Wareham, Mass. As a child, he learned basic sewing from his mother and honed his skills in prep school, where he made burlap bow ties to wear with his uniform. 
 He experimented with various materials for a new bag, and settled on Cordura, a waterproof nylon manufactured by Invista. He designed the bags so the seams were joined between the layers of fabric, so they would not split. 
 Mr. Truran said that he and his wife, Diana Salyer, who is a partner in CourierWare, took their bags to stores around Cambridge, but none were interested in selling them. Abandoning the idea of wholesaling, the couple took out a $4,000 loan to begin making and selling the bags themselves. The venture was successful; they paid off the loan and soon sold the courier company to concentrate on the bag business. The couple opened their store in Cambridge in 1991. 
 ''We thought it was a pretty good design,'' Mr. Truran said. ''It was designed by people who used it.''
 By 1994, the store was self-sufficient and had enough inventory that Mr. Truran and Ms. Salyer chose to move to this small town, where they set up the manufacturing portion of the business. The move, he said, was possible because of that initial decision to stick with retail, enabling the company to operate debt-free. 
 The company was still free of debt in 2001, but overhead -- including rent for the Cambridge store and salaries and health benefits for his employees -- was eating up 80 percent of the company's sales. The venture was also eating up Mr. Truran's time because he spent a good part of each week in the car commuting from Vermont to the store. 
 Hooked on a calmer outdoor life of skiing and biking in Vermont, Mr. Truran decided to move the business to his home, where he would process the Internet orders and make the bags. Much work was already done in the form of the store's inventory, valued around $100,000, which he transported here.
 His home is a 7,500-square-foot space in the basement of an old sewing factory, with the upper floors now housing other small businesses. Ms. Salyer runs a yoga studio and massage and bodywork business out of two rooms in the back. The studio is the only room with a window; Mr. Truran said a lack of natural light helps sewing and keeps the space cool in the summer. His bands rehearse in the living room, and he leases out a room to the Vermont Independent School of Music.
 ''Woodwinds are on Thursdays,'' he said. 
 The Internet, he said, allowed him the opportunity to move there, significantly cutting the business and its overhead but retaining its most profitable arm. 
 ''It took 15 years until the Internet was a profitable enough marketing tool,'' he said. ''We had a broad enough base that we didn't feel it would incur that much risk.''
 It took that long to build up the customer base. Mr. Truran and Ms. Salyer decided not to market their product, except for small advertisements in the Boston Review, a political and literary publication, and the Utne magazine. Mr. Truran thinks the bags speak for themselves. 
 ''The bag itself is its own advertising,'' he said. ''It's the outermost garment. Because of the rarity of them you don't see them everywhere. We're guerrilla marketing, word of mouth. Our phone number is on every bag. People will ask other people where they got their bag, and they'll call.''
 Mr. Truran is so proud of his product that each bag comes with a lifetime guarantee and free repairs, although he said only about 20 bags a year came back for that.
 Couriers have never made up the bulk of buyers, he said, since many expect to move on to other jobs and do not want to spend money on such items, despite CourierWare's discounts to them. (It offers seven styles of bags and laptop inserts, from $35 to $179.) Instead, most of the customers are individuals who can afford a well-made bag. 
 The markup on the bags is typically four times the materials' cost, higher than usual because the company sells only retail. 
 Mr. Truran, whose corporation rents his office to himself, said his only overhead costs were fabric, of which he buys 2,000 yards a year, rent, Internet and phone charges and miscellaneous expenses, allowing him to keep half the sales. 
 In August, a typical busy month, Mr. Truran's Web site drew 19,050 page views and 50 orders, totaling $5,700 in sales. Mr. Truran estimates he sold 25 more bags over the phone. 
 While Mr. Truran says he is not in the business to get rich, he knows that CourierWare could leave him well off. His ultimate goal, he said, is to sell the licensing and name rights to a manufacturer who can produce thousands of high-quality bags annually. 
 ''I've been polishing this jewel for 20 years,'' he said. ''The real value it has is if someone licenses the name, the reputation and the design, and already has the distribution and production in place.''
 Mr. Truran is not, however, seeking a licensee, but just answering the phone each time it rings with the distant hope that such a person might be on the other end. Even if he isn't, Mr. Truran doesn't mind. For now, he said, business, and life, are fine. 
 ''I'm in a good spot,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, the Wait for Federal Loans Drags On

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AT a Senate hearing last week, Walter Isaacson, the former CNN chief who is vice chairman of the agency leading Louisiana's recovery from Hurricane Katrina, identified the state's two highest priorities: stronger levees and loans to help the 80,000 or so small businesses in the hardest-hit areas stay afloat.
 But as of yesterday, the Small Business Administration said that it had approved only 1,078 loans to small businesses for property damage or economic losses across the Gulf Coast from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while denying 1,945 applications. According to the agency, 24,268 business-related loan applications were still being processed. 
Anger at the slow pace spilled over at the hearing last week, before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.
 Mr. Isaacson said that in the hard-hit areas of Louisiana, as of Nov. 3 only 276 business loans had been approved, a pace he called ''devastating, '' while rejections were ''alarmingly high.''
 Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, a committee member, complained that ''Our businesses were wiped out by a wall of water, while S.B.A. help is coming in at a trickle.'' The committee's Republican chairwoman, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, said she had ''growing doubts about the agency's management and leadership.''
 Hector V. Barreto, the agency's administrator, insisted that the disaster ''is 10 times larger than any disaster we've had before.'' Because the agency handles loan requests after disasters from homeowners as well as businesses, it has been swamped by more than 200,000 homeowner applications. The agency has quadrupled its work force, to nearly 4,100. 
 Mr. Barreto told Congress that the agency received 55 percent of the applications in the last two weeks of October and first week of November, giving the short-staffed S.B.A. little time to sift through them. 
 Even so, the agency had processed only 17 percent of the loan applications filed, say Senate committee figures, and has a backlog that will take at least four months to get through at its current pace. 
 Senator Snowe said the agency dragged its feet when it should have recruited more loan officers immediately.
 And the S.B.A. may well receive nearly twice as many applications as have been filed so far, committee members warned. 
 The lagging loans are just one more aspect to an already grim situation, state officials contend. ''The situation is not good here,'' said Mary Lynn Wilkerson, director of the Louisiana Small Business Development Center. ''Clearly the loans are not coming quickly enough, and we have lost 40 percent of our small businesses so far.''
 Take Don Johnsen, who owns Royal Crown Coffee Service Inc., which provides machines and supplies for coffee and tea to restaurants, schools and businesses in New Orleans and Slidell, La. He had no insurance, and he says he needs $70,000 from the agency to tide him over until he can rebuild his business.
 ''I applied about six weeks ago,'' he said, ''but I have not had any contact since then, not a phone call or even a letter of receipt. This can't go on too much longer since I can't even pay myself.''
 The agency says it is simplifying its loan requirements, and announced last week a pilot program called GO Loans, which allows a small business to borrow up to $150,000 from a commercial bank within 24 hours after its application. The loans, available through next September, are 85 percent guaranteed by the federal government; interest rates are set by the banks.
 This contrasts with S.B.A. disaster loans, which have a low 4 percent rate, and pits the program against legislation, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, to authorize money for bridge loans to carry small-business owners over the lengthy agency approval process. Senator Snowe and some of her colleagues blamed the Bush administration for derailing the $450 million assistance package on bridge loans, which passed the Senate unanimously, by allowing it to be cut recently from the final legislation.
 While it was awaiting federal aid, Louisiana started its own bridge-loan program for small businesses, said Donald M. Pierson, assistant secretary of Louisiana Economic Development. ''We've exhausted the $10 million in funding,'' he said, ''and we've only scratched the surface. We could have used $150 million to $200 million.''
 Concern over the lumbering pace of loan approval and the high rejection rate, legislators, including Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Small Business, have asked for the Government Accountability Office to investigate.
 Earlier budget cutbacks led to eliminating some S.B.A. offices and consolidating others this year. Congressional critics think this set the stage for an inadequate response after Katrina. Another major complaint has been the agency's new computer system, which requires scanning all applications submitted on paper.
 An agency spokesman, Dennis Byrne, responded that the unprecedented number of applications had created ''capacity concerns.'' He said 5,000 applications were being entered into the computer system each day.
 It may be too late for many owners. Mr. Johnsen, the operator of the coffee service, said he might close his business and walk away after 20 years.
 ''I figure that if by the end of December, I don't have the loan,'' he said, ''I will have to close up.''

HEADLINE: Small-Town Shops Bulk Up on the Web

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: MANITOWOC, Wis. 

 BODY:
ALMOST every significant American economic era is apparent in this neat-as-a-pin city on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Its agrarian heritage is reflected in the farms lying at the city's edge, and a beer-malting plant at the center of town. The maritime and industrial eras are represented by a coal-fired ferry that crosses Lake Michigan, and the steel cranes built here by the 103-year-old Manitowoc Company. The rust belt period, with its manufacturing-job losses and downtown decline, is still felt in slow population growth, modest housing prices and shuttered plants. 
 In the newest era of this city's history, the Internet is propping up bricks and mortar downtown, acting as a mainstay for the stores that have helped Manitowoc establish what development specialists call a ''recreational'' shopping experience. Indeed, besides generating sales for giants like Amazon, the Internet is allowing small stores, here and around the country, to develop the niche products that shield them against big-box retailers. 
Beyond the revenue from online sales, Manitowoc's merchants say the biggest benefit of e-commerce is that it enables them to turn over their inventory much more quickly, so owners can add more products and variety to their sales floors. That, in turn, encourages more interest and customer traffic, diversifies the revenue stream and contributes to downtown street life here and in other small cities. 
 A walking tour of Manitowoc, population 34,000, reveals several examples of the convergence of new technology. 
 At Eighth Street is the kitchen supply retailer Cooks Corner, which occupies a 20,000-square-foot store that was once a Kresge's. The company, which is 11 years old, employs 35 people and stocks 15,000 gadgets and appliances; its Web site, cookscorner.com, accounts for a third of the company's revenue. Of the 1,000 customers who visit the site each day, roughly 200 place a digital order, said Peter Burback, the company's owner and founder with his wife, Cathy. The site has also elevated Cooks Corner to regional and national attention.
 Mr. Burback keeps a customer log of cash-register receipts totaling 170,000 people who visited the store last year. ''We're the No. 1 tourist draw in the city,'' he said. 
 Around the corner from Mr. Burback, on Ninth Street, is Healthy Chocolate Treats (healthychocolatetreats.com), a business founded in April by Paul Stitt, a 65-year-old biochemist who turned another Manitowoc-based specialty food company, Natural Ovens Bakery (naturalovens.com), into a $29 million-a-year business that gets 20 percent of its sales from Internet orders. Healthy Chocolate Treats, which employs seven people and attracts 100 or so retail customers a day, specializes in vitamin D-fortified candies. Its revenues have already reached nearly $40,000 a month, a third from orders from the Internet, Mr. Stitt said.
 Nearby on 10th Street, the Fitness Store (thefitnessstore.com), founded in 1993, sells an array of exercise and cardiovascular equipment. John Brunner, the 44-year-old owner, says that his 2005 sales are expected to reach $2.5 million, twice as much as last year. ''The Internet accounts for 75 percent of our sales now,'' he said. ''I started the company in 1993. We launched a Web site in 1995. I didn't know the Internet was going to be such a catalyst for growth until 2000, when we developed an e-commerce site. We're making huge gains now.'' 
 To some extent, the Internet's influence on helping small businesses was anticipated. In 2002, the Small Business Administration published a study finding that 61 percent of small companies managed a Web site, and 35 percent were selling products online. 
 What was not as clear was how the Internet could contribute to so many downtown revivals. Hours north of Manitowoc, in the rugged Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Marquette is also undergoing an economic transition from being a mining-based city of heavy industrialization to a recreation and tourism economy centered on its access to Lake Superior. 
 One anchor of Marquette's revival is the Getz Department Store, a family-owned business that has been on Front Street since the late 19th century and now earns roughly half its sales revenue by selling Carhartt and North Face clothing on the Internet (getzs.com). The company's Web site has also helped to establish Getz's, as it is also known, as one of the city's tourist destinations, along with the county courthouse a few blocks west, where scenes from the 1959 Jimmy Stewart film ''Anatomy of a Murder'' were shot. 
 Many other examples exist. In upstate New York, downtown Ithaca is a hub of new retail activity and tourist trade generated by Internet marketing and sales. ''There's an upside and a downside of marketing on the Internet,'' said Gary Ferguson, the executive director of the Ithaca Downtown Partnership, a business development group. ''The floral business has been changed dramatically by the Internet. More and more people are buying flowers online. We had a business called Plantations that had been here for 30 years and had a hard time with the transition and didn't make it.
 ''On the other hand, we have three used-book stores, and they do half their business on the Internet,'' Mr. Ferguson said.
 The Beeswax Candle Company in Lynchburg, Va., started three years ago as an Internet business with a store located on the edge of downtown. Because of rising sales at beeswaxcandleco.com, the company moved into a larger space at the center of town. 
 ''The Internet has taken a small family-owned candle business and allowed us to compete on a national level while contributing to the redevelopment of our downtown area in central Virginia,'' said Kathy Shaw, the founder. 
 Several merchants said that preparing for the transition and managing Internet marketing, sales and distribution was not easy. 
 E-commerce requires a business to change its infrastructure in four ways: The first is understanding the computer hardware and e-commerce software and managing vendors, servers and consultants. The second is applying the technology to sales and marketing by designing the Web site's back-end ordering platforms for customers, while making the front-end digital showplace clear, attractive, informative and navigable. The third phase is hiring a consultant or training staff members or doing both to manage the site. The last is developing the capacity to quickly fill and ship orders, respond to returns and replace inventory, most of which can also be done on the Internet. 
 Here in Manitowoc, small businesses are tapping into the online sales world primarily through pay-per-click advertising offered by Google's Adwords and Yahoo's Overture. Both companies require e-commerce retailers to bid on keywords and phrases to drive customers to Web sites. Mr. Brunner of the Fitness Store said he spent $6,000 a month on Google and $2,000 a month on Yahoo. But he also gained $240,000 in revenue in August. ''I expect to do more than that in November and December,'' he said.
 Still, Dennis Mingay, the general manager of Getz's, said the cost of Internet advertising can be a big concern. Getz's, he said, is spending nearly $1 a click. ''We're trying to master the marketing strategy to get that down so it's affordable,'' Mr. Mingay said. 
 One way to do that is through e-mail. Getz's has a list of 20,000 e-mail addresses. Cooks Corner has 35,000 addresses, which it taps for promotional newsletters. Mr. Burback said that e-mail marketing had been successful, accounting for 75 percent of the company's orders in the week or so after they are sent. E-mail, he added, has helped Cooks Corner contain the cost of Internet advertising to $2,500 a month.

HEADLINE: I Have the Idea, You Have the Factory

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
FEW business executives can explain nanotechnology, but plenty of them know they are wearing the results: L. L. Bean khakis and other clothing engineered for exceptional stain resistance. They may have also used clear sunscreens made with particles of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that block ultraviolet rays.
 And when corporate bigwigs head to their country clubs, there is a good chance they will encounter someone who has heard about NanoDynamics, a start-up in Buffalo that has been promoting its ability to rearrange the molecular structure of golf balls to damp the physical forces that send poor shots slicing or hooking.
No wonder it is hard to find big-business executives who don't know that their business might be affected by the growing ability of researchers to manipulate the very molecules out of which everything is made. The field is known as nanotechnology because the measuring rod of its products is the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter and the size of the smallest molecules. Nanotechnology has spawned hundreds of companies in the last decade and attracted billions of dollars in government and private investment.
 But it is going to take more than the first wave of novel products to convince big businesses that access to the new technology is worth quite as much today as many of its entrepreneurs believe. 
 That, at least, seems to be the message in a recent survey of nanotechnology start-ups and large multinationals by Lux Research, a New York company that focuses on nanotechnology. Three out of four nanotech start-ups negotiating deals with the big companies think they have the power to set price and other crucial terms, according to Lux's survey of 20 companies averaging 29 employees and $2 million in annual revenue. 
 But when Lux asked the same questions to materials buyers at 20 multinationals averaging 100,000 employees and $55 billion in annual revenue, 70 percent said it was their company that dictated the terms.
 Lux also found other disagreements on what the ideal deal looks like. For instance, 65 percent of the small companies wanted the multinationals to pay them license fees. But only 35 percent of the big companies wanted to take such licenses. Many of them want to handle nanomaterials like the commodities they are often replacing: tell us what the product costs per unit and then ship us as much as we want.
 The clashing value assessments and goals have stalemated negotiations and aborted deals, according to David Lackner, author of Lux's report. 
 No surprise there, according to experts who study entrepreneurial activity across the economy. ''Most entrepreneurs overplay their hand,'' said Steven Rogers, who teaches entrepreneurial finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.
 In the long run, getting a good partner is probably more important for a start-up than getting a good price. Take the case of Ecology Coatings, based in Akron, Ohio, which makes proprietary nanoscale and somewhat larger micron-scale particles for blending specialty paints. The resulting paints reduce reliance on dangerous solvents, cure rapidly and produce thin but extremely abrasion-resistant surfaces. 
 One potentially valuable niche identified two years ago by Ecology is the demand for cleaner and faster ways to recoat the hundreds of millions of propane tanks from home barbecue units that are recycled each year. But the equipment maker that Ecology dealt with to build specialized recoating machines substituted 300-watt ultraviolet lamps for the 600-watt units Ecology had specified for its drying process. That attempt to cut costs led to dismal results when the units were delivered to the tank company, according to Richard D. Stromback, Ecology's chief executive.
 To preserve the business, Mr. Stromback this year negotiated an exclusive license for Red Spot Paint and Varnish, a major coatings specialist based in Evansville, Ind., to manage design of the equipment and servicing of the tank refillers. ''They have the clout we don't to get this done,'' Mr. Stromback said. 
 Mr. Stromback said there had been no risk of similar missteps when Ecology sought to get its materials incorporated in paints for the automotive market. Within a week of acquiring control of Ecology in 2002, Mr. Stromback called on DuPont, the leader in automotive coatings.
 ''It costs $2 million a minute if you delay an auto production line, the capital equipment you sell them has to pay for itself in 12 months, and they demand that you have full-time employees there servicing them,'' he said. ''It's prohibitive for a small company to introduce new technology into that space.''
 Some start-ups have decided that the best way to avoid pricing battles is to accept terms in which they are not paid for the materials but get a percentage of the big business's gains from using them. 
 For example, Mr. Lackner said, Aspen Aerogels, in Northborough, Mass., makes a novel insulating material that allows water pipe manufacturers to reduce the total outer circumference of their products and seeks to be paid a percentage of the production savings. Oxonica, in Kidlington, England, asks for a percentage of the fuel savings that bus fleet operators get from its nanoengineered catalyst. 
 ''They are saying, we won't try to prove the value to you, we'll just take a percentage when you find it,'' Mr. Lackner said.
 Some nanotechnology entrepreneurs have relied on government-financed research contracts to carry them through the long search for commercial partners. ''At the end of the day, the Fortune 500 companies are going to call the shots,'' said David Reisner, president and chief executive of the Nano Group. ''They define all the things that come to roost if the deal unravels.'' 
 Sometimes intermediaries can bridge the gaps. The Cabot Corporation, a large specialty chemicals company based in Boston, last year set up the Cabot Fine Particles Network to serve as a matchmaker between its customers and nanotech start-ups. 
 ''We do a light due diligence to understand what they do if they want to be in the network,'' said Jack Reder, new-business project leader at Cabot. ''After that we do nothing until we get a request from a customer for something that's somewhat tangential to what we offer. We tell the start-ups what the needs are.'' 
 Some nanotechnology executives believe their leverage will increase as more big companies decide that nanotechnology is beginning to deliver on its potential and that they don't want to be left behind. Others say big business will always hold most of the cards.
 Still, seeing eye-to-eye may never come naturally. ''If an entrepreneur fails, he just does his next start-up,'' said Vinod Khosla, a leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist who deals with nanotechnology. ''If the business executive fails, he gets fired. They have very different cultures.''


CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Small Business section on Nov. 16 about the business strategies of nanotechnology companies misstated the use of the product sold by Aspen Aerogels and the company's pricing practice. The company sells its nanoporous insulating material for oil pipelines, not water pipelines. The insulation is sold per square foot, with the price negotiated before delivery; it is not sold on the basis of how much money a company will save by using the insulation in its pipelines.

HEADLINE: Problem: Good Jobs Are Scarce. Solution: Become Your Own Boss.

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
IF there is one place where the idea of the ownership society is taking hold, it is America's colleges and universities. More than 1,600 colleges offer courses in entrepreneurship, up from 1,050 in the early 1990's and a mere 300 schools in the 80's. 
 Experts see the surge reflecting profound changes in the American economy. It is a response to globalization and the fact that ''two billion people in the world want to do the same job you do,'' said Paul Merage, an entrepreneur and philanthropist who endowed the business school at the University of California, Irvine, this year with $30 million. 
Mr. Merage, who invented the microwavable frozen snack Hot Pockets, demanded that the curriculum at the newly renamed Merage School of Business stress innovation and ways ''to grow a business.''
 Prof. Thomas O'Malia of the University of Southern California also sees uncertainty driving the spread of own-your-own-shop education.
 ''There's no job security,'' said Professor O'Malia, program director at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurship, a specialized unit within U.S.C.'s Marshall School of Business. ''If the average corporation must recreate itself every 3.4 years, you need to think about controlling your destiny.''
 Students, however, seem driven less by fear than ambition -- even passion.
 Maya Gowri, for example, who organized a nutritionist practice at a hospital in her native Chennai (formerly Madras), in India, and came to the United States to earn a doctorate in biology from the University of Kentucky, is happy that she also studied two years and paid about $70,000 in tuition to earn a master of business administration degree last year from U.C. Irvine.
 The M.B.A. studies ''taught me about function and marketing and helped me find a business partner to raise finance,'' Ms. Gowri said. With a few employees and a fellow Irvine student, Charles Hsu, as a money raiser, she has begun Discovery Services International, which performs research for small biotechnology companies. 
 Another student, Emily Chan, is in the final leg of a three-year part-time program of study for a business master's at U.S.C. while holding down a job planning auto plant locations for the Toyota Motor Company in Torrance, Calif. It is a good job, Ms. Chan said, but her real ambition is to develop ideas about animal feeds into a business of her own.
 Ms. Chan, who rescues injured dogs, has developed a formula for feeds that she says help animals recover. So she is going to classes at night and on weekends and paying about $80,000 over three years to earn the degree.
 ''I've always had the passion but not the confidence to get started,'' Ms. Chan said. 
 At her stage in the master's program -- called ''feasibility'' -- she works with other candidates to see if her concept can work as a real business. In fact, Ms. Chan needs to sell the product in a commercial market -- as opposed to just doing a college experiment -- or she will not pass the feasibility course, said Professor O'Malia, who likes to call the entrepreneur program a boot camp.
 At Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, the program sounds more like athletic coaching.
 ''Half of what I teach is technique -- how to organize, control cash flow and such,'' said Prof. Fred Kiesner, who teaches management and entrepreneurship there. ''The other half is to get inside your heart and soul and mind and say: 'You can do it. Don't fear failure. If you're not risking failure, you're not stretching to try something new.' ''
 At U.S.C.'s entrepreneurship center, students are taught a distinction between management and entrepreneurship. ''A good manager thinks efficiently of how to go from A to B,'' Professor O'Malia said. ''But entrepreneurs are a little like Columbus, thinking effectually how to go into the unknown.'' 
 Often entrepreneurial success doesn't involve derring-do as much as forming alignments and reducing the need for capital. ''Entrepreneurship is about organization, not lone-wolf operators,'' said Christine Beckman, professor of organization at the Merage school. 
 Two University of Southern California graduates, one from 1989, the other from 1998, illustrate the point.
 Todd Smart, attending the university in the 80's, heard a visiting insurance man say that his business was being hurt by poor service from car-towing companies that were paid $600,000 a year. So Mr. Smart asked for a chance to do the towing, traded his car for a tow truck and started gathering up crashed vehicles.
 As business grew, he did not use his new company's capital to buy more vehicles but had his drivers buy them, creating new small-business owners and allowing greater expansion of the towing company.
 ''What I learned in business school,'' said Mr. Smart, whose companies now tow 500 cars a day in the San Fernando Valley, ''is that the cash-flow account is more important than the profit-and-loss statement.''
 When the other student, Todd Stennett, graduated with an M.B.A. in 1998, he and his wife, who have two children, owed $82,000 in credit-card debt. But Mr. Stennett saw opportunity in a federal policy encouraging small companies to commercialize government technology, like the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's powerful lasers for mapping land.
 Mr. Stennett could not afford to buy a $1.5 million laser, but he lined up scores of land-surveying businesses as customers whose contracts helped him pay for the equipment. He also joined bush-pilot outfits to help the surveying.
 ''Our relationships with partners are critical to our success,'' Mr. Stennett said, as his company, Airborne 1, reaches $5 million in annual revenue.
 To Andrew Policano, dean of the Merage school, the benefit of entrepreneurial training nowadays is that it encourages original thinking.
 ''Innovation is what all corporations want today,'' Mr. Policano said. ''Chief executives coming to our campus want graduates who will tell them what the business should be in five years.''

HEADLINE: When a Bone Is Not Enough

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
HOW hot is the pet market these days? Think dog purses, cat strollers, ''Cab-bone-net'' wine-flavored dog treats and sitters hired to watch television with Fido, and some sense of the lunatic growth becomes clear.
 So far, the boom has created lucrative opportunities for small-business owners, but as more big companies take note, the market could become more difficult for the niche firms that are now flourishing.
Large companies that dominate other sectors of the consumer economy -- like Wal-Mart and Target -- are adding more pet products to their shelves, and the two big players already in pet supplies, Petco and Petsmart, are expanding at a breakneck pace.
 ''We're concerned,'' said Tom Measday, a co-founder of NJ Pets, which has three stores in New Jersey. He said he expected Petsmart to open a retail operation in East Hanover, N.J., near one of his stores. ''What we've seen from the big companies, let's say Petco and Petsmart, is they tend to look for the most successful store and that's where they put their store.'' 
 Mr. Measday had to contend with one of the two big pet-supply retailers once before, he said, but it closed. This time, he thinks that a new competitor will put up more of a fight.
 With about 75 employees, Mr. Measday has a solid midsize business. But for much smaller companies, the pet boom presents more opportunity than threat. 
 Pet Dreams, a small Manhattan company selling ''cratewear'' -- accessories for dog training crates -- was founded by Annette A. Grignard, one of many entrepreneurs who are making a living selling solutions to a problem that customers did not know existed. The kits she sells include a mattress for the animal to sleep on, bumpers to protect the animal from injury against the crate's metal bars and a cover to make the crate more attractive.
 The first such kit ''was just for my personal use,'' said Ms. Grignard, who used to work for a pharmaceutical company in Manhattan. ''People were coming over to my apartment and saying, 'Omigod.' '' She started her business in 1999 and later received a loan from the Small Business Administration for $250,000. Today she has manufacturers in China and uses a warehouse in New Jersey to distribute the kits, which cost $30 to $70. Business has grown rapidly, and she is shipping thousands of kits every month to a range of retailers -- including big stores like Petsmart.
 Pet supplies now fuel a $37 billion industry. Retail sales of pet supplies, not including food and services, amounted to $8.5 billion in the United States in 2004, more than the $6.2 billion spent on baby-care supplies, according to Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com. And pet supply sales are growing at 7 percent annually, as sales of baby supplies are decreasing.
 Many of the companies in the business are small, said Bob Vetere, chief operating officer of the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Greenwich, Conn. Over the last three years the number of members in his organization has jumped to nearly 900 from just over 500.
 ''Maybe 60 to 70 percent of them are new or start-up companies,'' Mr. Vetere added. ''These numbers continue to grow.''
 Everyone has a theory about why so many people are spending more and more money on their pets -- primarily cats and dogs, by the way; Mr. Vetere said that in the 69 million households with a pet, there are 90 million cats and 77 million dogs. All the theories are difficult to prove.
 People who are single or whose children have moved away may become more attached to their pets, treating them as members of the family rather than as, well, pets. In a world that feels more uncertain, the benefit of coming home to an enthusiastic welcome every day may be deserving of a bigger reward.
 ''As a human, to just buy him a dirty old tennis ball is just not enough, even though he doesn't care,'' Mr. Vetere said, referring to his dog, Dakota. ''I feel better because I've given him something more than just a tennis ball.''
 He added: ''Does it absolutely make sense? No.''
 But the feeling is clear. Many people refused to leave New Orleans without their pets during Hurricane Katrina, and in light of that devotion, several members of Congress have proposed legislation requiring consideration of pets in future evacuation plans.
 One sign of stronger human-animal attachments may be the increase in the number of social activities that people engage in with their pets, like dog runs where animals can run freely as their owners mingle.
 That is new, Mr. Measday said. When he grew up, most people didn't even walk their dogs, said Mr. Measday, who is 59. Instead, he said, they let pets out of the house and trusted that the animals would find their way home. Now, he said, ''Dogs and cats really are an integral part of the family.''
 But the main force pushing people to spend more on their pets may be mundane: marketing. Several business owners cited Paris Hilton and her famous Chihuahua as making the world safe for tiny dogs, clad in fashionable sweater sets, carried in matching purses. 
 ''Three years ago, we didn't sell the purses,'' Mr. Measday said. Now his stores sell, besides purses, strollers for very small pets.
 Businesses have tapped into a potent marketing tool by inciting a pet owner's sense of loyalty, said David Lummis, a pet market analyst for Packaged Facts. ''This human-animal bond is just being fully exploited by marketers,'' said Mr. Lummis, who owns two dogs and four cats, all of which he took safely from his home in New Orleans. 
 There is excess in the pet market, though, Mr. Lummis said. ''A lot of it is trading people up to more expensive products, basically, and making people feel like, 'Hey, it's O.K. for me to spend $20 on a bag of dog treats instead of $2.99,' '' he said. ''These dog treats are going to be really good for my dog, and he's going to love them.''
 But describing some of the pet snacks and services available does not begin to capture the range of goodies that are out there.
 At Fideaux, a pet supply boutique in Healdsburg, Calif., just a few of the offerings include leather collars imported from Switzerland for $60 to $100 each; ''Cab-bone-net'' and ''Char-dog-nay'' wine-flavored treats for $9.95 a bag; and brightly striped beds for summertime, and red and green beds for the holidays that cost $60 to $150.
 ''It's done very seasonally,'' said Erin E. Morris, a co-owner of Fideaux. Business at the store's two locations is booming, she said, mostly because tourists visiting the wine country nearby miss their pets and buy things to take back to them.
 One of Fideaux's suppliers is Up Country Inc., a Rumford, R.I., company that makes collars, toys, beds and other products. Alice M. Nichols started the business in 1984 to have more flexible hours and to be able to spend more time with her children. She had been a schoolteacher.
 ''When I researched different industries, the pet industry was the most interesting, because it was growing very fast'' and was considered recession-proof, Ms. Nichols said. ''It wasn't that I really had an idea about the dog collars,'' she added, but she quickly focused on collars as a product with great demand, because every dog needs one. 
 She started by designing the collars and then delivering raw materials and the designs to a belt maker in Marblehead, Mass., not too far from her home. Now she has 22 ''stitchers'' who make collars. Last year the company sold more than 500,000 collars and leashes through retailers nationwide.
 But the market may be growing most quickly in services. Reba Jackson of Austin, Tex., a part-time entrepreneur and an independent contractor to cellular telephone companies, opened up a business with her husband, Nelson, last year, offering to pet-sit while owners are on vacation.
 ''Business picked up pretty quickly right after we opened,'' Ms. Jackson said. Now their two-person company, Ruff Around the Edges, has contracts with several apartment buildings, so that if tenants need pet care, the building managers call her. 
 ''We check their food and water, but basically it's just some playtime with them,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''We're the most reasonable in the area and we charge $15 a visit.''
 Pet-sitting costs more, about $35 a night. Over all, in a slow month, Ms. Jackson said, she and her husband take in about $3,000, and during the holidays she thinks that amount will double as more people go away. Her husband quit his job as an insurance claims adjuster to cater to pet clients full time. 
 Then there are the special services, like watching television with a client's dog. Usually, Ms. Jackson said, it's a dog-friendly movie like ''All Dogs Go to Heaven.''
 Asked whether she had expected such demand for pet services, Ms. Jackson paused, then said, ''It is crazy.'' 
 She researched the business carefully beforehand, spending almost a year reading about dog massages and other services and the people who pay for them. ''People will do crazy things for their pets,'' she said. ''We do, my husband and I, so why not think that there are lots of other people like us?''
 The number of pet owners with similar attitudes, along with the near-100 percent markups on many types of pet supplies other than food, have led to steadily increasing sales at the industry's two giants, Petco and Petsmart. Both chains are opening stores around the country at a rapid pace and are expanding their service offerings, too. 
 Petco, for example, which has about 765 stores and 17,000 employees, will have opened 90 new stores by the end of the year, said Kevin Wayland, a company spokesman. Petsmart, the larger company in terms of sales, has more than 750 stores and is opening more at the rate of nearly 20 each quarter. 
 Wal-Mart is also paying more attention to pets, said Karen Burk, a company spokeswoman. ''You may have noticed a few more offerings of some items as we become more in tune with what our customers are looking for with their pet needs,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''We understand that pets are members of the families and people want to pamper them and have fun with them. It could be a fun new pet bowl, a stylish jeweled collar or even a costume for this past Halloween.''
 While statements like that are worrisome to midlevel retailers like Mr. Measday, he expects that the big stores will have a hard time matching his staff's expertise and familiarity with customers and their pets.
 His stores also offer more specialized equipment -- high-end purses, sophisticated saltwater fish tanks or expensive bird cages, for example -- than larger competitors. He also said that his employees spend more time making sure that items are properly fitted or set up.
 ''We have greater variety,'' in prices and range of items, Mr. Measday said. ''That's why when you see the Petcos and Petsmarts coming, you still see the small stores.''
 Years ago, after all, pet supplies were sold in big variety stores like Woolworths, and that business plan fell apart, as increased specialization led to smaller stores and the more focused chains of today. It is unlikely, he said, that the world will revert to an all-in-one store.
 ''When we started, it was the time in the States that people were going to specialty stores,'' Mr. Measday said. By opening a specialty pet store, he said, ''We guessed right.''
 And whatever its size, not every pet industry business is destined to succeed, many of the store owners said. Ms. Nichols of Up Country recalled attending a trade show for pet suppliers and talking to a fellow would-be entrepreneur who had a bold vision.
 ''Some fellow who owned a liquor store said he was going to put in a pet section,'' Ms. Nichols said. ''People have an unrealistic expectation of the pet industry.''

HEADLINE: Tax Increase Is Sought to Bolster Westchester Medical Center

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, proposed a $1.54 billion budget Tuesday calling for a 4.5 percent property-tax increase that will be used largely to pay for operating costs at the financially troubled Westchester Medical Center. 
 The tax increase, $21.6 million, also includes a $7.2 million increase for county government spending, which will pay for more public safety officers and services from nonprofit agencies.
The medical center, the largest hospital in the county, has failed to pay more than $33 million to reimburse the county for the cost of utilities, security and maintenance of its grounds. Rather than anticipate such a reimbursement in 2006, Mr. Spano's budget proposal includes a $14.4 million allocation to the hospital to cover such costs. 
 The county spun off the hospital as a public benefit corporation in 1998. Earlier this year, the county pledged to give the medical center $57 million from the national legal settlement from tobacco manufacturers to help pull it out from financial ruin. 
 ''What we're saying is, 'don't worry what's going on outside the walls of the hospital, let us focus on that,' '' said Larry Schwartz, the deputy county executive.
 Mr. Spano said that he would continue to press for more state aid for the hospital. An aid package fell apart during the last session of the State Legislature. Officials originally projected a $60 million deficit for the hospital this year, but have said money from the county and cuts in spending will reduce that figure. 
 Emphasizing that the total tax increase was below the current rate of inflation, Mr. Spano said the county has to finance several social service programs that had relied on federal and private grants that have expired. 
 Mr. Spano, who last week won a third term, said this budget was among the best in his time in office.
 The budget proposal will now be reviewed by the County Legislature, which must act on it by the end of the year. William Ryan, the chairman of the Legislature, said the lawmakers would likely approve the medical center appropriations, but would look for ways to lower the increase. 
 ''Ideally, we can keep services up to the standards and still find other ways for adjusting,'' he said.
 The property tax increases will vary among homeowners, because of complicated tax laws. Some residents may see a significant increase while others may have a small decrease.

HEADLINE: When the National Brand Loses Its Local Appeal

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
EVER since dinosaurs walked you could count on one thing: Republicans would control Long Island politics, and particularly the 12-story tower poking out of the Long Island landscape that's the seat of Suffolk County government.
 But yesterday the building was populated by strange creatures, like Brian Foley, the new Democratic supervisor of the Republican duchy of Brookhaven, and Steve Levy, the first-term Democratic county executive, who after last week's election will be presiding over a Democratic County Legislature. And for the first time in history, Democrats hold the county executive jobs in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties and have majorities in both Legislatures. 
Mr. Levy, a fiscal conservative who has rattled some liberals by his tough stance on illegal immigrants, mostly sees local trends, not broader ones, in the Democratic gains on Long Island. ''The big hurdle for Democrats was to get people in office who would destroy the myth that Republicans are better managers,'' he said yesterday. ''And I think we've shattered that myth.''
 Still, let us review last week's results. 
 New Jersey residents may be sick of high taxes and corruption from Democrats, but not enough to vote for Douglas R. Forrester over Jon S. Corzine. And Westchester continued to become more Democratic.
 Democrats made gains throughout the Hudson Valley, where, for instance, Republicans lost control of the Ulster County Legislature for the first time since the 1970's and barely held on in Orange County, where they've had control for the County Legislature's entire 35-year history. The Long Island Republicans are dispirited and in disarray. The New Jersey Republicans are dispirited and in disarray. The New York State Republicans are dispirited and in disarray.
 Maybe there's a pattern here.
 Yes, there was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, but Mr. Bloomberg cited his Republican Party affiliation as often as Mr. Corzine appeared in public with his former wife. 
 So here's the real question about last Tuesday's elections. Was all politics really local? Or do the results, at least in part, tell a bigger story?
 For the answer, tune in next year when control of Congress will be at stake. But there are some hints.
 It's hard to argue that on Long Island, for instance, the Republican machines didn't collapse, for the most part, on their own merits, or lack of the same. When Nassau County became defined by the financial meltdown of the Gulotta years and everyone started to know Brookhaven as Crookhaven, it was inevitable that the wheels would eventually come off the Republican machine. And local races almost always hinge on local issues.
 But then you have New Jersey, where voters had plenty of reason to turn out the Democrats but didn't, or Westchester, which is getting inexorably more Democratic by the year. Or, for that matter, the way all of Long Island's congressional seats but one have gone Democratic.
 You can blame the results (as Mr. Forrester did) on the sinking popularity of President Bush, but Republicans should be worried about something much broader.
 The Republicans nationally have been geniuses at using wedge issues -- particularly the three G's: God, guns and gays -- to create a gut-level bond with voters, particularly in the South and Midwest. The success of Republican strategists like Karl Rove has been based on a single insight: it's the culture, stupid.
 But what if the culture that sells in Georgia repels in New Jersey? How long do voters feel good about the local Republican brand, even in nonideological local elections, if they don't like the national one?
 OVER the years, the most successful local Republicans, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, former Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, have established themselves as creatures quite apart from the national party. 
 But they created that identity long ago. So the question is how new Republican politicians bond with an increasingly Democratic-leaning electorate and how long-existing ones, like Mr. Shays, can continue to convince voters that ''you may not trust my party, but you can trust me.''
 We'll find out a lot next year with Democrats desperate to take back Congress. New Jersey Republicans think they have a promising United States Senate candidate in Tom Kean Jr., but will voters elect him knowing it could keep the Senate Republican? Democrats hope to make the Connecticut congressional seats of Mr. Shays, Rob Simmons and Nancy L. Johnson three of the most vigorously contested seats in the nation. 
 And then there's Jeanine F. Pirro, having passed on what seemed like the race she was best suited for, New York attorney general, secure in the knowledge that at least Mr. Rove and President Bush would have her back if she ran against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Who knew they'd be so busy protecting their own?

HEADLINE: Ground Zero Cooling Plant Shrinks From XL to S

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey intends to drastically shrink its plans for an underground chiller plant at the World Trade Center site, cutting off the new commercial office towers from the central air-conditioning and water cooling system.
 The redesign, which is to be voted on tomorrow by the authority board, will make the chiller plant more environmentally acceptable by reducing the amount of Hudson River water -- and fish eggs and larvae -- drawn into its pipes. 
It will still provide cooling to public buildings like the memorial, the memorial museum and the PATH terminal. It will probably hasten overall construction and reduce the likelihood of lawsuits. It may open subterranean space for other uses.
 And by dividing responsibility for the utility, the new plan heads off what could have been a battle between the authority and Silverstein Properties, the commercial leaseholder on the site, over who would pay what for a central system.
 ''It's illustrative of our commitment,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the Port Authority chairman, ''to go ahead and build the chiller facility because we were not comfortable that we would reach agreement with Silverstein Properties in enough time.''
 The redesigned plant may cost half what the larger plant would have, estimated by the authority at $194 million. 
 The new arrangement will increase the time, complexity and cost -- perhaps by tens of millions of dollars -- of the Freedom Tower and four other office buildings planned at the trade center by Larry A. Silverstein, the president and chief executive of Silverstein Properties, who already faces questions about his future role at the site. 
 Without the ability to hook up to a central system, Silverstein Properties must build its own rooftop cooling towers, which will use drinkable city water. The cooling tower atop the Freedom Tower, however, will be so integrated that it is ''invisible from the street,'' said Janno Lieber, the project director for Silverstein Properties.
 State officials said they regarded the smaller chiller plant, and the splitting up of the cooling systems, as a logistical and environmental victory.
 ''It ensures that the project will go forward and that the Freedom Tower and the memorial will be built in accordance with the governor's time frame,'' said John P. Cahill, who oversees downtown redevelopment as Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff. ''And it's important for the continuing recovery of the Hudson River.''
 Mr. Lieber credited Mr. Cahill's intervention with resolving a difficult issue.
 ''The governor's office and all the different public agencies believed that the only way to avoid a major controversy and potential delay was for Silverstein to switch to building-by-building cooling towers rather than using a central chiller plant,'' he said.
 ''We agreed to this approach in order to maintain the schedule,'' Mr. Lieber said, ''and the government agreed to help us address the significant costs and environmental impact of this switch.'' Some savings may come from increasing the buildings' energy efficiency.
 Mr. Coscia, the authority chairman, said that financial issues remained unresolved and that the authority expected Silverstein Properties ''to adjust their economic contribution'' since they were being relieved of a legal obligation under the 2001 lease to provide chilled water for the whole trade center site.
 On a smaller scale, the new plant will echo the original, which sat under the twin towers and drew as much as 90 million gallons of river water daily through its refrigeration system, supplying air-conditioning and chilled water to the complex above. It was designed before the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.
 ''They have been trying until now to replicate the antiquated and destructive technology of decades ago,'' said Reed W. Super, a lawyer at the Environmental Law Clinic of Columbia Law School who represents Riverkeeper, an organization that describes its mission as safeguarding the Hudson's ecological integrity. Riverkeeper was prepared to battle the larger plant, as was the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 ''The proponents of the trade center have touted this redevelopment as the model of environmental excellence,'' Mr. Super said. ''With regard to the chiller plant, it has not met the lofty rhetoric. The only way it could is with a drastic reduction in the amount of Hudson River water it intends to use.''
 The new plant would reduce river water intake to approximately 15 million gallons daily. That would reduce by 82 percent the number of organisms ''entrained'' by the giant intake pipes -- that is, sucked in, run through the system and then discharged, state officials said yesterday.
 ''The implications of that are very positive for the Hudson River and the aquatic organisms that live in the Hudson River,'' said Charles G. Fox, the deputy secretary for energy and the environment in the governor's office.
 As originally planned, the central plant was to furnish up to 40,000 tons of total cooling capacity. (For comparison's sake, a residential room air-conditioner may have a capacity of less than one ton. A modest-size house would require three or more tons.)
 The revised proposal before the authority's board calls for the design and engineering of a plant with a 12,500-ton capacity.
 It had been clear for some time that the State Department of Environmental Conservation was not inclined to grant a permit to the larger chiller plant.
 ''A yearly entrainment of approximately 53 million fish, eggs and larvae is a significant adverse impact to the Hudson River fishery,'' said John Ferguson, the project manager for the environmental agency, in an April 21 letter to the Port Authority.
 Mr. Ferguson said that was a 24 percent reduction from the time the original plant was operating, before Sept. 11, 2001. And he told the authority his agency would seek a reduction ''at the upper end'' of 60 to 90 percent.

PERSON: Preston Robert Tisch

HEADLINE: Preston Robert Tisch, Co-Owner of Loews Empire and New York Giants, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Preston Robert Tisch, who with his older brother built a multibillion-dollar business empire and who himself was postmaster general, half-owner of the New York Giants football team and leader of many of the city's top business groups, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79 and also had a home in Harrison, N.Y.
 The cause was a brain tumor, said Jeffrey Stewart, spokesman for the family.
Wellington Mara, the co-owner of the Giants with Mr. Tisch, died on Oct. 25. 
 Mr. Tisch was sometimes called ''the other Tisch'' to differentiate him from his older brother, Laurence, who was known as a no-nonsense financial strategist, partly from being the fiercely cost-conscious chairman of CBS from 1986 to 1995. He died in 2003. 
 But it was more often Preston Robert Tisch, universally known as Bob, who seized the public view, first as a persuasive marketer for hotels and other companies owned by the Loews Corporation. As operations chief, his attention to detail once included personally hiring all bellmen for Loews hotels. He saw them as his best salesmen.
 Mr. Tisch freely gave his talents to New York City. He served as Mayor David N. Dinkins ''ambassador'' to Washington; was chairman of host committees for the 1976 and 1980 Democratic National Conventions; and led the way in building a new convention center on Manhattan's West Side.
 His last campaign, Take the Field, to revitalize the ragged athletic fields of the city's public high schools, raised $140 million in donations. He said he could have written a check himself, but wanted a broad base of continuing support.
 Mr. Tisch's enthusiasm for convening the city's movers and shakers began during the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's with breakfasts at his Park Avenue hotel, the Regency. Major players in that municipal drama -- the labor leader Victor Gotbaum, the real estate mogul Lewis Rudin and the investment banker Felix G. Rohatyn -- were the first regulars.
 ''Stop over for breakfast, and you'll meet a lot of people,'' Mr. Tisch was famous for saying.
 Many credit Mr. Tisch with coining the term ''power breakfast,'' and the Regency continued to attract the likes of Beverly Sills, Henry Kissinger and Mr. Dinkins who said in an interview, ''When you think of Bob Tisch, you smile.''
 In recent months, Mr. Tisch continued attending power breakfasts, as well as meetings at Giants Stadium and sports events there and elsewhere.
 Among the city organizations he headed were the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, the New York City Partnership and the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When he joined with Mr. Rudin and other executives to form the Association for a Better New York in 1971, he and other soon-to-be billionaires posed delightedly with brooms. 
 His speaking schedule was so full that when President Ronald Reagan named him postmaster general in 1986, friends wondered if the job might really be ''toastmaster general.''
 Larry and Bob Tisch were known for their generosity, not least their gifts to New York University where the medical center and arts school both bear the family name. So does a gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the children's zoo in Central Park, not to mention namesake institutions at the University of Michigan, Tufts University and elsewhere.
 The Tisch brothers add up to a quintessential Big Apple success story, beginning with playing stickball on the streets of Brooklyn and building to a financial conglomerate with annual sales of more than $15.2 billion and assets of $73.7 billion.
 Their holding company, the Loews Corporation, ranks 127th on the Fortune 500, and has subsidiaries engaged in various kinds of insurance, the production and sale of cigarettes and watches, and the operation of hotels and oil and gas drilling rigs.
 Preston Robert Tisch was born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn on April 29, 1926, to parents who came from Russia. His father, Abraham Solomon, known as Al, owned a garment-manufacturing business and bought two summer camps in New Jersey, Laurel and Lincoln, which his wife, the former Sayde Brenner, helped him operate. As teenagers, Larry and Bob worked at the camps.
 ''My parents were middle class and like everybody else in Brooklyn at the time, they worked hard and tried to move up the scale,'' Mr. Tisch said in an interview with Newsday in 1991.
 The family moved every three years to get three months of free rent, a common practice even among the middle class. This meant Mr. Tisch attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx for one year and Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn for three.
 Mr. Tisch joined the Army after briefly attending Bucknell, and enrolled at the University of Michigan after his discharge in 1944, earning a bachelor's degree in economics.
 His wife, the former Joan Hyman, recalled him selling keychains for a dime, or two for 15 cents, in front of the university's football stadium. They married in 1948.
 Besides his wife of 57 years, he is survived by two sons, Steven and Jonathan; and a daughter, Laurie. 
 In 1946, Larry, then a student at Harvard Law School, saw an advertisement for a sleepy resort in Lakewood, N.J., called Laurel-in-the-Pines, and persuaded his parents to put up $125,000 to buy it. A family friend threw in another $50,000 and took a one-fourth interest.
 The Tisches refurnished the hotel, added amenities like a swimming pool and dreamed up promotional schemes that included importing three reindeer from Finland to pull sleighs in the snow. By the time Mr. Tisch joined the business in 1948, the hotel was prospering.
 The family began investing profits in small hotel operations in Atlantic City, almost literally playing Monopoly on the boardwalk. They then took positions in Manhattan hotels. They typically found unprofitable properties, made improvements and raised rates.
 The brothers, personally and in business, could not have been closer. Their families socialized together, they went to temple together, played tennis together and even commuted to work together. In business, Larry made deals, Bob ran companies.
 Bill Rudin, comparing the Tisches to his father Lewis and uncle Jack, the New York real estate magnates, said in an interview ''They both sketched out a role that each of them wanted to play, and each ran with the ball.'' 
 In 1956, the brothers were ready to build their own hotel, the Americana at Bal Harbour, Fla. They did not borrow a cent to build the $17 million hotel. It did $12 million in business the first year, in large part because of Mr. Tisch's success in getting convention business.
 With $65 million from their thriving hotels, the brothers started buying into the Loews Corporation. An antitrust decree had separated the company's theaters from its filmmaking unit, and the brothers recognized that many of the theaters occupied prime real estate. By January 1961, they gained total control of Loews.
 They knocked down the old Loews Lexington theater and used the site to build the 800-room Summit, the first hotel built in Manhattan in 30 years. They built the Americana, which at 50 stories was the world's tallest hotel upon completion in 1962. Other hotels followed, and Loews became a leading chain.
 The Tisches decided to recast the company as a conglomerate. In 1968, they acquired Lorillard, then the nation's fifth-largest cigarette company. In 1974, they bought the CNA Financial Corporation, a nearly bankrupt Chicago-based insurance company. Within a few years, it had assets of $16.5 billion and an A+ credit rating. In 1979, they purchased the troubled Bulova Watch and turned a profit.
 By 1980, Loews had revenue of $4.5 billion and earnings of $206 million, and all its segments were doing well.
 Luck mixed nicely with strategy. When the brothers sold the Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City in 1956, they retained a parcel of its land. They were able to take advantage of the casino boom that began in 1978.
 In the early 1980's, the Tisches bought five supertankers for $25 million when the oil market was depressed. The deal had no risk because even if oil prices did not rise, the scrap value of each tanker was $5 million.
 Mr. Tisch was postmaster general for almost two years, beginning in 1986. He used his marketing skill to come up with the idea of selling stamps by phone, and stressing sales of commemorative stamps, which are financially advantageous for the Postal Service because collectors seldom use them as postage. 
 Mr. Tisch, whose net worth was $3.9 billion in 2003, according to Forbes, relished such hands-on personal involvement. Not only did he help found Meals-on-Wheels and serve as its president for 20 years, he many times personally delivered meals to elderly patrons.
 His habit of working Sundays prevented him from seeing a professional football game until 1961, but he made up for it. After buying the Giants in 1991, he loved to attend practices and confer with coaches. 
 Mr. Tisch improved the Giants' business by sharpening marketing strategies, and, just as he had raised hotel rates, increasing ticket prices. He remarked that for all his business success and his oversight of the world's largest civilian work force at the Postal Service -- and even his considerable civic and philanthropic contributions -- he found people most admired his ownership of the Giants. That made sense to him.
 ''I want to be part of the fraternity and live out my life as a Giants owner,'' he said in 1991, shortly after acquiring a share of the team.

HEADLINE: The Streetcars Don't Run Here Anymore

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Bourbon Street, with its show-must-go-on swagger, is back, but another venerable symbol of this city has fallen on harder times. Herded into a terminal a couple of miles from the tourist territories are row after row of streetcars, their metal undercarriages diseased with rust. 
 The city's three streetcar lines have been out of service since Hurricane Katrina, and it will cost more than $30 million to repair them. Their absence is not just a blow to visitors looking to sample a bit of quaint New Orleans conveyance to go with their crayfish and jazz. The streetcars were also a mainstay for residents poor and rich, offering a convenient $1.25 ride through the business district and nearby.
Before the hurricane hit, transit officials returned the 24 streetcars on the Canal Street line to their terminal, which then had several feet of flooding for two weeks. The brackish water ate away some of the red paint on the streetcars and corroded their wheels and motors.
 The Canal Street line actually started service only last year, with new streetcars, on a route that was shut down in 1964. Its resurrection was seen as a milestone in the city's efforts to bolster its sagging economy and quality of life.
 A second line, on St. Charles Avenue, fared better in the wake of the hurricane, with its 35 streetcars safely parked in a dry terminal. The St. Charles Avenue line is the real deal, considered one of the oldest continuously running streetcar systems in the world. Since the 1920's, it has used the same streetcars, a charming model that is not especially pleasant to ride in the summer because it cannot be fitted with air-conditioning.
 Still, while the St. Charles streetcars are fine, the overhead wires that power the line were wrecked.
 Six of the seven streetcars on a third line, the Riverfront, which opened in the 1980's, suffered the same damage as those on the Canal Street line. (You were going to ask, so here's the answer: the Desire streetcar line made famous by the Tennessee Williams play met its demise in 1948.)
 Rosalind Blanco Cook, a spokeswoman for the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority, said it was hoping that federal aid would pay the $1 million bill to repair each of the Canal and Riverfront streetcars. The St. Charles Avenue line should cost far less, but with so many people still lacking power, fixing the wires is not a priority.
 For now, buses are running along the streetcar lines, though those are not in great supply either. More than half of the system's buses were damaged in the hurricane and its aftermath. A few were recovered as far away as Houston. With much of the city's population still gone and some areas uninhabitable, buses are operating on only a third of routes, with free fares.
 Before the storm, there were 143,000 daily rides on the system, Ms. Cook said, about a quarter of them on streetcars.
 Edward J. Branley, a streetcar enthusiast who runs a Web site devoted to the New Orleans system (www.canalstreetcar.com), said he had first worried that the hurricane had demolished the fleet. Now he is worried that the system will languish.
 ''It's nothing that can't be fixed,'' Mr. Branley said. ''My big fear is, will the feds put up the money to fix them?''

HEADLINE: Bush, in Japan, Suggests That China Expand Freedoms

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Wednesday, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush planned to open his tour of Asia on Wednesday with a carefully couched warning to China's leaders, telling them they are finding ''that once the door to freedom is opened even a crack, it cannot be closed.''
 Mr. Bush's comments, in the text of a speech that he is scheduled to give in the afternoon after touring the Golden Pavilion of the Kinkakuji Temple, one of the treasures of Japan's ancient capital, stopped well short of prescribing to the Chinese a future course.
But coming just three days before Mr. Bush lands in Beijing, the speech implicitly urges China's leaders to follow the path of Japan, South Korea and -- in a comparison senior administration officials said they knew would annoy Beijing -- Taiwan, which Mr. Bush called ''free and democratic and prosperous.''
 At a midday news conference with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Bush was asked whether he was urging China to follow Taiwan's path to a Chinese-style democracy. He did not answer directly, but said, ''What I say to the Chinese is that a free society is in your interest.'' He then repeated that his one-China policy -- calling for peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan -- was unchanged. 
 For his part, Mr. Koizumi sidestepped a question about whether Japan was preparing to withdraw its troops from Iraq next year, as several leading Japanese newspapers have reported. He also rejected a criticism often leveled against him in Japan: that he has embraced the alliance with the United States to the detriment of Japan's already-strained relations with its Asian neighbors.
 ''The better our alliance'' with the United States, he said, ''the easier it will be to develop better relations with China and other neighbors in the world.''
 Since long before Mr. Bush took office, Chinese officials have borrowed from other models, like Singapore, whose leaders have allowed economic prosperity and elections, but have kept strong political controls in place. 
 Mr. Bush never mentions Singapore's experience in his text, though he excoriates Myanmar -- which he refers to by its former name, Burma -- and North Korea for harshly repressing their people.
 ''Fifteen years ago the Burmese people cast their ballots, and they chose democracy,'' Mr. Bush's text read. ''The government responded by jailing the leader of the pro-democracy majority,'' a reference to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and has lived under house arrest for 14 of the last 15 years. ''The result is that a country rich in human talent and natural resources is a place where millions struggle simply to stay alive.''
 In his discussion of North Korea, Mr. Bush makes only the briefest reference to the country's ''pursuit of nuclear weapons,'' following the administration's apparent policy of not publicly acknowledging the North's claim that it already has several weapons, and the C.I.A.'s estimate that it has produced the fuel for six or more during Mr. Bush's presidency. 
 Instead, he said, ''we will not forget the people of North Korea,'' declaring that the ''21st century will be freedom's century for all Koreans.'' 
 The text of Mr. Bush's speech was notable in part for what it omitted: He did not repeat his past characterization of Kim Jong Il, the North's leader, as a tyrant, and he made no reference to the administration's quiet effort throughout Asia to cut off the North's main sources of revenue, counterfeit currency, drugs and the sale of weaponry. 
 That appeared to be an effort not to rile South Korea, where Mr. Bush is scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening and which has adopted a different approach to the North, increasing its aid and investment in the country even as Washington is trying to cut off the North's income.
 The president's characterization of China is being closely scrutinized on this trip because it may reflect the outcome of a long-festering internal debate in Washington. At issue is how the United States should treat President Hu Jintao's claims that China's ambition is simply for a ''peaceful rise'' to superpower status.
 In June, speaking in Singapore, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld challenged China's description of its own intentions, declaring that no ''candid discussion of China'' could neglect to address what he charged was a huge military buildup that China has refused to talk about publicly.
 A later Defense Department report detailed China's missile buildup opposite Taiwan, and its rapid modernization of its comparatively small but effective nuclear arsenal. 
 But Mr. Rumsfeld was more circumspect during a recent visit to China, when he was allowed to tour some military facilities. And Mr. Bush, in his prepared remarks, did not use the words ''strategic competitor'' to describe China, a phrase he often reached for during his 2000 presidential campaign and in the early days of his first term. 
 ''This is delicate for the president,'' one of Mr. Bush's senior aides said in Washington last week. ''He's been disappointed with the pace the Hu government has been setting -- and he needs to find the right way to spur him.'' 
 It is a measure of how much has changed in American perceptions of power in Asia that Mr. Bush spent so much of his time in Kyoto discussing China -- a country whose rapid rise has become a preoccupation of the Japanese. Fifteen years ago, when Mr. Bush's father visited Japan, it was Tokyo's own rise that was paramount. On Wednesday, basking in his friendship with Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Bush barely mentioned trade differences with Japan, like disputes over the import of foreign beef or the opening of the agricultural market, a key element of the negotiations over a new global trade accord. 
 Instead, Mr. Bush fell back on lines now familiar from his past speeches, talking about how during World War II ''my father and a Japanese official named Koizumi were on opposite sides,'' and now the son of that official ''is one of my best friends in the international community.'' 
 He also made no public mention of Japan's recent renewal of tensions with China. It was unlikely, officials said, that Mr. Bush would raise Mr. Koizumi's recent decision to go to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the spirits of Japan's war dead are honored, angering the Chinese. As a result, Mr. Koizumi appears unlikely to meet with Mr. Hu at the summit meeting in South Korea that opens Thursday.

HEADLINE: Northrop Grumman Seeks $2 Billion to Fix Shipyards Hit by Hurricane 

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: PASCAGOULA, Miss. 

 BODY:
The destruction is everywhere at the Northrop Grumman shipyards here. Buildings look forlorn, with walls missing and soggy insulation dangling from rafters. Even the destroyer Kidd has a hole in its side. 
 But as the cleanup begins, Northrop will have a much easier time than most other Hurricane Katrina victims, at least financially. Unlike many small businesses and families that may never fully recover from the storm, Northrop -- through a combination of insurance and, most important, support from the Pentagon -- is likely to end up having to pay little, if anything at all, from its own coffers to repair the damage.
 The Navy is asking for $2 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, saying in a memo that it wants to restore Northrop's three Gulf Coast yards, where most of the Navy's surface ships are built, to their pre-Katrina ''capacity and profit opportunities.'' 
 Most of this $2 billion would be used to rewrite Northrop's usual contracts with the Navy to shift the full burden of hurricane-related cost overruns and shipbuilding delays from Northrop to the government. 
 On top of that, Northrop said it expected to get $1 billion from its insurers to repair damaged buildings, despite a nasty battle with one company that has ended up in court. 
 Shipyard delays, the Navy argues, only increase the cost of the ships, which already carry billion-dollar price tags. And because Northrop is the region's largest employer, with about 18,000 workers, the sooner it returns to full speed, the stronger the local economy will be, both the Navy and Northrop say. 
 But several Pentagon budget watchers questioned the government's priorities, pointing out that the amount of FEMA money that would go to Northrop would be nearly equal to the amount the administration is seeking to repair housing. 
 ''A lot of people need a lot of money now that Katrina has devastated so many communities,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a group that analyzes government spending. ''Should it be the taxpayers' first priority to make a contractor at the shipyard whole? Money to Northrop means that it is not going to someone else who might need it.'' 
 Further, the critics question whether the Navy and Northrop are using Katrina as an excuse to gain additional funds, outside the Pentagon budget, for shipbuilding programs that are notorious for cost overruns. 
 And $2 billion, these critics say, is suspiciously high for shipbuilding delays expected to take months, not years, and for a work force that is mostly busy again. 
 ''These numbers sound astoundingly high,'' said Winslow T. Wheeler, a former Republican staff member who analyzed the Pentagon budget for the Senate Budget Committee and is now at the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group often critical of military spending priorities. 
 ''What the Navy is asking for desperately needs to be audited,'' he added. ''Maybe some other cost overruns are getting laundered here.'' 
 The Navy says it is closely monitoring the expenses. And Philip A. Teel, president of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, which has its headquarters here, vigorously defended the proposed federal aid, arguing that Northrop should not shoulder the extraordinary costs of the hurricane without government help.
 ''The hurricane comes and it has significant impacts, outside of our control, in terms of our ability to complete contracts and our ability to earn a modicum of profit,'' he said. ''Our belief is that the cost of Katrina on the ships should be a cost the Navy pays for.''
 Under ''fixed price incentive'' contracts between the Navy and Northrop, cost overruns on many of the 11 destroyers and amphibious ships under construction in Northrop yards would normally be split 50-50. Under the Navy proposal, FEMA would pick up Northrop's half.
 ''It's our opinion that if we act now, we can mitigate future costs that would be caused by a slippage in the schedule,'' said Capt. Thomas Van Leunen, a Navy spokesman.
 ''The numbers being put together are from the Navy and not Northrop Grumman,'' he added. ''We want to make sure there is a clear-cut separation between Katrina effects and damage and possible cost overruns at the shipyard unrelated to Katrina. The money will only be used for legitimate costs to the government to assist in restoring the shipyards and re-employing the work force.'' 
 The $2 billion is contained in President Bush's Oct. 28 request to Congress that $17.1 billion of FEMA funds be reallocated to other agencies for Katrina relief. 
 The Northrop portion is part of a $6.6 billion request for the Pentagon; the rest will pay for National Guard reservists pressed into duty after Katrina and for repairs to military bases in the area. By comparison, the president asked for $2.2 billion for housing recovery and $2.4 billion for rebuilding roads and repairing airport damage. 
 If the $2 billion request for Northrop is approved, the Navy has said it will later ask for an additional $800 million. Without FEMA money, either Northrop would have to cover more of the cost or the Navy would have to dip into its own budget. 
 Northrop has gone a long way toward restoring the shipyard in Pascagoula, commonly called the Ingalls yard, as well as a nearby yard in Gulfport that makes composite pieces for the Navy's next-generation destroyer. The company has a third yard, Avondale, in New Orleans, that was protected by strong levees and suffered little damage. 
 The 800-acre Ingalls yard dates to the 1930's, and has long benefited from the political protection of Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican whose father once worked there; Mr. Lott's waterfront house -- now flattened by Katrina -- was just outside the yard. 
 Nearly the entire work force is back, some restoring the yard and others building ships. But scars of the storm remain everywhere. Old warehouses on the Ingalls East Bank operation are standing skeletons. Lathes, drills, presses and other equipment are stacked in piles, awaiting removal. 
 At the bigger West Bank side, work has resumed, but at a slower pace than normal. An underground electrical grid is being retooled. Generators continue to work as power is restored. A pipe fabrication shop that was under four feet of water at one time now has a work force of 50 rather than the normal 220. 
 Most damage was done not to the ships, but to costly material on the ground. The ships themselves were held in place during the storm with superstrong ropes that secured them to massive posts in the docks known as hurricane bollards.
 Right after the storm, Northrop's biggest concern was getting its employees back on their feet. It provided gasoline when there was none at the pump. It helped find housing and wired money when cash machines failed. A dockside berthing ship provides bunk beds for workers, and Northrop is providing 140 trailers for employees, their families and local residents. 
 Tales of hurricane heroics also abound, like the 72-year-old guard at the Gulfport yard who stayed at his post, along with his 92-year-old mother, and who finally had to float his mother on a sheet of composite board to a second-story refuge. 
 Almost immediately after the storm hit, Northrop began talking to the two entities that could help it: its insurers, for the damage to Northrop-owned property at the yards, and the government, for everything else.
 On the insurance front, Northrop has had mixed success. Of $1 billion in estimated physical damage to Northrop property, insurers quickly agreed to pay $500 million in claims. The company carried policies for wind and flood damage to physical property, as well as business-interruption insurance to protect its earnings. 
 But one insurance company, FM Global, based in Johnston, R.I., is balking because it contends its policy covers only wind, not flood, damage. That action is holding up payment on the remaining $500 million. Northrop sued FM Global on Nov. 4, calling the insurer's actions despicable and accusing it of fraud. 
 In a statement, FM Global said it was ''surprised and disappointed by the suit, but we're confident in our position because we believe our policy language is clear.'' 
 While Northrop predicts that it will prevail with its insurers, it has had an easier time with the Navy. 
 In a conference call on Oct. 10 with Wall Street analysts, Northrop said it had been negotiating with the Pentagon for ''contractual relief'' over delays that stood to cost the company 40 cents a share in full-year results. 
 The chief financial officer, Wesley G. Bush, told the analysts that the company had met with the Pentagon and that the ''leadership in the Department of Defense has been understanding'' of ''the need to mitigate the effect of extraordinary hurricane costs.'' 
 But critics have questioned some of the Navy's assumptions in its request.
 For instance, the Navy estimates that it will take six months for the yard to return to pre-Katrina output -- three months of downtime followed by a three-month ramp-up period. Yet the shipyards restarted some production within weeks. 
 ''We shouldn't be holding Northrop entirely harmless and have the government make good for anything it did not have insurance for,'' said Steve Ellis, a military analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that opposes what it considers wasteful federal spending. 
 ''There is risk in any contractual endeavor, and this is ensuring that Northrop never loses,'' he added. ''Since the government is opening up the wallet after Katrina, they thought, 'Let's go after it.' '' 
 Congress has not yet acted on the White House request, but Northrop cannot fathom a defeat. 
 ''That would be a bad outcome,'' said Mr. Teel of Northrop. ''I can't self-fund an impact this size. The Navy would have to find money from other programs, or the programs would not get done. My belief is that Congress does understand the scope and magnitude of this and will act.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Battles Lethargy As G.M. Hits 14-Year Low 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed after an erratic session yesterday as General Motors hit a 14-year low, dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. Rising oil prices also dulled investor enthusiasm. 
 G.M. fell $1.32, or almost 6 percent, to $21.29, as concerns mounted about problems at its top supplier, Delphi. Leaders of the United Automobile Workers said the union and Delphi remained far apart on a new labor agreement and investors were concerned about a possible strike.
 Broader economic news was more upbeat. The Labor Department reported that consumer prices edged up just 0.2 percent in October, the best showing in four months. In September, consumer prices soared 1.2 percent on record energy prices. 
 Oil futures settled at $57.88 a barrel, up 90 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after reaching a four-month low Tuesday. Yesterday's government petroleum inventory numbers were weaker than expected.
 Expiring options also spurred selling. ''We did get surprising oil inventory data, but it's still below that $60 range,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist, senior vice president and market analyst at S. W. Bach & Company. ''The market is running against options expirations, which are causing technical difficulty.''
 The Dow fell 11.68 points, or 0.11 percent, to 10,674.76. Broader stock indicators were barely higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.20 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,231.21, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.19, or 0.05 percent, to 2,187.93.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.59, or 0.24 percent, to 654.64.
 Bonds rose sharply with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 22/32, to 100 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.47 percent from 4.56 percent late Tuesday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies in European trading. Gold prices were higher.
 Trading was light, and some analysts said last week's strong advances came in anticipation of yesterday's inflation numbers, leaving little to trade on during the day's session.
 ''It's really a trendless market,'' said Rob Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass.
 American Express, a Dow component, fell 85 cents, to $50.08, after its chief executive said several analysts were overestimating the company's fourth-quarter profits based on incorrect assumptions about marketing plans, write-offs and the spinoff of its brokerage operation.
 Caterpillar, also a Dow stock, rose 83 cents, to $56.73, after J. P.Morgan Chase said its global machine sales continued to be strong in October.
 Too, a clothing retailer aimed at girls age 7 to 14, rose $1.73, to $31.48, after its third-quarter profit climbed 40 percent, which it attributed to higher sales and improved merchandise margin. It also forecast fourth-quarter earnings above Wall Street's target.
 Declining issues led advancers by roughly 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 1.59 billion shares, down from 1.69 billion Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Looks to Sum Itself Up in Just Six Words 

BYLINE: By Julie Bosman

 BODY:
WHEN slogans for cities work, they really work. There's the world-famous ''I Love New York,'' which dates back to 1977, and Las Vegas's more recent: ''What Happens Here, Stays Here.''
 Then there is Atlanta's new slogan, unveiled by the city's marketing arm last week: ''Every Day Is an Opening Day.'' 
 Huh?
It is the latest of many taglines that Atlanta has cycled through over the years, from ''The City Too Busy to Hate,'' in the 1960's, to ''Atlanta: People Seem to Like It Here.'' 
 The city spent $8 million on the new campaign, which includes an advertising program created by Grey Worldwide in Atlanta that city officials hope will bolster tourism. 
 The slogan is meant to convey the robust growth Atlanta has experienced over the last decade, as well as the attractions the city plans to open in the next few years. Next week, the $200 million Georgia Aquarium will open, billed as the largest in the world. The High Museum of Art recently completed a $178 million addition. And the nation's first Olympics museum is due in the city next summer.
 ''The basis for the line is, if you start with the amount of new development and the building of new attractions that's taking place in Atlanta right now, it's incredibly high,'' said Joel Babbit, the president and chief creative officer for Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group division of the WPP Group. ''You literally have things opening up constantly.''
 But so far, ''Every Day Is an Opening Day'' has been met with confusion. 
 ''I have no idea what it means,'' said Laura Ries, the president of Ries & Ries, a marketing strategy firm outside Atlanta. ''The main problem with most destination slogans is that they generally don't say anything and try to encompass too many things, and this is just another example of that.''
 Bob Hope, the president of Hope-Beckham, a public relations firm in Atlanta, said the challenge was trying to please different constituencies, like the tourism bureau, economic development groups and educational groups.
 ''It's hard to come up with a simple definition of who you are,'' Mr. Hope said. ''Right now, I don't think there are many common bonds across the board for the four and a half million people who live here.''
 For the advertising agency, building a consensus is difficult, at best. ''Everybody in the city has a different opinion, and I've heard every one of them,'' said Mr. Babbit of Grey Worldwide.
 Choosing a slogan is simpler in a city like Las Vegas, where there is one main objective: promote the gambling industry. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority spent $65 million this year on advertising and will spend $80 million next year on a campaign of television commercials, print ads and Web site ads produced by R & R Partners in Las Vegas.
 ''Sometimes people go the easy way and come up with things that are safe and uncontroversial,'' said Terry Jicinsky, the senior vice president for marketing at the authority. ''And the end result is that many times, that doesn't connect with the consumer.''
 For every hit like ''Virginia Is for Lovers,'' there is a dud like ''San Diego Feels Good All Over.'' In New Jersey recently, a New York branding consultant that was paid $260,000 to create a slogan came up with ''New Jersey: We'll Win You Over.'' Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey swiftly killed the proposal last month and set up a Web site to solicit alternative ideas from New Jersey residents. 
 When Mayor Bloomberg's marketing office moved to trademark the phrase ''The World's Second Home'' for New York City this year, the tagline was met with a heap of scorn from the public and hasn't been mentioned much since. 
 Even smart, catchy slogans are tough to sell to the public. Ken Bernhardt, a marketing professor at Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University who worked on the Brand Atlanta planning committee, said he was prepared for the challenge. ''People generally hate slogans when they come out,'' he said. ''Part of it is because the slogan by itself is hard to interpret in comparison to the rest of the message. And people tend to become comfortable with slogans over time.''
 One nickname that many Atlantans have already become comfortable with is ''Hotlanta,'' which refers to both the Southern climate and the city's recent prosperity. Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta, even incorporated the nickname into advertising on billboards that read ''Welcome to Coldlanta.''
 But for the planning committee, using Hotlanta had a big negative. ''Why remind people who are considering coming to Atlanta in July and August that it's hot here?'' Mr. Bernhardt asked.
 And sometimes a city's most famous modern attribute is not something its planners want to highlight. 
 ''You can't say, 'We've got the biggest airport in the world' as a slogan,'' Mr. Hope said.

HEADLINE: Mexican Court Says Sex Attack By a Husband Is Still a Rape

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and GINGER THOMPSON; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City for this article, and Ginger Thompson from Guatemala City.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court of Mexico ruled Wednesday that rape within marriage is a crime, bringing Mexico's laws into line with much of the world and removing one of the many obstacles women here face in reporting rape. 
 The ruling ended a legal battle waged since 1994, when a majority of the justices agreed that because the purpose of marriage was procreation, forced sexual relations by a spouse was not rape but ''an undue exercise of conjugal rights.''
The unanimous ruling on Wednesday said the earlier decision had denied women the right to exercise their sexual freedom and was based on an interpretation of rights relating to property, not human beings. The court stated clearly that forced sexual relations within marriage -- whether the force is physical or psychological -- was a crime. 
 ''What's behind this is a modern conception of the relationship between a man and a woman in marriage,'' said Jose de Jesus Gudino Pelayo, a justice of the Supreme Court. ''It's a relationship of equality in which a woman does not lose her sexual freedom when she marries.'' 
 That the decision came with so little debate suggested that attitudes in this macho country are changing, albeit slowly. But many women's advocates agreed that while the ruling was a landmark step, polls on social attitudes have shown that deep-rooted opinions that women should be subservient still hold sway over much of society.
 They warned that entrenched attitudes still made it very difficult for women to report rape. 
 A United Nations study found that 9 of 10 sexual assaults go unreported in Mexico and that 18 percent of victims of sexual assault were not aware that it was a crime. 
 ''A recent government survey found that 47 percent of all women report being the victims of either physical, emotional, sexual or economic violence.'' said Patricia Espinosa, the director of the National Institute of Women. ''But 84 percent of those who are victims of domestic violence remain silent.'' 
 The 1994 ruling by the Supreme Court effectively meant that husbands who raped their wives could walk free under most conditions. It was a retreat from earlier laws on rape, which did not specify anything about the relationship between the rapist and his victim. 
 The decision left women ''defenseless'' and ''consisted of a serious and systematic violation of women's human rights,'' said Patricia Olamendi, who has worked to change the precedent and pass state laws overturning it. ''The court should recognize that it has violated these rights for 11 years.'' 
 Only a few countries in the world do not recognize rape within marriage as a crime; India and Malaysia are the two most prominent examples. But the change in laws is relatively recent. In the United States, it was not a crime in all states until 1993.

HEADLINE: Milestone Approaches in Bid to Restore the Great Plains 

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: MALTA, Mont. 

 BODY:
''Got to feed my buffies,'' Bill Willcutt, a black silk kerchief tied around his neck, says as he jockeys a pickup truck into place behind a large, round bale of hay. 
 Two metal arms swing down and pick up the roll and drop it in front of 16 bison in a pen made of hay bales.
Mr. Willcutt is no ordinary rancher. He manages more than 31,000 acres here in the heart of Phillips County, one of the most remote counties in the continental United States. 
 He has been entrusted with the bison, which are seed stock for the start of a restoration project by the American Prairie Foundation, which owns 11,000 acres and leases 20,000 more. 
 On Nov. 17, the bison will be turned out of their pen onto the dun-colored prairie in the middle of their ancestral home. 
 The foundation's project is one of several major independent efforts under way across the West intended to re-create North America's ancient prairie. The players include the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund and Ted Turner, the media mogul, who owns a large bison herd. 
 Several factors have contributed to a movement to restore the Great Plains, an ecological phenomenon called mixed-grass prairie that stretches from southern Canada to the Sandhills of Nebraska. 
 ''It has the most breadth, depth and diversity of fauna than anywhere on the High Plains,'' said Sean Gerrity, the executive director of the American Prairie Foundation. 
 Birds are especially diverse, with rare grassland species like the greater sage grouse and Sprague's tippet found in abundance.
 The notion of restoring the prairie to the days of the early 19th century -- with large herds of free-roaming bison and other recovered species and an ecotourism economy based on the viewing and hunting of wildlife -- was broached in 1987 by two professors, Frank Popper at Rutgers, and his wife, Deborah Popper, who teaches at the City University of New York. 
 A paper the couple wrote, ''The Great Plains: From Dust to Dust,'' described the region from the Canadian border to Texas as the United States's steppe. Their intent was to encourage new ways of thinking about the prairie beyond traditional agriculture, but many prairie residents believed that the Poppers were advocating the forcible depopulation of the area. 
 The Poppers, who were denounced and threatened, said they were surprised by the intensity of the response. 
 But the times have changed. The population has been falling in north-central Montana, which was settled by homesteaders lured west by the railroad and the promise of free land. 
 As small farms fail and are absorbed by larger ones, people blow away like tumbleweeds.
 November is a pallet of browns and gray in Phillips County, one of the least populated areas in the United States. In 1898, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared that a place was no longer part of the frontier if it had more than two people per square mile. 
 Phillips County has less than one person per square mile, and half of them live in Malta, population about 2,000. 
 At times beautiful, the country is also harsh. The foundation's ranch is an hour's drive from Malta, which is about 35 miles from the Canadian border, and if it rains, the roads become an impassable muddy gumbo. 
 The population of Phillips County peaked at 9,300, in 1920, and has fallen in every census since. It was 4,600 in 2000, and many who remain are elderly. The pattern is similar across much of the Great Plains, where federal subsidies provide life support for the agricultural economy. 
 An organization that has criticized the subsidies, the Environmental Working Group, said the United States Department of Agriculture has reported subsidies of $110 million paid to about 1,000 farmers and ranchers in Phillips County over the past 10 years. 
 But instead of attacking the idea of restoring the prairie, some former opponents of the concept, like J. Michael Hayden, the former Kansas governor who is now the state's secretary of wildlife and parks, are saying it may have merit as an alternative to the declining agricultural economy. 
 ''I had to eat crow,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''They made a bunch of predictions about out-migration from the Great Plains, and they came true.'' 
 Still, there are opponents. 
 ''I'm not thrilled,'' said Kenny Blunt, a Malta real estate agent and rancher. ''When you remove cattle and put on bison not a whole lot of anything is going to happen. Bison won't come close to creating the economic engine cattle create.'' 
 Many ranchers worry that the bison will escape and knock down their fences or damage their pastures. 
 But a lack of organized opposition indicates a change in attitude, especially if tourism were to take root. 
 ''It's all part of a recreation economy,'' said Marty Lundstrom, assistant manager of Northern Agrifeeds, which supplied nine miles of electric fence for the American Prairie Foundation's ranch. 
 ''They stay in the hotels, eat at the restaurants, shop at the clothing stores,'' Mr. Lundstrom said of tourists. ''Anything that brings people to Phillips County is good for the economy. We just don't know how much it's going to help.''
 The American Prairie Foundation paid from $110 an acre for native prairie to $600 for irrigated hay meadows. Its ranch is just a sliver of the proposed restoration project. 
 With the 1.1-million-acre Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, the 700,000-acre Missouri River Breaks National Monument and thousands of acres of land managed by the federal government, the foundation is hoping to create a refuge larger than Yellowstone National Park. 
 The organization has been careful in presenting its proposal. It has held meetings to explain its plans and does business in Malta when it can. It has restored a one-room log schoolhouse with a sod roof and brought former students back for a reunion. 
 The ranch, whose only full-time occupant is Mr. Willcutt, has brought new people to this isolated region. Mr. Gerrity, the foundation's executive director, said about 200 people had already come to watch birds and work at the ranch, which will be open to the public. 
 Last year, 50 people attended a concert by the Boston Muir String Quartet of the Boston University School of Music that was held in a large tent on the ranch, a first, it is safe to say, for Phillips County. 
 But Curtis Starr, the editor of The Philips County News, a weekly with a circulation of 2,600, said the community had doubts. 
 ''There's still a great deal of skepticism,'' Mr. Starr said. ''We take with a grain of salt the fact that buffalo are the future and are going to save our county.''

HEADLINE: What Palestinians?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

 BODY:
The swallows fly to Capistrano; I go to the Middle East. 
 Every few years I fly to Israel and Palestine and I get out my notebooks, and every time I go the experience is the same. Some world leader will have proposed a peace plan. Some set of lines on a map will be debated. Some elaborate procedure to get both sides to the table will be in the process of being hammered out.
 Over the years, the Shultz plan begat the Oslo process, which begat the Mitchell plan, which begat the road map. Even though the names may change, the grievances are the same, the intensity is the same, and the addictive three-dimensional chess game we call the Middle East peace process is fundamentally the same. 
 Until this year.
 I just got back from a Saban Center conference that took me once again to Jerusalem and Ramallah, and I discovered the most amazing thing: the Israelis have lost interest in the chess match. They have become desensitized to the thoughts and actions of their dysfunctional neighbors, the Palestinians, with whom they used to share such an intimate feud. 
 The second intifada, coming on the heels of Yasir Arafat's rejection of a deal at Camp David, cut some visceral bond that used to join the two peoples. The Israelis are separating themselves from the Middle East emotionally and psychologically, and with a security barrier. 
 The dream of peace has been replaced by another dream, the dream of disengagement. Until I spoke to people here, I thought the Gaza disengagement might lead back to the peace process, but now I realize it's a replacement for that process. It's a step toward a new (and even more illusory) dream: the dream of disengaging Israel from its geographic and historical situation.
 The security barrier has not only reduced suicide bombings; it has also helped change the nation's psychology. On the Israeli side of the barrier, there is increasing safety, prosperity and normalcy. Jerusalem's streets are crowded again. People no longer choose restaurants by how good their security arrangements are and no longer avoid tables by the windows.
 While the barrier makes the Palestinians seem farther away, the Internet makes the rest of the world seem closer at hand. Israel is in the midst of a tech boom, fueled in part by the brainpower of Russian immigrants, and the nation is proud of its ties to Silicon Valley. The economy is thriving (even while income inequality soars), and Israel is developing closer bonds with China, Turkey and the world.
 Over there, on the other side of the barrier, Mahmoud Abbas, a new sort of Palestinian leader, promises to impose order and defeat terror. But Israelis don't seem to feel their destiny is intertwined with his success, and they have not helped him deliver the tangible benefits he needs to have any chance of victory.
 Israelis have, as I say, disengaged.
 Given recent history, no one can blame Israel. The Palestinians richly deserve to be left behind. Even now they expect Israel to allow Palestinian trucks to cross its border, even though both sides know some significant portion will contain bombs designed to kill Jews.
 And yet, despite it all, I wonder whether the Israelis know in their hearts that disengagement is not a long-term option. 
 It's not an option because while Israelis may no longer be dependent on the Palestinians, the Palestinians remain dependent on them. Today, Gaza is spiraling into the abyss, cut off from Israeli markets and abandoned by the Arab world. When Gaza sinks, the West Bank will surely follow, and if Palestine turns into Somalia, Israel will not survive untouched. The Israeli Arabs, if no one else, will see to that.
 Disengagement is not an option because America will not allow it. Americans still believe in the peace process and in democratizing the Arab world, which is the opposite of disengagement. The U.S. will always pressure Israel -- as it did so forcefully this week -- to re-engage with Palestine, to open up trade and movement.
 Finally, unilateral disengagement is no option because the Israelis will never do it well. Driven by normal self-interest and by the bitterness of war, Israelis will grab too much land, and impose too much pain. A nation of philosopher-kings could impose a just unilateral solution, but no such nation exists. Unilateral action is bound to be unjust and thus unstable.
 The sad fact is that no matter how long and futile the chess game sometimes appeared, someday it will have to start up once again.

HEADLINE: American Ingenuity, Irish Residence

 BODY:
The newest expatriates aren't people. They're ideas, and we can't afford to watch them go. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Microsoft had trimmed more than $500 million from its annual tax bill by putting a small subsidiary in Dublin in charge of $16 billion in assets. The game is simple: a company sends intellectual property to a tax-haven country like Ireland and keeps the tax difference on the money it earns. 
 The world is used to seeing manufacturing businesses move to countries where labor is cheaper, like Mexico or China. But profits from software created and designed at Microsoft's headquarters, in Redmond, Wash., should be taxed in America, not Ireland. Unfortunately, outsourcing is extending itself to taxes, in large part because the United States Congress has given businesses the loopholes to do it. That means that America's greatest asset -- its intellectual property -- could be sent offshore to reduce corporate tax burdens.
Microsoft's subsidiary is raking in the dough from licensing fees for copyrighted software, much of it originating in the United States. And what is the subsidiary's legal address? A Dublin law firm that advertises its smarts in turning Ireland into a tax shelter.
 Microsoft's response is that it pays all taxes required by law. Worldwide, that came to more than $4 billion for the company's last fiscal year. Tax avoidance is a gray area, and exploiting the cracks in the system isn't a crime. But the resulting damage, in terms of bigger budget deficits at home, sure makes it feel as if something is wrong. 
 Microsoft isn't alone. A host of American tech companies have set up shop overseas, both for business and tax purposes. And as for the destinations, they're more than just Ireland; Singapore, for example, also attracts businesses with low corporate rates. But one of Ireland's advantages for tax dodging over, say, Bermuda, is its plausibility as a home for genuine investment because it is a place where foreign corporations have built and staffed offices and plants. Microsoft has 1,100 full-time employees in Ireland, for example, compared with 40,000 in the United States. 
 That means, in a particularly hard-to-swallow twist, that the tax havens encourage companies to send increasingly large chunks of their businesses offshore as well. By pushing more of their jobs and investments overseas, the companies make the tax havens seem more legitimate.
 American companies' successful hunt for low-tax opportunities overseas has been used as an argument for slashing corporate taxes at home. Maybe we should close the loopholes first, and provide the Treasury Department with the resources it needs to enforce existing law. After that, it's clear that meaningful corporate tax reform is needed. For an economy increasingly based on products with little physical substance -- drug recipes, images, sounds, strings of ones and zeroes -- it wouldn't take long to lose it all.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Backs Nominee For Fed Chief

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee approved on Wednesday the nomination of Ben S. Bernanke to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirming vote. 
 The panel backed Mr. Bernanke, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, on a voice vote, with just one committee member in opposition.
 ''Ben Bernanke has the potential to follow in the footsteps of the giants like Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, referring to the current Fed chief and his predecessor. ''The near unanimous vote in the committee shows the broad, bipartisan support he has.'' 
 The nomination now faces a vote in the full Senate, which must grant its approval in order for Mr. Bernanke to take over as chairman after Mr. Greenspan departs the Fed on Jan. 31. 
 Mr. Bernanke, a onetime academic, is expected to win easy confirmation, but Senate aides have said a final vote may not come until next year. 
 Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a longtime critic of the Greenspan Fed, was the only committee member to oppose Mr. Bernanke, who had served on the central bank's board for nearly three years before taking the White House job in June. 
 Mr. Bunning, a Republican, said he was concerned that the nominee, who always voted with Mr. Greenspan, had failed to establish his independence. 
 Mr. Bernanke, 51, is considered one of the nation's pre-eminent monetary economists and an advocate of greater central bank transparency. 
 At a hearing on his nomination Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke told the banking committee that ''continuity'' with the Greenspan Fed would be a priority. 
 He made clear, however, he still thought the central bank should lay out a numerical objective for acceptable inflation, arguing this would help anchor inflation expectations and make it easier to keep inflation contained.

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN candidates hoping to make illegal immigration a central issue in next year's Congressional elections and the 2008 presidential race should consider the results of the Virginia governor's contest. 
 The Republican candidate, Jerry Kilgore, tried to tap into sentiment against illegal aliens by running advertisements that featured grainy video of border arrests and Hispanic men waiting in line while an announcer accused his Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, of favoring ''taxpayer benefits for illegal immigrants.'' In the last weeks of the race, Mr. Kilgore regularly worked the theme into his campaign speeches, especially in Northern Virginia, home to most of the state's immigrant population, legal and illegal.
But on Election Day, immigration failed to galvanize voters, and Mr. Kilgore lost by six percentage points, coming up short even in reliably conservative areas like Loudoun County, where I live. No doubt other missteps, including harshly negative ads on his opponent's position on the death penalty, contributed to Mr. Kilgore's defeat. But clearly, immigrant bashing can cut both ways in an election. 
 Northern Virginia is home to about 200,000 illegal aliens. Jobs are plentiful, many of them good-paying ones in construction. Statewide unemployment is at 3.5 percent, lower than the 5 percent national average; but Northern Virginia is even lower at 2.5 percent. Legal immigrants in the area outnumber illegal ones by more than 2 to 1 (about the same proportion as they do nationally), but both groups have helped transform the region's economy into one of the most robust in the nation.
 Nationally, illegal immigrant males actually have higher labor force participation rates -- 92 percent -- than other groups (83 percent for native-born men and 82 percent for immigrant men overall). And they make up an increasingly large share of certain occupations. A survey last summer by the Pew Hispanic Center found that about a quarter of all drywall and ceiling tile installers in the United States are illegal aliens, a statistic confirmed by a visit to almost any construction site in the Virginia suburbs. 
 If these immigrant workers were to disappear tomorrow -- as so many politicians and conservative talk-show hosts seem to desire -- it would have a drastic and unwelcome effect on the economy here and around the country. Not only do these workers fill necessary jobs in a tight labor market, but they spend their wages largely in the communities in which they live and work, and most contribute their share of taxes as well (employers generally withhold from paychecks in these industries). 
 Unfortunately, buoyed by polls showing that most Americans (69 percent in a survey last year) say that they are concerned about illegal immigration, some Republicans are hoping to ride the issue into the White House. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, the leader of the virtually all-Republican immigration reform caucus in the House, is spending time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in anticipation of a possible presidential campaign. (Mr. Tancredo caused even some immigration hard-liners to wince when he tried to have a high school honors student and his family deported after a newspaper article about the boy noted that he entered the country illegally at age 12.) 
 The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, also eyeing a presidential run, has e-mailed his supporters asking them to post messages on his Web site ''showing support for a tough border bill.'' The National Republican Senatorial Committee contacted one million Republican voters asking them to respond to a survey on immigration that asked ''where loyal Republicans like you stand on this critical issue.'' And there is even discussion among House Republicans to revoke the laws giving citizenship to children born in America to illegal-immigrant parents.
 Yet most polls show that illegal immigration is way down on the list of concerns motivating most voters, and Republicans may be confusing the intensity of the small number of people for whom it is a top priority -- usually about 10 percent of voters -- with its overall appeal as an election issue.
 None of this is to suggest that the status quo -- some 11 million illegal aliens residing in the United States and more coming every day -- is desirable. Border security is an important issue; indeed, it is too important for demagoguery. A terrorist or drug smuggler can just as easily cross a porous border as can a father hoping to support his family back home. 
 The best way to intercept the jihadists and criminals, however, would be to give hard-working laborers a realistic opportunity to come here legally -- by enacting a more generous legal immigration law with a guest-worker option. Ideally, such a program would allow illegal aliens already here to participate after paying a fine and demonstrating that they have paid taxes and are gainfully employed. 
 Three Republican senators from border states -- John McCain and Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas -- have introduced bills that address these issues in various promising ways; and President Bush has outlined a similar, if somewhat vaguer, proposal. A poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government last year showed that about 58 percent of Republican respondents supported a guest worker program. 
 Republican leaders have two choices: continue with the hard-line rhetoric that may or may not help at the polls, or enact market-based immigration reform that will give a chance to those willing to work hard for a better America.

HEADLINE: Kansas City Will Stage Super Bowl, With One If

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 16 

 BODY:
In a move that surprised even the Chiefs, the National Football League awarded a Super Bowl to Kansas City on Wednesday. The decision was contingent on significant improvements being made to Arrowhead Stadium, including the addition of a rolling roof. 
 Kansas City is likely to be the host for Super Bowl XLIX or LI, in 2015 or 2017, as a way to honor the 50th anniversary of the Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt's leadership role in the N.F.L. It would be just the fourth cold-weather game in Super Bowl history, including the February 2006 game in Detroit. Super Bowl XXVI was in Minneapolis, and Super Bowl XVI was in Pontiac, Mich. 
The proposed rolling roof would provide weather protection for the Super Bowl but allow open-air games in the regular season. 
 ''Happy day for us and happy day for Kansas City,'' Hunt said, ''and I think it will lead to some great things as far as the total renovation of the sports complex. We think it's an exceptional opportunity for mid-America, for Jackson County and this community.''
 The N.F.L. is again dipping its toe into a local debate over stadium development, as it did when it awarded a conditional Super Bowl to New York, contingent on the Jets' building a stadium on Manhattan's West Side. When the Jets failed to win approval for the stadium earlier this year, the game was awarded to Miami.
 The Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals are negotiating with Jackson County for about $465 million in public money for improvements and expansion of Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums, according to The Kansas City Star. The roof addition, which could also be used to cover neighboring Kauffman, could add as much as $200 million to the cost of the renovations. 
 A lease negotiated in 1990 stipulated that the two stadiums would be maintained in state-of-the-art condition, with no caps on expenditures. But the teams currently receive only $8.5 million annually in city, county and state money -- far below what is needed to maintain the complex. The Chiefs had proposed about $312 million in renovations for Arrowhead alone, The Star reported, with the team contributing at least $50 million -- but that was before the roof. The N.F.L. would help the Chiefs finance a portion of the renovation through a program that offers low-interest loans for stadium work.
 Local voters are likely to face a referendum in April calling for a sales-tax increase of three-eighths of a cent for at least 25 years to finance most of the work. In awarding the Super Bowl, the league is clearly trying to sway that vote in the Chiefs' favor. Despite the team's popularity in the region and Hunt's standing as a beloved public figure, approval is not a given.
 Last November, a bi-state vote in Missouri and Kansas to finance stadium improvements and the arts was defeated. And a group of Kansas City business and civic leaders is exploring whether money would be better spent building a baseball stadium downtown. 
 ''It's obviously helpful for getting the renovation plan for Arrowhead,'' Jon Copaken, the executive director of the Downtown Council of Kansas City, said of the Super Bowl. The Council is leading the interest in a downtown baseball stadium. ''And whether that is the type of thing that causes people on the baseball side to look the other way at a huge economic development opportunity for the city and go ahead with the renovation plan for the other half of the package, I don't know. Our efforts are not working counter to renovations and Super Bowls at Arrowhead. Our objective is to come up with something that is successful at the ballot so both goals can be accomplished.'' 
 The rolling roof was part of the original concept for the construction of the Truman Sports Complex, which includes Arrowhead and Kauffman. But when costs for the construction ran high in the early 1970's, the idea was shelved. Now, voters will have to decide if the roof and the renovations are again too expensive. 
 The chairman of the Jackson County Sports Authority, Mike Smith, says that the promise of a Super Bowl will be enough to make a difference. ''This gives us the sizzle to put together a package for voters,'' he said.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Expands Its Surplus Estimate for the Third Time This Year, to $1.04 Billion 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
In February, it was $76 million. In July, it ballooned to $833 million. Yesterday, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced its third -- and, it hopes, final -- estimate for the size of its surplus this year: $1.044 billion.
 The wide variation in budget predictions vividly illustrates how the authority seems to lurch unpredictably between dire insolvency and sudden windfalls. 
The authority does not expect its good fortune -- soaring proceeds from real estate taxes and unusually low interest rates -- to last. It anticipates a net deficit of $152 million in 2007, rising to $934 million in 2009, and that projection assumes fare and toll increases in both years. 
 ''We have good news in this budget, but I ask the board to just continue to focus on those out years, because those deficits are substantial,'' the authority's executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, said after presenting board members with the final proposed operating budget for 2006. The board is expected to adopt the spending plan next month.
 The plan confirmed that the authority has jettisoned an idea it floated in July: using part of the surplus to build a giant platform over its West Side railyards, which it could then sell to developers for office and apartment towers.
 The plan made no mention of a proposal last month by Gov. George E. Pataki, who suggested that $250 million from the surplus be dedicated to transit projects in Lower Manhattan and to a proposed rail link to Kennedy International Airport. 
 Mr. Pataki's chief of staff, John P. Cahill, who oversees downtown redevelopment, recently called the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, to discuss the surplus, but the board has disregarded the proposal -- a rebuff, since Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Kalikow in 2001 and controls 6 of the 14 votes on the panel. 
 Mr. Kalikow declined to characterize his talks with the governor's staff, saying, ''We have a big commitment to rebuilding downtown.'' Of the airport rail link, he said, ''We'll be getting to that in due course.'' 
 He praised the state's voters for approving a $2.9 billion transportation bond measure last week. Half of the money will go to the authority, bolstering its five-year capital program for 2005 to 2009.
 ''Anybody who underestimated the intelligence or the tenacity of the voters to do what they think is best for them is making a big mistake,'' he said. ''Mass transit is a big deal down here. It's important, people want it, and they want us to expand it.'' 
 The plan outlined the use of the $700 million portion of the surplus that is seen as nonrecurring because it stemmed from the unusually high real estate taxes and low interest rates. 
 The biggest portion, $450 million, will go to reduce an unfunded pension liability, which will save the authority $42 million a year. And $100 million will finance holiday fare discounts this year and next.
 In an acknowledgment of dissatisfaction with breakdowns and delays, the authority is using $50 million of the surplus for service improvements, including better cleaning and more service on two commuter railroads. It would also include more patrols and bomb-sniffing dogs for the authority's police force. A proposal to reduce the frequency of off-peak bus service in the city is being put off until 2007. 
 The authority will also spend $100 million for security improvements, including closed-circuit television cameras in 60 subway stations and buses; locks to secure subway car seats that could be lifted to create a space for a dangerous package; and emergency-exit release devices on floor-to-ceiling turnstiles. 
 The automated turnstiles --known as high entry-and-exit turnstiles and used at entrances without a station booth -- have been criticized as dangerous because they allow riders to leave only one at a time, unlike exit gates by station booths. A release device is being tested at the Lawrence Street station, on the M and R lines in Brooklyn, a development first reported by The Daily News. 
 The budget plan also revealed that the authority has given up, for now, a plan to eliminate 71 conductors' positions on the L subway line. In June, the authority stopped using conductors on the L on weekends, but it was forced to restore them in September after an arbitrator ruled that the action violated a union contract.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Puts More Muscle Into Rebuilding

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Putting power and influence where his campaign pronouncements had been, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday named four top members of his administration and two executives to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation board, ensuring a larger role for City Hall in rebuilding the World Trade Center site.
 An hour or so later, Gov. George E. Pataki named two top members of his administration to the board, holding out the possibility of pointed monthly board meetings as the city and state pursue their sometimes competing visions for downtown. 
The naming of the new directors resembled a game of one-upmanship. Officials on both sides agreed that Charles A. Gargano, the state's top development official, was to some degree appointed as a counterbalance to Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, whose reputation for charging hard is well known in the governor's office.
 Officials on both sides said they had been in close contact concerning the appointments, and that Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Pataki were planning a private meeting today to discuss the future of the site.
 The new appointments -- representing half of the 16-member board -- would bring new life and heft to an agency whose reason for existence was called into question recently after Mr. Pataki banned the International Freedom Center from the memorial quadrant, even as the corporation was reviewing the issue.
 ''This is a true reaffirmation of the rebuilding process,'' said Stefan Pryor, the corporation president. ''We are extraordinarily grateful for the caliber of appointments that they have made.''
 For the same reason, civic organizations generally praised the choices, although Julie Menin, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan, said she was disappointed by the absence from both lists of community representatives.
 Mr. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, who now attends meetings as the mayor's representative, will become a director, as will Marc V. Shaw, the deputy mayor for operations. So will Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, and Martha E. Stark, the finance commissioner.
 Such a strong and senior bloc may shift the center of political gravity toward the city's side. But the corporation remains a state agency at heart, wholly owned by the Empire State Development Corporation and ultimately subject to the governor's control.
 Mr. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, will now join the Lower Manhattan subsidiary as a director.
 The governor chose his senior adviser for counterterrorism, James Kallstrom, to serve on the board, at a time of great concern about designing attack-resistant structures. 
 The mayor's other appointees were William C. Rudin, the chairman of the Association for a Better New York, and Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., vice chairman and president of Verizon, whose headquarters will overlook ground zero.
 The appointments marked the first major personnel move by Mr. Bloomberg since his re-election, and were in keeping with his campaign vow to play a stronger role downtown.
 He appointed some of his most trusted deputies. Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Shaw are among the handful of top officials in Mr. Bloomberg's administration, and, as one official put it, ''This is the best thing he could do short of appointing himself to the board.''
 Mr. Doctoroff's style was on display during the mayor's failed pursuit of a West Side football stadium. In recent weeks, many of Mr. Doctoroff's outside associates have said they believe he would like nothing more than to put the failure of the stadium plan behind him with some notable successes, like pushing the mayor's agenda downtown.
 Mr. Shaw is a far more low-key player. But he has spent a lifetime in government, and knows the ins and outs of Albany perhaps better than anyone in the administration. He also knows a thing or two about board rooms, having served as the executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 Ms. Burden, the city planner, is seen as the yin to Mr. Doctoroff's yang, with a more subtle approach. She also has deep ties to the cultural and civic elites, a central part of the Bloomberg constituency that was alarmed by the governor's handling of the Freedom Center.
 Ms. Stark, the finance commissioner, has a reputation as a no-nonsense numbers cruncher. But she is also known as an aggressive defender of city policy, frequently showing a combative side when questioned by City Council members during hearings.
 The mayor said his appointees would see to it that the trade center development took into account ''jobs and tourism and housing and schools and all of the things that society needs.'' His stress on housing at the site has put him at odds with Mr. Pataki.
 Mr. Gargano said he did not see himself as a counterweight to Mr. Doctoroff. He said his interest was in demolishing the former Deutsche Bank building, constructing the memorial and memorial museum and coordinating the complex infrastructure. ''I bring to the table a lot of construction experience as a civil engineer,'' he said.
 With the six appointments, the mayor now has a full complement of eight board members.
 ''This is good news,'' said Fredric M. Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, ''that he's putting people with a large view of the city onto something that others might think of as a sinking ship.''
 Two mayoral appointees, Stanley S. Shuman and Edward Lewis, have been replaced. The governor now has seven appointees on the board, with one more to be named.

HEADLINE: Rail Link to Benefit From Unused 9/11 Aid

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
The Senate is set to approve a measure that would allow New York officials to use $2 billion in unused Sept. 11 aid to build a rail link connecting the World Trade Center site to the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport, Congressional officials said on Wednesday.
 It is the first significant effort by Congress to fulfill a request that New York officials made last year to finance the rail link project with unused parts of a $5 billion tax-incentive package. Washington had approved the package shortly after the terror attack to encourage the construction of office towers, residential buildings and retail shops in Lower Manhattan. 
The fate of the rail link project is still uncertain in the House, where conservatives, who are increasingly alarmed about the growing federal deficit, have been averse to redirecting the remaining 9/11 dollars to the rail link project. A senior Republican aide said last night that it was too early to determine how the House would respond.
 Nevertheless, city and state officials said they were encouraged by the developments in the Senate and immediately called on Republican leaders in the House to follow suit, saying that the rail link was a vital part of efforts to rebuild Lower Manhattan.
 In a statement, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, urged the House ''to act in concert with the Senate and help secure this important funding,'' arguing that the rail link would help restore ''tens of thousands of jobs'' lost as a result of the attacks.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said that the project would bolster ''the future economic vitality of Lower Manhattan.'' He also said that getting the money from Washington would ensure that ''the federal government keeps its promise to New York to help in the rebuilding after Sept. 11.''
 The developments in the Senate came after Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from New York, persuaded his colleagues on the Finance Committee on Tuesday to include the rail link plan in a larger tax bill that the full chamber is expected to take up on Thursday.
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer credited members of the Bush administration, chiefly John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, with helping him persuade members of the Senate to support the plan to use the unspent portion of the 9/11 aid package to pay for the rail link project.
 He added that it was now up to the House to live up to the promise Washington leaders made to help New York rebuild in the wake of the terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan. ''The country made a commitment to New York, and the president and the Senate are on board now,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The House is the final hurdle.''
 The federal tax breaks that the city and state want to convert, known as the Liberty Zone package, have been controversial from their inception. Many New York politicians, economists and real estate experts questioned their value and argued that Lower Manhattan would be better served by an infusion of actual dollars from the federal government.
 Last year, Mr. Pataki made an unusually direct appeal to President Bush asking him to provide cash for the rail project by tapping the Liberty Zone package. 
 Planners estimate that the $6 billion rail link project could be completed by 2013. 
 It would allow travelers heading to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport to travel aboard new trains on existing AirTrain tracks that loop around the central terminal area and then run along a viaduct in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway to Jamaica, Queens. There, a new 1,500-foot elevated connector would carry the trains from the AirTrain tracks to the Long Island Rail Road tracks heading toward Brooklyn. 
 Near the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, the trains would enter a new three-mile tunnel and travel beneath the East River into Lower Manhattan. An underground station would serve both the tunnel and the Atlantic Terminal.
 The tunnel would allow access to Hanover Square, the intended terminus of the proposed Second Avenue subway, and the World Trade Center station, the existing terminus of the E train.
 The plan to convert the unused tax breaks into cash to finance the rail link is contained in a larger bill that cuts taxes by about $60 billion over five years.
 House Republicans have fashioned their own $70 billion package of tax cuts, but it does not include plans for the rail link. The two chambers will reconcile their bills in the coming weeks, and the hope is that the compromise that emerges includes the rail link plan.

HEADLINE: Made in U.S., Shunned in China 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
Abby Chan, a 23-year-old advertising copywriter, took a break from shopping for Levi's jeans at a mall here on Wednesday evening and relaxed at a table in a Starbucks restaurant.
 Aside from coffee and denim, there were not many American brand products that interested her. She covets Chanel clothing and Louis Vuitton bags, dreams of owning a BMW or Mercedes-Benz someday, and struggles to think of an American brand that appeals to her.
"There are more choices for European brands, more styles, so they are more interesting," she said.
 When President Bush arrives in Beijing on Saturday, he is expected to press China to reduce its large and growing trade surplus with the United States, on track to hit a record $200 billion this year. 
 But for a long list of reasons, American products are struggling these days in the Chinese market, where they have trouble measuring up to European brands and even some Chinese brands.
 The United States is buying $6 worth of goods from China for every $1 worth of goods it ships to China. With American imports from China climbing at a clip of nearly 30 percent a year, American exports to China would have to nearly triple each year just to keep the deficit from widening further.
 Many economists say that it is the United States' total trade deficit that is a more disturbing reflection of overall American weakness in trade. But it is the bilateral deficit between China and America that sets off fires on both sides. 
 China's economy is galloping along just as a long series of America's weaknesses are combining to hurt American exports. With many of America's name brands made in China these days, from clothing to cars, the Chinese are beginning to wonder what a ''Made in U.S.A.'' label really has to offer.
 ''The only U.S.-produced items that I can think of that exist in large quantities in China are dollar bills,'' said Matthew Crabbe, the managing director of Access Asia Ltd., a market research firm.
 But the handful of products that Americans make well, and which sell like hotcakes, do not have labels on the sleeves -- Boeing's aircraft and General Electric's power plant equipment, railway locomotive parts and aircraft engines. Beyond those, American exports to China consistently grow more slowly than imports, and this year, they have slowed even more. 
 To be sure, many economists question the value of focusing on any single bilateral trade deficit -- even one that Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, decried in a speech in Beijing on Monday as ''the largest trade deficit in the history of the world.''
 Chinese officials increasingly try to deflect criticism by emphasizing America's growing dependence on borrowing from the world. That borrowing pays for a higher level of consumption than America's economic output would otherwise sustain.
 ''Even if the United States stopped importing from China, it would have to buy from somewhere else,'' said Liao Xiaoqi, China's vice minister of commerce.
 Another big reason for the expanding bilateral deficit lies in changing patterns of trade. Companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia increasingly manufacture only the most technologically sophisticated components at home. They ship them to China, buy the less complicated parts locally at low cost and assemble the product in China for shipment directly to Europe or the United States.
 A result is that East Asia has achieved the dream that a dozen years ago gave rise to the North American Free Trade Agreement: a regional manufacturing center that taps each country for the part it can produce most efficiently. 
 America's overall trade deficit with Asian countries has changed little in recent years, but the deficit is now concentrated in China.
 The glue for this highly efficient regional export machine lies in the common rules of the World Trade Organization, which China joined in November 2001. Those rules make it very hard for the United States, also a W.T.O. member, to impose limits on Chinese imports unilaterally, giving investors the confidence to put factories in China and to make use of the country's immense supply of cheap labor.
 Only in textiles and agriculture do W.T.O. rules allow more restrictions. The United States has limited Chinese textile exports; Chinese agricultural exports are small.
 America's inability to sell to China is a result of many different limitations. A few of them are self-imposed, like American visa restrictions since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that make it harder for buyers to come to the United States, and limits on the export of technologies with potential military applications.
 ''We are in essence restricting trade'' by restricting visas, said David L. Cunningham Jr., the president of FedEx's Asia and Pacific division. ''Businesspeople take their business elsewhere.''
 Other limits to American sales are a result of Chinese policies, like the Chinese government's purchase of $20 billion or more in dollars and other foreign currencies each month to prevent the Chinese currency from rising in value. China has also insisted that technology transfers to Chinese companies accompany any large import agreements for anything from cars to computer software.
 That insistence, together with persistently low wages, has helped push multinationals to build, buy or invest in factories in China to supply the Chinese market, instead of exporting the same goods to it every year the way multinationals have long done in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere in Asia. 
 The Chinese market -- a fifth of humanity -- is so large that big corporations like General Motors and Caterpillar have been much more willing to move production here than to other developing countries.
 Even among Cadillacs, the top of G.M.'s line, G.M. now imports only the $150,000 Cadillac XLR sports car, which is manufactured at the same assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., that has long made the Chevrolet Corvette. G.M. has started building the Cadillac CTS sedan and Cadillac SRX car-based utility vehicle for the Chinese market in a 50-50 joint venture in Shanghai with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. 
 Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., has been one of the most successful American companies in the Chinese market, but now relies heavily on factories in China to supply the market. ''For Caterpillar and for every multinational, the key is to have a big presence in a country,'' said Richard P. Lavin, the company's vice president for Asian and Pacific operations.
 What China is buying, because it cannot grow or mine enough for itself, is food and minerals. American farmers -- and the rural state lawmakers in Congress who represent them -- have turned into a powerful lobby for free trade with China, as China erects few of the barriers that bedevil agriculture elsewhere.
 ''We have not been told of any trade barriers for two years now, it's really amazing,'' said Phil Laney, the China director for the American Soybean Association.
 At the consumer level, tastes in China are also changing to the detriment of American companies. As China becomes increasingly cosmopolitan, an early admiration for all things American is fading. The generation of students who raised a copy of the Statue of Liberty during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 has gone on to acquire tastes as international as any in the world.
 American car brands like Ford, marketed in the United States with a lot of waving flags, are promoted here as quality vehicles that show their owner's taste and sophistication.
 ''Putting explicit American symbols in advertising will be alienating, not because of anti-Americanism but because of Chinese nationalism,'' said Tom Doctoroff, the chief executive for greater China at the JWT Advertising Agency.
 Shopping at a store selling Coca-Cola merchandise in the same Tee Mall where Ms. Chan shopped, Estella Chong, an English teacher who has never lived outside China, said that attitudes had changed. ''Maybe some people thought American brands were better than Chinese brands or had better after-sales service,'' she said. ''Now they don't think so.''
 Business hotels in China have a smattering of Americans and swarms of executives from China, the rest of Asia and often Europe, a sign of scant interest by small American companies.
 The American Chamber of Commerce in Guangzhou in southeastern China helped organize an import opportunities fair here last year and arranged for American and Chinese officials to make presentations. But the heavily promoted event had to be canceled when fewer than a dozen American companies signed up to attend.
 ''American brands are not actively attacking the Chinese market -- lazy, maybe,'' said Andrew Leung, a garment industry magnate who is the chairman of the Hong Kong Textile Council. ''You see all the Italian brands doing quite well.''
 The biggest strength of the United States in many markets has been its innovation. At a conference in Beijing on Tuesday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California held up a new solar cell that had been designed in Silicon Valley, though it was actually manufactured in China.
 But China's rampant copying of everything from movies to auto part designs makes it hard for American companies to profit even by licensing their ideas. The Chinese government is determined to move into higher- technology industries, moreover, and is hiring top scientists to be researchers.
 China wants new products to be ''not just 'made in China' but 'designed in China,' '' said Gov. Huang Huahua of Guangdong Province at a news conference here on Thursday evening.
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated this week that a steep decline in the dollar was the most likely way that the overall American trade deficit would narrow, by making America's imports much more expensive, and American exports less costly overseas.
 Ivy Chan, a 26-year-old secretary shopping at Tee Mall, said that she thought Motorola cellphones -- an American brand partly designed in the United States and manufactured in China -- were less attractive than Nokia phones. But a big drop in the price might make her reconsider.
 ''I would buy it if it were a third cheaper,'' she said. ''But I would think about why it is so cheap.''

HEADLINE: Home Building Slips to Slowest Pace in Five Months 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
New-home construction dropped to its slowest pace in five months and building permits had their biggest monthly drop in almost six years in October, the government reported yesterday, providing more evidence of a housing slowdown. 
 Although not conclusive, a stream of reports in recent weeks has signaled that the long housing boom is coming off its peak and that slower growth or even a decline might lie ahead.
A monthly report from the Commerce Department yesterday showed that builders started homes at an annual pace of 2.01 million in October, down 5.6 percent from September and down 2.3 percent from October 2004. 
 Local authorities issued 6.7 percent fewer building permits in the month, for an annual rate of 2.07 million, a decline of 1 percent from October 2004.
 ''What we are now seeing finally is enough of the housing indicators suggesting that the cooling process has begun to be a believer,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
 On Wednesday, the association reported that a monthly index measuring its members' confidence fell in November as builders reported a decline in potential buyers. The group cited mortgage rates, which have risen in the last two months but remain near historical lows, and a decline in consumer confidence.
 Earlier this month, Toll Brothers, the nation's biggest maker of luxury homes, reduced its sales forecast for the coming months and year, noting that buyers have become more restrained after Hurricane Katrina. 
 Mortgage interest rates have been rising steadily for several months. Last week, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage carried a 6.36 percent interest rate, up from 5.77 percent at the end of July. Applications for loans for purchases and for refinancing have fallen an average of 2.9 percent in the last four weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 Consumer confidence, as measured by leading surveys, fell after Katrina in September and October, but the shopping behavior of Americans appears to provide mixed evidence of that. Retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, have grown briskly in recent months. But real estate agents and others in the industry have reported that homes are staying on the market longer, and that prices are increasing more slowly or even falling in some of the nation's hottest markets.
 Reports on other forms of economic activity have looked positive in recent weeks, as they did yesterday. In one, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose by 0.9 percent in October as more factories, oil refineries and other plants on the Gulf Coast resumed operations. Production fell by 1.5 percent in September because of shutdowns in the region.
 The numbers were also bolstered by resumed production at Boeing, which had a machinists' strike in September. Construction and manufacturing were both up 1.4 percent.
 ''This is further evidence that the economic expansion remains intact,'' Anthony Chan, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, said, noting that gulf recovery accounted for only part of the growth.
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in seven months in the week ended Nov. 12 -- to 303,000 from 328,000 the week before. People displaced by the three hurricanes -- Katrina, Rita and Wilma -- added about 19,000 claims to the totals.

HEADLINE: Red Update Alert: Poseidon Goes Belly Up Again 

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Re-creations of 70's schlock, from ''Starsky & Hutch'' to ''The Dukes of Hazzard,'' all seem to obey the second law of movie dynamics: remakes drift to a state of inert uniformity known as entropy.
 NBC's three-hour ''Poseidon Adventure,'' to be shown Sunday night, may be the exception that proves the rule. It is not quite as deliciously awful as the original 1972 disaster movie, but it comes pretty close. Pauline Kael once described ''The Poseidon Adventure'' as a ''waterlogged 'Grand Hotel.' '' The TV version is closer to a massacre on ''The Love Boat.'' 
 Not a single cruise director is spared. 
 The writers wisely chose to update the plot, which was based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Instead of a freak weather disaster, Islamic terrorists disguised as kitchen workers take over the luxury cruise ship and blow it up with explosives hidden inside beer kegs. (These terrorists are much better prepared than the pirates who tried to board a cruise ship off the coast of Somalia earlier this month with a grenade launcher.)
 Modern audiences have short attention spans and need a movie to kick off with a little violence. The terrorist twist allows the film to open with a scene of a Special Forces team raiding an enemy safe house in Jordan and opening fire on the conspirators -- always a bracing way to start. The terrorists are slaughtered (''all targets are reduced,'' one agent says to another), but not before their leader manages to destroy evidence of the secret plot to blow up the S.S. Poseidon. 
 The cast of characters has been updated as well, though, oddly, not to reflect multiculturalism. There are no black or Hispanic heroes. Only feminism gets a tip of the cap: one of the smarter, tougher survivors is Rachel (Alexa Hamilton), a successful entrepreneur who booked the cruise to improve relations with her whiny husband, Richard (goes without saying: Steve Guttenberg). But she also chooses to share the cabin suite with their two children, putting a damper on candle-lit reconciliation. Richard, a failed novelist, seeks adulterous consolation in the arms of the ship masseuse, Shoshanna (Nathalie Boltt). 
 Ernest Borgnine played Detective Lt. Mike Rogo in the original. In the post-Sept. 11 version, Rogo (Adam Baldwin) is a gruff, buff officer in the Department of Homeland Security who is assigned to the Poseidon as an undercover sea marshal. Rogo is a man of few words, but lots of disaster movie aphorisms (''Everything is safe, until it's not''). 
 The script even takes account of grade inflation at the Vatican: the take-charge Roman Catholic priest Gene Hackman played in the original is now a monsignor, Bishop Schmidt, played by Rutger Hauer (''Blade Runner''). Secular Hollywood, however, gets equal time: Bryan Brown (''The Thorn Birds'') plays a Hollywood schlockmeister, Jeffrey, who goes on the cruise with his sexy, young French beloved, Aimee (Tinarie Van Wyk). 
 Perhaps the most striking addition is the remake's post-Iraq war humility. When the United States Navy is finally alerted to the hijacking (the terrorists destroy the ship's communications system, but Rachel manages to tack an S.O.S. message to her e-mail Christmas list), the admiral in charge finds he cannot get an American satellite in position to locate the missing vessel. The British secret service comes to the rescue, led by a crisp senior agent, Suzanne Harrison, played by Alex Kingston (''ER''). 
 Since John le Carre, British spy thrillers have brooded over the inequities of the ''special relationship,'' gleefully portraying C.I.A. agents as blustering bullies who undermine British spy craft, notably in the BBC series ''MI-5.'' In its own small way, ''The Poseidon Adventure'' is a way of saying we're sorry. 
 Sadly, the famous theme song, ''The Morning After'' sung by Maureen McGovern, which won ''The Poseidon Adventure'' its only major Oscar, was left out. But the Shelley Winters role remains intact. The British actress Sylvia Syms plays the elderly passenger, Belle Rosen, and while this time she is a widow (the tiresome kind who always quotes her late husband, Manny), she has just enough avoirdupois to give viewers chilling expectations for Mrs. Rosen's underwater swimming scene. It would be churlish to ruin the suspense, but as soon as the ship flips, the producers tantalize viewers with ominous shots of Mrs. Rosen's rear end as she climbs fire ladders in a blue dress with a long slit up the back.
 The original movie was one of the first all-star disaster movies, a precursor to ''The Towering Inferno,'' starring Paul Newman, but that genre has faded. For one thing, in an era when Robert De Niro and Kate Winslet do ads for American Express, few movie stars have the same cachet. The cast of NBC's disaster movie is not particularly high powered, but it doesn't really matter. 
 Nor are the special effects particularly special -- it's hard to detect any major technological advances in the depiction of rushing waters and crashing furniture. Nevertheless, the high point, when the ship first capsizes and New Year's Eve revelers in the grand ballroom fall from the upside-down floor to the ceiling, is quite satisfying -- especially when one of them crashes through the ceiling's stained glass. 
 Three hours is a lot for a cruise-ship hijacking, but ''The Poseidon Adventure'' manages to keep a straight face throughout even in its silliest moments. And that is a fitting tribute to the original.

HEADLINE: Is Key West Going Straight?

BYLINE: By ROBERT ANDREW POWELL

 BODY:
FOR decades, the remote Florida town of Key West has been a refuge for gay tourists, a kind of Southern bookend to Provincetown, Mass. -- a place where drag shows, all-male guest houses (complete with communal hot tubs) and a spirit of unbridled hedonism attracted everyone from closeted Midwest accountants to Tennessee Williams. 
 But recently, soaring real estate prices and the popularity of events like Fantasy Fest -- an annual bacchanal of of parades, masquerade balls and celebrity look-alike contests that began as an AIDS fundraiser in 1979 and has since evolved into a drunken open-air party that would be right at home on fraternity row -- have begun to attract a more heterogenous crowd, one that can at times make Key West look like any other tourist town getting ready for Spring Break.
You can feel the change at the Lighthouse Court, a popular -- some would say notorious -- gay-only Whitehead Street guesthouse that recently went ''all welcome,'' the local euphemism for accepting heterosexual guests as well as gays. And it's obvious clear across Old Town at the Heron House Court, formerly known as the Fleur de Key and long one of the premier gay-only guesthouses on the island. It started welcoming straight visitors to its 16 rooms in August. 
 Meanwhile Duval Street, the main commercial street of Old Town, continues to evolve into a strip of Hard Rock Cafes and Margaritavilles. On a sultry evening in late September, a cover band at Sloppy Joe's plowed through Tommy Tutone's lone hit, ''Jenny (867-5309).'' At Irish Kevin's, a troubadour was convincing his audience of fraternity brothers to sing along to Bon Jovi.
 Could Key West, the place that Readers of OutTraveler magazine named the second best resort town in the world (behind Provincetown), be going straight?
 ''I'd say Key West is less gay friendly than it was 10 years ago,'' said Gregory Gearhart, a hairdresser from Fort Lauderdale who visits three times a year. Mr. Gearhart was sitting at the Atlantic Shores pool bar, an iconic gay hangout that plans to close next year. He took a sip from his Skyy and Coke and contemplated the impact of his words. ''Actually, I wouldn't say it's gay unfriendly. It's becoming different, though. It's not what it once was.''
 Of course, Key West retains a gay sensibility. There are gay tourist charters to the Dry Tortugas and gay sunset cruises into the Florida Straits. Rainbow flags flutter across Old Town. It's nothing to see a pair of men or pair of women walking on Duval Street hand in hand. A sign posted on a house on Frances Street states: ''That 'love thy neighbor' thing, I meant it. -- God.''
 Key West was the first American city to openly recruit gay tourists, and current ads are specifically aimed at gay travelers. A gay and lesbian trolley tour rolls down gay guesthouse row on Fleming Street, passing the Equator, Coconut Grove, Oasis and the Coral Tree Inn. The Island House on Fleming not only remains gay-only, it also features a clothing-optional gym.
 On Duval, the La Te Da cabaret continues to offer drag queen reviews. More drag queens work the sidewalk outside the 801 Bourbon Bar, beckoning passing tourists. At the Bourbon Street Pub, a man in a tight pink tank-top still looks right at home.
 But for many longtime gay visitors to this 5.9-square-mile island, located about 150 miles southwest of Miami, there is a growing sense that Key West is no longer the gay destination it once was. Some of it is a generational shift, as younger gay travelers can take their choice of gay-friendly destinations like South Beach, Palm Springs, Puerto Vallarta and even -- unlikely as it seems -- Orlando. 
 But the shifts are a reflection of more significant changes in Key West itself. Once a low-cost retreat for those who wanted to get away from it all -- both gay and straight -- it is now one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country. While transplants once could buy up attractive but dilapidated houses in Old Town, those ''Carpenter Gothic'' houses have now been restored with pastel paint and shiny tin roofs to a standard that would make Martha Stewart applaud. Today, a tiny bungalow in Old Town can sell for $600,000 or more. 
 ''In 1985 you could go to a party that would include a famous writer, a millionaire and a woman who sold beads on Duval,'' said Michael Browning, one of the owners of the Atlantic Shores, which is scheduled to close in the spring, to be replaced by a 58-unit condominium complex. ''That doesn't happen as much anymore. But people talk about how great it was 20 years ago. I'll bet you anything that 20 years from now, they'll talk about how great it was in 2005.''
 At the Atlantic Shores pool one sunny day this fall, what caught the eye first were the women, many of whom were topless. And then the men reclining on plastic lounge chairs padded with blue cushions. Several of the men were completely naked, soaking up sun as naturally as iguanas. In the pool, men in fluorescent bikinis stood submerged almost to their nostrils, motionless like Everglades alligators stalking deer. 
 In a survey of gay tourists conducted by the Key West Business Guild, several respondents specifically mentioned the Atlantic Shores as their favorite thing about Key West. ''It was a simple business decision,'' Mr. Browning said of the condo conversion. ''A lot of people love the Atlantic Shores, but they weren't necessarily booking rooms at the hotel.'' 
 Mr. Browning is not alone in blaming simple economics for many of the changes. The Lighthouse Court, for example, was bought in January by a group of investors who own four other hotels on the island. ''They are all all-welcome, so we just folded it into our operation,'' said Julie Fondriest, the new managing owner of the Lighthouse Court. ''It wasn't a slight against the gay community at all.''
 At Pearl's Rainbow, a former cigar factory that is the island's only women-only guesthouse, Loraine Quigley remained optimistic about the island's gay-friendly identity. ''I wouldn't say there's a trend to eliminate gay guesthouses,'' she said. ''One or two properties have switched owners, but that's about it.''
 Still, at one of the Atlantic Shores regular Sunday night tea parties earlier this fall, a sense of mourning hung in the humid and salty air. There was worry that condos like the ones to be built on this property will change the character of the city. There was talk of moving to Wilton Manors, a growing gay enclave outside Fort Lauderdale. Or perhaps Costa Rica. 
 ''Key West is not going to be the gay Mecca that it was,'' Charlie Barry, 42, said. He wore jeans and no shirt. A can of Budweiser perspired in his hand. He is a native New Englander known as Woody; he said he first came to Key West in 1992 and has lived in Old Town for the last three years. ''I mean, c'mon, it's just for the filthy rich. It's not going to be a gay Key West.''
 On the dance deck, a drag queen, Miss Angelica Duval, lip-synced her way through a set of disco hits. She redefined Amazonian, with muscular legs and buttocks showcased by a thong. Remove the makeup, the wig and the glitter and she could be a defensive lineman for the Washington Redskins. 
 Another drag queen, Gina Maseratti, lamented the closing of the Atlantic Shores. ''I've been coming here for many years,'' she said. She wore stiletto heels, a platinum wig and a full face of makeup. ''Eventually the condos will be bought up by people who don't live here year-round. The real heart of Key West will sell and move on.'' 
 But, in many ways, Gina Maseratti's situation is as complicated and nuanced as Key West's future. Miss Maseratti'sgiven name is Kerry Torr Cressman. He works in construction. He's involved in a committed relationship with a woman, whose shoulder he caressed while he spoke to a reporter. ''I don't think people come to Key West for the typical stuff you get in Miami or Fort Lauderdale,'' he said. ''They come to see people like me, a drag queen in a beautiful relationship with a beautiful woman who is a schoolteacher.'' 
 Miss Maseratti was about to step into the spotlight to lip sync a disco version of ''Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'' during which she would strip off her khaki skirt to reveal a blue maillot spangled with white stars. As she headed over to the stage, she insisted she was not about to leave the island, even if the Atlantic Shores did. 
 ''I still love Key West,'' she said. ''I love it. I'll be here until they drag me out screaming and kicking.'' 

AFTER THE STORM
Cleaning Up, Getting Down
 HURRICANES are an annual worry for residents of Key West. Wilma justified the anxiety this year, spraying the island with triple-digit winds and flooding streets and houses. Renewal is under way with the staccato slap of hammers securing metal roofs. 
 New Town, where most residents live, still has months of work ahead of it. Tourist-centric Old Town is largely back in place. Restaurants are open. Hotels are again filling up and in many cases are fully booked. 
 Wilma forced the postponement of Fantasy Fest (305-296-1817, www.fantasyfest.net), Key West's pre-Halloween take on a Mardi Gras-type party. It has been rescheduled for Dec. 7 through the 10th. It keeps its previously planned theme: ''Freaks, Geeks & Goddesses.'' Expect street fests, parades, and all-around frivolity, all shared with the latest cast of MTV's ''Real World,'' still taping on the island.
 Water flooded the first-floor rooms at the Heron House Court (412 Frances Street, 800-932-9119), but by this weekend all rooms are scheduled to be refurbished and ready for guests. Its 16 rooms start at $189 a night. As of this week rooms were still available for Fantasy Fest.
 The Atlantic Shores (510 South Street, 888-324-2996) is still rebuilding the pier that it lost during Hurricane Wilma. The pool, however, has already reopened, and clothing remains optional. Its 72 rooms start at $99. As of this week rooms were available starting at $255 for Fantasy Fest. Atlantic Shores is scheduled to close for good in April 2006.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Friday about the decline of gay-only inns in Key West misstated the origin of the annual Fantasy Fest there. It began in 1979 as an effort by businesses to promote tourism. It was not an AIDS fundraiser.

HEADLINE: Rapid Rise: Google Passes $400 a Share 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Google became a verb before it became a public company. Now it has also become a $400 stock.
 Just 15 months after the company went public in an unusual auction at $85 a share, which was less than the company had hoped and was widely viewed as disappointing, Google traded yesterday above $400 for the first time, closing at $403.45, up $5.30. The gain helped lift the Nasdaq composite index, which rose 1.5 percent, to 2,220.46, to its highest close since June 2001.
Just five weeks ago, Google shares were trading below $300, but a surprisingly strong profit report sent bullish analysts back to their calculators to come up with even more optimistic forecasts, and investors swarmed in. 
 ''It is more psychological than anything,'' said John Tinker, an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners in New York. ''There aren't too many $400 stocks out there.'' 
 But Mr. Tinker noted that one explanation for the auction when the company went public was to give every individual investor a chance to get in, and not splitting the stock now may not serve that purpose. ''The perception is that it is hard for individual investors to buy $400 stocks.''
 At the close, Google was valued at $119 billion, and the stock is now up 302 percent from $100.33, where it closed the first day of trading in August 2004. It is nearly double the value of its rival Yahoo, which has a value of $59.9 billion. 
 Google is valued higher than Coca-Cola, Cisco Systems or Amgen, and is deemed to be worth more than the combined value of McDonald's, DuPont and Anheuser-Busch. Its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and its chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, have sold billions of dollars of their shareholdings. 
 Not bad for a company whose revenues over the last four quarters totaled $5.3 billion, well below Disney's revenue for any single quarter in the last seven years. 
 By one standard -- that of price per share -- Google is the most successful initial public offering since the Internet bubble burst in 2000.
 But that reflects both the fact that it came out at a very high price, while most new offers are priced under $40, and the fact that Google, like Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, eschews stock splits. Google is in no danger of replacing Berkshire as the highest-priced stock in the United States. Berkshire closed yesterday at $89,700. 
 High prices were a feature of the Internet bubble, but many did not end well. Henry Blodget, then an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, gained fame in late 1998 for forecasting that Amazon.com, then trading around $240, would hit $400. 
 It never did, but that was because a stock split intervened. Adjusted for the split, the stock took just three weeks to get to the equivalent of $400, and it kept rising from there. The shares peaked in late 1999 at $113, or the equivalent of $678 when Mr. Blodget made his forecast. They later fell to under $10, but now are back to about $46, a little above the level when Mr. Blodget spoke up. 
 A company called Commerce One, which was supposed to be a pioneer in business-to-business Internet, was one of the hottest new offerings of 1999, nearly tripling on the first day of trading, closing at $61 on July 1. It went above $400 on Dec. 8 and peaked on Dec. 23 at $625.50, a gain of more than 900 percent from the first-day close.
 Last month the company went into liquidation, with shareholders getting a few pennies per share.
 When Google put out its earnings on Oct. 21, the stock leaped $36.70, to $339.90, and analysts from Piper Jaffray, UBS, RBC Capital Markets and First Albany raised their price targets to more than $400, and other analysts raised the targets to $400.
 Of all the offerings since the end of 2000, Google ranks No. 10 in terms of appreciation from the first-day close, according to calculations by Thomson Financial. 
 The leader is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which almost made it to $400 before Google did. Last week it traded as high as $394.80, but it slipped back and closed at $378.25 yesterday, up 782 percent from its first-day close of $42.90 in 2002.

HEADLINE: To Fight Rising Costs, Hospitals Seek Allies in the Operating Room

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It is a war on rising hospital costs, being fought one tiny balloon at a time. And as with most wars, some of the tactics are controversial.
 Until recently, some cardiologists at the PinnacleHealth System hospital group in Pennsylvania would inflate a new artery-opening balloon each time they inserted a stent into a patient's clogged arteries. Now, if they can, these doctors will use a single balloon throughout a patient's procedure.
 That simple step, which the doctors say poses no additional risk to patients, saves at least a couple of hundred dollars a procedure. And -- here lies the controversy -- the doctors share in any money they save the hospital. While the new approach gives them a financial incentive to be more cost- conscious, it also fundamentally recasts the traditional arm's-length relationship between a hospital and the doctors who practice there. 
 Without the special approval that PinnacleHealth has received from federal health regulators, such an arrangement would run afoul of longstanding rules meant to prevent hospitals from paying doctors to skimp on care or to steer patients their way. Similar experiments have been allowed at a handful of other hospitals around the country, but regulators are evaluating each plan case by case. HCA, the nation's biggest hospital chain, has proposed its own version of a savings program that has met resistance from some surgeons, and regulators have not yet weighed in. 
 PinnacleHealth says it saved 5 percent last year in cardiology supplies by conserving on balloons and getting cardiologists to agree, when feasible, to use stents, pacemakers and other cardiac devices that it pays at a negotiated volume discount. Those savings equaled about $1 million, which the hospital split with the participating doctors. 
 ''A lot of it is just common sense,'' said Dr. Ken May, whose 17-doctor cardiology practice is among the groups involved.
 But hospital administrators and consultants say getting doctors to agree to use certain brands or waste fewer supplies can be difficult. The only way to make doctors cost-sensitive, the hospitals say, is to pay them to pay attention.
 The experiments are known as gainsharing in the industry, and while no one expects that alone to bring health care inflation to heel, it is gaining momentum. There is talk in Congress of relaxing some of the current prohibitions. 
 Regulators and others still worry that such programs, if not designed properly, could induce doctors to put money matters ahead of the interests of patients. Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat, has described Congressional enthusiasm for gainsharing as ''not only misguided'' but ''potentially dangerous.''
 But many economists and health care experts say something needs to change. The soaring cost of medical devices -- and major advances like drug-coated stents designed to keep arteries open better than stents without such coating -- is a big reason that hospital care has become the largest component of the nation's nearly $2 trillion annual health bill. 
 ''There's so much pressure to reduce costs across the board in health care, I would be surprised if this doesn't get traction,'' said Dara A. Corrigan, a former official in the inspector general's office of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. She is now a lawyer representing drug companies and device makers at Arnold & Porter in Washington.
 As relations between doctors and hospitals have grown increasingly strained in recent years, many doctors now have closer ties to device makers, who sometimes pay them consulting fees, than to the hospitals, which must purchase the devices and swallow any portion of the price they cannot pass along to patients and insurers. 
 Often, hospitals say, they cannot negotiate better deals with device makers because too many doctors refuse to switch brands or to consider using anything but the most sophisticated models, even when a less expensive device might work as well. Without new approaches like PinnacleHealth's, the doctors, paid separately for their services, typically have no reason to care about prices.
 ''There has to be some way a hospital can get physicians involved,'' said Joane H. Goodroe, a consultant who has worked with all seven of the hospitals that have received regulatory approval to conduct the experiments to share savings. Besides PinnacleHealth Systems, the other hospitals include St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta and Sisters of Charity Providence Hospitals in Columbia, S.C. 
 Gainsharing's critics include device makers, whose profits are threatened if hospitals are able to demand better prices. 
 ''We believe that gainsharing would have an immediate and significant negative effect on public health by encouraging the use of the least expensive option without consideration of long-term effects or overall health economics,'' said Martin J. Emerson, chief executive of American Medical Systems, a maker of pelvic devices based in Minnetonka, Minn. 
 He was speaking last month at a Congressional hearing convened by Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican. Not persuaded, Ms. Johnson plans to introduce legislation making it easier for hospitals and doctors to cooperate.
 Federal officials do remain concerned, though, that doctors might reduce care to increase their own share of the savings. Regulators now carefully evaluate each hospital's plan, and many hospitals shy away from gainsharing because of the legal thicket, even when they think the idea makes sense.
 ''It's taking money from the manufacturers and giving it to the attorneys and consultants,'' said Kathleen Killeen, an administrator for HealthEast Care System in St. Paul. 
 For PinnacleHealth, the experiment is in its second year at the system's flagship, Harrisburg Hospital, in Pennsylvania's state capital. Doctors still have the ability to choose any device, but the hospital has worked with them to focus on a handful of companies that provide the bulk of the products used. The discounts are negotiated with that core group of manufacturers, and any savings from using less expensive devices are shared with doctors.
 ''We pick out vendors that have very good products and very good history,'' said Dr. May, the cardiologist. Doctors are still able to try new devices, he said, and because the contracts run for only a year, the physicians can change their minds. 
 Under its agreements with the device makers, PinnacleHealth cannot disclose which companies it uses or the prices it pays for devices. But the hospital said it was able to negotiate lower prices on many devices, saving about $370 for a pacemaker system, for example.
 The eventual goal of these new cooperative programs with doctors is to develop certain standards of care, said Dr. Roger Longenderfer, the chief executive of PinnacleHealth. In one case, he said, doctors were able to identify patients suitable for smaller incisions when inserting a catheter, avoiding the need for a special vascular clamp costing a couple of hundred dollars. The hospital reduced the number of patients getting those devices to 30 percent from 40 percent, Dr. Longenderfer said. 
 To deter doctors from using cheaper devices simply to improve the overall savings, regulators have required PinnacleHealth and other pilot programs to develop guidelines indicating when more sophisticated and expensive devices are necessary, said Ms. Goodroe, the consultant. Doctors are not paid, for example, if they save money by implanting single-chamber defibrillators in patients who should be getting the costlier dual-chamber models. 
 And to reduce the likelihood of any one doctor's becoming a cost-cutting zealot to amass large individual savings, the hospitals dispense the payouts to the medical practices -- not directly to individual doctors. 
 Dr. Longenderfer estimates that participating cardiologists earned an additional $10,000 to $15,000 each last year through gainsharing payouts from their group practices, although the practices decided how to allocate the money. 
 But not all plans are alike. The HCA approach rewards doctors individually, according to documents that outline the program to the orthopedic surgeons who practice at HCA's hospitals. 
 And unlike the gainsharing plans already approved by regulators, the HCA program strictly limits the doctors' choices to three manufacturers: Stryker, DePuy and Zimmer. ''Your surgeon or doctor cannot use what he thinks is best for you,'' said one surgeon, who spoke on the condition he not be identified because he practices at an HCA hospital. He argued that devices made by other companies might be better for some patients.
 But HCA says that its three chosen manufacturers, the largest in the industry, make a full range of devices, and that doctors who are doing repair work on a patient who has already undergone surgery are free to use whatever brand device the task requires. The company says it needs to limit its pool of suppliers to negotiate better prices.
 ''If you try to go out and contract with all vendors, you're going to get list price'' with no discounts, said James A. Fitzgerald, a senior purchasing executive for HCA. Doctors who insist on using another brand can also petition HCA for an exception, he said. 
 Under the HCA plan, an orthopedic surgeon stands to get 20 percent of any savings, if the doctor had been using a different brand but switched to a preferred device. If the surgeon was already using a preferred device, the doctor earns 15 percent of those savings. A physician who performs 30 hip implants a year, for example, saving $1,200 per surgery, stands to make $7,200 through gainsharing, the documents show.
 Such incentives make some surgeons uncomfortable, and the surgeon at the HCA hospital said he would prefer the money go to charity. HCA says it designed its program to motivate doctors but would work with federal regulators if they had concerns. So far, more than 200 surgeons at its hospitals have agreed to participate, and about 40 surgeons have switched brands. (Pending the plan's regulatory approval, HCA will not distribute any of the money to the doctors.) 
 It is debatable whether doctors can generate enough savings year after year to make it worth continuing gainsharing programs, even if they do catch on. To make sure the payments are only for gainsharing, regulators are requiring that savings be recalculated annually -- meaning doctors would need to find new ways to reduce costs each year to generate new money for the hospitals to share. 
 With costs soaring, savings are fairly easy to achieve in the early going. But Dr. Longenderfer acknowledges that savings at PinnacleHealth are likely to be lower in the second year. He adds, though, that there is still ample opportunity to come up with more efficient ways of practicing medicine. ''We're just beginning to scratch the surface,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Harvard, for Less: Extension Courses' New Allure

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 17 

 BODY:
Laura Shortill had a 3.6 grade point average at her Buxton, Me., high school and her SAT's were ''fairly average,'' she said. ''Nothing astronomical.'' 
 So when she applied to Harvard, Ms. Shortill knew it was a stretch. And she had a backup: Harvard.
Although Ms. Shortill was accepted elsewhere, including Johns Hopkins, when she was rejected by Harvard College, she moved to Cambridge anyway. She enrolled in a bachelor's degree program at Harvard University Extension School -- for a fraction of the admissions requirements and a fraction of the cost.
 ''I had Harvard as my reach school,'' said Ms. Shortill, 20, ''and I had Harvard as my safety school.'' 
 Students Ms. Shortill's age make up a small but growing percentage of Harvard Extension School these days, said Michael Shinagel, the dean. While the school does not keep count, he said, the number of bachelor's degrees it gives out (118 last year) is double that of 10 years ago, largely because of younger students, at least some of them drawn by the chance to experience Harvard at bargain-basement prices.
 ''I can tell by the physiognomy, by the color of the hair, by the body types that we're getting leaner and younger,'' Dr. Shinagel said. ''Clearly the trend is to a younger student population.'' 
 Extension and continuing-education schools have long served midcareer adults and people with some previous college credit. They still account for most extension students, and many do not accept students under 25 or without college experience. 
 But schools that accept younger students say interest is increasing, driven largely by economic considerations, although at Harvard it is also fueled by the fact that it is Harvard. 
 ''There is a group of what you might call traditional college-age students who are with us now,'' said Robert E. Wiltenburg, dean of University College, the extension school of Washington University in St. Louis.
 Dean Wiltenburg said that the number of students in his undergraduate degree program tripled in the last five years, and that most students studying full-time were 25 or younger.
 University of Phoenix, a continuing-education school with 176 campuses, last year dropped its rule that students be at least 22, and now 18-to-22-year-olds are nearly 10 percent of its 160,000 undergraduates. 
 At University of Maryland University College, a continuing-education school, students 25 and under seeking bachelor's degrees are the fastest-growing population, tripling to 4,200 in 2004 from 1,400 in 1997, said Mary Ellen Hrutka, dean of undergraduate studies. 
 ''Faculty members are adjusting their pedagogy to reflect age diversity,'' Dean Hrutka said, including in her course on women in business, where all the students once had careers, but now several are too young.
 The trend reflects the increasing number of students struggling to afford college, even as they realize it is increasingly necessary, experts say.
 ''The cost of college has risen, and the federal aid that is available has not kept up,'' said Kay J. Kohl, executive director of the University Continuing Education Association. ''A large proportion of traditional-age college students come from low-income families or are basically debt averse.''
 The same impulse has more students attending community colleges for two years before switching to a four-year institution. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that in 2000 only 27 percent of students fit the traditional description of enrolling right after high school, attending full-time, being financially supported by parents and either not working or working part-time. 
 Extension schools, with evening and weekend classes, appeal especially to students who need jobs to afford college and whose income then disqualifies them for financial aid but is not enough for full tuition. 
 Harvard Extension School, with its mission of making a part of Harvard broadly accessible, is unusually inexpensive, charging about $550 per lecture course compared to about $4,000 per course at Harvard College. 
 Other recent high school graduates, as well as home-schooled students, are also pursuing bachelors degrees at Harvard extension. Jeanne Margaret Nurse, although largely an A student, did not even apply to Harvard's undergraduate program. One of 12 children, Ms. Nurse, 20, who went to high school in St. Louis, said her family's income was too high to qualify for financial aid but too low to afford a regular college. 
 And Chip Perro is thrilled with his extension school decision. 
 ''I really wanted to go to a good school,'' said Mr. Perro, 21, from the Boston suburb of Natick, who failed to get into Harvard College or other top universities. ''My degree will be a degree from Harvard University. Sounds pretty good to me.'' 
 Students have access to Harvard faculty, even Nobel laureates like Roy J. Glauber, a physicist who has taught extension classes. At least 52 of the 128 credits required for the extension bachelors degree must come from courses taught by Harvard instructors. And some courses are virtually identical to those at Harvard College, professors say. 
 Ms. Shortill, majoring in classics, is taking the course Ancient Christianity with Helmut Koester, who teaches the same course at Harvard College and Divinity School. 
 Ms. Nurse takes a course called Justice taught at Harvard College by Michael Sandel, a well-known political scientist. It is videotaped and is one of 75 courses offered online for extension students. 
 And Mr. Perro said he discovered that a high school classmate attending Harvard College ''had one of the same instructors for an expository writing course.'' 
 Their instructor, Thomas A. Underwood, said the extension course ''aspires to be the equivalent'' of the college course. To get a bachelor's degree in either school, students must take that course and get a B minus.
 The differences, professors say, come mainly from the students. The rigorous competition for getting into Harvard College make its students ''almost like polished river stones,'' Dr. Underwood said. 
 Extension students are all ages and from all academic backgrounds, and many have jobs, marriages and children. There are no requirements to take extension courses; getting into the bachelor's degree program is permitted if students get at least a B minus in three extension courses, including expository writing. 
 ''There's a much wider spectrum of good and not so good and poor students,'' Dr. Koester said. 
 But some professors say the real-world experiences of extension students make the classes less academic and more practical. 
 Greg Harris, a Harvard College preceptor teaching advanced fiction writing in the extension school, said that he started with an academic approach, but that some students said, '' 'Get that stuff out of the way because I just want feedback on my writing.' ''
 What extension students do not get is the experience of living in college dorms, socializing routinely with others their age and having access to all libraries, dining halls and other facilities. They also do not get as much faculty advising. 
 For that reason, heads of some other continuing-education schools say younger students are a bad idea. 
 ''We've in fact discouraged it,'' said Jay A. Halfond, dean of Metropolitan College, Boston University's continuing-education school. Metropolitan College used to have younger students, he said, but they ''were more likely to have academic and disciplinary issues, issues of plagiarism, attendance and neglect, misbehavior of sorts.'' 
 He added, ''I've spoken to parents about this: do you really want your child in school with 30-year-olds? Unless your child is very mature and independent and able to juggle commitments, it's not a good choice.''
 At Harvard, although extension students must maintain a C average and fulfill language, science and math requirements, they may deal with the perception that they are not full-fledged Harvard citizens.''Some people are like, 'What are you exactly?' '' Ms. Shortill said. ''But some people are like, 'Oh my goodness, you can do that? Wow, that was really smart of you to figure that out.' ''
 Social life can be challenging too because most classmates are older and return home to families. But some students like the mix of ages, and that the evening classes allow daytime pursuits. And there is the diploma, a bachelors of liberal arts in extension from Harvard University (that other diploma says bachelors of arts from Harvard College).
 Dr. Shinagel put it this way: ''Let's say you're buying a Gucci handbag and you're going to pay a thousand dollars for it, and Gucci also puts out a line that doesn't call itself Gucci but is close in quality to a Gucci and you can get it for $50. That's what this is.''
 Not everyone buys that analogy. 
 ''I think that's sort of going to Harvard the wrong way for the wrong reasons,'' Dr. Halfond said.
 But on a resume, most employers would probably not know the difference, he and others said.
 Gail Kaplan, a legal recruiter in Boston, said: ''If I were sending someone with a Harvard Extension School degree to a law firm in Boston, I know it would not get the same reaction as Yale or Harvard or Stanford or Princeton. But if I sent them to St. Louis or California, people wouldn't notice as much.''
 Dr. Shinagel said extension graduates had done illustrious things, including attending Harvard's medical and law schools.
 Dr. Underwood said students getting bachelor's degrees from the extension school were ''brilliantly milking the cow of Harvard University.''
 ''If for some reason your finances or your SAT's wouldn't get you into the Ivy League,'' he said, ''you could come and get a very similar experience and then have the Harvard name on your resume. People say Harvard-trained, they don't say Bunker Hill Community College-trained.''

HEADLINE: Cocaine Prices Rise and Quality Declines, White House Says 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
After years of disappointing news about the easy availability of cocaine on American streets, the Bush administration on Thursday said its multibillion-dollar drug war in Colombia was showing signs of success, with the retail price of the drug in the United States sharply higher and the level of purity lower.
 From February to September, the price of a gram of cocaine rose 19 percent, to $170, while the purity level fell 15 percent, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy said. 
 White House officials said those trends were consistent with a shortage of cocaine and validated the United States' $4 billion, multiyear plan to wipe out cocaine drug crops in Colombia through aerial spraying.
 ''These numbers confirm that the levels of interdiction, the levels of eradication, have reduced the availability of cocaine in the United States,'' John Walters, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Thursday in a telephone interview from Washington. ''There's a change in availability. The policy is working.''
 But drug policy analysts critical of the administration's war on drugs said the White House was drawing unrealistically rosy conclusions from too short a period. They noted that a Rand Corporation study for the White House in 2003 showed that as the war on drugs had expanded since 1981, the price of cocaine had tumbled to historic lows while purity levels had risen.
 Drug policy analysts also said that like any commodity, the price of cocaine sometimes fluctuates wildly. Yet the cocaine trade remains intractably lucrative, they said.
 ''Cocaine is not like computer chips, where new technology makes it cheaper and cheaper,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, an independent New York group that says the war on drugs has been counterproductive. ''A small blip upward after so many years of decline in price and increase in purity is essentially meaningless.''
 Since 2000, American officials have insisted that an aggressive push to spray land used for Colombia's huge drug crops with glyphosate would pay off. Hundreds of thousands of acres, many in a swath of southern Colombia held by Marxist rebels, have been sprayed. 
 But this year, even after reporting that 336,000 acres of coca plants had been sprayed in 2004, the White House acknowledged that the amount of coca across Colombia was ''statistically unchanged'' from 2003. 
 Coca cultivation has spread to most states, growers are planting more potent strains and the amount of cocaine Colombia produces is still more than enough to satisfy American demand.
 Right-wing paramilitary commanders have continued trafficking much of Colombia's cocaine, fearing little from the administration of President Alvaro Uribe, which has granted generous concessions shielding them from serious punishment as they participate in a government-sponsored disarmament process. Human rights groups and some Colombian political leaders say that the paramilitaries are evolving into a Mafia-like organization that depends on the cocaine trade.
 John Walsh, who follows American drug policy for the Washington Office on Latin America, a policy analysis group, said cocaine trafficking regularly rebounded after difficult periods. When Colombia dismantled the Medellin cocaine cartel in the late 1980's and began an offensive against the Cali cartel in the mid-1990's, ''cocaine price increases, while obvious, were equally obviously short-lived,'' he said. ''They were quite ephemeral.''
 Still, the American government says the overall picture is positive: its figures show that seizures of cocaine are way up and that cocaine use among some sectors of the American population has declined. 
 The White House said the newest figures were just the start of a positive trend. Officials say that trend took time to develop because the traffickers had probably overproduced when the spraying effort began and for months used stockpiles of cocaine to supply American consumers.
 ''We kept watching this and watching this and that started to change,'' David Murray, a drug policy analyst at the White House, said of the price and purity figures. ''Nobody is saying victory. We're just finding a figure that's consistent with some of the other data sets we had.''

HEADLINE: Shares Up as Oil Prices Fall And Factory Output Jumps 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks broke out of this week's slump yesterday after industrial production showed the biggest increase in 17 months and oil prices declined. The Nasdaq composite index set a four-year high as Google's shares rose above $400. 
 The output figures helped ''reassure investors that corporate profitability and employment is going to be there,'' said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief portfolio strategist at Columbia Management Group in Boston. ''That should be a good underpinning to the market.'' 
 Google, the online search engine, led a rally in Internet companies amid optimism that advertising revenue is picking up. General Motors rebounded from a 14-year low after the chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said a bankruptcy filing was not necessary. 
 The Nasdaq added 32.53 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,220.46, the highest since June 2001. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 11.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,242.80. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 45.46 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,720.22. All three had been down for the week before yesterday. 
 The economic data helped stocks extend a November rally. The S.& P. 500 has gained 3 percent this month as lower oil prices and better-than-expected quarterly profits encouraged investors. 
 Industrial production expanded 0.9 percent in October, the most since May 2004, a Federal Reserve report showed. The rise in output at factories, mines and utilities followed a 1.5 percent decline in September. The proportion of industrial capacity in use increased to 79.5 percent, from 78.9 percent. The number of Americans filing first-time claims for state unemployment benefits dropped last week to a seven-month low of 303,000, the Labor Department said. 
 ''The good news continues,'' said Michael Holland of Holland & Company in New York. ''With the moderate inflation numbers from yesterday and today's jobs numbers, it's only the beginning.'' 
 Crude oil slumped 2.7 percent, to $56.34 a barrel in New York, the lowest close since June 15, on speculation that inventories will be adequate to meet refiner demand. Prices are down 20 percent since setting a record of $70.85 on Aug. 30. 
 Interest rates fell, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipping to 4.46 percent from 4.47 percent Wednesday and the price, which moves inversely to the yield, rising 4/32, to 100 11/32. 
 Gold rose $6.75, to $485 an ounce.
 Google gained $5.30, to $403.45. It has surged more than fourfold from its initial price of $85 in August 2004 on growth in online ads and expectations that it will diversify beyond Internet search. Yahoo gained $2.19, to $42.23 a share. Time Warner, which owns America Online, climbed 22 cents, to $17.82 a share. 
 Network Appliance, the maker of computers that store and distribute data costs, rose $1.36, to $29.61. The company said it expected profit of 77 cents to 80 cents a share in fiscal 2006, better than Wall Street forecasts, and said it planned to buy back as much as $650 million of stock. 
 G.M. rose $1.34, or 6.3 percent, to $22.63 a share, for the biggest gain in the Dow average. Mr. Wagoner said G.M. did not intend to file for bankruptcy, according to an e-mail message. G.M. shares slid on Wednesday as a result of concern that workers at the Delphi Corporation, G.M.'s largest parts supplier, would strike and threaten G.M.'s production.
 Wells Fargo, the bank holding company, jumped $1.40, to $62.39 a share. Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren E. Buffett, bought 20 million shares of Well Fargo in September, according to a regulatory filing.

HEADLINE: Discounting a Host of Ifs, Ands and Buts, United Projects a Profitable Future

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
United Airlines planes rumble down the runway some 3,400 times a day, gather speed and then lift off into a smooth ascent.
 Now, after three years in bankruptcy protection, the UAL Corporation is counting on doing the same. During the next five years, it says that its revenues and profits will rise in a steady stair-step fashion, a pattern that would certainly be attractive to investors. But it seems at odds with an industry so vulnerable to everything from terrorism and fuel prices to labor unrest and low-cost competitors, not to mention normal economic ups and downs.
The newest projections assume that passengers will line up to pay higher fares; that costs will stay under control as employees do more work for less pay; and that operating profits will expand steadily, nearly doubling over the five years to $1.77 billion in 2010, after the carrier's expected exit from bankruptcy in February 2006.
 It is a rosy outlook, and not out of the question. Moreover, if the economy stayed strong and fuel prices moderated, the domestic airline industry could be reaching a turning point leading to a period of unusual prosperity. 
 Indeed, third-quarter results for the industry -- essentially strong revenue weighed down by big fuel costs -- showed some significant progress.
 But, if recent history is any guide, the projections will prove overly optimistic. ''What could go wrong?'' said Philip A. Baggaley, a managing director who rates airline debt at Standard & Poor's. ''In this industry, there's plenty.''
 Fuel prices, the largest immediate concern, are beyond United's control. That is not the case, however, with productivity.
 To achieve its profit projections, United said it needed to streamline operations further during 2006 and 2007. The company began a plan last year to save $650 million a year by increasing productivity -- doing more with essentially the same number of workers and the same equipment. 
 For instance, overhauling a big engine on a Boeing 777 has for years taken United about 100 days, said Peter D. McDonald, chief operating officer. Through a series of process improvements, ''we're getting those into the 30-day range,'' he said. 
 That frees time for mechanics to handle repair work for other airlines, a business expected to generate more than $250 million in revenue next year. Likewise, United ground crews at some airports have picked up the pace, loading and unloading planes, cleaning and fueling them in 30 percent less time.
 But these efficiencies have been applied only to about one-quarter of United's operations, Mr. McDonald said.
 Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Calyon Securities, worries that prosperity, even for a relatively brief period, could prompt United's beleaguered unions to demand that the company give back some of the compensation workers surrendered to keep the airline afloat. That is a pattern seen in the past. 
 William T. Warlick, who rates airline debt at Fitch Ratings, also questions how much the company can further raise productivity. ''I'd be a little skeptical of that at this point of the bankruptcy plan,'' he said.
 Indeed, United in the past has set goals, notably emerging earlier from bankruptcy, only to miss them. Citing the failure to win a government guaranteed loan and the disruption caused in Asia by the SARS outbreak, ''we at various times had thought we would be exiting sooner than we did,'' Frederic F. Brace, United's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
 To keep workers focused on productivity, United pays performance bonuses. And workers will also receive profit sharing and newly issued stock in the company. 
 ''This idea that we've played out all the opportunities for improvement just couldn't be further from the truth,'' said John P. Tague, an executive vice president in charge of sales.
 He said that outsiders have been underestimating United, seeming to believe, he said, that ''if you're bankrupt, you can't invest in your business; you should act like a failure; go off in the corner and lick your wounds.''
 The truth is, he asserted, ''it's exciting to come to work realizing you can actually make things better.''
 United can only hope fuel prices decline. It is projecting that jet fuel will cost $1.48 a gallon during the five years, based on its expectation that oil will sell for an average of $50 a barrel during that period. ''Perhaps a bit optimistic,'' said Mr. Baggaley of S.& P.
 Currently, oil is trading at just under $57 a barrel and jet fuel is $1.70 a gallon.
 But United has plenty of company in expecting lower oil prices during the second half of the decade. Adam E. Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said he expected oil to be $60 a barrel next year, $45 in 2007 and $40 in the next three years.
 For United's mainline fleet, which excludes its regional carriers, a 10-cents-a-gallon increase in jet fuel would cost an extra $230 million next year, Mr. Warlick of Fitch said. And a fuel price 30 cents above United's projections would add $690 million to its costs for 2006, an amount that is more than two-thirds of its projected operating profit.
 ''Fuel is not at $50 a barrel,'' said Mr. Brace, the chief financial officer. ''We know that.''
 In recent months, he noted, revenue has been higher than expected, thanks to strong pricing, and costs have been higher, too, because of fuel prices. 
 In the five-year period covered by the projections, ''the actuals will be lower and higher,'' he said. ''We don't expect the world to behave in a 2-percent-higher way every year.''
 Fares are a third crucial consideration. If fuel prices stay high, United is assuming its competitors will raise fares rather than keep them low and endure yet more losses. 
 Crucial in that calculation is Southwest Airlines. As the healthiest and most competitive domestic airline, Southwest's pricing is influential.
 A $6 increase on one-way tickets across the board by Southwest next year would allow other carriers to raise fares enough to produce well over $500 million in additional industry revenue, David R. Strine, a Bear Stearns & Company airline analyst, wrote in a report this month. Much of that would go directly to the bottom line.
 But while United and other traditional carriers are retrenching -- retiring planes and reducing domestic flight schedules -- Southwest and other discount airlines are growing. That means more and more routes of the traditional airlines face direct competition from lower-cost carriers. 
 The ability to raise prices, of course, depends on strong customer demand. And if continued high oil prices weaken the economy, airlines carrying fewer passengers would find it difficult to maintain current prices, let alone push through increases.
 Having reduced its fleet amid strong demand, United's planes were 84 percent full throughout the third quarter this year. United had a net loss for the quarter of $1.8 billion because of charges related to its bankruptcy. But excluding the charges, even with high fuel costs, the heavy passenger traffic would have produced $68 million in net income. 
 ''Our third-quarter results proved to many people that the restructuring made us financially strong,'' Mr. Brace, the chief financial officer, said. ''We are largely on track with our projections going forward.''
 But the industry has a history of being overly optimistic. A proposed leveraged buyout of United in 1989 by its management at the time, along with other investors, failed to find adequate financing in part because of overly rosy revenue projections. 
 More recently, ''there have been a whole series of missed projections and false starts,'' Mr. Baggaley of S.& P. said. ''They've built up some credibility issues.'' He expects United, American and other traditional carriers to ''muddle through,'' but not thrive. 
 He summed up the situation this way: ''Moderately profitable in the upturn, highly leveraged, and at risk in the downturn.''

HEADLINE: A Private Obsession

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Lots of things in life are complicated.'' So declared Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, in response to the mass confusion as registration for the new Medicare drug benefit began. But the complexity of the program -- which has reduced some retirees to tears as they try to make what may be life-or-death decisions -- is far greater than necessary.
 One reason the drug benefit is so confusing is that older Americans can't simply sign up with Medicare as they can for other benefits. They must, instead, choose from a baffling array of plans offered by private middlemen. Why? 
Here's a parallel. Earlier this year Senator Rick Santorum introduced a bill that would have forced the National Weather Service to limit the weather information directly available to the public. Although he didn't say so explicitly, he wanted the service to funnel that information through private forecasters instead.
 Mr. Santorum's bill didn't go anywhere. But it was a classic attempt to force gratuitous privatization: involving private corporations in the delivery of public services even when those corporations have no useful role to play.
 The Medicare drug benefit is an example of gratuitous privatization on a grand scale. 
 Here's some background: the elderly have long been offered a choice between standard Medicare, in which the government pays medical bills directly, and plans in which the government pays a middleman, like an H.M.O., to deliver health care. The theory was that the private sector would find innovative ways to lower costs while providing better care.
 The theory was wrong. A number of studies have found that managed-care plans, which have much higher administrative costs than government-managed Medicare, end up costing the system money, not saving it. 
 But privatization, once promoted as a way to save money, has become a goal in itself. The 2003 bill that established the prescription drug benefit also locked in large subsidies for managed care. 
 And on drug coverage, the 2003 bill went even further: rather than merely subsidizing private plans, it made them mandatory. To receive the drug benefit, one must sign up with a plan offered by a private company. As people are discovering, the result is a deeply confusing system because the competing private plans differ in ways that are very hard to assess. 
 The peculiar structure of the drug benefit, with its huge gap in coverage -- the famous ''doughnut hole'' I wrote about last week -- adds to the confusion. Many better-off retirees have relied on Medigap policies to cover gaps in traditional Medicare, including prescription drugs. But that straightforward approach, which would make it relatively easy to compare drug plans, can't be used to fill the doughnut hole because Medigap policies are no longer allowed to cover drugs. 
 The only way to get some coverage in the gap is as part of a package in which you pay extra -- a lot extra -- to one of the private drug plans delivering the basic benefit. And because this coverage is bundled with other aspects of the plans, it's very difficult to figure out which plans offer the best deal. 
 But confusion isn't the only, or even the main, reason why the privatization of drug benefits is bad for America. The real problem is that we'll end up spending too much and getting too little.
 Everything we know about health economics indicates that private drug plans will have much higher administrative costs than would have been incurred if Medicare had administered the benefit directly.
 It's also clear that the private plans will spend large sums on marketing rather than on medicine. I have nothing against Don Shula, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, who is promoting a drug plan offered by Humana. But do we really want people choosing drug plans based on which one hires the most persuasive celebrity? 
 Last but not least, competing private drug plans will have less clout in negotiating lower drug prices than Medicare as a whole would have. And the law explicitly forbids Medicare from intervening to help the private plans negotiate better deals. 
 Last week I explained that the Medicare drug bill was devised by people who don't believe in a positive role for government. An insistence on gratuitous privatization is a byproduct of the same ideology. And the result of that ideology is a piece of legislation so bad it's almost surreal.

HEADLINE: Weld Blames Government For Failure Of Trade School 

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
William F. Weld, who resigned last month as the chief executive officer of a collapsing vocational college in Kentucky, blamed the federal government yesterday for driving it into bankruptcy by cutting it off from student aid, and said he had offered to cooperate with a federal investigation into the school's practices.
 ''As soon as I heard that the F.B.I. had an interest, I called them and said, 'I'm available if I can be useful,' '' Mr. Weld said in a nearly hourlong telephone interview. ''They said, 'Sure, fine, thanks.' But they haven't gotten back to me yet.'' 
 Mr. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor of New York, offered his account of the closing of Decker College in Louisville as political associates and other Republicans said that regardless of what investigators find, the school's troubles are likely to come up in his race. 
 Decker's closing, on Oct. 21, interrupted classes for thousands of students, many of them holding student loans they say the school encouraged them to take.
 Mr. Weld lauded Decker's educational record, saying it had helped prepare many low-income students for construction and clerical jobs. 
 ''The college did a lot of good,'' Mr. Weld said. ''It served a disadvantaged demographic, predominantly black and Hispanic, got them into the labor force. It served a tremendous purpose for a lot of low-income people trying to improve themselves.''
 Mr. Weld said that after his investment firm, Leeds Weld & Company, took a minority stake in Decker, he went to Louisville to recruit new senior management, and served as chief executive of the commercial school from January through October. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is the chairman of Leeds Weld.
 Mr. Weld said his annual salary as the top official at Decker, which had 3,800 students, was $700,000. 
 After a campus audit in June, the federal Department of Education restricted Decker's access to student loan funds, citing severe violations of financial regulations, a measure that Mr. Weld said forced the school into financial crisis. 
 The department terminated Decker's participation in federal programs on Sept. 30. Federal agents raided the school on Oct. 18, and three days later it closed. This month Decker entered bankruptcy proceedings.
 Mr. Weld said he decided to return to politics in New York and left the school in August. He said he went back only once, ''to pick up some stuff.'' 
 ''I came up here to get the gears grinding on the political front,'' Mr. Weld said. He remained the college's chief executive through October. 
 Mr. Weld said that on one occasion he sternly warned his staff against making false claims to the government, saying in a memo that activity like logging onto a computer in a student's name to establish evidence of attendance was a felony. 
 He also said he relied on subordinates to carry out certain tasks at the college, including overseeing the school's final emergency administrative measures, and informing students and employees of the collapse. 
 ''The impact on the students is the greatest tragedy,'' Mr. Weld said. ''But I believe the appropriate notification was sent out. They posted notices on the Web site and sent information out to students via e-mail.'' 
 Republicans and Democrats disagreed yesterday about how the school might play in a campaign.
 ''Anything can be made into an ad, and potentially there are things here that can be made into an ad,'' said Michael McKeon, a Republican strategist who is not involved in the campaign for governor. ''But I don't know that it sticks. Clearly the administration that he ran in Massachusetts is far more likely to be a measuring stick for him than a college that he had an affiliation with from a long distance away.''
 But Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist, said the college could help define Mr. Weld. ''New Yorkers don't know who he is, so this is kind of a lousy introduction,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''It's not how you'd want to begin a campaign.''
 Mr. Weld described two instances in which he heard that illegal activity could be occurring. In one case, Mr. Weld said, he heard a rumor that an employee had changed a student identification number on a form. He said he immediately sent an e-mail message to all Decker employees, explaining that it was a felony to provide false information to the government.
 The message, which Mr. Weld made available yesterday, asked employees to report violations of law to him or to Decker's top lawyer, ''so that we can have them investigated, and if substantiated, referred to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.''
 A former Decker admissions officer, Steve Johnson, said this week that when he sought to report his suspicions that tax forms had been falsified in order to qualify students for loans, Mr. Weld's subordinates failed to take action. Mr. Johnson said he took the information to the F.B.I., and later, at its request, recorded meetings with Mr. Weld's subordinates.
 David L. Huber, the United States attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, said yesterday that he could neither confirm nor deny Mr. Johnson's statements. But he added: ''A lot of investigations start that way.'' 
 Mr. Weld said he had ordered his subordinates to investigate Mr. Johnson's charges carefully.
 ''I said, 'Make sure you go over it thoroughly and see if there's anything there,' '' Mr. Weld said. The subordinates reported that the wrongdoing was unsubstantiated, Mr. Weld said. He said college officials had told him that Mr. Johnson ''had various issues with the company and had made demands for payments of money.''
 Mr. Johnson acknowledged yesterday that after discussions with Decker officials, he signed an agreement pledging to keep Decker matters confidential in exchange for severance money. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a contention by William F. Weld, the former chief executive of a for-profit vocational school, that the federal government drove the school into bankruptcy referred incorrectly to the position that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, holds with Mr. Weld's investment firm, Leeds Weld & Company. He is the chairman of an advisory board at Leeds Weld, not chairman of the board.

HEADLINE: Tracing Steps of the Man Who Walked Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
He walked these avenues and then he was gone, as the inhabitants of one city give way to the next, as some are hurried along. Everyone leaves behind a name, a time, a place and a role, and his were Jimmy Moy, 1960, Park Slope, Brooklyn: the man who never returned.
 A cataclysm's sudden vacancy leaves the memory of the disappeared, and the great imponderables visited upon the ancient Mayans, the Lost Colony in North Carolina, New Orleans, the long list. Where did they go, and will they come back, and why or why not, and what did they find? On the morning fire rained from the sky, Jimmy Moy left Brooklyn and a legend began.
''The people who lived here then,'' said Everett Ortner, who moved into one of the majestic brownstones that define this place three years after Jimmy Moy went away, ''are all dead or moved out or sold out.'' 
 The legend started in a laundry, an immigrant business like countless others across the weary boroughs. Then as now, a man behind a counter could be a neighborhood figure, familiar face and passing acquaintance.
 ''He lived across the street,'' said Pauline McCaddin, whose family owned a funeral home on Seventh Avenue. ''It was on the second floor of a brownstone, grocery underneath.''
 By the same coin, a man behind a counter could be a nonentity, ghost of a half-block's walk.
 ''I didn't go to the Chinese place,'' said Robert M. Nevin, who in 1960 lived at 126 Sterling Place, around the corner from the laundry. ''I used a different tailor.''
 For Chon Quey Moy, the shop was a foothold in the city, sustenance and identity, a place in the world situated between Prospect Park and Flatbush Avenue rumbling on toward Midwood and Flatlands and the whole wide ocean.
 In the 1959 Brooklyn telephone directory, behind a stately cover portrait of the library at Grand Army Plaza, Mr. Moy listed his home number, MAin 2-1446, at the shop's address, 26 Seventh Avenue. There he was on the page below Elsie Moxter from Shore Parkway. 
 To Mr. Moy's contemporaries, he was the Chinese laundryman of Park Slope. He cleaned shirts and folded them and returned them to their owners, and their owners were his neighbors, and his neighbors called him Jimmy. Park Slope was not the latter-day place of jogging strollers and purebred puppies. Houses on the park were offered for less than $30,000, though few banks would lend money to buy them.
 ''The neighborhood was in trouble,'' said Joseph Ferris, a retired teacher and state legislator. ''Urban renewal was the poison pill they were offering for the abandoned buildings. This was the nadir.''
 Friday, Dec. 16, 1960, 10 a.m.: A wet snow was falling from clouds gathering low over Seventh Avenue. Slush in the streets. Harry Harrison spinning Chubby Checker on the radio, Christmas shopping. Drip coffee, subway tokens, morning. Mrs. Robert Nevin standing there in front of the dresser in a bathrobe, her babies asleep. Same day, 11 a.m.: A DC-8 jetliner collides with a Super Constellation over Staten Island and the wreckage burns in the Park Slope streets. A woman is trapped in a burning car. The Pillar of Fire Church burns, and bedrooms and storefronts burn, and the streets seem to be burning, and 135 would be the number of the dead.
 The next morning the papers called it the worst aviation disaster of all time. 
 Dostoyevsky once said there are but two books written: A man goes on a journey and a stranger comes to town. To that end, the New York newspapers found Stephen Baltz, 11, the lone survivor aboard the DC-8. He was photographed dazed and scared under a passer-by's umbrella in the snow, a living symbol of hope to frame the horror for posterity, but he lived only a day.
 The editors of The New York Herald Tribune wrote of Stephen, ''And when he, too, died 24 hours later, the final grim sentence was written -- and written in such a way as to concentrate all the horror and heartbreak of the story.''
 Fools believe in final sentences. The day fire fell from the sky was not to disappear from memory, but when Stephen died the chroniclers of Brooklyn's heartache needed a new protagonist. It happened that a man named Moy had been running a laundry shop at 73 degrees 58 minutes 25 seconds west longitude, 40 degrees 40 minutes 37 seconds north latitude, the corner of Seventh Avenue and Sterling Place. And now he was gone.
 ''What has happened since to Sterling Place?'' asked an article in The New York Times four months after the crash. ''To Jimmy Moy, the Chinese laundryman who vanished shortly after the crash, leaving the lights burning and neatly packaged shirts on the shelves of his seared shop?''
 The writer answered her own question, finding Mr. Moy in Manhattan looking for another laundry job, and quoted him as saying, ''I'm 70 years old and I don't feel good.'' How he felt was more detail than the legend required. Jimmy Moy quit Park Slope for Manhattan, left his business and his home, and that act alone would serve to evoke the day the plane fell to earth in Brooklyn. 
 Forty-three years later, a magazine called the Park Slope Reader would revisit the crash and mention ''Jimmy Moy, who owned a laundry on the parlor floor at 26 Seventh Avenue, decided to move to Manhattan.'' 
 The man who never returned is a common legend, said Steve Zeitlin, executive director of City Lore, because it describes two ways of navigating life and times. In one way, Mr. Zeitlin said, people ''want to come back to the places they once lived; the other being a very American way of wanting to invent yourself from scratch.''
 ''When somebody walks away and never comes back,'' he said, ''they're in some ways doing a disservice to the community they leave behind, even if they try to find a new life for themselves.''
 The new life Chon Quey Moy found in his 70's flashes past in five editions of the Manhattan telephone directory. There he is on East Eighth Street through 1962, then on First Avenue near 82nd Street through 1968. By 1970, his name is gone from the Manhattan directory.
 A final accounting appears in a thick black volume marked Deaths and Fetal Deaths Recorded in 1974, City of New York. There, Medical Examiner Case No. 6,532 is described as Moy, Chon. The type is small and the names are dozens to a page, but the space under Boro is marked K, for county of Kings.
 The certificate on file in the Municipal Archives shows that on Oct. 14, 1974, a death was reported in apartment 4R at 560 Lincoln Place. The address is in Crown Heights, not Park Slope but Brooklyn just the same. The man who left the world that day had a wife and a son, and he was first identified as James Moy. On the certificate, someone added Chon Quey, formal nomenclature. 
 But the language of bookkeeping leaves no room for intimacies or nicknames, for neighbors or blocks, for things everybody saw, for airplanes falling out of the sky. The pages do not explain that this vessel, brought down by coronary artery disease after 84 years, was the body of Jimmy the Chinese laundryman, the man who never did return.

HEADLINE: Louisiana's Lifeline in Manhattan

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
More than a thousand miles from New Orleans, in an office building on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, part of the recovery of Louisiana is taking shape.
 There, J. Chester and Freda Johnson, a husband-and-wife team who are the chief financial advisers to Louisiana, have been working to shore up the state's municipal financing in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
In the days after the storms, the two were in frequent contact with the state treasurer and other government officials, advising them to set up conference calls with the credit rating agencies and worried bondholders at a time when reliable information was scarce. They helped the state secure $200 million credit lines from Citigroup and from Merrill Lynch, making money available to cover its immediate cash needs. 
 Now, the Johnsons are assessing new financing ideas, from restructuring existing debts to issuing a new set of bonds backed by payments from the tobacco industry settlements.
 ''When you have a financial crisis of these proportions, people have gotten focused very quickly,'' Mr. Johnson said in a joint interview with his wife in which they frequently finished each other sentences. ''They have not only been realistic, but creative in an effective way.''
 Municipal finance and marriage may not appear to go hand in hand, but in a business built on relationships, personal bonds are as important as the fiscal ones. 
 ''A lot of these bond deals are complicated and bring together a lot of personalities from the public sector: elected officials and investment bankers,'' said Don Yacoe, editor of Tax Credit Advisor, a newsletter that covers the affordable housing market. ''The people who serve as financial advisers have to be conversant in both of those worlds, and Freda and Chester are.''
 John Kennedy, the Louisiana state treasurer, said the Johnsons' work had been essential. ''They understand the complexities and intricacies of municipal finance; they are completely objective and apolitical,'' he said. ''And they look you in the eye and tell you the truth, even if it is something that you don't want to hear.''
 Still, the fiscal challenges ahead are enormous. Louisiana faces as much as a $1.5 billion budget shortfall, and is constrained by a much smaller tax base and state rules that prevent the Legislature from using its rainy day reserves to make it up. Moreover, Mr. Kennedy says the state needs several hundred million dollars more to help small businesses get back on their feet and have money set aside for hard-hit local governments to make the interest payments on their own debts. And the state was recently billed $3.7 billion by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the first of several bills anticipated for its share of the recovery and cleanup.
 Congress is debating several economic recovery measures, and Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco has convened a special session of the Legislature to cut the budget and hammer out a coherent economic redevelopment plan.
 ''It really is a historic event that is still unfolding, and it's really just the initial chapters,'' said Kurt Van Kuller, head of municipal credit research at Merrill Lynch. ''The damage is being assessed, the problems are being discovered, and the key building blocks of reconstruction are still being put together in Washington and Baton Rouge.''
 The story is one the Johnsons have seen before. More than a decade ago, Louisiana state officials engaged their consulting firm, Government Finance Associates, after efforts to recover from the collapse of oil prices in the 1980's mired the state in debt.
 In 1993, Louisiana had the eighth highest per capita debt level in the nation, and the underlying quality of its bonds teetered on junk. The couple advised state politicians to use the bond debt to finance infrastructure projects rather than interest payments, to pay for education and health care programs with about $2.4 billion worth of new state bonds backed by tobacco settlement payments and to practice fiscal restraint. While Louisiana's rating is still the second lowest, behind California, its credit quality has steadily improved and is now ranked 28th in per capita debt. 
 ''Before Katrina, we were being told by the marketplace and rating agencies that we were on the right path,'' Mrs. Johnson said. But a little more than a week after the storm, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service put $8 billion and $9.4 billion in debt on their respective watch lists. Now, she added, ''our focus has shifted.''
 Under a contract awarded by competitive bid, the Johnsons' consulting firm can expect to receive as much as $224,100 this year. 
 The Johnsons met in the 1960's while working as analysts in the Moody's public finance division, but eventually married other people and went their separate ways.
 Mrs. Johnson, 58, a New York City native, stayed on at Moody's to eventually become the head of its municipal bond rating department in the 1980's. She was the New York City rating analyst during the 1970's financial crisis.
 Mr. Johnson, 61, who still speaks with a slight Arkansas twang, became an investment banker and then headed to the Treasury Department during the Carter administration, where he oversaw the federal loan program for New York City. In 1979, he started his own consulting firm.
 After divorces, the two reconnected when they ran into each other at several business meetings and industry conferences. Shortly after they married in 1989, Mrs. Johnson became a business partner, too. 
 While the couple jointly offer financial advice, they each specialize in different tasks. Mrs. Johnson typically handles credit ratings issues; Mr. Johnson negotiates with the underwriters and helps clients set the bond prices. They enjoy taking their work home with them, too. ''It's our life. It's not work,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ''It's what interests us.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Says New Jersey Faces Pain 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 17 

 BODY:
In his first major speech since winning the governor's race last week, Governor-elect Jon S. Corzine warned on Thursday that solving New Jersey's budget and property tax problems would require plenty of ''tough choices'' and ''pain.''
 He told the annual conference of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities here that he would keep his campaign promise to convene a special session of the Legislature next year to develop a plan to reduce property taxes in the state. 
Mr. Corzine, who will be sworn in in January, said he hopes to offer voters a solution on property taxes in a ballot proposal next November. ''I don't look at this as a hopeless exercise,'' he said.
 He also promised to work closely with local officials in the months ahead, and to approach his new job the same way he approached his former job as a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and his current one as a United States senator.
 ''Never back down from a fight,'' said Mr. Corzine. ''Take things on directly and squarely. And stand up for what you believe, regardless of the outcome.''
 Fresh from a four-day vacation in Mexico, Mr. Corzine spoke to nearly 1,000 municipal officials who are part of a system of government that both he and his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, said needed to be streamlined to ease property taxes.
 His appearance here amounted to an informal, if slightly awkward, passing of the torch. The man who preceded him to the lectern was Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, a fellow Democrat who had considered running for a full term but backed out after the wealthy Mr. Corzine said he would spend what he needed to win the state's top job.
 Mr. Codey, who is also the president of the State Senate, did not mince words about how ''leaving will not be easy.'' But he joked that what made the transition easier for him was the ''long list of problems'' he was leaving behind for Mr. Corzine.
 ''Let me condense your transition report for you,'' he said, eliciting chuckles from the crowd. ''We're pretty much broke. We have more debt than we can afford. Next year's budget deficit is at least $5 billion. School construction and transportation funding have virtually dried up. And we have a $1 billion pension payment due next year.''
 But Mr. Codey also said, ''Don't go writing my political obituary, just yet.'' And he proceeded to highlight his priorities for the lame-duck legislative session that will be convened before Mr. Corzine takes over. One of those is coming up for more funding for stem cell research. Another is an indoor smoking ban -- a plan that has run into stiff opposition from Atlantic City's gambling industry.
 Mr. Codey told reporters later that he was amenable to a compromise that would create an exception for the casino floors -- though not the casino restaurants or bars -- in Atlantic City.
 Asked for a reaction, Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden County, the incoming Assembly speaker, expressed concern about the potential economic impact on the casinos, but said that ''there's always room for compromise.''
 For his part, Mr. Corzine said after his remarks, ''I think they're on to the right program.'' Still, he cautioned that he did not want to get involved because ''we have one governor at a time, setting an agenda.'' 
 In addition to dealing with property taxes, Mr. Corzine told municipal officials that he wanted to create a new post of an elected state comptroller who would monitor the state's books. He promised to work hard to make the economy grow.
 Mr. Corzine said he hoped to make his first cabinet appointments in mid-December. But many top Democrats have been consumed in recent days by another prospective appointment: Mr. Corzine's choice for his successor in Washington.
 The governor-elect has remained coy on the subject. But many Democrats say the leading contenders include Mr. Codey and four congressmen: Robert Menendez of Hudson County, Robert E. Andrews of Camden County, Frank Pallone Jr. of Monmouth County and Rush D. Holt of Mercer County.
 Mr. Codey joked about the speculation, when he said that he looked forward to serving in the Senate, but deliberately did not say whether it was the State Senate or the United States Senate. But when asked by reporters afterward about the speculation, he replied, ''I like where I live right now.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Achievement

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Idiots Abroad,'' by John Tierney (column, Nov. 8): 
Poverty rose in Venezuela from 28 percent in the early 1980's to 85 percent when President Hugo Chavez took office. That was the backdrop of his initial victory as a democratically elected alternative to the flawed policies of the past.
 In the years since, social expenditures have risen in net terms to about $5 billion a year; this represents a large transfer of resources to the poor. 
 It has wiped out illiteracy, provided 40 percent of the population with subsidized food and ensured that 18 million people have free health care.
 Venezuela has the fastest-growing economy in Latin America, with growth rates in the first two quarters of 7.5 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Importantly, the non-oil sectors have grown at a faster pace than the oil sector, rising 8.7 percent and 12 percent in the first two quarters of this year.
 This is the right result for Venezuela even if it does not fit the United States' paradigm, or Mr. Tierney's idea of the difference between wisdom and idiocy.

HEADLINE: A Cold War China Policy

 BODY:
President Bush probably won't mention the word ''containment'' when he visits China this weekend. But his hosts can surely be excused for wondering whether his administration is now trying to revive that cold war anti-Soviet strategy and apply it to the very different circumstances of today's complex relationship between Washington and Beijing. 
 China's headlong economic advance presents real challenges to American policy makers, like potentially destabilizing trade and currency imbalances and a growing competition for scarce global energy supplies. But China poses no obvious military threat to the United States at this time. In the one area of potential future conflict, Taiwan, tensions have notably eased in recent months.
Yet for the past few months, the Bush administration has been going out of its way to build up its military ties with countries surrounding China. India and Japan are the two most troubling examples. Washington has pressed ahead with an ill-advised initiative to share civilian nuclear technology with India, despite that country's refusal to abide by the restrictions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And it has actively encouraged an already worrisomely nationalist Japanese government to shed postwar restraints on its military and embrace more ambitious regional security goals. Washington has also taken steps to strengthen military cooperation with Vietnam and Indonesia. Mr. Bush's stopover in Mongolia on Monday will likewise be aimed at cementing a new security partnership.
 The risk is that this neo-containment policy could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading China to start throwing its own military and economic weight around to break out of the containment trap. 
 Asia's great challenge at the start of the 21st century is to find ways to adjust to an economically stronger China without falling into the destructive military rivalries of the past. That, not a new version of containment, should be the central concern right now for the United States, and for Japan and India as well.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investors Pour Money Into Bonds Every Minute, Every Day

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CALL it the trillion-dollar investment.
 The Treasury Department reported this week that foreigners had put a net $1.01 trillion dollars into long-term American securities in the 12 months through September. It was the first time the 12-month total topped that threshold. It is a figure that works out to almost $2 million of investments a minute. 
The strong investments are the flip side to the record trade deficits the United States has been running, since foreigners who sell goods to Americans must do something with the dollars they receive.
 Still, they do not have to put the dollars into private companies, rather than into presumably safer Treasury bonds and securities issued by government-backed agencies. And yet over the last year, nearly half the money did go into corporate bonds and stocks, reflecting a willingness to take risks. For September alone, nearly two-thirds of the monthly record flow of $118.1 billion went into corporate securities. 
 Foreigners have not, it must be said, distinguished themselves as market timers in the United States. The heaviest one-month flow into corporate stocks came in February 2000, when $27.7 billion flooded in, just one month before the technology stock bubble began to deflate. This week, the government reported $24.6 billion flowed into stocks in September, making that the second-largest month ever.
 For 12-month periods, however, stock flows are still far from setting records. The money kept coming in even after shares peaked in 2000, and a total of $188.1 billion flowed in during the 12 months that ended in January 2001. The latest 12-month total is $88.7 billion, but that is more than four times the 12-month flow posted from the summer of 2003 through the summer of 2004.
 Corporate bonds drew in $51.1 billion in September, a little below the record set in June but still the second-best month. On an annual basis, a record $363.8 billion went into corporate bonds.
 Flows into securities of government-backed agencies have not risen as rapidly as those going into corporate securities, but they still set a record of $249.7 billion over the last 12 months. Treasury bonds took in $308.8 billion over the period, well below the record of $403.2 billion set in early 2004.
 There are, presumably, limits to just how much foreign investors are willing to put into United States securities. But so far there is no sign that those investors are having second thoughts about sending millions of dollars to this country every minute of every day.

HEADLINE: The Autumn Upturn Lifts Some Indexes to 4-Year Highs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A late rebound gave Wall Street modest gains yesterday as two acquisitions and upbeat earnings from Hewlett-Packard helped lift some major market indexes to four-year highs. The indexes had their fourth consecutive winning week.
 Lower oil prices also helped stocks, easing worries about consumer spending ahead of the holiday shopping season. But many analysts remain split over whether the market will have its usual year-end rally, and trading has become erratic as mixed economic and earnings data leave investors wondering about the economy's health.
 ''You've had a pretty good run off the October bottoms,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments. ''But there really are no major catalysts to help support the market coming into these levels. 
 ''You don't want to read too much into a Friday of late November,'' he added.
 Crude oil futures fell to five-month lows although the approaching winter still has many concerned about oil and natural gas supplies. A barrel of light crude dropped 20 cents, to $56.14 in New York trading.
 At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 46.11 points, or 0.43 percent, to 10,766.33. Broader stock indicators reached their highest levels since mid-2001. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.47 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,248.27, and the Nasdaq composite rose 6.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,227.07.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.49 percent from 4.46 percent on Thursdeay and the price, which moves inversely to the yield, fell 9/32, to 100 2/32. 
 Although recent reports show the nation withstood the blows dealt by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, investors continue to be uncertain about economic growth and corporate profits. This week brought conflicting data on inflation and retail spending, raising concerns about critical holiday sales.
 For the week, the Dow added 0.75 percent, the S.& P. 500 rose 1.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.12 percent. While the indexes are at four-year highs, their performance for the year to date is mediocre at best: the Dow is down 0.15 percent, the S.& P. 500 is up 3 percent and the Nasdaq is 2.37 percent higher.
 Susan Malley, chief investment officer for Malley Associates Capital Management, said the improving economic and earnings figures have built a foundation that could enable the market to close out the year with double-digit gains. 
 ''Stocks are up 5 percent or 6 percent since their October lows, and the market has broadened considerably -- instead of just energy, most of the sectors are performing,'' Ms. Malley said. Coupled with recent upbeat news, ''that makes me feel optimistic about the rest of the year.''
 Acquisitions led the day's headlines. The networking firm Cisco Systems is buying Scientific-Atlanta, a maker of cable television set-top boxes, for $6.9 billion, or $43 a share. The deal is expected to increase Cisco's 2007 results. Cisco fell 35 cents, to $17.02, and Scientific-Atlanta advanced 70 cents, to $42.15.
 General Electric has agreed to sell most of its insurance business to Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second-largest reinsurer, for $6.8 billion in cash and stock. Swiss Re will also assume $1.7 billion of G.E.'s debt. G.E. gained $1.09, to $35.75.
 In earnings news, Hewlett-Packard said late Thursday that a $1.1 billion restructuring charge caused its quarterly profit to slide 62 percent. But its adjusted earnings handily beat Wall Street estimates as revenue grew across its computer, printer and software divisions. Hewlett-Packard jumped 40 cents, to $29.40.
 Walt Disney sank 79 cents, to $25.20 after posting a 26 percent drop in quarterly profit, which it blamed on weak sales of DVD's and consumer products that offset higher earnings from its television and theme park units.
 The clothing retailer Gap reported on Thursday that its profit declined 20 percent as sales fell modestly, prompting the company to cut its full-year outlook. Gap slid $1.45, to $17.06.
 The women's apparel maker AnnTaylor Stores said its quarterly profit more than doubled as sales expanded by 12 percent. While income topped analysts' expectations, sales lagged behind estimates. AnnTaylor nonetheless jumped $2.14, to $30.42.
 The market could receive some support next week from two economic reports, with the most important of them being the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which is due out Wednesday. On Monday, the Conference Board will release its index of leading economic indicators.

HEADLINE: Agency Plans Updated Fuel Economy Standards

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 18 

 BODY:
New standards for calculating fuel economy ratings on cars and trucks will be proposed by the end of the year, the Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday, but the agency is still not saying exactly how the standards may change. 
 The new standards would be the first revision in 20 years. The goal is to have standards in place for 2008 model year vehicles, which will go on sale in 2007, E.P.A. officials said at a briefing here on Friday.
The current standards are based on vehicles' performance in city driving and on the highway. 
 Under its new program, the E.P.A. plans to also consider factors used by the agency in measuring vehicle emissions. They include how a car performs at high speeds, defined as 80 miles per hour or more; during aggressive driving, in which a vehicle accelerates more than 3.3 miles per hour in a second; while air-conditioning is in use; and during cold temperatures. All these factors can affect fuel economy.
 The goal of the new standards is to make the mileage ratings reflect real-world performance, rather than how vehicles perform under E.P.A. tests.
 But Steven L. Johnson, the agency's administrator, declined to say whether the E.P.A. would go beyond its city-highway calculations and state fuel economy based on how vehicles perform under each of those circumstances.
 ''I'm open to a range of options,'' said Mr. Johnson, who was on his first visit to the agency's automotive testing laboratories here.
 The new calculations could mean that a vehicle would have a different fuel economy rating in the 2007 model year than it does in 2008. That could cause problems for vehicles that come out less fuel efficient under the new standards -- and likewise, give a lift to models whose ratings improve.
 ''Whatever the results are, that's what they'll be,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 Once the proposed standards are published, the agency plans to schedule hearings and receive comments from auto companies, consumer groups and others. That process is likely to last well into 2006.

HEADLINE: Money Takes Up A Lot of Time

 BODY:
I CAN'T believe what it takes to manage my finances these days. I'm not talking about anything complicated, like weighing the merits of exchange-traded funds -- just the endless pile-up of money chores. 
 Here is a recent sample: I never subscribed to Time magazine, yet this month there was a $14.95 subscription charge on my credit card. The service representative said I couldn't cancel the ''order,'' and I didn't have time to press the matter further. Then my mortgage lender sent a notice stating that I had a $532.18 escrow shortage, thanks to a tax increase in my town (what tax increase?). And when a real estate agent ran a credit check a few weeks ago, she found my husband's credit report to be impeccable. Mine, she said in a cheery e-mail message, was blank. 
Blank? I hoped the agent meant she couldn't get access to my report because of the security freeze on my account, in place since an identity theft incident a few months ago. But I haven't had the time to play Ms. Fix-It and sort out these fiscal mysteries. And who does?
 These are the delights of financial life in the 21st century, when managing your money means keeping track of a swirl of maddening fees, capricious terms and fluctuating interest rates -- and that's just to use your home phone.
 ''We're in a new world,'' said Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute (www.ebri.org). With the sharp rise in homeownership, credit card use, and employee-directed health and retirement plans, Mr. Salisbury said, ''individuals are doing far more than they used to do -- and they have to do far more.''
 In theory, the greater number of choices and high-technology alternatives should enable consumers to make the best financial decisions for themselves. In reality, it's time-consuming to track every bleep on one's financial radar -- and harder to see the benefit of doing so.
 If you have a couple of children and three or four cellphones in the household, ''How do you go through a 10-page bill?'' asks Robert J. Glovsky, director for the financial planning program at Boston University. ''The reality is, you don't.''
 Losing track of a few dollars here and there might not be so bad, but the price of not paying attention can be much higher. Credit card companies can raise interest rates for almost any reason, ''including no reason,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Mr. Mierzwinski added that even a supposedly fixed-rate card could be changed with 15 days' notice. And rather than bounce a check, he said, many banks ''make money on the back end by not bouncing your check -- but charging you a fee.''
 YOU might not have read the fine print on this one either, but some banks may include the amount of your overdraft with your balance when you go to a cash machine. So if your actual balance is $100, the machine might say it's $300. ''You might then take out $120 -- and get hit with a $30 fee,'' Mr. Mierzwinski said. ''It's like death by a thousand cuts.''
 Sometimes it feels like a million cuts, especially when you consider how the pressure to be fiscally vigilant takes a toll on one's sanity. Apart from the money you stand to gain or lose, ''you're always kind of worried whether you made the right choices,'' said John de Graaf, co-author of ''Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic.'' 
 ''We're confronted with so many options that don't really add to your quality of life, but they do add to your anxiety,'' Mr. de Graaf said. ''Do I want this product or that product? This plan or that plan? You really can go crazy.''
 So it seems that either you monitor every nickel, dime and surcharge -- and sacrifice your sanity on the altar of fine print and double asterisks -- or you accept the inevitable losses to preserve some free time and peace of mind. 
 Mr. de Graaf, who is also the national coordinator of the Take Back Your Time movement (www.timeday.org), seems to lean toward the latter. ''Sometimes you just have to make a choice and say, 'I have other things to do, I can't obsess about getting the best deal. Life is about more than getting the best deal.' ''
 Perhaps by refusing to dither over one cable-Internet-phone package versus another, one might find time to tackle all those other money chores. I dream of the day when I'll have the resources to figure out my frequent-flier miles. I think I've earned a free ticket or two. But at this rate I may never know.

HEADLINE: Panel Advises New Orleans To Relinquish Purse Strings

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
The city should turn over its finances to a municipal oversight board similar to the one that helped New York through its fiscal crisis in the 1970's, a prominent planning group recommended on Friday.
 The proposal was one of several announced by the group, made up of 35 members of the Urban Land Institute, a planning organization in Washington that Mayor C. Ray Nagin enlisted to advise New Orleans on its rebuilding. After losing most of its residents and tax base in the evacuation after Hurricane Katrina, the city faces a major financial crisis and will have difficulty paying its bills and providing services without major assistance.
Other recommendations included creating a new redevelopment agency that would take ownership of blighted or abandoned homes throughout New Orleans and restoring slivers of wetlands throughout the city, especially in low-lying areas where housing was most ravaged by the storm. 
 By offering a list of policy recommendations in a debate that has until now been largely devoid of specifics, the institute has opened a new chapter in the slow-moving effort to devise a blueprint for rebuilding. ''This should get us talking frankly about some of the stuff we need to deal with, particularly extremely low-lying areas and areas where we have a low-income black population,'' said Joseph C. Canizaro, a wealthy developer who is on the commission the mayor named to draw up a master plan for New Orleans by year-end. ''A lot of people have been dodging around that so far.'' 
 The institute's planners did not recommend that entire low-lying neighborhoods be returned to marshland, a politically volatile idea that some environmentalists have suggested. But they did suggest that fingers of land in some of those neighborhoods be reserved for drainage in case of flooding and not be rebuilt. The land could be used for parks, the planners said.
 In select neighborhoods, the planners said, the city should forbid individuals from rebuilding on their own ''because the challenges there are so great that it might be a place for collective action,'' said Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York and the Urban Land Institute chairwoman. The idea is to avoid what panelists dubbed the ''jack-o-lantern syndrome,'' with large gaps between homes on a given block. 
 But the panel left to local leaders the decisions on which neighborhoods should have limits on development, choices fraught with the politics of race and class. ''We don't have a map that says what blocks should be classified what way,'' Ms. Taylor said. 
 Other recommendations include a proposal that employers in the city be required to pay a ''living wage'' and a requirement that developers of new housing set aside 10 percent to 20 percent of their units for low- and moderate-income residents. The panel also suggested that city leaders focus in the near-term on neighborhoods that suffered the least damage from Hurricane Katrina and the flooding that followed. 
 ''There are areas of the city we're recommending not be rebuilt right now,'' said Smedes York, the panel chairman and a former mayor of Raleigh, N. C. He did not specify which ones.
 The panelists spoke glowingly about New Orleans as a city rich in character and culture, but several had harsh words for a local political apparatus that at least one called ''dysfunctional.''
 ''I appreciate their bluntness, and I know they could have been even blunter,'' said Barbara Major, a community activist who is co-chairwoman of the mayor's commission. ''They've given us some very difficult, tough choices to make.'' 
 The recommendations came after seven weeks of study and included interviews with more than 300 residents. Members of the panel received no payment for their services. 
 The proposed municipal oversight board, which under the panel's plan would control the city's finances for five years, is likely to be one of the more contentious issues the mayor's commission will debate in the coming weeks. As conceived, the seven-member board would be made up of three members chosen by President Bush, two by Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, one by the mayor and one by the City Council.
 The panel would oversee the city's budget, approve all contracts and help insure fairness in obtaining federal funds, the planners said.

HEADLINE: The Shape of Taxes to Come

 BODY:
There are important differences in the two tax bills now moving through the Senate and the House. Depending on how the bills are melded into one, the American people could end up with a train wreck of a tax law, or a reasonable compromise. 
 The Senate, to its credit, passed a bill yesterday that leaves out the most offensive item that was under consideration: a $21 billion provision to delay for two years the expiration of special low tax rates on investment income. The preferential rates don't expire until the end of 2008 anyway, and they overwhelmingly benefit well-heeled taxpayers. So a majority on the Senate tax committee rightly concluded that extending them now would be both needlessly expensive and a slap in the face for America's poor, who face deep budget cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other government programs. 
To its further credit, the Senate has included a justifiable extension, through 2006, of a provision to protect 14 million taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. The alternative tax was created to prevent excessive tax sheltering by a few thousand multimillionaires. But it increasingly -- and unfairly -- afflicts taxpayers much further down the income scale, so Congress must routinely pass relief measures. The cost: $29 billion. 
 The House took the opposite tack from the Senate: its version includes the two-year extension of the investor tax breaks and omits relief from the alternative tax. In other words, it has tax cuts for the rich and no protection for middle class taxpayers, wrapped up in a budget that cuts deeply into programs for the poor. The only sign that House leaders feel squeamish about their skewed priorities is that they postponed a vote on the tax bill until after the House's two-week Thanksgiving break, thus putting some distance between the passage of the program cuts yesterday and the coming vote on tax cuts. 
 The worst-case outcome from the competing tax bills would be a deal that allowed for the passage of both the extended investor tax breaks and the alternative tax relief, without coming up with a way to pay for either. That would worsen the deficit, recently $319 billion, by an estimated total of $50 billion over the next five years, even as programs for the poor were gutted. Running a big budget deficit when there isn't a recession is ludicrous. Adding to it by locking in investor tax cuts that don't even expire for three more years is lunacy.
 With ideology driving tax policy, it may seem beside the point, but common sense mitigates against extending the investor tax cuts. A priority of President Bush, they were conceived at a time of surpluses -- pre 9/11, pre-Iraq, pre-Katrina -- and before Mr. Bush's approval ratings tanked. They're no longer affordable or even relevant to the nation's most pressing needs -- if they ever were. 
 Instead, lawmakers should extend only the must-pass items that are expiring this year, like alternative-tax relief. To defray that cost, Congress can adopt the corporate-loophole closers in the Senate bill, worth $14 billion over five years. Lawmakers should also postpone the scheduled start next year of $27 billion in tax breaks that would allow high-income taxpayers, most of them making more than $200,000 a year, to take bigger write-offs for their dependents and other expenses.
 In our present budget and political situation, the guiding principle for tax cutting must surely be that less is more.

HEADLINE: Southern Exposure

BYLINE: By James C. Cobb. 
James C. Cobb, a professor of history at the University of Georgia, is the author of ''Away Down South: A History of Southern Identity.''

DATELINE: Athens, Ga. 

 BODY:
IN 1964, when the blood and terror of Freedom Summer prompted many Americans to condemn the South as backward and bigoted, the historian Howard Zinn struck a nerve with his suggestion that ''the nation reacts emotionally to the South precisely because it sees itself there.'' Now, as Americans rebuild from the wreckage and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, they see another portrait in time, one that tells us much about what has and hasn't changed in the South in recent years, as well as about what the South can still tell the rest of the nation about itself. 
 At the very least, Hurricane Katrina put the lie to a generation's worth of ballyhoo about the newfound prosperity of the Sunbelt South. It showed us not only the impoverished and immobile masses of New Orleans, but the shack-dwelling, hand-to-mouth lives of thousands of others within the three-state swath of its hellish destruction. Here the disaster laid bare the shackling legacy of generations of pursuing industry through promises of low-wage, nonunion labor and minimal taxation and the correspondingly inadequate investment in public education, health and social welfare in the South. 
Many of the places leveled by the hurricane were one-industry towns that had been reduced to no-industry towns when low-paying, tax-exempted, union-free employers repaid their hospitality by heading east or farther south where even cheaper labor and lower taxes awaited them. If Sherman originated urban renewal in Atlanta, Hurricane Katrina may have accomplished small-scale urban removal along the Gulf Coast, considering the number of towns that will likely never be rebuilt.
 Even before the hurricane, more than two-thirds of the poverty-level families with children in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama fell into the ''working poor'' category. This figure is pretty much standard across the Old Confederacy, meaning that a great many Southerners beyond the physical reach of the storm would also be at the mercy of any such catastrophe of similar proportions. However, the same might be said for the almost equally prevalent working poor in such decidedly un-Southern locales as Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where folks have been laid low by wholesale outsourcing of jobs and economic policies that have left real wages stagnant and a social safety net in ever greater disrepair.
 No Americans have had more experience with burden-bearing than Southerners, white and black. In this they have been well served by traits they exhibited repeatedly in dealing with Hurricane Katrina, especially their willingness to suffer extreme hardship and even death rather than sever their enduring ties to place, family and community.
 Indeed, while Katrina may have bared the lie behind the New South's supposed prosperity, it has also highlighted a remarkable shift in racial attitudes. The small towns throughout the hurricane area where the rabidly segregationist Citizens' Councils once flourished produced some striking scenes of black and white Southerners in physical and emotional embrace, commiserating about what they had lost and sharing what they had left. 
 As community after community across the South opened its arms to the displaced, small-town papers were awash in stories about middle-class whites who had obviously made homeless and penniless evacuees the first black guests ever to sit at their tables and sleep on their sheets. These breakthroughs might seem especially emblematic of change in Southern white racial attitudes, but my guess is that there were a lot of these ''firsts'' registered as well in homes above the Mason-Dixon line where Hurricane Katrina victims found shelter. 
 Hurricane Katrina should also have demonstrated to skeptical blue-staters that the South's vaunted religiosity amounts to more than a convenient vehicle for political manipulation of the ignorant, unthinking masses. Black and white survivors told story after story of reciting the Lord's Prayer or the 23rd Psalm as the storm raged around them, and though left penniless, homeless and uninsured, they expressed both gratitude and absolute confidence that the Lord would protect and provide.
 If the Hurricane Katrina experience reveals that the South remains in many ways what Mr. Zinn described as a ''marvelously useful'' mirror where other Americans can see some of their nation's most egregious flaws magnified, it also suggests that in looking southward these days they should recognize some of its most admirable virtues writ large as well.

HEADLINE: Congress Rushes to Tie Up Loose Ends Before Break

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Edmund L. Andrews and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
After forcing through nearly $50 billion in budget cuts in an early morning vote, House Republican leaders put off a fight over $56 billion in tax breaks on Friday as the House and Senate rushed to close up shop after weeks of party infighting and battles with Democrats.
 As they scrambled to tie up loose ends before a Thanksgiving break, Congressional leaders also temporarily abandoned efforts to reach agreements on other contentious legislation, including a renewal of the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act and spending bills for health and education programs and the Pentagon. 
Several House Republicans encouraged the leadership to delay the vote on tax breaks, fearing the political symbolism of approving tax benefits for investors and other affluent Americans just hours after narrowly winning passage of a budget attacked by Democrats for its limits on programs for the poor. Party leaders said they decided it was time to head home after a grueling day on Thursday in which Republicans eked out a 217-to-215 victory on the budget cuts after an embarrassing defeat on a spending bill.
 ''I don't think the members are ready to stay here until 2:00 in the morning another day, and we'll do this when we get back,'' said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 Republican and floor leader.
 The Senate also cleared its desk, approving two spending bills after senators adopted their own package of $60 billion in tax cuts early Friday. The White House quickly threatened a veto of the Senate's tax plan because it contains a one-year, $5 billion windfall profits tax on the nation's biggest oil companies. 
 The White House also expressed its strong displeasure at a provision that would raise $15 billion over 10 years from companies and people who use certain kinds of tax shelters. And it was dismayed that the Senate omitted one of President Bush's top economic priorities of the year, an extension of his 2003 tax cut on stock dividends and capital gains.
 While House Republicans celebrated the narrow budget victory, nearly six weeks in the making, they face a difficult time in reaching a final agreement with the Senate because of differences in their approaches. The Senate backed a plan that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling. But House leaders were forced to strip that element from their bill to win the support of moderates who say they have enough votes to block any final plan that includes drilling.
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who promised quick action on the tax cuts when the House returns in early December, said Republicans would confront the budget challenge later but first wanted to savor Friday's victory after weeks of tumult in their ranks on spending and taxes.
 ''We got through the first round,'' Mr. Hastert said. ''You've got to get through the first round before you get to the championship. And we hope we're getting there.''
 In their push for greater budget cuts over the next five years to mollify conservatives, the House leadership had to soften the impact of the measure on food stamp recipients and poor Americans who rely on Medicaid in order to win votes from Northeastern Republicans and other centrists who were balking.
 ''The final product reflects a lot of hard work on the part of moderates,'' said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York.
 In the end, 14 Republicans joined 200 Democrats and an independent in opposing the budget plan backed by 217 Republicans. 
 Its backers portrayed it as a modest effort to slow the growth in federal spending while making overdue changes to a wide range of benefit programs that have been exploding in cost. Critics said that it took too great a toll on Americans who rely on federal aid and that any savings would be consumed by the proposed tax cuts.
 Despite some anxiety among moderates over the tax cuts, Mr. Hastert said that he intended to move ahead with the plan when the House comes back and that he wants to hold to the lower rates on capital gains and stock dividends.
 ''We want to continue to create jobs in this country,'' he said. ''I think that's an important piece of that legislation.''
 Even if the House succeeds, Senate and House Republicans have developed almost entirely different tax-cutting bills, in part because Senate Republicans made concessions to Republican moderates and Democrats who balked at cutting taxes mainly for the wealthy.
 The Senate bill provides for more than $80 billion worth of tax cuts over the next five years. But it also includes about $20 billion worth of tax increases, like a steep one-time tax on oil companies and a measure that would give prosecutors a new tool to impose heavy penalties on people who avoid taxes with accounting schemes that lack ''economic substance.''
 The House and Senate approved final spending bills covering veterans' spending and military construction as well as transportation, treasury and housing programs and were trying to resolve last-minute procedural snags. In writing the treasury measure, negotiators dropped a Senate plan to block annual pay raises for Congress, clearing the way for a $3,100 pay increase.
 Major spending measures for health and education programs -- the bill defeated Thursday in the House -- and the military are snagged in disputes and will not be considered until next month at the earliest; spending for those agencies is covered under a stop-gap bill.
 Congress also put off until December legislation to extend the USA Patriot Act, the antiterrorism law passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. With Senate Democrats and some Republicans threatening to filibuster the measure, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his colleagues needed more time to review a draft produced by House and Senate negotiators.
 The main sticking point, Mr. Specter said, was a dispute over a ''sunset provision'' that would permit the extension to remain in effect for seven years without Congressional action to renew it. Democrats, including Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, want the period shortened to four years. Mr. Specter said he hopes to reach a compromise after the Thanksgiving recess.

PERSON: Joseph Monserrat

HEADLINE: Joseph Monserrat, 84, Leader In Efforts to Unify Latinos 

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Joseph Monserrat, a leader among Puerto Ricans in New York and the continental United States beginning in the days of their mass migration in the 1950's, died last Sunday at a nursing home in Greenwich Village. He was 84 and lived in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
 His family said he died after a long illness. 
In more recent decades, Mr. Monserrat, a former member and president of the city's Board of Education, had been active in efforts to unite Latinos of various national origins and give them a unified voice in the political arena. His earlier high-profile public career was crippled in the 1970's when he was forced to resign from the school board amid allegations of corruption.
 Joseph Monserrat grew up in poverty. Born in Bayamon, P.R., he came to New York when he was 3 or 5 and lived in a foster home for a time. He lived with his father and stepmother in East Harlem, did well in public schools and served in the Army Air Force in World War II. 
 He then attended the New School for Social Research and Columbia University, studying economics, public relations and opinion research as well as sociology. He also worked as a community organizer in settlement houses, helping new arrivals from Puerto Rico. As a member of the city's Youth Board, he started working with street gangs.
 From 1951 to 1969 he directed the New York office of the newly formed Migration Division of the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico, also serving as deputy director of the national office. In that capacity he helped Puerto Ricans look for work on the potato farms of Long Island, in city factories and even in rural Ohio. As farm work dwindled, he helped people find new sources of income and homes in the suburbs. He became a liaison between the newcomers and the political representatives of the established communities. 
 The migration division also ran programs in education, social services, cultural affairs and research. He became its national director in 1960, overseeing 13 offices around the country with a staff of more than 200. 
 He branched out to deal with related Hispanic concerns involving Latinos of all origins, through social and religious groups around the country.
 He also pressed the cause of education for people with inadequate English skills. He served on the New York Moreland Commission on Welfare, the state advisory committee to the Unites States Civil Rights Commission, various commissions on manpower and the exploitation of workers, and the Knapp Commission, which investigated police corruption. 
 In 1969, Herman Badillo, burough president of the Bronx, nominated him for the Bronx seat on an interim Board of Education. The previous board was disbanded after a school-construction scandal several years earlier. He was elected board president, serving two one-year terms, but was forced to suspend himself in 1975. 
 In 1977, Mr. Monserrat pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge in two indictments against him, admitting a conflict of interest involving an audio-visual company that did business with the city schools. He was fined $1,000, and forfeited his place on the school board. 
 He established a consulting business and, over the years, regained his voice as a community leader. He worked for national Puerto Rican business and marketing groups and in the early 1980's was president of the Minority Business and Marketing Association. He was an under secretary in the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States in the 1990's and, most recently, served as a consultant to Hostos Community College in the Bronx. 
 Mr. Monserrat is survived by his wife, Judith Reiss; a daughter from a previous marriage, Dr. Laura Monserrat of Manhattan; a sister, Olga Bello of Charleston, N. C.; and a granddaughter. His first marriage, to Josephine Monserrat, a Manhattan resident, ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: City's Private Sector Shows Biggest Job Loss for October

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
New York City lost 11,000 jobs in October -- an 11 percent decrease from September. It is the greatest month-to-month loss since late 2003. 
 The city's private sector lost 9,400 jobs, led in part by the construction industry, where the number of jobs fell by 2,000; in the public sector, jobs decreased by 1,600.
 While some industries continue to show robust increases -- the securities industry, which was hammered in 2001, grew somewhat in October -- many other areas showed modest increases or even steep declines. 
 For instance, in health services, which has led the city's recovery from the recession earlier in the decade, 2,300 jobs dried up last month, and 1,200 jobs in the transportation business were lost. The construction industry now employs 109,600 people, the lowest level since March 1999, when seasonally adjusted.
 Tom Stabile, the editor of New York Construction, a trade publication, said the decrease in construction jobs was likely due to heavy rainfall during October, as well as the completion of several large projects in the city this fall.
 The film industry, which has enjoyed new tax benefits given by the Bloomberg administration, has still gained only 200 jobs this year, and the insurance industry has lost 1.5 percent of its workers over the year. 
 The total drop in city employment last month was the greatest since September 2003, when the number of city jobs fell 10 percent. 
 ''The magnitude of the loss is surprising,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate firm, ''as are the industries that sustained the greatest losses: health services and construction. 
 ''Health services has added jobs in nearly every month since 1990,'' Ms. Denham added. 
 ''And residential construction seems to still be on the rise. This could prove to be a temporary aberration, but both industries warrant watching.'' 
 Anyone considering new career options can look to some areas of employment where growth has been consistent all year. 
 Management consulting jobs, for instance, are up nearly 10 percent this year, and jobs in computer systems design have grown nearly 7 percent.
 And while professional business services lost 1,500 jobs last month, the number of people employed in the sector is up 2.3 percent year to date. 
 Most notable to many economists was the growth last month of 1,700 jobs in the securities industry, a field whose fortunes drive much of the local economy, although the industry has yet to recover to the heights it reached in early 2001.
 ''Finance, and especially securities, looks pretty strong,'' said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''My sense is that New York City's economy is doing pretty well.''

HEADLINE: Julius Edelstein, 93, Dies; Devised CUNY's Open Admissions 

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Julius C. C. Edelstein, a primary architect of open admissions at the City University of New York in the late 1960's, died on Friday morning at New York Hospital. He was 93. 
 His daughter, Suzy E. E. Edelstein, said the cause was complications of pneumonia.
Although he never graduated from college -- he dropped out of the University of Wisconsin, where he was studying medicine, for health reasons -- he became a senior vice chancellor of the City University of New York and devoted nearly 40 years to the battle to ensure that economically and educationally disadvantaged students had access to a college education. 
 At a celebration honoring him three years ago, Mr. Edelstein described how he had worked closely with CUNY's chancellor, Albert H. Bowker, to find ways to admit more minority students. 
 ''Al Bowker was really the one who thought up open admissions, and I was his handyman,'' Mr. Edelstein said, adding that at the time, minority students accounted for only 1.5 percent of the enrollment at CUNY's senior colleges.
 Mr. Edelstein also worked with Shirley Chisholm, Percy Sutton, Charles B. Rangel, Basil A. Paterson, Anthony J. Travia and others to win financing and draft legislation for the SEEK program to help poorly educated low-income students enroll in CUNY's senior colleges with financial and educational support.
 Open admissions followed, paving the way for a surge in the number of white and minority students who would not otherwise have been accepted at the four-year colleges. CUNY's enrollment jumped from fewer than 100,000 students to more than 250,000. And with that growth came charges that the university had debased its standards. 
 As the criticism mounted, Mr. Edelstein remained convinced that educating disadvantaged students was the appropriate role for a public urban university.
 ''For all of its shortcomings, City University is the social engine of the city,'' he said in 1998 as Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pressed CUNY to bar students unprepared for college work. ''The attempt to convert it into Swarthmore or Harvard is ridiculous, and is not what people of New York need.''
 Mr. Edelstein was bitter when CUNY's board tightened admissions standards for its bachelor's degree programs, but later came to accept that the new policies had not brought about the ''destruction'' of the university.
 Julius Caesar Claude Edelstein was born in Milwaukee on Feb. 29, 1912. His parents were Russian immigrants, and Mr. Edelstein said he inherited his concern for the downtrodden from his father, who was the general secretary of the Social Revolutionary Party in Czarist Russia. 
 Mr. Edelstein spent much of his career in politics, before moving to CUNY in 1966. After leaving Wisconsin, he worked for the United Press, and then joined Franklin D. Roosevelt's White House.
 During World War II, Mr. Edelstein served as an aide to Admiral William D. Leahy. When the war ended, he worked for the United States high commissioner in the Philippines, Paul V. McNutt, and then as an adviser to the president of the Philippines. He then worked for the secretary of state on the problem of reparations before becoming Senator Herbert H. Lehman's executive assistant and chief of legislative staff. After serving as executive vice chairman of the New York Citizens Committee for Kennedy and Johnson, he became executive assistant to Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1961, and rose to deputy mayor. 
 Under Mayor Wagner, he dealt with issues like how to handle the city's water supply during drought and whether cellar apartments should be disallowed. He also served as executive secretary of the city's antipoverty board. The mayor lent Mr. Edelstein to Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for the Senate, to advise him on Jewish and Israeli issues. (Mr. Edelstein met his first wife, Rivka Ben-David, while she was assistant military attache to the Israeli Embassy in Washington. They married in 1955. She died in 1964.) 
 When Mayor Wagner decided not to run for re-election, Mr. Edelstein joined CUNY. He later said that because he suggested New York City follow Wisconsin's model in using the university ''as a sort of laboratory'' for state government, ''Chancellor Bowker said: 'O.K., I'll hire you. Now you do what you told me to do.' '' 
 He retired as senior vice chancellor in 1984, but remained at CUNY, teaching, writing and continuing to lobby for the education of the disadvantaged. In the late 1990's, he helped form Friends of CUNY, a group that lobbied unsuccessfully to keep remedial classes in the senior colleges.
 Mr. Edelstein's second wife, the former Nancy Harris Palmer, whom he married in 1985, died in 1996. In addition to his daughter Suzy, he is survived by two stepdaughters, Helena P. Chapin of Rochester and Dudley Palmer of Acton, Mass.; four stepgrandchildren; and six stepgreat-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Doctor of Girl, 7, Who Died Says He Made Abuse Report

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON and LESLIE KAUFMAN; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A Brooklyn pediatrician recalled yesterday how a 7-year-old girl who died last month of severe internal injuries was brought to him two years ago with a broken leg -- and how he accused the father of beating her and notified child welfare authorities.
 The girl, Sierra Roberts, died on Oct. 25. Her father, Russell Roberts, 43, was charged on Thursday with beating her with his knee and with a belt in the two days before her death, causing a ruptured bowel and extensive internal lacerations.
 Sierra, who tested positive for cocaine after she was born and was placed in foster care, was returned to her father in 2001. She came to the attention of child welfare authorities once after that -- after her father brought her to the office of Dr. Rakesh K. Dua in 2003 with a broken leg. Only five months earlier the doctor had treated her for a fractured spine.
 In an interview yesterday, Dr. Dua said he had contacted the city's Administration for Children's Services and the state hot line for child abuse, saying he suspected that her father had caused those injuries. The city agency confirmed yesterday that the doctor had spoken to it. But it said its records showed he told it that although he was concerned, he did not suspect abuse. 
 ''I remember it clearly,'' Dr. Dua, 50, said in his Canarsie office. He showed a reporter Sierra's records, which contained a list of names and numbers he said he had called and a fax number at the city agency to which he said he had sent 14 pages of records.
 ''Personally, I feel the authorities messed up,'' he said. ''Something is not right.''
 The doctor said Mr. Roberts told him that Sierra fractured her spine when she tripped and that she broke her leg when he was carrying her up the stairs and dropped her. 
 ''He gave me some stupid explanation,'' he recalled, ''he said she had slipped from his hands. It was obvious that the injuries were nonaccidental. Nobody that age sustains that severe an injury just by falling.''
 The pediatrician said that he had told Mr. Roberts that he was going to report him, and that Mr. Roberts had said, ''Go do it.'' Dr. Dua said that he made the calls and that he expressed that he thought the father had caused Sierra's injuries.
 The children's services agency never acted to remove Sierra from her home.
 Sharman Stein, the agency's director of communications, said records indicated that the pediatrician first saw Sierra in December 2002 for the fractured spine and made no report at that time.
 He then saw Sierra in May of 2003 for the broken leg. At that time, agency records show, Ms. Stein said, Dr. Dua called the injury in to the state, but ''was explicit that he did not suspect abuse.''
 Ms. Stein emphasized that the state hot line was an independent organization. 
 ''If he had been concerned that this child had been abused and phoned that report in, that report would have come to us as an abuse report,'' she said. ''It did not.''
 When workers from child welfare came to investigate anyway, Dr. Dua again reiterated that he did not suspect abuse, Ms. Stein said. 
 She added that although Sierra had been seen by numerous doctors at different institutions for the injuries and had been in rehabilitation for more than three months, agency records show that none of those professionals called in any concerns to the state. By law, doctors must report injuries if they suspect child abuse.
 For the second time in two weeks, a birth parent has been charged in the death of a child who had been placed in foster care by the city and then returned to the home. 
 Last week, Tracina Vaughn was charged with reckless endangerment in Brooklyn because, prosecutors said, she had left her 16-month-old son, Dahquay Gillians, unsupervised in the bathtub, where he drowned.
 Sierra lived with her father, who regained custody of her after taking parenting classes. Yesterday, a law enforcement official described a troubled relationship between the girl and her unemployed father.
 Neighbors said Mr. Roberts -- who pleaded not guilty to the charges against him -- walked his daughter daily to Public School 42 and would not let her interact with neighbors. According to the prosecutors, Mr. Roberts told detectives that he was tough on his daughter; for example, he made her write repeatedly, ''I have to be a good girl.'' 
 ''There was a lot of stress in that house, they did not have any money, he really was not gainfully employed and it was difficult,'' the law enforcement official said. 
 ''I think they were just dirt poor, and I think he was a very controlling guy and had cut her off,'' the official added. ''She just didn't have touch with the foster family anymore that she loved a lot. She did go to school, but there wasn't much contact with the outside world other than that.''
 Sierra's foster parents, Alonzo and Mary Freeman, live in Jamaica, not far from the house Sierra and her father shared on Hillmeyer Avenue in the Rockaways. Since last Christmas, Mr. Roberts has forbidden his daughter from having contact with them, becoming angry, apparently, because she had referred to Mr. Freeman as Dad, the law enforcement official said.
 The Freemans wanted Mr. Roberts to allow them to spend time with the girl, the official said, adding, ''They'd say 'Let her stay there,' or they would buy her things and the little girl would call him 'dad' and that was not tolerable.''
 Referring to the foster family, the official said, ''She missed them.''
 The Freemans called Sierra, nicknamed C. C., a happy, talented and bright girl who enjoyed sharing a room upstairs with their granddaughter, Camille, and considered all the children in their home her siblings. They said that Sierra's mother, Mitchelena Hines, was H.I.V. positive and had lived in the South for years. 
 When Mr. Roberts prepared to take custody of Sierra, Mr. Freeman said, ''I invited him to join our family, and he accepted.''
 Although he had an apartment nearby, Mr. Roberts often slept at their home with Sierra, and, like his daughter, he also called them Mama and Dad, he said. 
 Even after moving into his home in the Rockaways, he would often spend weekends there and leave Sierra with them for weekends, they said. 
 While working at a Nathan's restaurant, Mr. Roberts got into a fight with his manager, Mrs. Freeman said, and on Christmas Day last year he began fighting with one of the Freemans' teenage grandsons.
 ''He just grabbed Sierra and said, 'We're leaving,' '' she said. ''He never brought her around again or called. Her toys and clothes are still here.''
 After her death, when it was still unclear how Sierra died, he went back. The Freemans invited him to stay with them. For five days, he sat around the house crying intermittently and did odd jobs like raking leaves, the Freemans said.

HEADLINE: How to Tame Entertainment Budgets Gone Wild

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You probably spend more on entertainment than you do on groceries, clothing or gasoline. 
 If you don't believe it, take a few minutes to total your monthly costs, starting with the services that have you locked in: basic cable television, and any premium channels, like HBO or Showtime; Netflix to rent videos; TiVo for digital recording; your high-speed Internet connection; and perhaps, satellite radio and streaming music like Yahoo Music. You are already up to about $200 a month, or $2,400 a year.
Don't forget your iTunes music and video downloads, plus magazines, movie rentals, movie tickets, live shows and sporting events. 
 Add in your cellphone and any of its video, data and premium content. 
 The average American spends more on entertainment than on gasoline, household furnishings and clothing and nearly the same amount as spent on dining out, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Among the affluent, the 20 percent of households with more than $77,000 a year in pretax income, more money is spent on entertainment -- $4,516 a year -- than on health care, utilities, clothing or food eaten at home.
 The average income of households in that quintile is a little more than $127,000. Because they account for a disproportionate share of spending in the economy, they are the group that trend watchers and marketers focus on. (From the unexplained fact department: People in the western part of the country spend about 20 percent more on entertainment than the national average, the government statisticians also show.)
 Over the last 10 years, outlays for entertainment outpaced overall expenditures. Spending on health care and education, which almost doubled in that period, grew faster.
 Entertainment budgets will only grow larger. With a proliferation of electronics like giant flat-screen TV's, video iPods and devices to send music, photos and video from room to room in your house, not to mention a proliferation of services to deliver entertainment on cellphones and laptops, you will be opening your wallet more often. 
 How do you get a handle on it? 
 Take up shadow puppets, perhaps, and enjoy good conversations in front of the fireplace? 
 Not likely; for all the talk of the Information Age, we are really in the Entertainment Age, where our lives are centered on the pursuit of happiness. Nevertheless, innovation may actually offer ways to trim costs, if technology does not first spur us to consume ever more entertainment.
 Consider Netflix. Before Reed Hastings came up with the idea of mailing DVD's in a flimsy red envelope, your only option was renting movies at the neighborhood video store for $3.50 a pop (before sales tax). 
 Netflix charges a flat fee of $17.99 plus tax a month for all the videos you can watch. If you watch six DVD's a month, you are doing better than the video store. Watch enough of them and you can drive the cost below 75 cents a movie and save $120 a month over going to a video store. The trick is, of course, to watch the movies right after receiving them and return them as quickly as possible. 
 A middle school science teacher in Seattle, Justin Baeder, wondered whether he saved very much getting his DVD's through the mail. So he created an Excel spreadsheet that calculates exactly how much he does save. It turned out to be just a little, about $6 a month, but he loves Netflix and keeps using it. 
 He's posted the calculator on his Web blog, the Republic of Geektronica at www.geektronica.com. All you need to do is download it and paste your Netflix rental history, which Netflix provides on its site, into the spreadsheet.
 Netflix's success -- it now has 3.6 million subscribers -- has attracted other entrepreneurs to its business model. For $15 a month, Gamefly sends two video game discs for any of the game machines like the Microsoft Xbox and the new Xbox 360, DS from Nintendo or PSP and PS2 from Sony. As with Netflix, as soon as you send one back, you are sent another one. 
 A subscription looks pretty smart when you consider a new game costs as much as $50 and your children (O.K., you) get bored with it after eight hours of play. 
 Another option is to buy used games from stores like EB Games or GameSpot. (New releases show up quickly and go for about half price.)
 The game industry is trying to push prices higher for the hottest games, to as much as $60, but even at that price, on a dollar-to-minutes-of-enjoyment basis, video games may be one of the best values, about 12.5 cents a minute for the easily bored, or fractions of a penny for those who can play ''Half Life'' their whole life. 
 Among the worst?
 Live opera works out to about 37 cents a minute, for a middling seat in the New York Metropolitan Opera house to hear ''Aida,'' compared with 7 cents a minute for ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' at a Loews Cineplex. 
 But a Gwen Stefani concert, in again, middling seats, is about $1.25 a minute and that's with a serving of Black Eyed Peas thrown in. 
 If you accept statistics that the average American's TV is on eight hours a day, a $100-a-month cable bill is really only a bit more than half a cent for each minute of entertainment. 
 Yahoo Music adopted the subscription model as well. Instead of paying 99 cents to download a song on iTunes, Yahoo charges $5 a month, if you pay for a year's subscription upfront, so you can download as many songs as you want onto your computer or MP3 player.
 It's cheaper than iTunes, though the selection of music isn't as extensive. Napster and RealNetworks have a similar service. 
 There is a rub. As long as you keep paying the subscription, Yahoo lets you keep the music; when you stop, the music stops. In fact, it will disappear right off your computer.
 That is the genius of subscriptions. But in Yahoo we also see just how costly the reliance becomes. Just a few months after starting the service, Yahoo doubled the price. If you don't pay it, you lose the music. That may be one reason it has been slow to catch on despite being cheaper than iTunes. 
 Here's a tip: If you want to put payment of your subscriptions on automatic, use a credit card rather than have payments deducted straight from a bank account. It's easier to manage credit card payments and it may be easier to monitor for price increases. 
 But we've only been nibbling around edges so far. It's the D.S.L., cable and phone bills that are bleeding you. The Federal Communications Commission recently studied cable prices and found that in those areas with competition, fees rose 3.6 percent in 2003 compared with a rate of 5.6 percent in those regions without competition. In the 1990's, they were sometimes rising as much as three times the rate of inflation. 
 The cable industry says that rate increases have moderated so that they now are just a bit more than the overall rate of inflation and wage growth.
 A new pricing system may offer some temporary relief. Since cable companies offer Internet service and phone service, Internet service providers offer phone service, and phone companies offer cable TV and Internet service as well as cable TV services over the Internet, they are trying to lock up consumers in this new topsy-turvy world with bundled services.
 It is called triple play or quadruple play (four-play presumably being too racy), and it offers some advantages to consumers. Sprint Nextel recently announced a joint venture with five of the largest cable TV companies to offer a co-branded wireless device next year that will stream video over a wireless network. 
 SBC Communications, soon to be renamed AT&T, says that 66 percent of its customers already have some form of bundled service, usually phone and Internet service. It is offering a ''super bundle promotion'' of D.S.L. Internet service, satellite TV and long-distance phone service for $100. One can also throw Cingular wireless phone service into the bundle. It claims that a consumer can save $89 to $179 a month depending on the level of phone service they get. 
 Companies are finding that because consumers perceive a value, they end up upgrading to higher tiers of service. 
 ''There is a barrier to exit,'' admitted Frank Mona, executive director of consumer marketing for SBC, ''but it is not huge. In this competitive environment, we can't afford not to do that.''
 Of course not. As long as we get more entertainment, we'll pretend not to notice.

HEADLINE: For a G.M. Family, the American Dream Vanishes

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Detroit for this article.

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. 

 BODY:
Four generations of the Roy family relied on General Motors for their prosperity. 
 Over more than seven decades, the company's wages bought the Roys homes, cars and once-unimaginable comforts, while G.M.'s enviable medical and pension benefits have kept them secure in their retirements.
But the G.M. that was once an unassailable symbol of the nation's industrial might is a shadow of its former self, and the post-World War II promise of blue-collar factory work being a secure path to the American dream has faded with it.
 After a long slide, it now looks like the end of an era. ''General Motors, when I got in there, it was like I'd died and went to heaven,'' said Jerry Roy, 49 -- who started at G.M. in 1977 and now works on an assembly line at a plant operated by Delphi, the bankrupt former G.M. parts unit that was spun off in 1999. 
 When Mr. Roy was hired at G.M., nearly three decades ago, his salary more than doubled from his job at a local supermarket. He traded in his five-year-old Buick for a new Chevy and since then he has done well enough to buy a pleasant house on a lake near Flint.
 But now he faces the prospect of either losing his job or accepting a sharp pay cut. And for those coming after him, ''it's just sad that it's ending, that it looks like this,'' he said. In his hometown, he added, ''all these places that used to be factories are now just parking lots.''
 Those factories supported the Roy family for generations.
 Jerry's great-grandfather, John Westley Roy, came to Michigan from Missouri in 1931, in the depths of the Depression. He built a home five blocks north of a plant operated by General Motors' AC Delco division and worked there for a decade before he was injured and retired to a farm.
 Mr. Roy's grandfather, Edward, worked at the Delco plant during the war, when it was converted into a machine-gun plant: he would tell a story about a day one of the guns came off a mount and began shooting holes in the wall of a cafeteria. 
 Mr. Roy's father, Gerald, started at G.M.'s Fisher Body unit in 1951, was laid off after a year and a half, and then got a job in 1954 at AC Delco. Gerald's sister, uncle and future wife, Delores, worked at the plant.
 The elder Mr. Roy remembers the 1950's and '60's as a golden era, when everything seemed possible.
 ''There were three shifts -- they worked around the clock,'' he said of the AC Delco plant, adding, ''you'd go in there and you couldn't even hardly walk.''
 Buoyed by such prosperity, the auto industry was the pioneer in advancing what became the American model for the social contract between workers and their employees -- from the $5 a day Henry Ford offered workers in 1914 to the all-inclusive health care and pension benefits that became a mainstay of the vast expansion of the middle class in the second half of the 20th century. 
 In many ways, it was not the government but Detroit and other major industries, at the prodding of their unions, that created the American-style social safety net, and helped foster the shared prosperity that is now fracturing.
 ''The days when blue-collar work could be passed on down the family line, those days are over,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''Where you did have automobile plants, it was always looked at as an elite job. It was hard work, but good, steady work, with wonderful benefits and good solid pay, and you were in the upper middle class.''
 Now, with G.M. and other domestic automakers and suppliers fighting to survive brutal global competition, Detroit is planning to cut even more manufacturing jobs. At the same time, the industry is moving to rewrite or even tear up its labor contracts in a bid to turn itself around by drastically reducing both wages and benefits. Today, Mr. Roy and Gerald, 71, who once helped him get his job, are both preparing to make sacrifices. 
 Robert S. Miller, the turnaround specialist who became chairman and chief executive of Delphi in July, said in an interview in October that Delphi and the United Auto Workers would have to grapple with how much to take from the retirees' pockets and how much from workers. 
 ''This is a trade-off,'' he said. ''I can't satisfy what everyone would like to have.''
 [But Delphi is pressing for such large cuts from both constituencies that one top U.A.W. leader, Richard Shoemaker, recently called the company's proposals a ''roadmap for confrontation.''] 
 Not only is the company seeking to cut two-thirds of its 34,000 hourly workers in the United States, it wants to cut wages to as little as $10 an hour from as much as $30. 
 Worries about a strike at Delphi have also been among the many issues weighing on G.M. itself. Talk of bankruptcy has become so persistent around G.M., despite the significant cash and other resources it still has at its disposal, that Rick Wagoner, the company's chief executive, has gone out of his way recently to state that there was intention for G.M. to file.
 Delphi is also seeking major cuts in the health care and pension benefits of retirees, though under the terms of the spinoff of Delphi, G.M. would have to assume much of those costs, setting up a further quandary because simply dumping troubles on G.M., its largest customer, is not necessarily palatable to Delphi or the union.
 Delphi plans as well to do more of what it has been doing since its spin-off, by continuing to shift thousands of jobs overseas. An internal memo obtained earlier in November by The Detroit News listed the Flint plant where Jerry Roy works among factories intended for closing. Delphi has called the memo incomplete and preliminary.
 Delphi puts the choices facing Detroit and its workers in starkest relief. G.M., at least so far, has sought a more compromising approach, in large part because automakers face slightly less-onerous competitive dynamics than their suppliers.
 In early November , U.A.W. members reluctantly agreed to allow the company to shave $15 billion, or nearly 20 percent, from its retiree health care liability. The elder Mr. Roy and other retirees will now be required to pay monthly premiums, deductibles and co-payments for medical services for the first time, with costs of as much as $752 a year. 
 For his part, Gerald Roy is more worried for his son Jerry than himself. 
 ''What worries me the most, or bothers me the most, is him working for 28 years for G.M. and he might lose his retirement,'' he said. 
 But the Roy's are the lucky ones. Gerald and his wife, Delores, another G.M. retiree, are healthy and not on medication, and their son is single and does not have any children. 
 They are both aware that the good life that auto work has afforded their family for four generations, and for hundreds of thousands of other families in Michigan and elsewhere across the country, is ending. 
 Indeed, others face more difficult times. 
 ''We're going to have to make a choice between what bill to pay, whether to go to the doctor,'' said Larry Mathews, who works at the same Delphi plant as Mr. Roy and is also the editor of The Sparkler, a paper for plant workers. If the pay cuts go through, Mr. Mathews said he would no longer be able to afford his son's college tuition. 
 ''I know I'm going to have to call my son at Central Michigan and tell him to come home,'' he said. ''I bet those executives don't have to make those calls.''
 Like Gerald Roy, Mr. Mathews's father retired from G.M. at a time when the bond between the company and its workers was still strong. Mr. Mathews's father died from an asbestos-related illness stemming from his plant work. Even so, Mr. Mathews said his father, who became ill in his late seventies, refused to sue. 
 ''He said, 'This place paid for everything I got today; I'm not going to sue them now,' '' Mr. Mathews recalled.
 But now, Mr. Mathews makes clear that he has no desire for his own son to continue the family tradition. 
 ''Given what we've lost here in the past decade, I really didn't want to see him come to work at G.M. or Delphi,'' he said. ''The security just isn't there.''
 When the web of labor contracts was woven during the postwar American auto boom, industry executives wanted, above all, to keep the union at bay and the profit rolling in. With young workers and no Toyotas and Hondas to worry about, there was little short-term downside to the industry's concessions.
 ''The work forces were young, the pension costs were low, the exposure for health care wasn't really there and they didn't promise a lot to begin with,'' said Gerald Meyers, a professor at the University of Michigan and the former chief executive of American Motors. Each contract, he said, ''added a little more and a little more and a little more.''
 ''The thinking in top management,'' he said, speaking from personal experience, ''is that they've kicked this ball in front of us, and keep kicking it. And when it comes due, we're not going to have to pay it.''
 ''It's like the national debt,'' he added. ''We'll spend it now and let the kids worry about it. Well, here we are in 2005, and the kids are now the management. They're paying for their fathers' sins.''
 G.M. workers should not expect the dire approach that Delphi has taken, at least on wages, because assembly work has always been better paying, even at competitors like Toyota and Honda in their American plants.
 G.M.'s problem, at least in terms of its costs, is the enormous price of health care benefits for hundreds of thousands of retirees. G.M. is the largest private provider of health care, covering more than a million Americans. 
 ''If I look at our priority list on the things we need to do to get cost-competitive, wage rates are nowhere near the top for us,'' Mr. Wagoner, the G.M. chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview. 
 Not that anyone has much chance of getting a job at these companies anymore. Wages are less important because the industry is so much more efficient than it used to be and has already cut so many jobs.
 G.M. plans to cut its blue-collar work force even further, though, to 86,000 Americans nationwide by the end of 2008, about the same number of people it once employed in Flint alone in the 1970's. At its peak, G.M. employed more than 600,000 Americans. 
 ''Frankly in our business, the progress in improving productivity has been dramatic,'' Mr. Wagoner said. ''Over a 10-year period, we have gone from a ballpark of 40-plus hours a vehicle in assembly to 20-plus hours a vehicle.'' 
 Benefits are another matter. G.M. pays about $1,500 per car assembled in the United States for health care, more than it spends on steel.
 Even with the coming cuts for retirees, the elder Mr. Roy is not concerned; he is actually more worried about paying heating bills for the large house he built two years ago, abutting woods just outside Flint. 
 ''It costs a lot to heat this place,'' he said, sitting on a swivel chair in his sun room, before taking a visitor on a tour of his house, including his own wood carvings displayed in his basement. 
 ''We really made out,'' he said. ''I bought a little cabin out on the lake and made a chalet on it, turned around and made enough money to buy this house.''
 But his son Jerry, knowing that his job may disappear and that his pay is likely to shrink no matter where he ends up, faces much greater uncertainty. 
 ''What can you do?'' Jerry asked. ''People survive somehow, regardless of what happens. I mean, it's sad, I could cry all night, but I'll figure out a way to get by -- somehow.''

Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about a family with four generations of General Motors workers referred incorrectly in some editions to a statement by Rick Wagoner, General Motors' chief executive, on the possibility of a bankruptcy filing by the company. Mr. Wagoner said recently that the company had no plans to file for bankruptcy, not that it did intend to do so.

HEADLINE: Dixie Cups and Paper Towels Sell Well 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
JUST as some retailers seem to think it is never too early to start shopping for Christmas, they also think it is never too early to start worrying about how much Christmas shoppers will spend. So when big retail chains like Wal-Mart turned on the holiday hype earlier than usual this year, it only accelerated the holiday hand-wringing.
 It was a good week to be an investment banker, however. Two big takeovers advanced and four new ones were announced. And while one merger deal fizzled, it left behind two weakened and vulnerable companies that are now ripe for takeover.

KA-CHING OR THUD? -- Better-than-expected sales and profits at major retailers in the third quarter buoyed hopes for a robust Christmas season, particularly after H. Lee Scott Jr., chief executive of Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, explicitly promised ''a good holiday season.'' 
As fast as the euphoria rose, however, it fell when it became apparent that Wal-Mart and others expected to rev up revenue by aggressively cutting prices. That may mean smaller profits -- a prospect made more evident when Wal-Mart said its gross margin did indeed fall in the three months ended Oct. 31. Target added to investors' pessimism by forecasting weak sales over the holiday shopping season.
 Other retailers offered mixed forecasts. American Eagle Outfitters said its fourth-quarter profits would probably not meet Wall Street expectations, but both J. C. Penney and Home Depot raised their sales and earnings forecasts.
 The Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.1 percent in October from a month earlier. It is scheduled to release its next report on Dec. 13.

INFLATION ROULETTE -- Is inflation a problem or not? Economists are having a devil of a time sifting through conflicting data to sort that out. Producer prices rose unexpectedly in October as soaring home heating costs more than offset cheaper gasoline, but the so-called core producer prices -- not counting food and energy prices, which tend to swing widely month to month -- fell 0.3 percent last month. Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent rise.
 While gasoline prices fell 3.3 percent, the retail price of natural gas climbed 12.7 percent in October, the largest monthly increase in more than two years. Home heating oil also rose, 12.3 percent. Still, the decline in core producer prices led some economists to say the Federal Reserve may soon stop raising short-term interest rates.
 That idea, however, was quickly undermined by testimony that Ben Bernanke, the nominee to become chairman of the Fed, gave to the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Bernanke, who is poised to become the Fed chairman after Alan Greenspan retires next year, said inflation was currently above rates desirable in the long run.

INSTANT FAME -- Koch Industries, a family-controlled conglomerate in Wichita, Kan., agreed to pay $13.2 billion in cash for Georgia-Pacific, the forest products company that makes Dixie cups and Brawny paper towels. If completed, the purchase would vault Koch ahead of Cargill, the agriculture giant, as the nation's largest privately held company.
 Koch (pronounced coke) had revenue of $60 billion last year from petroleum, chemicals, ranching, commodities, financial services and paper. While Koch is little known outside the oil patch, it is big by any measure. It has 30,000 employees in 50 countries, and has grown 1,600 percent since 1961.
 Until now, Koch's best-known products were Lycra and Stainmaster fabrics, which it acquired from DuPont only last year, for $4.2 billion. The Georgia-Pacific takeover will give it brands including Northern, Angel Soft and Sparkle, in addition to Dixie cups and Brawny towels.
 Koch executives said they did not plan to lay off any of Georgia-Pacific's 55,000 workers and would rely on them to handle selling products to consumers, something Koch has not had to do. Instead, Koch said it would focus on improving productivity at Georgia-Pacific's mills.

RECONCILIATION -- Overcoming concerns about product recalls and regulatory reviews, Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy the Guidant Corporation for $21.5 billion, or about 16 percent less than the two companies agreed to last year.
 The companies reached the terms a week after Guidant sued Johnson & Johnson to force it to complete a deal. Johnson & Johnson had threatened to abandon the acquisition unless it was allowed to renegotiate, saying Guidant's recall of 100,000 heart defibrillators made the company worth much less than originally believed.
 Johnson & Johnson said the boards of each company had approved the revised deal, as had the Federal Trade Commission, but Guidant's shareholders must still vote on it.

LEFT AT THE ALTAR -- Note to merger-minded executives: Hollywood and hospitals don't mix. VNU, the Dutch publishing company, learned that lesson the hard way, when it was forced to abandon its planned $6.8 billion takeover of IMS Health, which sells health care data. VNU had to withdraw its offer because three of its biggest shareholders said the plan was too expensive and too risky.
 As a result, VNU's chief executive, Rob van den Bergh, will resign as soon as a suitable successor can be found, and the company, which owns the Nielsen TV ratings service and publishes Billboard magazine and The Hollywood Reporter newspaper, said it would pay IMS a termination fee of $15 million.
 To soothe irritated investors, VNU also plans to spend one billion euros ($1.18 billion) on a share buyback and an extraordinary dividend.

HEADLINE: Senate Bill Would Renew Insurers' Aid On Terrorism 

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
The Senate on Friday passed legislation that would extend a program that required the federal government to cover insurance losses in cases involving catastrophic terrorist attacks.
 President Bush and Congress put the program in place roughly three years ago after billions of dollars in construction projects were disrupted because private insurers abruptly excluded terrorism coverage from standard policies after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The program was set to expire at the end of this year, leading to concern in the real estate, construction and insurance industries, especially in New York and in other cities considered vulnerable to attack, like Boston, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington. 
 The Senate legislation makes several significant changes in the program, most notably through provisions that would increase the costs for insurance companies and reduce the coverage.
 But even with those changes, the bill drew praise from industry representatives, largely because it leaves intact the main part of the program: requiring the government to pay the bulk of insurance losses in a terrorist attack up to $100 billion.
 Representatives of the industries had warned that many real estate transactions would be jeopardized if the federal program expired because terrorism insurance would become difficult, if not impossible, to obtain.
 ''The Senate has acted to protect U.S. businesses, workers and investors from uncertainty about the future availability of terrorism insurance, as well as the potentially catastrophic economic losses and dislocations that would follow any future terrorist attacks,'' said Jeffrey D. DeBoer, president of the Real Estate Roundtable, an advocacy organization for real estate companies.
 Now, the issue moves to the House, where lawmakers are also advancing legislation that would extend the program, though the bill making its way through that chamber differs from the Senate bill in some significant respects. 
 Industry leaders urged the House to follow the Senate's lead and move to extend the program before it expires.
 The program has been intensely debated since it was adopted. Critics said the huge role played by the government was preventing the private sector from developing ways to provide terrorism coverage on its own.
 In fact, the Bush administration had said it would not support an extension of the program, known as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, unless the insurance industry was willing to play a larger role in providing insurance. That position emboldened members of Congress who had argued that the program amounted to a needless bailout of the insurance industry.
 But proponents of the current program argue that in the absence of terrorism coverage, banks will be reluctant to finance real estate purchases, construction projects or other such investments. Banks usually require businesses to insure any property they use to secure loans, according to industry experts.
 Moreover, the program's supporters said that critics of government intervention ignore the crisis the business community faced after the 9/11 attacks, when losses totaled more than $40 billion. Insurers suddenly began excluding terrorism coverage from standard commercial policies, arguing that the risks were too difficult to predict and could ultimately ruin them.
 In a statement released on Friday, the White House expressed its support for the Senate bill.
 The bill extends the federal insurance program through the end of 2007. It increases the amount of property and casualty losses that would require the federal government to provide coverage: to $50 million in 2006 and $100 million in 2007. The government program is now put into effect after an attack involving as little as $5 million in losses.
 The bill also reduces the range of coverage in the program by excluding coverage for damage to commercial vehicles, theft, burglary and other areas. It also raises the deductibles for insurers before federal help begins. After the deductible is reached, the federal government covers 90 percent of insured losses in 2006 and 85 percent in 2007.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, expressed disappointment that the bill does not make the program permanent, as some industry leaders preferred, arguing that it had restored confidence in the real estate and insurance industries.
 ''Insurance rates have come down, terrorism insurance is available, and insurance companies know if, God forbid, the worst happens there will be a backstop, and they are willing to issue policies,'' Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon To Europe: Higher Rates

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank said Friday that it was poised to raise interest rates, ending weeks of speculation about when Europe would join the United States in tightening credit. 
 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said its governing board would soon ''moderately augment'' interest rates, which have not been raised in five years or changed at all in the last two and a half years.
''We will remove some of the accommodation which is in the present monetary policy stance,'' Mr. Trichet said, in what amounted to a remarkably blunt warning from a normally circumspect central banker. 
 While he did not give a timetable, Mr. Trichet's comments, made to a banking conference here, strongly suggest that the bank will raise rates at its next meeting, on Dec. 1. The remarks reverberated through European markets, briefly reversing the dollar's rally against the euro.
 Most economists expect the bank to raise the benchmark rate a quarter-point, to 2.25 percent, with a further quarter-point increase early in 2006. Some believe that it will mimic the Federal Reserve by nudging up rates in multiple increments over the next year. The Fed has lifted the short-term rate 12 times, to 4 percent, since it began tightening policy in June 2004.
 ''The E.C.B. is determined to bring interest rates in line with what they view as their natural level, around 3 percent,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at the HVB Group in Munich.
 The bank, economists said, was also emboldened by a raft of reports this week that showed Europe's economy, after faltering late last year, finally growing at a more vigorous pace. The 12-nation euro zone grew 0.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter. Germany, once the dragging anchor of Europe, also expanded 0.6 percent in the quarter.
 Now that the bank has made its intentions clear, it is likely to come under sharp criticism on a couple of fronts. European leaders have pleaded with the bank not to raise rates, still fearing that it could choke off the Continent's economic growth. Some economists argue that the bank's stated reason for tightening policy -- the risk of inflation -- is overstated.
 Among the doubters is the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Rodrigo de Rato. ''We don't see too much wage inflation pressure,'' Mr. Rato said at a briefing here, after meeting with Mr. Trichet. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Rato pointedly did not repeat the fund's previous warning that raising rates in Europe would be a mistake.
 Mr. Trichet's statement answered at least one complaint about the bank: that it does not communicate clearly.
 ''It was very clear; therefore, it is very consequential,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''Apparently, there is now an agreement on the board that they should move soon.''
 Like many bank watchers, Mr. Mayer said he thought the bank's 18-member governing council had been divided about whether -- and when -- to begin raising rates. Mr. Trichet began hardening the bank's tone at its monthly news conference in October, pointing to the risk of high oil prices and saying that rising inflation had to be monitored with ''strong vigilance.''
 But since then, other board members have gone considerably further than Mr. Trichet in their public comments.
 ''It is now time to walk the talk,'' Yves Mersch, the governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, said this month. Such comments generated confusion in financial markets about whether the bank would increase rates in December or wait until next year to sift through more economic data. Critics noted that last year, the bank laid the groundwork for a rate increase, but held off after growth in Europe faltered.
 Mr. Kramer of HVB said the bank might face a similar situation in the middle of next year. Housing prices, which have been rising at a torrid pace, are leveling off in several European countries, he said. The resulting loss of confidence could discourage consumer spending, which could be a drag on their economies.
 The outlook for inflation is similarly murky. In October, the inflation rate in the 12-nation euro zone was 2.5 percent, well above the 2 percent threshold that the bank views as acceptable. The European Commission estimates that inflation will average 2.3 percent for this year. But some economists say inflation will drop below 2 percent by the middle of next year.
 German officials have urged the bank not to raise rates, as they struggle to revive a long-dormant economy. The new coalition government pushed back by a year one of its major policy initiatives -- an increase in the value-added tax -- to prod German consumers into spending money in 2006.
 Whatever the prospects for growth and inflation, economists say that the bank is acting now mainly because it thinks that its monetary policy is simply too loose. In his long-awaited signal on Friday, Mr. Trichet described current rates as ''historically, exceptionally low.''

HEADLINE: Bush and Putin Want Iran To Treat Uranium in Russia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Pusan for this article, and William J. Broad from New York.

DATELINE: PUSAN, South Korea, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Presenting a united front against Iran, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Friday that they would press Iran to reverse itself and accept a compromise allowing it to enrich uranium, but only in Russia and under strict controls. 
 The plan would let Iran enrich uranium only to levels suitable for use in nuclear reactors, using Russian technology. ''We hope that over time Iran will see the virtue of this approach, and it may provide a way out,'' Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, told reporters here on Friday, after the two leaders met.
Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a new report about Iran to its board on Friday, showing that Iran was offered information in 1987 that could have helped it cast uranium into the precise shapes needed to build the core of a nuclear bomb. 
 The engineering drawings were offered by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani head of what was the world's largest nuclear black market, but Iran said it never sought the information. It has previously acknowledged buying centrifuges from the Khan network, but said it used them to enrich uranium for commercial power reactors, not atomic bombs. 
 While the report made no reference to weaponry, it indicated that the Khan network offered to help Iran shape uranium metal into ''hemispherical forms,'' which arms experts said suggested the making of bomb cores.
 The report made no reference to information from what American officials contend is a stolen Iranian laptop computer. The officials have said in recent briefings with allies that the information on the computer indicates work toward developing an atomic weapon. 
 The report noted some increased cooperation by Iran since the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency voted in September that Iran had withheld important data and threatened to refer the country to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. But the referral would require another vote, which Russia and China have opposed.
 Until a few days ago, the United States seemed poised to press for a vote on the issue when the agency's board meets late next week. But in recent days, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who attended the meeting with Mr. Putin, has signaled that she may delay that vote again, perhaps in hopes of gathering more votes.
 ''The Russians are getting very, very frustrated with the refusal of the Iranians to move to a middle ground,'' one senior American official said. A senior Russian delegation that went to Tehran last week was unable to persuade the Iranians to consider giving up enriching uranium on their own soil, the American officials said.
 Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Putin here, on the edges of the annual Asian economic summit, was partly intended to close differences between Washington and Moscow about how to deal with Iran.
 But the two men also discussed oil, North Korea's nuclear program and growing American concerns that Mr. Putin is rolling back democratic advances that Russia has made in the past decade.
 Most recently, the administration has been pressuring Mr. Putin on new legislation introduced by Mr. Putin's party last week in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. The legislation would prevent foreign nongovernmental organizations from opening offices in Russia and would prevent Russian organizations that engage in political activity from getting money from outside the country.
 Russian officials appear particularly concerned about human rights groups that focus on Chechnya and groups that they worry could help finance a political opposition.
 Mr. Hadley said the proposed law ''was a subject of discussion today,'' but called the talk confidential and said it was best conducted ''outside of public view.''
 Under the nuclear plan proposed by Russia and endorsed by Britain, France and Germany -- which are leading the talks with Iran -- Tehran would be permitted to continue to convert raw uranium into a gas form, called uranium hexafluoride. That gas can be enriched if processed by high-speed centrifuges, which made up most of the technology Dr. Khan's network sold Iran in 1987 and in deals that resumed in 1994.
 Under the new plan, Iran would no longer be able to enrich uranium on its soil. The Iranian government has said it will never give up its right to enrich, under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 Mr. Hadley, in describing the proposed compromise in public for the first time on Friday, said that Iran, ''while retaining its right to enrichment and reprocessing, would, nonetheless, find it in its interest to give up that right in terms of its own territory.''
 An enrichment facility would be built in Russia, ''in which Iran would have management and financial interest, but not a technical interest,'' he added. In other words, Iran would have no control over the level to which the uranium is enriched, preventing it from making bomb fuel.
 ''This is an interesting idea,'' Mr. Hadley said. ''The Iranians, probably not surprisingly, initially have said no.'' But he said he hoped Iran would come around.
 Russia would benefit financially from the deal, and would hope to also attract enrichment business from other nations. But Russian authorities were frustrated by the reception they have gotten so far from Iran. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has put off visiting the country in coming days because he did not want to come away empty-handed.
 As for the atomic agency's disclosure about casting and forming uranium metal into hemispheres, it is no secret that such shapes are often a prerequisite for making a nuclear bomb. Books tell how two hemispheres of uranium or plutonium are joined to make a weapon's spherical core.
 Although reports this year on the Iranian program disclosed Dr. Khan's offer of uranium casting expertise to Iran, and the possibility of its application to nuclear arms, they made no mention of the signature geometry of the hemispheres.
 In interviews Friday in the United States, scientists who have designed nuclear arms said the details of Dr. Khan's offer made it clear that the sensitive information was probably intended for the development of nuclear arms, rather than reactors.
 ''They point pretty heavily to a weapons interest,'' said Siegfried S. Hecker, director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico from 1986 to 1997 and now a visiting professor at Stanford University.
 Dr. Hecker added that some elements of the offer could be applied to reactors, but that others had no use other than in nuclear arms.
 ''It signals pretty clearly that he's giving a recipe for bomb production,'' Dr. Hecker said.
 Ray E. Kidder, a retired weapon designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, agreed. ''It's reasonably clear that this would be related to bombs,'' he said, noting that uranium and plutonium hemispheres could aid arms research as well being used to make bomb cores.
 As for the laptop computer, American officials have said in secret briefings that it contained more than 1,000 pages of documents, written in Persian, showing what they described as a long Iranian effort to design a nuclear warhead.
 Nuclear experts in Europe and the United States who have examined the documents have said the computer contained no plans for the ball of radioactive fuel in a bomb's core, but instead showed studies for the surrounding nose cone as well as essential bomb components, like a telltale sphere of detonators of the kind used to trigger an atomic explosion. Many analysts in Europe and the United States have interpreted such information as indicating that the Iranians are trying to design a nuclear warhead.
 However, some analysts have disagreed, saying an impostor could have forged the documents. Others have raised the possibility that rogue Iranian missile scientists did the studies without the knowledge of central authorities in Tehran.
 Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said the new report made no mention of the information from the computer because the claims had emerged only in secretive briefings rather than as part of the agency's formal agenda. So far, the United States has refused to declassify the computer information, making it impossible for the agency to seek a detailed explanation from the Iranians.

HEADLINE: UPROAR IN HOUSE AS PARTIES CLASH ON IRAQ PULLOUT

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Korea for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats shouted, howled and slung insults on the House floor on Friday as a debate over whether to withdraw American troops from Iraq descended into a fury over President Bush's handling of the war and a leading Democrat's call to bring the troops home. 
 The battle boiled over when Representative Jean Schmidt, an Ohio Republican who is the most junior member of the House, told of a phone call she had just received from a Marine colonel back home.
''He asked me to send Congress a message: stay the course,'' Ms. Schmidt said. ''He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message: that cowards cut and run, Marines never do.'' 
 Democrats booed in protest and shouted Ms. Schmidt down in her attack on Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, a Vietnam combat veteran and one of the House's most respected members on military matters. They caused the House to come to an abrupt standstill, and moments later, Representative Harold Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, charged across the chamber's center aisle to the Republican side screaming that Ms. Schmidt's attack had been unwarranted.
 ''You guys are pathetic!'' yelled Representative Martin Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''Pathetic.''
 The measure to withdraw the troops failed in a 403-to-3 vote late Friday night.
 The rancorous debate drew an extraordinary scolding from Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee.
 ''Today's debate in the House of Representatives shows the need for bipartisanship on the war in Iraq, instead of more political posturing,'' Mr. Warner said in a statement. 
 But as the third hour of debate opened, with the House chamber mostly full on the eve of the Thanksgiving recess, even two senior Republicans, Henry Hyde of Illinois and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, tried to temper the personal nature of the confrontation by offering tributes to Mr. Murtha. ''I give him an A-plus as a truly great American,'' Mr. Hyde said. 
 Then Mr. Murtha, who normally shuns publicity, gave an impassioned 15-minute plea for his plan to withdraw American troops, who he said had become ''a catalyst for violence'' in Iraq. The American people, Mr. Murtha thundered, are ''thirsty for some direction; they're thirsty for a solution to this problem.'' 
 The uproar followed days of mounting tension between Republicans and Democrats in which the political debate over the war sharply intensified. With Mr. Bush's popularity dropping in the polls, Democrats have sought anew to portray him as having exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq before the American invasion in 2003. Republicans have countered that Democrats were equally at fault.
 The battle came as Democrats accused Republicans of pulling a political stunt by moving toward a vote on a symbolic alternative to the resolution that Mr. Murtha offered on Thursday, calling for the swift withdrawal of American troops. Democrats said the ploy distorted the meaning of Mr. Murtha's measure and left little time for meaningful debate. 
 Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, denied that there were any political tricks involved and said pulling forces out of Iraq so rashly would hurt troop morale overseas. ''We want to make sure that we support our troops that are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' he said.
 The measure's fate was sealed -- and the vote count's significance minimized -- when the Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, criticized the Republican tactics and instructed Democrats to join Republicans in voting against an immediate withdrawal. 
 ''Just when you thought you'd seen it all, the Republicans have stooped to new lows, even for them,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who assailed Republicans as impugning Mr. Murtha's patriotism.
 The parliamentary maneuvering came amid more than three hours of often nasty floor debate and boisterous political theater, with Democrats accusing Republicans of resorting to desperate tactics to back a failed war and Republicans warning that Mr. Murtha's measure would play into the hands of terrorists. 
 In South Korea, where Mr. Bush was in the final day of the Asian economic summit, the White House released the text of a speech that he is scheduled to make later on Saturday to American forces at Osan Air Base. 
 ''In Washington there are some who say that the sacrifice is too great, and they urge us to set a date for withdrawal before we have completed our mission,'' Mr. Bush planned to say, keeping up the daily drumbeat of White House response from 7,000 miles away. ''Those who are in the fight know better. One of our top commanders in Iraq, Maj. Gen. William Webster, says that setting a deadline for our withdrawal from Iraq would be, quote, 'a recipe for disaster.' ''
 ''General Webster is right,'' Mr. Bush's text said. ''And so long as I am commander in chief, our strategy in Iraq will be driven by the sober judgment of our military commanders on the ground.''
 On Thursday, Mr. Murtha called for pulling out the 153,000 American troops within six months, saying they had become a catalyst for the continuing violence in Iraq. His plan also called for a quick-reaction force in the region, perhaps based in Kuwait, and for pursuing stability in Iraq through diplomacy. 
 But House Republicans planned to put to a vote -- and reject -- their own nonbinding alternative resolution that simply said: ''It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the deployment of United States forces in Iraq be terminated immediately.''
 Democrats denounced the Republican measure as a fraud. But Democrats privately acknowledged that they were seeking to escape a political trap set by the Republicans to box them into an unappealing choice: side with Mr. Murtha and face criticism for backing a plan that American commanders say would cripple the mission in Iraq or oppose their respected colleague and blunt momentum for an overhaul of the administration's Iraq policy. 
 House Democrats greeted Mr. Murtha with a standing ovation on Friday as he entered the chamber.
 ''This is a personal attack on one of the best members, one of the most respected members of this House, and it is outrageous,'' said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.
 While some 70 liberal Democrats who support ending American military involvement in Iraq have praised Mr. Murtha's plan, many of his other party colleagues appeared to harbor doubts. To a member, Democrats said they respected the counsel of Mr. Murtha, a retired Marine colonel who has earned bipartisan respect in his three decades in Congress as a champion of American service members. 
 But many senior House Democrats, including Ms. Pelosi, have distanced themselves from Mr. Murtha's resolution, saying a phased withdrawal is a more prudent course. The House debate is likely to stoke an intensifying partisan debate on Capitol Hill over the administration's handling of the war, including how it used prewar intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. 
 Democrats, including Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, as well as Representative Jane Harman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, defended Mr. Murtha and gave examples of what they said were faulty intelligence. 
 The House action comes just days after the Republican-controlled Senate defeated a Democratic push to have Mr. Bush describe a timetable for withdrawal. Underscoring unease by both parties about the war, though, the Senate then approved aRepublican statement that 2006 should be a year in which conditions were created for the Iraqi government to take over more security duties in the country and allow the United States to begin withdrawing. 
 Even as Republicans sought to make political hay from Mr. Murtha's plan, Democrats defended him as a patriot.
 ''I won't stand for the Swift-boating of Jack Murtha,'' said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004. Mr. Kerry, who is also a Vietnam veteran, was dogged during the campaign by a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that challenged his war record.

HEADLINE: Shoppers In the Malls, If Not on Wall Street 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
NO one can predict with certainty what the stock market will do on any given day, but forecasting a gain on the day after Thanksgiving is a safer bet than most. Investors are inclined to feel good after their day off, and they often express it by bidding up share prices upon their return. 
 But this time around, they may wish to hold off celebrating the unofficial start of the year-end rally. One analyst who studies trading patterns in the stock market warns that longer-term cycles are pointing lower and predicts that the market will provide little holiday cheer next month. Louise Yamada, who heads Louise Yamada Technical Research Advisors, contends that any advance on Friday will provide a better opportunity to sell stocks than to buy them.
''Under the surface we're seeing perhaps a weakening pattern in the equity market over all,'' Ms. Yamada said. While the stock market moved upward last month, she said, technical indicators for the longer term suggest that the market is likely to decline, with a bottom next year. 
 Ms. Yamada's forecast is not entirely gloomy. A 40-week market cycle is still rising, she said, and it may provide a window for investors to lighten their holdings at decent prices before it tips over, an event that she believes is not far off.
 ''November may be a mixed month in the sense that we may get a rally from the 40-week cycle,'' she said, but longer-term declines ''may kick in after that.'' 
 Measures of internal market strength also foretell weakness, she added. Momentum is waning, suggesting that traders are becoming nervous and more prone to locking in gains instead of letting the money ride.
 ''The underlying technical indicators are not very robust,'' Ms. Yamada said. ''We may not get much of a Christmas rally if people can take a quick profit and close their books.''

DATA WATCH -- Two reports will vie to keep investors' heads in the game during this holiday week. The index of leading economic indicators, due Monday, is expected to show a climb of 0.8 percent for October, according to a Bloomberg News poll of economists, after a fall of 0.7 percent the previous month. The University of Michigan consumer confidence reading for this month, to be reported on Wednesday, is predicted to show a small increase, to 81 from 79.9 in October.

HEADLINE: Can Nuclear Power Become Just Another Business? 

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

DATELINE: LONDONDERRY, Pa. 

 BODY:
STAND among the pumpkins and purple mums in the gravel parking lot of Anna's Garden and Gift Center and you can glimpse beyond the trees a ghost that haunts the nuclear power industry. 
 There hulk the twin cooling towers of Three Mile Island Unit 2, the nuclear reactor that had a partial meltdown in 1979. That event, paired with the Chernobyl explosion in Ukraine in 1986, halted the growth of the American nuclear power industry for a generation. No new plant has been ordered in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident. But existing plants have kept operating: the United States has 104 reactors, which make a fifth of its power.
Lately, the nuclear-power sector has been enjoying something of a revival, because of its operating-cost advantages over other forms of electricity production. That may prompt investors to bet on its resurgence by buying shares in nuclear power plant operators, equipment makers or fuel producers. 
 The economic appeal of nuclear power has risen as prices for natural gas and coal -- fuels for the bulk of America's electricity -- have climbed. The price of natural gas, especially, has soared. In October, it touched $14 per million British thermal units. That was nearly double the price from October of last year. ''There's a big advantage for operating a nuclear plant when gas prices are in the $5 range, much less where they are today,'' said John C. Kohli, portfolio manager at the Franklin Utilities fund.
 Many people, of course, still worry about inadvertent releases of radiation and about the long-term storage of radioactive waste. But in some circles, those fears are beginning to be overtaken by an appreciation of nuclear power's competitive advantages. As concern about global warming has become mainstream, some investors are reminded that nuclear power produces no greenhouse gases. And while nuclear power plants could be vulnerable to a terrorist attack, war and recent hurricanes have underscored the fragility of fossil-fuel supplies. Federal lawmakers have given nuclear power a nudge, too, with a raft of subsidies in the Energy Policy Act this year.
 ''The incentives in there were a bold statement that nuclear is going to be an important part of the U.S. electricity supply in the future,'' said Timothy P. O'Brien, manager of the Evergreen Utility and Telecommunications fund. 
 Still, investors should understand that betting on nuclear power entails risks beyond the stock market's usual shimmies and shakes. Domestic plants have operated without a major accident since Three Mile Island, but another big stumble, in the United States or abroad, could hobble the industry. And many long-term issues remain, including the questions about waste storage and the proliferation of nuclear technology, said Ernest J. Moniz, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The construction of a long-promised waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, has been delayed by years of legal arm-wrestling. 
 If investors choose to go nuclear, perhaps the most conservative approach is to buy shares of utilities with big nuclear operations -- utilities like Exelon, Entergy, Dominion Resources and the FPL Group, said Mark C. Sadeghian, an analyst at Morningstar. 
 Exelon, based in Chicago, has made a hefty wager on nuclear generation, he noted. It has 17 reactors at 10 sites. If it completes a pending acquisition of the Public Service Enterprise Group, based in Newark, it will have 20 reactors at 12 sites. Exelon's stock is up more than 15 percent this year. 
 Among Exelon's plants is Three Mile Island Unit 1, a mirror image of its infamous sibling. Both occupy the same central Pennsylvania island, protected by glistening razor wire and guards toting assault rifles. Unit 1 generates about seven million megawatt-hours of power a year, while Unit 2 sits idle and entombed. Exelon does not own Unit 2, but monitors it for its owner, First-Energy of Akron, Ohio. 
 ''Several years ago, when the industry started to deregulate, many companies decided to sell off their nuclear plants, and very few companies had the bright idea to buy them, though they were being sold by pennies on the dollar,'' said Judith A. Saryan, portfolio manager at the Eaton Vance Utilities fund. ''Exelon was one of the companies that had the good sense to buy.'' 
 Operating a passel of plants helped Exelon to hone its nuclear expertise, Ms. Saryan said. ''Now its nuclear fleet runs at 95 percent capacity.'' 
 Entergy, with 10 reactors, is the second-biggest nuclear operator, after Exelon. Entergy's hometown utility, Entergy New Orleans, had to file for bankruptcy-court protection after Hurricane Katrina, but that division accounts for less than 5 percent of the parent's earnings, said Shelby G. Tucker, a principal at Banc of America Securities. ''About a third of their earnings comes from their large nuclear fleet in the Northeast,'' he added. 
 Those plants could soon contribute even more to profits. Entergy sells its power at below-market prices because of risk-hedging contracts, he said. As the hedges expire, ''they'll be able to recontract at higher prices.'' 
 Eight power companies, including Exelon and Entergy, are trying to prepare the way for the eventual licensing of a new nuclear plant. Their coalition, called NuStart Energy, aims to test a streamlined federal licensing process and to develop a design for a new reactor. 
 Other countries, especially China and India, are likely to build more nuclear plants and to do so sooner. ''People are talking about China building 20 to 21 new reactors,'' said David M. Schanzer, utility analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. 
 A company that may have a role in construction abroad is General Electric, which has designed and sold parts for plants for decades. But the nuclear business accounts for just a tincture of G.E.'s sales. Buying G.E. for its atomic expertise is like buying a bag of M&M's just to eat the green ones. 
 A foreign company with a focus on nuclear power is British Energy, which produces about a fifth of Britain's electricity, said Charlie B. Gaffney, an analyst at Eaton Vance. British Energy owns eight nuclear plants and one coal-fired one. ''So they're basically a pure-play nuclear generator,'' he said. ''They've had some problems in the past, and they're in restructuring mode.'' If the company succeeds, its cheap power could yield healthy returns, he said. 
 Only one domestic company qualifies as a pure-play nuclear investment: USEC, a former government agency that chemically modifies uranium for use as reactor fuel; it is based in Bethesda, Md.
 Since being privatized in 1998, its earnings and stock price have zigzagged. This fall, the company reorganized, cutting its staff by 6 percent, to about 2,700, and bringing in a new boss, John K. Welch, from General Dynamics. 
 USEC's government legacy has hampered it by saddling it with outdated technology, Mr. Welch said. Its enrichment plant was designed in the 1950's and uses more electricity than competitors abroad. That is why the company is betting on a giant centrifuge costing $1.7 billion. It should use about 5 percent of the electricity required by the current method, Mr. Welch said, adding that ''we hope to have that up and running by 2011 or 2012.'' 
 A competitor -- Louisiana Energy Services, yet another venture that includes Exelon and Entergy -- has announced plans to bring an enrichment plant in New Mexico online at about the same time.
 Ultimately, investors' best hope for nuclear power may be that it comes to be viewed as just another business, rather than the industrial offspring of a perilous technology. 
 IN Londonderry, Anna M. and Daniel J. Angelo, owners of Anna's Garden and Gift Center, already seem to see the industry that way. 
 They don't fret much about the past of Three Mile Island Unit 2. Sure, they tell tales about the huge nuclear plant -- about the iodine tablets, a radiation antidote, handed out at their children's school after Sept. 11, 2001, and about the way the warm-water discharge into the Susquehanna River draws fish and anglers in the winter. Otherwise, they accept the reactor, saying it brings well-paying jobs to their area. 
 ''We joke about having glow-in-the dark plants,'' Ms. Angelo said. ''Other than that, people don't talk that much about it. You get so used to it.''

HEADLINE: Another Fall in Oil Prices, Another Gain for Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
For the fourth consecutive week, the stock market rose, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest level since June 2001. 
 Declining oil prices spurred the stock market. A barrel of crude oil for December delivery closed at $56.14 on Friday in New York, a five-month low and a drop of 21 percent since a peak in late August.
Economic reports also encouraged investors. On Wednesday, the core Consumer Price Index -- excluding food and energy -- for October rose at an annual rate of only 2.1 percent. Other data showed that the economy was continuing to grow at a robust rate.
 Georgia-Pacific, the paper maker, rose 36 percent for the week, the best performance in the S.& P. 500. The company agreed to be acquired by the privately held Koch Industries. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 80.29 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,766.33. The S.& P. 500 gained 13.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,248.27. The Nasdaq composite index rose 24.60 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,227.07.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.49 percent from 4.56 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Don't Beat Up Big Oil. It's Just Doing Its Job.

 BODY:
''INSANITY,'' the old saying goes, ''is doing the same thing and expecting different results.''
 That adage came to mind as I watched the Congressional hearings into accusations of gasoline price gouging and windfall profits for the oil companies. Real ''men in white coats with straitjackets'' insanity came to mind as I read about Republicans in committee voting a few days ago to tax the stockholders of oil companies with what amounts to a windfall profits tax.
The back story, as everyone knows by now, is that energy prices shot up like mad after the disastrous results of Hurricane Katrina became known. In sequence, gasoline prices rose, heating oil rose and natural gas, which is priced somewhat differently from oil, also rose significantly. 
 The wise men on Capitol Hill apparently have so little education in economics that they believed that the rise in oil prices was a conspiracy fixed by the large oil companies. Not only that, but the oil companies reported large profits for the most recent quarter, and this also supposedly showed something nefarious at work that needed Congressional tampering to be set right.
 Herewith, a few respectful thoughts in reply:
 First, the price of oil is a worldwide commodity price. (Natural gas is set on a national or North American basis.) It is set on commodities markets all over the world, but largely in the United States and Britain. This was not always the case. Once, oil prices were set by a cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. But now, with the advent of free markets in oil futures, oil prices are set on a market. 
 This means that the price of oil cannot be set by any one person, like Hugo Chavez, or by any one country, like Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. Many entities, people and events can affect the price of oil, but it is ultimately set on a world market. This is an incredible advance over the old system in many ways. The main one is that, barring a major war, there cannot now be times when oil is simply unavailable. The price will allocate the output so that there will always be gasoline and heating oil available, at some price.
 For those of us who lived and suffered through the oil shocks and closed gas stations in the early and late 1970's before there was a free market in oil futures, this is a blow for freedom. I cannot imagine that any sane person would rather have no gasoline available at the pump, but at an (imaginary) low price, than have gasoline available at a high price. The free market in oil involves greedy speculators and maniac traders, but they make sure that gasoline is available -- and that is no small thing.
 Next, ''profit'' is not a bad word. When profit is earned by oil companies, it does not go to King John or to the Sheriff of Nottingham. It goes mostly to widows and orphans and pension funds who are owners of the big oil companies. They risked their savings for years when oil prices were low and profits were modest. Now, when they have a good quarter, the Bill O'Reillys want to take it away from them. Why? If, instead of saying ''stockholders of oil companies,'' you say widows and orphans and pensioners, do you, Senator Barbara Boxer, really think that allowing them to have a good profit is an awful idea? If oil company profits are bad, why are profits at hedge funds sacrosanct? 
 I am always amazed that no one in Congress raises a finger when entities that perform the valuable function of trading derivatives based on arcane debt instruments make staggering profits that go into making their traders multimillionaires at 30 -- and good luck to them, I say. But when a company that allows us all to heat our houses and drive our children to school makes money, somehow that is a sin. Why? 
 Do we really want to punish the people who risk billions to bring us oil from deep under the ocean, then pump it out, refine it, add chemicals to it to make it less polluting, then have it on the corner for us to put into our cars -- and still sell it at a price less than that of a bottle of water from a tap that's been barely filtered? Why do we hate the oil companies that basically make our lives possible and turn a blind eye to the people making millions basically by playing poker against one another?
 Next, what possible evidence is there of any price collusion by oil companies? If there were such price fixing, it would be illegal already under existing antitrust laws. For decades, in investigation after investigation, no collusion has been found. If it exists now, the Justice Department can find it. But why just suppose it's there because a huge storm in the prime energy-producing region of our nation knocked out refineries and caused gas prices to rise? Occam's razor: Do not multiply entities. If it seems that a simple explanation is the explanation, go for it unless there is proof to the contrary.
 AND what historical evidence do we have that government meddling in the oil and gas patch improves the situation? Under my old boss, President Richard M. Nixon, we tried an amazingly complex system of regulating the price of already found, or ''old,'' oil while allowing a free market in ''new'' oil. The results were a disaster. Under President Jimmy Carter, we had Congressional movement toward actual gasoline rationing. Did any of it do a bit of good? No, but since we have had the free market in oil, we have had peaks and valleys in price, but no real cutoffs -- and this is a blessing indeed.
 By the way, if the oil companies could fix prices at artificially high levels, why have they allowed them to collapse in the last few weeks? Why not keep them high indefinitely? Or did Bill O'Reilly scare off Big Oil?
 Yes, I loathe the speculative premium in energy prices. Yes, I wish that I did not have to pay as much when I fill up my car. But the idea that there is a conspiracy at work, the idea that Congress can make it better by regulation -- that's insanity. To let the free market, the best economic idea of all history, work its magic -- that's good sense.

HEADLINE: The Future of Buyouts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''The Great Global Buyout Bubble'' (DealBook, Nov. 13) raised important concerns about the buyout industry's rapid growth. That said, it presented an overly gloomy prognosis by omitting two aspects of the industry's evolving dynamics. 
 First, the limited-partnership structure of private equity firms represents an alternative ownership model to the public corporation -- an alternative that has important advantages. Leveraged buyouts concentrate equity in fewer hands, creating powerful incentives to perform. With a significant stake in their portfolio companies, L.B.O. firms actively monitor their investments, reducing corporate governance problems.
 Second, investment organizational models continue to evolve -- adapting and anticipating market opportunities. Hedge funds are a source of liquidity for private equity deals and, in the case of a few funds, are competitors for deals. There are a number of distressed-debt funds that are well placed to benefit from any pickup in defaults. And recently, new funds have emerged that focus on private equity and distressed debt. 
 These two factors are crucial to the dynamism and wealth-creating capacity of the market system.
