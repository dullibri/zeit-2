Air Products Adds Charge for Swap Losses

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ALLENTOWN, Pa., May 16

 BODY:
Air Products and Chemicals Inc. said yesterday it would take a charge of $9 million in the third quarter because of losses on derivatives trading.
The charge is in addition to a $60 million after-tax charge for the second quarter that the company reported last week. 
 The company entered into five interest-rate swaps with the Bankers Trust New York Corporation between October and December last year. The swaps, a form of the complex and highly publicized financial contracts known as derivatives, were bets that United States and European interest rates would remain stable. Companies use swaps with the aim of paying a floating interest rate when they think rates will fall and paying a fixed rate when they think rates will rise.
Air Products terminated three contracts after last week's announcement of the losses, resulting in an extra loss of $7 million, the company said. One of the other contracts was essentially closed out by buying some additional derivatives, Kevin Ramundo, a company spokesman, said.
The fifth contract, which is tied to Dutch interest rates, remains on Air Products' books, though the company said it had bought an interest-rate option to protect it against big moves in rates. If Dutch rates rise one percentage point, Air Products will lose a further $2 million. A similar drop in rates would bring the company a gain of $7 million.
"The ultimate charge in the third quarter, we can't say for sure," Mr. Ramundo said.
The company's loss on its swaps reduced net income to $13 million, or 12 cents a share, in its second quarter. Without the charge, earnings would have been 65 cents a share.
Air Products' loss is the latest in a series of setbacks companies have suffered in derivatives trades. Procter & Gamble said last month that it lost $102 million after taxes on a leveraged swap with Bankers Trust. Gibson Greetings Inc. said it lost $19.7 million and the Mead Corporation announced a $7.4 million loss on swaps last month. An ARCO pension fund lost $22 million on derivatives, the company said this weekend.
 
 
Cost of Debt Service
 Air Products, which employs 14,000 people, has used swaps to guard against swings in interest rates that could raise the cost of servicing its $1.3 billion in debt.

TIFFANY & CO. (TIF,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Tiffany & Company reported yesterday that first-quarter net income rose 80.9 percent, to $1.88 million, or 12 cents a share. Shares of Tiffany jumped $2.75 yesterday, to $31.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was more than 156,000 shares, greatly surpassing the three-month average daily volume of 32,000 shares.
Sales in the United States increased 18 percent, to $57.2 million from $48.5 million for the quarter, which ended on April 30. Tiffany, the New York jewelry retailer, said comparable United States sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, were up 16 percent, reflecting growth in Tiffany's flagship New York store and all American branch stores. 
 "We are pleased to be experiencing such strong results in our U.S. stores, which clearly indicates the success of Tiffany's strategic initiatives, along with a generally favorable economic climate," said William R. Chaney, the company's chairman.
International retail sales increased 29 percent, to $55.2 million, from $42.9million a year ago. The company said the increase primarily resulted from Tiffany's strategic realignment of its Japanese business in July 1993.
International same-store sales fell, which Tiffany attributed to soft economies in Japan and Europe. Worldwide sales, including catalogue operations, rose 20 percent, to $131.2 million from $109.5 million.

HEADLINE: Killings by Ex-Police Officer Leave Town Wondering Why

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, N.Y., May 16

 BODY:
Joseph Merola did not get along especially well with his neighbors in this blue-collar city dotted with small wood frame homes, arguing with them over the late-night howling of his bassett hound, Murray, and the long black garden hose he would inexplicably leave running in his driveway for days at a time.
But for all his frictions, no one in this sleepy community 35 miles east of Syracuse expected what happened on Saturday night. Stepping out his back door at 9:23, Mr. Merola, a 34-year-old former police officer, unwrapped a licensed semiautomatic weapon from a gray sweatshirt and opened fire, killing two youths -- ages 14 and 15 -- and wounding a 17-year-old youth and a 43-year-old woman. He then brought the gun to his head and killed himself. 
 Mr. Merola's one-minute reign of terror at the corner of North Charles and Elwood Streets has shaken this community of 45,000, leaving city officials, former police colleagues and neighbors wondering what caused him to snap and whether his actions could have been prevented. It has also left school officials trying to counsel the hundreds of children who attended Strough Junior High School with the two popular youths who died: Mike McSweeney, who was in the eighth grade, and Dellon DiPasqua, who was in the ninth.
At a news conference this morning at City Hall, Mayor Joseph A. Griffo and Police Chief Merino J. Ciccone detailed Mr. Merola's troubled, six-year tenure as a police officer, which was marred by two suspensions and his dismissal for insubordination in May 1993. In a 1991 lawsuit that was settled out of court, he was accused of slapping and kicking a teen-ager whom he had arrested for skateboarding on the city mall. But two department-ordered psychological examinations found Mr. Merola to be no threat to the community.
City officials said that after Mr. Merola arrested the 14-year-old skateboarder in April 1991, Dr. Joseph T. Himmelsbach, a psychologist who examined him at the city's request, wrote, "There was no evidence of a major emotional disturbance or a significant mental disorder, nor were there indications that he is a hostile, angry person about to explode."
Mayor Griffo said that a second examination by another doctor a year later concluded that Mr. Merola was somewhat anxious and depressed, but most likely to recover in a few weeks.
Instead, Mr. Merola's life seemed to spiral steadily downward. He was dismissed from the department last May after he was found guilty of administrative charges that he had abandoned his post without authorization, faked an illness and reported to work out of uniform. City officials declined to give further details. Mr. Merola was believed to have been unemployed ever since.
 
Marksman and Gun Collector
 Then, about six months ago, Mr. Merola's father, Joseph, a beer distributor, died of cancer. The two were said to have been close and had lived together since moving to North Charles Street in the mid-1980's, not long before Mr. Merola's mother, Angeline, died after a lengthy battle with multiple sclerosis. Mr. Merola, who was not believed to have ever married, had lived alone in the house since his father's death.
Chief Ciccone said today that the department had been aware that Mr. Merola was an avid marksman and gun collector -- 14 handguns, all of them believed to have been licensed, were recovered from his home -- but had received no indication from his neighbors that he had threatened to use the guns against them.
Mr. Merola began to unravel Saturday evening, when he summoned the police to his home about 9 P.M. after discovering his garden hose had been slashed about six inches from the nozzle. In front of the officers, witnesses said, Mr. Merola exchanged angry words with several members of the Garofalo family, who live across the street and whom he had initially accused of cutting the hose. He then blamed several teen-agers who had joined the dispute, the witnesses said.
Finding no evidence that linked anyone to the cutting of the hose, the officers left at 9:15 P.M., Chief Ciccone said. The chief said the officers described Mr. Merola as "satisfied" with their efforts and "not upset."
But eight minutes later, the chief said, Mr. Merola re-emerged from his home and shouted something to the effect of, "You cut my hose and now you're going to pay." He then fired off at least 20 rounds of bullets.
 
Shot Trying to Run Away
 Matt Thompson and John Conner -- two teen-age witnesses who watched the shootings from under a parked car -- said Mr. Merola shot and wounded Mike McSweeney, who was standing only a few feet away. When Mike, a football and lacrosse player, got up and tried to run away, Mr. Merola shot him fatally in the head, Matt and John said.
Dellon DiPasqua, a track and field standout, tried to run away before he was fatally wounded in the head, the witnesses said. A third youth, James Nasci, 17, a swimmer who had shaved his head to a sleek, blond fuzz earlier in the day, was wounded next, in the elbow. He was listed in fair condition today at University Hospital in Syracuse.
Mr. Merola then sprayed the Garofalo home with bullets and struck Elvira Garofalo, 43 -- who, the police said, was sitting on her porch -- in the wrist. Mrs. Garofalo was treated at a local hospital and then released, the police said.
Finally, the witnesses said Mr. Merola turned toward his driveway, put the gun to his temple, fired once and fell to the ground.
Chief Ciccone said that the police believed one of the victims, whom he declined to name, might have been involved in the cutting of the hose, but that the others were believed to have been "in the wrong place at the wrong time." The precise words and actions that led up to the shooting, he added, will most likely never be known.
"What his rationale was, I don't know," Chief Ciccone said. "We were very lucky, if you could say there was any luck here, that we do not have more casualties."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Close Higher Awaiting Action by Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities finished higher yesterday as traders and investors awaited the outcome of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.
The Fed is expected to raise its short-term interest rate target for the fourth time this year soon. But market analysts are split over whether the increase in the target for the Federal funds rate, which is now 3.75 percent, will be a quarter of a percentage point or a half of a percentage point. And some argue that the Fed may wait a little longer and not act today. 
 In late trading the 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to 8527/32 for a yield of 7.44 percent, down from 7.49 percent on Friday. The yield is the lowest since May 5, when it was 7.33 percent.
Last week's subdued inflation reports have given rise to feelings by some investors that the three-month-plus bond retreat may have run its course.
 
Inflation Reports Cited
 The Labor Department reported on Friday that inflation was subdued through April, with consumer prices climbing just 2.4 percent over the last year. For all of 1993, consumer prices rose 2.7 percent. On Thursday, the department said producer prices in the 12 months ended April fell four-tenths of a percent -- the first drop in two years, based on the 12-month change.
Mark Grant, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he expected nothing immediate to come from the Fed's meeting today. He said the Fed governors might wait "until they have a better picture of the economy."
When the adjustment does come, he thinks it will be 25 basis points and not anything as large as the 50 that has been speculated. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
"We have been reacting to inflation and to a stronger economy than some thought," Mr. Grant said. "A lot of those fears have turned out not to be so well founded."
As a result a 25-basis-point increase in rates may not get much of a market reaction, he says, where as weeks ago it would have caused the market to hemorrhage.
 
'Beginning to Calm Down'
 "The market is beginning to calm down, and is taking a more realistic view of where the economy is going," Mr. Grant said. "It's finding its base after a three-month decline, in what many think has been the worst bond market in the last 10 years."
Elsewhere in the Treasury market, traders and dealers said the three- and six-month bill auction was strong, and was helped by reinvestment demand from the issues maturing. The average discount rate for three-month bills was 4.22 percent, down from 4.32 percent last week, while the average for the six-month bill was 4.69 percent, down from 4.81 percent.
According to traders, retail interest at the auction was good, because many investors were parking their money in the short end of the market.
In early trading, bonds were little changed after the Fed said industrial production rose three-tenths of a percent in April, and the percentage of factory capacity in use was unchanged at 83.6 percent. Both reports were in line with market expectations. The production increase was the 11th consecutive monthly gain. Analysts said the only surprise to some was the lack of a rebound in utilities, which fell six-tenths of a percent in April after a 2.3 percent drop in March and 1.9 percent drop in February.
The solid performance in manufacturing despite the drag from lagging motor vehicle sales should reinforce perceptions of a healthy pace of growth, other analysts said.
An 85 percent capacity utilization rate has been considered a point that would translate into production bottlenecks and higher prices on manufactured goods. But the fact that more American production is done abroad makes this high capacity level less of a concern, some analysts contend.
 
Commodity Rise Shrugged Off
 Analysts at MMS International said bonds were not under pressure as much as they usually would by a sharp rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index. The index rose more than three points to 230.49. But the jump was largely a result of a surge in coffee and grain prices.
"Coffee has been pressured by supply constraints, rising another 3 percent today and nearly 50 percent in the past couple of weeks," said James Hale, an MMS International analyst.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.933	97.629	Discounted Rate	4.22%	4.69%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.87%	High Price	98.938	97.634	Discounted Rate	4.20%	4.68%	Coupon Yield	4.31%	4.86%	Low Price	98.933	97.629	Discounted Rate	4.22%	4.69%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.87%	Accepted at low price	31%	34%	Total applied for	$49,025,680	$46,672,933	Accepted	$12,096,337	$12,036,668	Noncompetitive	$1,433,939	$1,245,942	
 
Both issues are dated May 19, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 18, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 17, 1994.

HEADLINE: A Benign Bundesbank?;
Germany's Rate Arbiter, and Europe's Too, Lowers Interest as the Economy Recovers

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, May 16

 BODY:
Has the Bundesbank, the monetary lion that has had all Europe cowering before German tight-money policies, rolled over and started purring like a pussycat?
After the German central bank lowered both its key interest rates by half a percentage point last week, some financial analysts here are beginning to think just that. 
 A new era, they say, might be dawning under the Bundesbank's politically shrewd president, Hans Tietmeyer, a former close aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl who took charge of the central bank on Oct. 1.
If the Federal Reserve decides on Tuesday to raise American short-term rates for the fourth time this year, many Bundesbank-watchers will see the increase as confirmation of a suspected two-part agreement with the Fed to help halt the decline of the dollar on international currency markets.
Whether Mr. Tietmeyer and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, made such a deal is, of course, not known. But the notion that the Bundesbank would stubbornly defend the mark despite the consequences of a tight-money policy on the dollar, on other European currencies and on European unity has now faded.
Some German officials caution, though, against assuming that the new Bundesbank has done an about-face. A few close colleagues of Mr. Tietmeyer on the 16-member Central Bank Council, the equivalent of the Federal Open Market Committee in the United States, which approved last week's interest-rate cuts, say that the Bundesbank is able to be more cooperative internationally because Germany's financial situation has changed.
The bank under Mr. Tietmeyer is "less dogmatic and more pragmatic," one official said. At the same time, the nation's emerging economic recovery means that staggering budget deficits, which had constrained Bundesbank policy in the early 90's, are now less of a problem. Some critics also note that this is an election year for Chancellor Kohl and his party, the Christian Democratic Union.
The Bundesbank confirmed its reputation as an uncooperative central bank late in 1992 and in 1993, when it stuck to high interest-rate policies although a run on other European currencies was threatening the stability, even the existence, of the European Monetary System. As a consequence, the monetary system all but fell apart.
But Mr. Tietmeyer, a silver-haired north German with a florid speaking style, appears to be setting a new tone. He has escaped the constant complaining about the Bundesbank's being too restrictive that dogged his predecessor, Helmut Schlesinger, a stolid monetarist without much flair for sugar-coating the painful anti-inflation steps that he led the bank to take during his 26-month leadership.
In part, this is because Mr. Schlesinger had already begun reducing German interest rates, in small and gradual steps, after the monetary storms that broke when the bank jacked up rates to record levels in the summer of 1992.
Setting the discount rate at 8.75 percent and the Lombard rate at 9.75 percent then, the bank hoped to keep the financial pressures of German unification from sending inflation up so sharply that it would seem out of control.
By the time Mr. Tietmeyer took over last fall, those rates -- which define the range within which German commercial short-term interest rates fluctuate -- had come down by two and a half percentage points.
The critical step that made people sit up and ask about a new Bundesbank was the 50-basis-point reduction the Bundesbank made last week, bringing the key rates down to 4.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
Technically, the bank could say that it had lowered interest rates for the almost the same reasons it raised them two years before -- keeping inflation low and the mark strong, the mandates of its charter since it was founded in 1957.
 
Recovery and Politics
 It reduced rates last week, the bank said, because German inflation was headed down and because it wanted to encourage long-term investment and capital formation. It also appeared to have more leeway to reduce rates because the mark was especially strong, having steadily gained against the dollar for weeks.
Still, the big rate cuts seemed to mark a watershed, one that may have as much to do with German domestic politics as international economics.
"Tietmeyer is a political animal and the Bundesbank is a political institution," said a Frankfurt banker who knows both well. "After nearly two years of recession, he now has a majority of the Central Bank Council members in favor of expansionary economic policy."
Politically, Mr. Tietmeyer's patrons in Chancellor Kohl's Government welcomed the rate reductions as a decisive contribution toward accelerating Germany's fragile economic recovery in time to help them win the elections on Oct. 16.
But if the German domestic considerations had not changed, it is likely that Mr. Tietmeyer would look less cooperative and the Bundesbank, less changed.
His job in persuading the Central Bank Council to cut rates may have been made easier by help from members appointed by state governments that are controlled by the opposition Social Democratic Party. All five of them are believed to have voted for the relaxation of monetary policy because stimulating the economy would be good for their states as well as for the country.
"Tietmeyer is more of an internationalist than his predecessor," agreed Allan Saunderson, editor of The Old Continent, a Frankfurt financial bulletin published by the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's information services division. "But this decision," he said, "was entirely based on domestic considerations."
Other analysts share that view. "The latest move represents a bold judgment by the Central Bank Council that their strategy of cutting short-term rates will slow the growth of the money stock and bring down inflation," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz of Salomon Brothers International in London, alluding to the bank's definition of the M-3 money-supply measure -- currency in circulation plus short-term deposits at financial institutions.
Since that definition excludes time deposits of more than four years, by this analysis high short-term German interest rates discouraged domestic investors from putting their money into long-term instruments like bonds. If it is correct, this may have contributed to the turbulence in international bond markets that began when the Fed began raising American short-term rates early in February.
This view, too, would represent a shift by the Bundesbank, because under Mr. Schlesinger it seemed to view surges in the money supply as a reason to keep short-term rates high -- to discourage consumer borrowing that fed inflation.
"If they had followed the current logic two years ago, they wouldn't have raised rates in the summer of 1992," one critic said. "But," he added, "this is an election year."

HEADLINE: Mario Einaudi, An Educator And Writer, 90

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Mario Einaudi, who spent most of his life explaining Europe to Americans and America to Europeans, died on Sunday in the house in which he was born in Piedmont, Italy. He was 90. For most of the last 30 years he had divided his time between Italy and Ithaca, N.Y.
He died after a brief illness, his family said. 
 At his death he was emeritus Goldwin Smith Professor of Government at Cornell University. At the university, he founded the Center for International Studies, which was later renamed the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies.
Professor Einaudi was the oldest son of Luigi Einaudi, an economist who was the first President of the Italian Republic, from 1948 to 1955. Mario Einaudi created the Fondazione Einaudi in Turin, in memory of his father. His father's library formed the basis of what has grown into an important collection of texts on economic history. The foundation also provides graduate research fellowships for students from around the world.
Educated at the University of Turin, Professor Einaudi first came to this country as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow to study at Harvard University in 1927. He returned in 1933 as a political refugee from the Fascist Mussolini regime in Italy.
He taught political science at Harvard University and Fordham University before joining the Cornell faculty in 1945. While there he twice served as chairman of the Department of Government and in 1965 founded the Center for International Studies.
One of his widely known books, still in print, is "The Roosevelt Revolution" (1959), an appraisal of the legacy of the New Deal for American society. He was co-author of two other books that remain in print, "Communism in Western Europe" (1951) and "Christian Democracy in Italy and France" (1969).
Professor Einaudi's wife of 57 years, Manon Michels Einaudi, died in 1990. He is survived by three sons, Luigi of Bethesda, Md., Roberto of Rome, and Marc of Stanford, Calif.; two brothers, Roberto of Milan and Giuglio of Turin, and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gains in Soybeans and Corn Push Silver and Metals Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Corn and soybean prices rose yesterday, helping to touch off a rally in silver and other precious metals, as the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities climbed to its highest point since late March.
Surging prices for coffee also contributed to the rise in the index, a widely watched gauge of inflation, which ended at 230.49, up 3.11 points. 
 Corn and soybeans rose on concerns that dry weather could damage crops almost as badly as flooding hurt them last year. Corn for July delivery gained 6.25 cents a bushel, to $2.6725 on the Chicago Board of Trade. July soybeans rose 13 cents a bushel, to $6.7850, and July wheat rose 6 cents, to $3.2625.
Rainfall over much of the Midwest has been below normal in the last few weeks.
"Weather is much more important after last year's reduced crop," said Bill Biederman, research director at Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
Flooding last year left stockpiles low. The Agriculture Department estimates corn stocks at 827 million bushels, down from 2.11 billion a year earlier.
The gains in corn and soybeans, and the resulting rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index, led silver and other metals higher, traders said.
Silver for July delivery rose 16.2 cents an ounce, to $5.597 on the Commodity Exchange, while June gold gained $2.20, to $383.70 an ounce. July platinum rose $2.60 an ounce, to $405.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Silver is often used as a hedge against inflation. Some traders believe in a connection between silver and soybean prices. A rally in one market often causes a rally in the other.
"When they forecast dry weather," the grains started to rise, said Leonard Kaplan, vice president with Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. "Silver took off on the basis of the C.R.B. rallying."
Higher industrial commodity prices "would push inflation higher," Mr. Kaplan said. Even so, silver could fall if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates today.
On other commodity markets, coffee prices soared, rising for the 13th straight day as concern grew about reduced supplies from Brazil and Colombia. July coffee gained 12.35 cents, to $1.2805 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest price since June 1989.
"The worst things that can happen are all happening at once," said John Connolly, managing director with Alpine Capital Management. Falling exports, rising demand, poor crops next year and falling stockpiles all contributed to the 45 percent rise in coffee prices during the last three weeks.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Little Change As Fed Meeting Is Awaited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most leading currencies yesterday as traders waited to see whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting today.
Many analysts and traders expect the Fed to raise interest rates to stave off the inflation that often accompanies an economic expansion. Higher American rates usually make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive, bolstering demand for the currency. 
 "The currency market was paralyzed today," said Victor Polce, head of foreign exchange marketing at Commerzbank A.G. "Everyone is waiting to see what the Fed does."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6735 German marks, up a fraction from 1.6701 on Friday. It was little changed at 104.80 Japanese yen, down from 104.95 yen.
The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year so far, pushing the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 3.75 percent, from 3 percent, in increments of a quarter of a percentage point.
Another quarter-point increase is not expected to lift the dollar because many traders have been anticipating a larger increase, Mr. Polce said. Indeed, he said, a quarter-point increase would hurt the dollar more than it would help because expectations are so high.
Bond prices rose yesterday, pushing the yield down to 7.44 percent from 7.49 percent on Friday.
"The market is looking for reassurances that the Fed isn't abandoning bondholders," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The dollar is in for some trouble unless the Fed looks like it's vigilant on inflation."
In the first four months of this year, the dollar tumbled as much as 6 percent against the mark and 10 percent against the yen as investors abandoned bonds and other United States assets. The slide could resume if the Fed does not steady the bond market, Mr. De Rosa said.
Many traders expected the Fed to raise interest rates to support the dollar after it joined 18 other central banks in heavy dollar-buying on May 4.
In other currencies, the Greek drachma fell yesterday as speculators bet that it would be devalued soon. The Greek central bank pushed one-month interest rates to 25 percent yesterday from 22 percent to try to defend the drachma. The market rate fell to 248.15 drachmas to the dollar yesterday from 246.16 drachmas on Friday.
Also, the British pound was quoted at $1.5028, up from $1.4991 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Joint Effort in Sports Cars

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 16

 BODY:
The Vector Aeromotive Corporation, whose principal shareholder owns the Italian sports car maker Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., said today that the companies would explore joint projects, including the development of a new engine.
The shareholder, Robert Braner, is president and chief executive of both companies and holds a large stake in Megatech Ltd., an Indonesian company that acquired Lamborghini from the Chrysler Corporation last year. 
 The companies are reviewing design plans on an all-new engine for Vector's Avtech SC Super Coupe, which is due to be introduced later this year.
"The synergy that can be created between the two exotic sports car manufacturers will serve to broaden Vector's market appeal and strengthen Vector's economic viability," Vector said.
Vector said it plans to move operations from Wilmington, Calif. to Jacksonville, Fla., where Lamborghini USA is based, to cut costs and retail prices.
The move may cause minor delays in achieving production goals of 50 of its 1995 model Avtech SC cars, Vector said. The company still plans to make a total of 250 to 300 of the Avtech SC's.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Big League Money Can't Buy Happiness

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Ask any baseball fan if he (or she) would play third base for a major league team for a $500,000 salary plus $2,500 a game or second base for a $1.5 million salary plus $10,000 a game beyond the 90th game, and that fan couldn't answer yes quickly and emphatically enough.
Most fans, in fact, would tell you they would play for nothing. Of course, none of them have the ability to play major league baseball, but that doesn't stop them from wondering how anyone who does could be unhappy playing any position for $500,000 or $1.5 million or any salary major leaguers earn these days. 
 Tony Fernandez is unhappy playing third base for the Cincinnati Reds. Bip Roberts is unhappy playing second base for the San Diego Padres. The aforementioned salaries and bonuses are theirs.
Fernandez, a career shortstop, wants to play short. Roberts, who has displayed a career of versatility, wants to play the outfield. Barry Larkin is the Reds' shortstop, the best in the National League, and Fernandez knew that when he signed with them as a free agent during spring training. The Padres' strongest area is their outfield, and Roberts knew that when he signed with them as a free agent in January.
These are changing times in baseball. The owners want to change the economic system from a get-what-you-can market to a market fixed by a salary cap. The players don't want a salary cap and note that even National Football League team officials are complaining about their new salary-cap system. Rather, they were complaining until the commissioner threatened to fine them for their critical comments.
In advance of their effort to secure a salary cap, the baseball owners implemented an interim system under which they set out to eliminate the middle class of salaries. Not players; they still want the players. But they want them at their idea of a correct salary -- $350,000 for Jack Morris, for example, instead of last year's $5,425,000.
Or $500,000 for Fernandez instead of $2.3 million and $1.5 million for Roberts instead of $3.9 million.
Unlike their collusive assault on free agents in the mid-80's, the owners' strategy to get players at drastically reduced salaries is legal and sensible. If they create a two-tier salary system of stars and spear carriers and in the process make the spear carriers unhappy, all the better to lure the players into a salary-cap system, they reason.
For the most part, though, players do not grumble about the lower salaries they are forced to accept. Maybe if Fernandez and Roberts were making more money, they would not be so unhappy at their present positions. But this most likely is not primarily about money.
In their free-agent forays, the 31-year-old Fernandez and 30-year-old Roberts discovered they didn't have much of a market.
John Davimos, Fernandez's agent and manager of the World Boxing Association heavyweight champion, Michael Moorer, asked Toronto for three years at what the club said -- but Davimos denies -- was $12 million. The Blue Jays, for whom Fernandez had a big post-season last year, had no interest in such a lengthy or lucrative deal. Three weeks into spring training and two agents later, Fernandez reluctantly accepted the Reds' offer to play third.
Recently, however, Fernandez, who always has been unusual, has behaved erratically, tossing his clubhouse chair into a laundry bin, knocking over a clothes hamper and putting items from his locker in equipment bags and storming out of the clubhouse.
"Jim Bowden and Davey Johnson have been very above board and very patient with Tony," said Tom Reich, the agent who secured the job for Fernandez, referring to Cincinnati's general manager and field manager, respectively. "It's understandable that he's terribly frustrated. He lost his spot and a couple million dollars to boot. Hopefully, it will work out. He's better off where he is than sitting at home."
The deal with the Reds apparently includes an understanding that the club will trade Fernandez to a team seeking a shortstop if the opportunity arises. But no such prospect is in sight. Pat Gillick, the general manager of the Blue Jays, a team that could use a shortstop, said yesterday that he has no plans to trade for Fernandez.
Roberts, hitting only .217, rejoined San Diego in Chicago last night after receiving permission to leave the Padres for a few days, the club said, "to help him cope with stress and pressures that have been bothering him."
Roberts's problems were said to stem more from migraine headaches than playing second base, but he wasn't always a happy player the previous two years in Cincinnati because of the position or positions he was playing. Although he is one of the most versatile players in the majors, Roberts doesn't like changing positions and he doesn't like second base.
But the Padres have Tony Gwynn, Derek Bell and Phil Plantier in their outfield, leaving no room for Roberts.
So Roberts and Fernandez are stuck with their unwanted jobs and their lower but nonetheless livable salaries. In these changing times, they should be happy they have any jobs at all.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
America The Best

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The United States is the best country in the world. In America, you are free to become anything you want. The only person who can stop you is you. You can say what you want, pray as you want, or don't want. The police will never bother you unless you break the law. So don't break it. In America, if you want to work you can make a living. Only America gives you all these things. God blesses the golden land.
I knew that was all true when I was a small boy. My parents told me so straight out, at home. They compared it with Europe and America won, in every way except maybe the fruit was a little fresher there. 
 In school, teachers gave us lessons and books that fully backed up what my parents said about America. Mostly they were Irish women presiding over quiet classrooms of little Jews and Italians.
Sometimes the teachers talked about God and how important it was to honor Him and your parents. At Christmastime, teachers put up wreaths. My parents said why not -- after all, it was their country too, wasn't it?
Now in Tavares, Fla., the school board has passed a regulation that children be taught that American culture and values are inherently superior to other "foreign or historic cultures."
My parents and teachers would have thought the board stupid. My father detested right-wing noseybodies, plus Communists and Socialists. They all reminded him of the Russia he left. He would have said that if you need a law to teach a child right from wrong you should go back to school yourself.
But he is also saying in my head, right now, that on second thought if those regulators don't know that America is made up of "foreign or historic cultures" maybe they are too ignorant to profit by school.
Mrs. Margaret McCarthy and other teachers for whom we stood up and shut up would have said Tavares should hire teachers and elect board members who understood America before they got near a schoolhouse. Neither parents nor teachers ever used the words "values" or "culture"; the word "America" summed it up nicely for them.
Please note, readers, that my parents and teachers never said America was the perfect country, just the best. Not everybody agreed in those days.
Some thought Nazi Germany was better. They paraded in New York City -- not often after the first time, believe me.
Other Americans thought the Soviet Union was better. Some were young people who believed Stalin was the only bulwark against Hitler. Others were older in tooth and even softer in mind -- such as professors who babbled about the wonders of the Soviet system until it fell to dust. To this day they are not inclined to go into the matter of the gulag.
My parents and teachers did not talk much about tarnish marks on the golden land -- crime, poverty and race.
About crime, I promise not to glaze any more eyes with stories about how we spent summer nights sleeping in the park. (But we did). Now, though, when it comes to crime, we are not the best but among the worst. And there we will stay, as long as we are sentimental about either gun nuts or recidivists.
About poor, that was Our Crowd. What was there to say except someday things will be better, meantime join a union? My father believed that any white man who could not make a living in America was lazy or a fool, or both. That thought lurks in me still.
From my childhood, I remember not a single real discussion about minorities. Our neighborhoods were working-class, mildly liberal, and color-segregated. We did not know any "minorities." As a matter of fact, we thought Jews and Catholics were the minorities.
If I were black maybe I would become smart enough not to fret about ugly people who slighted me for my color. I doubt it. But I know that I would burn day and night at injustices that stood between me and believing everything in the opening paragraph of this column.
What I wind up thinking is this: Because of America's range for economic hope, and its Constitution, this is the best country in the world for all Americans, any shade.
That's not good enough. In school and out, the American prayer should now be that one day the country will soar farther, and make the first paragraph true, every word for every person. It will happen.

HEADLINE: Youthful, Impressionable And Accused of Murder

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young -- A periodic report.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
The most shocking thing about them is their ordinariness. Like so many young teen-agers, they are insecure, materialistic, impressionable, not always in command of their anger and aggressiveness.
They often come from broken homes, and in many cases their mothers are hard-working women trying to build safe and comfortable futures for their children. They get in arguments that seem the petty stuff of coming of age -- a taunting bully, an insulting boyfriend, a stolen puppy. They want the things that will make them popular: Nikes, mountain bikes, presents for girls. 
 But what sets these few apart from other young teen-agers is that the state has called them killers. In New York City, 28 youths 13 to 15 years old were indicted last year in adult courts for murders committed in 1993. The cases were handled under a juvenile offender law intended specifically to move them out of family court and allow for tougher sentences. Thirteen of the youths have been found guilty of murder or manslaughter. Two were acquitted of murder but found guilty of lesser charges. The rest await trial.
Rodney Reid, who was 13 years old when he murdered an 18-year-old over a drug deal, says he sold marijuana to buy himself what he otherwise could not afford. "I made money so I could get myself things I needed, like sneakers," he said. Of the youth he shot, he said, regretfully, "He was all right."
Crime in general, and crime by the youngest in particular, has become a national obsession. The arrest rate for juveniles for murder has climbed 60 percent in a decade, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But who are these youngsters? And why do they kill?
They often come from single-parent homes, seeking older friends in place of the father they barely know. But they are not all the children of a welfare-dependent, drug-abusing underclass. Half have parents or guardians who work.
In fact, the vast majority of cases are not directly related to drugs. Most of the killings were the result of robberies and disputes. The connection is often more subtle than a scrap over drug turf.
Rather, it is that the youth was high when the police say he pulled the trigger, or that his mother was an addict so he had to go live with a relative.
Most of these youths were not habitual lawbreakers. Six of them, however, had serious criminal records that provided some clue to the violence to come, according to a study by The New York Times of the 26 cases in which the teenagers have been convicted or still await trial.
More commonly, they were truants who passed their days on the streets. Ten of the youths had never been arrested. Another 10 had been arrested for lesser offenses like joy riding, fighting, or playing bit parts in the drug trade -- cases that prosecutors say were often dropped because witnesses did not show up or undercover narcotics officers were unwilling to blow their identities to put someone away for a few months.
And in a juvenile justice system struggling to handle growing numbers of serious felons, prosecutors and social workers have had fewer resources to deal with teen-agers charged with small-time offenses -- before they graduate to big-time trouble.
One factor does tie together 20 of the 26 cases: the availability of a handgun. The youths bought and borrowed guns easily. Some said they went to the black market on a street corner or in someone's house, where arsenals of were for sale.
 
A Fascination With Weapons
 Guyce Hayes said he bought a .32-caliber handgun from a neighborhood crack addict for $40 when he was 14 years old. "I just bought it to be buying it because I had the money at the time," Guyce said in a recent interview from prison.
Others borrowed weapons. Tippy Jones, 15, got his TEC-9 from a friend he knew as "J.B. And Chauncey Forden, 15, told police that he found a .38-caliber revolver in his brother's room.
In a neighborhood equivalent of the arms race, some of the youths said they got a gun because everyone else seemed to have one. Shaul Linyear bought his first gun at age 15 for $100 on a corner two blocks from home after he was robbed twice at gunpoint.
Only four of the youths had been arrested on gun charges, though far more carried or had access to guns. A 1992 survey of New York City public high school students, conducted by city agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 7 percent said they had carried a handgun.
The number of juveniles New York City prosecuted for possession of a loaded firearm rocketed from 103 in 1986 to 750 in 1992, said Peter Reinharz, chief prosecutor in the city's Family Court. There were so many gun cases in Manhattan's Family Court last year that prosecutors needed a second evidence safe to store the weapons.
 
Most Victims Were Young
 The teen-agers' victims fell into two categories: A majority were young and usually died as the result of a dispute, either as a participant or a bystander. Eight were teen-agers. Usually, the victims were the same race as the person accused in the killing.
In contrast, all 10 robbery victims were adults. Usually they were a different race than the youths charged with killing them. All 10 suspects were black, while five of the victims were Hispanic, two were Asian, two were black and one was white. The victims were shopkeepers, cabdrivers, deliverymen or people just out for a stroll.
The weakened bonds of family and community -- bonds that have traditionally kept teen-agers in line -- also appear to have contributed to the violence, especially in urban black communities hit hardest by social and economic decay. Of the 26 teen-agers, 21 lived with a single parent, an aunt or a grandmother. Twenty-one of the 26 were black teen-age boys. All but two of the 26 were male.
 
A Lack of Alternatives
 It makes sense, say sociologists, that the youth crime rates took off in the mid-1980's, as the growing number of children born to unmarried mothers in the 1970's entered adolescence at the same time that crack began eating away at the already weakened structure of many poor families.
Often, the youths in these cases confronted their crimes with bravado or naivete. Richard Siracusa, a criminal defense lawyer, said many youths involved in violent incidents, including his client Gerald Bunche, do not even hide out after a crime.
"These 15-year-old kids, they don't know where to go. So they go home," said Mr. Siracusa. "It amazes me sometimes, the police ask some kid to come down to the station, and they go, on their own carfare. Their own token. You or me, we'd be on the next flight to Miami. But these kids just go right in, like they're told."
 
ANTHONY KNOWLES, 13
Awaiting trial
 Anthony was involved in a gun battle on Aug. 26 between rival groups of youths at the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York, the police say. Toyatwenda Gillard, 17, was caught in the crossfire as she ran to the playground there to scoop up her son Donovan, 2, who had been climbing on a jungle gym. Ms. Gillard was struck by a bullet in the head and died draped over the playground fence.
The police said that Anthony, a slight, sweet-faced boy, was chasing Shaimond Johnson, 16, when he fired a .380-caliber handgun several times. Ms. Gillard's sister, Valena, said the bad blood between the two groups began with a fight during a basketball game in 1992.
Yvonne Knowles, Anthony's mother, said her her son is innocent and is being blamed for the crime by neighborhood toughs who bullied him. Anthony hung out with the wrong crowd because he was looking for older guys to substitute for the father he did not have, she said. She worried about Anthony's truancy, but was unable to get him to attend school, she said.
"I hate the projects," said Ms. Knowles, who moved after her son was charged in the killing. "They are not a place to raise any kids."
At the time of the shooting, Anthony was on probation for being a passenger in a stolen car.
 
GUYCE HAYES, 15
Convicted of murder; sentenced to 12 and one-third years to life
 The blue Alfa Romeo throbbed with the beat of rapper Heavy D as it cruised Jamaica, Queens, on Jan. 31, Super Bowl Sunday. Guyce, a slim, reserved 15-year-old in the back seat, pulled out a .32-caliber handgun and fired a shot into the brain of 22-year-old Kevin Edwards, the driver. Then he swung the gun to the passenger side and put a bullet in 29-year-old William Cox's head.
No one, least of all his victims, had believed Guyce capable of such a bloody act. He was a shy, sickly youth who had to be taught at home by a public school teacher because he was asthmatic. His passions were rap music and cars. He hadn't even started shaving the fuzz on his upper lip.
"He was the little guy from the neighborhood," said Mr. Cox, who survived the shooting.
Guyce's father, Donald Chapman, an elevator operator, never knew he had a son until Guyce was indicted for murder and the child's mother broke the news to him. By the time they met, Mr. Chapman said, "It was too late for Guyce."
Guyce lived with his grandmother and his mother in Jamaica. They got by on welfare. When Guyce was a seventh and eighth grader, Steve Williams, a teacher of homebound students, came to their dilapidated house most weekdays. "Personality-wise, Guyce was the best," Mr. Williams said. "He was pleasant. He had a sense of humor. If I gave him an assignment, it was always done."
Guyce's friends and family say that when he was 14, he got mixed up with Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cox, known as Junior. Guyce says they pressured him to accept an old, broken-down Ford Escort that just sat unused on the street, gathering stacks of parking tickets. Guyce claims Mr. Edwards threatened to hurt him and his mother unless he sold drugs to pay off the tickets -- a contention Mr. Edwards' family called a lie.
"They forced the car on me," Guyce said in an interview. "It was a setup. They had customers on my block, and being that they knew I was always over, they, they tried to get me to sell to their customers."
Guyce worked for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cox, he and his relatives said. Along the way, he bought a gun for $40. "He did whatever they told him to do," said Michael Reavis, Guyce's best friend's uncle. "As he got older, he wanted out, but they wouldn't let him out."
In his confession, taped the morning after the crime, Guyce told the police in a dull, exhausted monotone that the men were pressuring him to sell crack to pay off a $1,200 debt. Guyce said that, when he refused, the men said they were going to "strip me, beat me with a bat and throw me in the lake" at Baisley Pond Park.
Mr. Cox testified that Guyce shot them for no reason. Mr. Cox acknowledged that he had had a crack problem and had served time in prison for it, but said he was off drugs at the time of the shooting and was not a drug dealer. Prosecutors noted that Mr. Edwards, who died, had no criminal record.
After the gunfire, Mr. Cox said he called out to Guyce to duck, but Guyce was gone.
"Guyce, I trusted him," Mr. Cox said. "I went to his house. I went to his bedroom. I knew his mother. I keep thinking, 'Not Guyce. I see you every day.' "
 
RODNEY REID, 13
Convicted of manslaughter; sentenced to three years
 Rodney shot Rafael Nunez, 18, on a street corner in Jamaica, Queens, on March 3. Rodney later went around the neighborhood boasting about the killing and trying to sell the .45-caliber handgun, the police said.
Rodney said in an interview that he met Mr. Nunez that night to buy a pound of marijuana and to return a gun Mr. Nunez had lent him. Rodney said Mr. Nunez wanted $1,250 for the drugs, but he had only $950.
"I told him to try to do better for me," Rodney said.
During an argument over the price, Rodney told the police, Mr. Nunez grabbed the gun from his waistband, the two struggled and the gun went off.
But investigators believe Rodney intentionally shot Mr. Nunez in the stomach, then chased him into a nearby bodega, where, the police said, Rodney asked if the dying victim wanted "some more."
Rodney moved to New York City from Florida with his mother and four brothers when he was a toddler. They settled in Crown Heights, then moved to Queens at age 9 to get away from crime. But violence followed.
At 12, Rodney said, he was robbed on the subway by six youths, three of them with guns. They took his designer sneakers and jacket, then ran. Rodney said he made his way home, shoeless and angry.
"They played me like I was a punk or a sucker," he said. "That was the first and last time, I make sure of that."
Rodney would not say whether he began carrying a gun after that. Rodney himself became a menace in his neighborhood and school, investigators and a school official said. He had an explosive temper and a frame as large as a man's. He routinely shouted insults at neighbors, frequently skipped classes and once even threatened to kill a teacher who reprimanded him for incomplete homework.
Neighbors and others say his mother, Jaqualine Thompson, who Rodney said was a meter maid who is now unemployed, was upset by her inability to control him. She told investigators the day of his arrest that she would consider a plea bargain on her son's behalf if it included mandatory schooling.
 
ROBERT BROWN, 14 GREGORY MORRIS, 14
Cases Pending
 Robert testified that he, Gregory and two older youths had three bikes and wanted a fourth. Instead of going to school on June 1, they headed to Prospect Park to steal one.
During a trial last month that resulted in the conviction of the shooter, Jerome Nisbett, 17, for murder, Robert testified that they first went after a woman practicing karate, but she saw them and fled. Then, they saw a male cyclist, but he was going too fast. Finally, they found Allyn Winslow, on Quaker Hill, one of the most peaceful places in the park. Robert testified that Gregory said, "Let's get him." They circled Mr. Winslow, 42, a drama teacher, on their bikes, Robert said.
When Mr. Winslow tried to ride away, prosecutors say, Mr. Nisbett shot him in the back twice. Mr. Winslow stayed on his bike, steering down a hill, over a small bridge and out of the woods. But he collapsed in a meadow, fatally wounded.
Mr. Nisbett told the police that he fired the .22-caliber revolver, which he called "the burner." "All you could see was the smoke coming from the gun," Robert testified.
Robert and Gregory were indicted as juvenile offenders because they were 14. The two other suspects, both 16, were charged as adults. Robert agreed to testify in exchange for being allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter, a lesser charge, and to receive a sentence of one and one-third to four years.
Robert said he also has a case pending in Family Court, where he is charged with showing a gun on May 6, 1993, while another person took someone's wallet. Two years ago, he pleaded guilty in Family Court to fourth-degree grand larceny for joy riding and was given two years' probation.
Robert lived with his mother, Sarah, and several siblings on St. Marks Avenue in Crown Heights. Gregory also lived with his mother, Winsome, and nine other siblings in a cramped basement apartment nearby on Rogers Avenue. They knew each other from the neighborhood.
Gregory was a troublesome student at I.S. 390, prone to angry outbursts and rude behavior, school officials said. On one occasion, he threatened to cut a dean with a razor when the dean asked him to leave a hallway where he was causing trouble, said the dean, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Eventually, the dean said, school officials recommended Gregory's transfer to a resource room in the school where he could receive individual attention.
Alicia Benton-Owens, who teaches health at the school, said Gregory "wasn't a pleasure. He'd come in with a Walkman, eating candy, and put his feet on his desk."
Gregory's lawyer, Howard Kirsch, declined to comment on the case, although his client has pleaded not guilty. Robert's lawyer, Howard Weiswasser, said his client is not guilty.
"I really don't think he's a bad kid," he said. "I think he got swept up in a series of circumstances."
 
LUKE DAWKINS, 14
Pleaded guilty to manslaughter; sentenced to three and one-third to ten years
 It all started over a single cigarette, the police said. Nahl Finch and Luke Dawkins both wanted to smoke it. The 14-year-olds argued, and the next afternoon, July 6, they returned to Liberty Park in Jamaica, Queens.
Nahl started picking on Luke right away, witnesses said. Nahl was a neighborhood bully who had set cats on fire, and even threatened his own grandmother, family members said. Luke was afraid of him, and so that day, Luke said, he had put a steak knife in his pocket just to scare Nahl away.
When Nahl grabbed at Luke, Luke said he pulled his knife. But the knife didn't make Nahl back off. In a split second, Luke decided to use the knife. He plunged it into Nahl's neck, hitting a major artery. Luke ran home, crying, to wash the blood from his hands.
"That knife was in his pocket," said his lawyer, Bryan Levinson. "He stabbed. That's how it is out on the street. People in these areas are afraid for their lives. The whole world is a fight."
Luke lived with his mother, Pamela Dawkins, in Jamaica. Ms. Dawkins worked in the nursing department at St. Albans Veterans Administration Hospital, the police said. Luke was the youngest of six children, and he had fallen under the influence of his older brother, Alvin, now 22.
Seven months earlier, Luke and Alvin had been arrested for ambushing a Chinese food delivery man and robbing him of $67 and $19 worth of food, and Alvin was later found guilty in that case. The victim told the police that Luke had hit him on the head with a bat.
After stabbing Nahl, Luke pleaded guilty to the robbery and to killing Nahl, although the murder charge was reduced to manslaughter because Luke had not meant to kill him. Luke was terrified of prison and asked his lawyer, Mr. Levinson, "Will they beat me up?"
 
HEDLEY SEWELL, 14
Pleaded guilty to manslaughter; sentenced to three and one-third to ten years
 Hedley says he and four friends decided to rob someone, anyone, for money. He later told the police that Jorge de Leon was the first vulnerable-looking person they saw as they walked down Ryer Avenue 187th Street in the Bronx on the night of Aug. 12.
Mr. de Leon, 43, an unemployed Vietnam veteran, was headed home after visiting his wife, Rosa, at a nearby hospital. The teen-agers chased him across the street, threw him down and went through his pockets. They found 50 cents, his wife said.
They then punched and stomped Mr. de Leon, leaving him on the street, dazed and bleeding. The boys retreated down the block, hooting with excitement, a witness said.
Mr. de Leon was helped inside a nearby building, then taken home, where he died three days later from a brain hemorrhage.
Hedley, who was small for his age at 4 feet 8 inches, lived alone in his mother's apartment. She worked as a live-in helper in Westchester County, neighbors say, coming home on Saturday evening and staying only 24 hours. An older brother sometimes came by.
Unsupervised, Hedley rarely attended school, went out at all hours, played loud music and invited friends over, some of whom brought girls to stay the night, neighbors say.
"I can't tell you how many people I saw coming and going," said Margie Vega, who lives next door. "He must have given keys to all his friends."
When he was taken into custody for killing Mr. DeLeon, the police said Hedley quickly admitted his guilt. Court records show he had never been charged with a crime. Tracy Almazan, the prosecutor, said she was startled to face such a tiny defendant.
"In court, he was very matter-of-fact," she said. "Most pleadings are very emotional affairs. Some people cry, some are angry. He was stone cold."
Ms. Almazan said she was also struck by the way that the boy was eager to plead guilty, ignoring the urging of his lawyer and his mother that he contest the charge. He seemed proud, she said, and seemed to want everyone to see that he could take whatever he was dished.
 
TIPPY JONES, 15
Awaiting trial
 From the window of his ground-floor apartment in a housing project on West 19th Street in Manhattan, the police said that Tippy Jones watched as a neighborhood crack addict and small-time drug dealer, Audrey Walker, 35, approached his building in the early hours of Oct. 18. Tippy took the Tec-9 semiautomatic handgun he kept under a mattress, stepped out his front door into a small lobby, and shot Ms. Walker four times.
Tippy had been arrested for selling cocaine in 1992 and spent a year in jail in that case, but the detective who arrested Tippy for murder said he thought the youth was too small a player in the drug trade to be the gunman in a planned execution. Tippy probably acted on his own to impress friends, neighbors and drug dealers, said the detective, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Tippy was living with his aunt and her seven children. He was not in school. His mother was a crack addict, a law-enforcement official said. His father had died of a heart attack when he was 8. Tippy and two sisters grew up in Jamaica, Queens, where they were raised by a grandmother. She died while Tippy was serving a year in a juvenile detention center for the cocaine charge.
Tippy's aunt, Felicia Lindsey, said he lacked a moral anchor in his life. "Kids are looking for something to hold on to," she said. "If you teach them some morals, then when they do something wrong, you can pull them back. If you don't care what they do, they'll be out there, looking for self."
With slightly droopy eyes that seem to tinge his face with sadness, Tippy seemed to some friends to be mentally frail, frequently collapsing into tears when he was teased by other kids in the project.
"Tippy listened to other people too much," said Kareem Jones, a friend who also lives at 420 West 19th Street. "He couldn't think clearly for himself. He would always do what you want, chill when you want to chill, go to the store when you want to go to the store."
The detective who arrested Tippy said he bragged about the shooting, telling several people in the building that they should thank him for doing away with a public menace. Ms. Walker had been widely disliked. Neighbors said she regularly robbed elderly neighbors to support her habit.
Tippy acted unafraid, cocky even, when the police asked him and his aunt to come to the station to answer some questions, the detective said. But confronted with information that implicated him in the shooting, Tippy wavered, asking his aunt to go back home and let him talk to the detective alone.
"I told him, no, you act like a man and talk about this while she's here," said the detective. "Those were the words that got to him, 'act like a man.' He crumbled."
Tippy confessed to the shooting, the detective said, and said he had asked a friend to throw the gun into the Hudson River. Later, Tippy pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Edwin Gonzalez, declined to comment.
 
JAMES BUTLER, 14
Pleaded guilty to manslaughter; sentenced to two to six years
 This killing grew out of a fight over dice game winnings, said Shannon Alexander, James's 17-year-old co-defendant.
On Aug. 18, a few days after the game, Mr. Alexander said he, James and a third young man, were in Aberdeen Park in Bushwick, when they spotted "Prince" from the dice game fight, adding that it was the third man who fired an AK-47 assault rifle at Prince. The police say those bullets missed the intended victim and struck a bystander, Derrick Johnson, 23 years old. James had the AK-47 when the police arrested him at his home. Mr. Alexander later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the killing.
James lived with his aunt, Sylvia Graves, from the time he was 2. His mother, Paulette, lives in Manhattan and has not seen her son in years, Ms. Graves said. He was known in the neighborhood as "Little James" because of his diminutive stature. His passion was basketball, his friends said.
Though James was quiet and polite, friends say he began hanging out with older, tougher youths in his neighborhood sometime in 1993. Danny Esquilin, a community activist who helped organize basketball teams in the neighborhood, said James was looking for a male role model. "He was looking for somebody who wasn't there," Mr. Esquilin said.
"I guess he wanted to feel like he was part of something. But this kid was no hood."
 
MICHAEL HARRIS, 15
Awaiting trial
 According to the police account in court records, on Sept. 5, Michael's co-defendant, Russell Gaither, 16, cornered Frantz Germain on a street in Flatbush and swung a bat at him. Then Michael stabbed Mr. Germain, 19, in the chest with a knife.
Darla Harris, Michael's mother, an immigrant from Belize, did not want to discuss the case. His lawyer, Salvatore Canonico, said Michael was not the one who carried out the killing. Mr. Gaither is still awaiting trial.
 
WILLIAM BAILEY, 15
Awaiting trial
 The police said that William shot Jerome Clark, 63, a Pepsi-Cola deliveryman, during an attempted robbery on Oct. 18 in a South Bronx supermarket.
William was not attending school or working at the time of the incident, said a spokesman for the Bronx District Attorney's office. He was living with his grandmother, Joyce Kanu, in the High Bridge section of the Bronx. A lawyer for William, Anthony Ventura, said a videotape monitoring the store's entrance did not give a clear picture recorded entering and leaving the store at the time of the killing.
 
CHAUNCEY FORDEN, 15
Awaiting trial
 On Friday, Nov. 5, Chauncey was playing hooky in his basement with a couple of buddies. They were smoking joints, munching on sandwiches, and watching a video of "Menace II Society," a movie about guns and violence in the ghetto, he told the police.
They had already smoked "two blunts" when Chauncey started toying with his brother Shawn's black .38-caliber revolver, Chauncey told the police, adding that he picked up the gun and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He pulled the trigger again. This time, Chauncey told the police in a deadpan voice, the bullet tore into his friend Kevin Scott's head as Kevin got up from the couch.
Kevin died the next day at Jacobi Hospital.
Chauncey grew up in the same neatly kept brick row house where he shot Kevin, in Williamsbridge, the Bronx. His parents, who declined to discuss the case or say what they do for a living, were working that day.
Chauncey admits he knew the revolver was loaded, court records show. That morning, he had taken it from his brother's room, emptied it of three bullets, then put them back in. He even wandered to the back door and fired it in the air, the record said.
Chauncey's lawyer, Lewis Alperin, said he will argue that Chauncey never meant to kill his friend and should be found guilty of a lesser charge, manslaughter in the second degree, which is prosecuted in Family Court. Mr. Alperin, who has seen Chauncey's videotaped statement, said he was taken aback by the demeanor of the youth and of his mother, Catherine Forden, who sat at his side.
"He talks about this horrible crime, and his mother just sits there," Mr. Alperin said. "There was no emotional reaction. If it was my kid, I would turn around and say, 'How could you do this?' "
Chauncey had been arrested seven months earlier on a robbery charge. And that July, he was arrested twice within two days on charges of selling drugs. The drug cases were never prosecuted, but he pleaded guilty in September to larceny and was given two years probation, court officials said.
 
SHAKEEM HODGE, 15
Awaiting trial
 Ann Yeo, the co-owner of a Chinese takeout restaurant on Burke Avenue in the Bronx, knew Shakeem as a regular customer. On Nov. 24, the night before Thanksgiving, the police say Shakeem walked into Lee's Kitchen, pointed a 9-millimeter handgun at Ms. Yeo and asked her for the cash in her register. Two of his 14-year-old friends watched.
Ms. Yeo apparently took $19 out of the register, stuffed it into her apron pocket and then tried to push the gun away. In the struggle that followed, the gun fired and struck Ms. Yeo, 30. She died the following day. A co-worker later suggested that Ms. Yeo had been unable to take seriously a demand from a chubby kid who spent most of his afternoons in front of the video games in the pizza parlor next door.
Shakeem later told the police that he and his friends wanted money to go roller skating, a detective said. They did not intend to shoot Ms. Yeo, Shakeem said, and when the gun fired they ran out of the store without taking any money. Shakeem's mother, Linda Hodge, who says she is self-employed, insists that her son was not capable of the crime, and the teen-ager has pleaded not guilty in the killing.
Shopkeepers in the area said a gun can turn a young prankster into a killer. Maria Rodriguez, the proprietor of a bodega next door to Lee's Kitchen, knew Shakeem for his awkward attempts to shoplift Cheetos. Donald Marajh, who works at Step Two Haircutters three doors down, said Shakeem was a harmless-looking kid who dropped quarter after quarter into video game machines.
"These kids are not used to having a gun," said Mr. Marajh. "When they get one in their hands, they want to flash it around."
Like most other teenagers in Williamsbridge, a quiet section of the Bronx near the border with Yonkers, Shakeem was from a middle-class family and had never been arrested. A reliable if uninspired student at Harry S. Truman High School, Shakeem liked gym class best, his mother said, because he excelled at basketball and swimming.
Ms. Hodge and her eight children moved to New York from the Virgin Islands in 1988 when Shakeem was 10. His father, a plumber and carpenter, stayed behind.
 
RAYMOND JOHNSON, 14
Awaiting trail
 The police say that Raymond and an unidentified man went to an unoccupied apartment in a public housing project in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn on Dec. 3 to scare away some people who were using it as a place to party. The police believe the man with Raymond was a drug dealer who wanted to use the apartment for business.
Jerome Reeves, 21 years old, was shot as he answered a knock at the door, the people in the apartment told the police.
Housing police officers heard the shots and saw two men run from the building. One of them, whom police identified as Raymond, dropped a gun and was apprehended. The police do not believe Raymond pulled the trigger.
Raymond's lawyer, Mark Zuckerman, said Raymond was not even at the scene of the killing.
 
GERALD BUNCHE, 15
Convicted of murder; sentenced to nine years to life
 On a cold night in February, Gerald Bunche helped two friends rob a bodega on Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. While Gerald stood lookout, his friend, Dion Davis, 18, pointed a Mach 11 semiautomatic at the cashier, Jose de Leon, 39, and pulled the trigger twice, killing him.
Gerald's family had been torn apart by divorce, and Gerald had spent time living with each parent. His three siblings adapted and did well in school. But Gerald fell in with older youths and began committing crimes, his father said.
When he was 13, Gerald was arrested three times in one month: for possession of crack, assaulting a passenger on a No. 1 subway train in Manhattan, and attempted rape, Family Court records show. At 14, he served a year for car theft. He had been out only a week when he was arrested for murder.
 
JOE SANCHEZ, 15
Awaiting trial
Firing from a rooftop in the Bronx, the police said, Joe fatally shot Andy Vega, 16, on Jan. 25 as the victim stood outside a bodega in the Mount Hope neighborhood.
But investigators say it is not clear why he fired the deadly shot, or whether he wanted to kill anyone. He was identified as the shooter nine months after the killing and arrested.
Joe moved to the Bronx from San Juan, P.R., with his family when he was nearly a year old. His parents separated about seven years ago, leaving his mother, Carmen Olmedo, who receives public assistance, to raise Joe and seven other children. But his father, Alejandro Sanchez, who lives nearby, says he has kept close ties to the family.
Joe was a slow learner who showed little interest in his studies, his mother said. But while he sometimes played hookey, she said he was never a habitual truant.
His family said he has no criminal record and was not a troublesome child, and he has pleaded not guilty to the killing. The family maintains he had never given them reason to believe he was capable of such violence.
"My heart tells me that he didn't do it," said Mrs. Olmedo.
 
TAHIR TOOMBS, 13
Pleaded guilty to murder; sentenced to 9 years to life
 Tahir killed for the first time in Ozone Park, Queens. He shot Clyde Scott, 35, in the back with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun on Feb. 7 after Mr. Scott confronted him for snatching a gold necklace earlier that day.
Nine days later, Tahir killed again, with the same gun. He shot a livery cab driver, Fernando Lopez, 26, in the head while robbing him of cab fare to send two friends home that night.
Tahir had been driving his mother, Deboroah Toombs, to distraction since he was 10, straying far from the modest, working-class life she had provided. Earning $29,000 a year as a telephone operator, Ms. Toombs had raised Tahir and his younger brother in a tidy apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
She provided her boys with trips to the zoo, picnics, video games, stereos, fancy jeans and sneakers. "I used to have to tell him, 'It's not that you have it good; it's that your mother works hard,' " Ms. Toombs said.
Tahir was a quiet boy most of his life, the kind of child who did average work in school and never caused trouble. But by age 10, he began to show a keen interest in the wild life of the streets during stays at his grandmother's house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where, his mother said, she left him most evenings while she worked the late shift.
There, Tahir came to admire young men who wore flashy gold jewelry, drove fancy cars and made quick profits on drugs sales. "I got him what he needed, but I couldn't compete with that," Ms. Toombs said. She became so alarmed by her son's friends that, she said, she wandered the streets, begging them to stay away from him.
Tahir started cutting class, selling drugs and even struck his mother. Seeking help, she said she phoned her police precinct and the city's Child Welfare Administration. She even considered sending him to a military academy until she found out the cost.
"I tried everything because I was afraid of losing him," she said.
In desperation, she convinced a neighbor to press charges against Tahir in 1991, and he served several months for assault in a juvenile detention center. But the brief incarceration did not stop his slide into crime.
A year and a half after his release, he went on the killing spree. By then, his mother had sent him to live with some relatives in Queens with the hope that they could bring him under control.
 
SHAUL LINYEAR, 15
Pleaded guilty to murder; sentenced to seven years to life
 Shaul shot and killed a candy delivery man, Ricardo Nunez, in Brooklyn during a robbery on Feb. 19. Shaul said he had planned to spend the money from the robbery on a new pair of sneakers.
Shaul lived in Crown Heights with his mother, who had a job as an office worker and went to college at night. Shaul had been found guilty of possession of a loaded weapon two months before the murder. He was sentenced to 18 months in a residential center on the gun charge, but spent only two weeks there.
 
ANTHONY SMITH, 15
Convicted of weapons charges. Hung jury on murder charge. Will be retried.
 Prosecutors say that on Feb. 27, Anthony shot and killed Michael McNeil, 26, the backseat passenger in a moving car, during a dispute over money. Anthony denies it.
Anthony lived with his mother, who is on welfare, in Brownsville, Brooklyn. His father had recently been murdered in what Anthony's family described as a drive-by shooting. Anthony was devastated, said his brother, Frederick Smith. "He didn't care about things anymore," Mr. Smith said.
Anthony has a history of arrests, dating back to age 12, for robbery and weapons possession. Family Court records show he failed to show up in court on the weapons case. A warrant was issued, but he was never picked up and the case was dismissed because it was not prosecuted quickly enough.
 
ELIZABETH HOS, 15
Pleaded guilty to murder; sentenced to six years to life
 Elizabeth admitted in court that she and her boyfriend, Anton Rogers, 18, walked into Kim Wei Kitchen, a Chinese restaurant in Sunset Park, to pull a robbery on April 1. Mr. Rogers drew his .25-caliber revolver and demanded money from the cashier, Kam Ping Kwok, 30, who told them she recognized them and would report them to the police, Elizabeth and Mr. Rogers said later.
Mr. Rogers, who also pleaded guilty to murder, told the police that Elizabeth pressured him to fire. "Beth said, 'Shoot the bitch,' " Mr. Rogers said. "So I shot her."
Elizabeth said she went behind the counter to get the money from the register. They fled to a friend's house, where they counted about $200, Mr. Rogers said.
Elizabeth -- Beth to her family -- was a truant and a runaway, her mother, Sadet Hos, told the police when she filed missing persons reports on her in the month before the murder. In March, Beth called home and told her brother she would see them when she was 18. Mr. Rogers told the police that he and Beth had done other robberies together.
Family members said Elizabeth wanted to be like any other American teen-ager, but Ms. Hos, a Turkish immigrant and a devout Muslim, thought her daughter should stay home, study and do household chores. Ms. Hos was struggling to raise Elizabeth and a younger son by herself, since the father lived in New Jersey. She worked nights cleaning offices at the Met Life building in Manhattan, leaving her children with a friend. The mother and daughter often fought, said Elizabeth's lawyer, Daniel Williams.
Elizabeth's family and classmates say she was led astray by a possessive and manipulative boyfriend. "She's not a bad person," said her brother, Gokhan, 14. "She was just hanging with the wrong people."
 
CATHY MAJARAJ, 14
Awaiting trial
 Cathy says she was simply rushing home from school on April 5 to get ready for work when a mob of more than 25 teen-agers erupted into violence in Ridgewood, Queens. "It was a riot," she said. "I was on the floor getting all scratched up myself." But investigators say Cathy stabbed Kultos Sayaves, 21, with a kitchen knife during the melee in front of the victim's home.
Cathy was raised by her mother, Slavia Martinez, after her parents separated when she was 7 years old. Ms. Martinez struggled to make ends meet, sometimes holding down two jobs and working late into the evenings while a neighbor watched her children in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Cathy said. Cathy maintained a close relationship with her father, Pooran Maharaj, spending many weekends with him. Cathy said she kept busy with homework, chores and a part-time job selling cookies. She had no prior arrest record.
 
DAMON HOOKS, 15
Convicted of manslaughter; sentenced to three and one-third to 10 years
Deshawn Mayberry and his girlfriend were arguing on June 26 about who was going to look after their baby while she went to the beach. Damon, a friend of the girl's, got into the middle of the fight. "It was a little bit of chivalry," said Detective George Readding of the 40th Precinct. "Damon was trying to protect the girlfriend."
In the hallway outside Damon's aunt's apartment in Mott Haven, the Bronx, the yelling between Mr. Mayberry and his girlfriend escalated into a shoving match, said Damon's lawyer, Pat Bruno. Damon fetched a a kitchen knife. When he pulled it, Mr. Mayberry, 19, asked, "What are you going to do, stab me?"
There may have been a struggle before Damon put the knife in Mr. Mayberry's heart. "Damon was trying to do what a man has to do in the Bronx," said Mr. Bruno. "This was kind of like senseless stupidity," said Detective Readding.
Damon lived with his mother, who is on welfare, in Mott Haven, a desolate, violent neighborhood. Damon had never been in trouble with the law before.
 
PARIS PERKINS, 15
Awaiting trial
 Paris went to a party in Bedford-Stuyvesant and ended up spending the night in the apartment of Noel Cooper, 36, because it was too late to walk home to Bushwick, said Paris and his lawyer, Alan Stutman. Mr. Stutman said that Mr. Cooper was about to sexually molest Paris and, after a struggle, Paris took Mr. Cooper's .380-caliber revolver and shot him. The lawyer said Paris was acting in self defense.
Paris fled with the gun he used to kill Mr. Cooper on July 18, and also took another gun that belonged to his victim, he told the police. "I sold the guns," he said.
Paris was raised by a single mother on welfare, Theresa Perkins. He was the oldest of six children. Ms. Perkins said that her son was never the same after he was hit in the head with a baseball bat during a fight when he was about 11. Afterward, he became unruly and would often disrupt his classes.
When Paris was 14, he was sentenced to 12 months' probation for assaulting a student at Public School 369. He spent a few months at a non-secure detention center and was released in July 1992, and the school board provided him with a tutor who came to his home, Ms. Perkins said. Shortly before Mr. Perkins shot Mr. Cooper, Ms. Perkins said that she had asked a Family Court judge to send Paris to a school upstate to keep him out of trouble.
After his arrest for murder, Paris's teacher at the Spofford Juvenile Detention Center wrote: "He's a pleasant and bright person who has the potential to do anything he puts his mind to. Paris could get away with a lot because he's so likable."
 
GILBERTO UBIERA, 15
Pleaded guilty to murder; sentenced to five years to life
DAVID TEALDO, 15
Pleaded guilty to manslaughter; sentenced to three to nine years
 Gilberto was furious when his family's Rottweiler puppy was stolen from the backyard, but he said it was his buddy David who pushed him to kill the youth they believed was the thief.
On the hot summer morning of July 20, Gilberto was showering when David came by his house. David kept nagging him, saying, "This is your chance to do "Rev," their nickname for Henry Vargas, 15. Gilberto told the police he stalled, playing records and taking his time dressing.
But when David handed Gilberto a .25-caliber handgun, Gilberto said he told his friend, "Yo, I'm about to murder someone." He said David replied: "So what? He robbed something from your house."
They tracked Henry down that day to a street in Corona, Queens. David waved the youth over to them, Gilberto said.
"David whispered to me, 'Do it now or else I'll do it,' " Gilberto told the police the next day. "I gave in, pulled the gun out of my right jacket pocket and shot once at Rev."
The murder was a bloody exclamation point to two violent, wayward lives. Gilberto and David grew up on the same block in Corona. David lived with his mother and father, a handyman; Gilberto's mother and stepfather, Yani and Goupaul Ramtahal, owned a video store in the neighborhood.
Both youths began getting into trouble in high school. David's problems quickly intensified from chronic truancy in his freshman year at Bayside High School to three arrests for robbery and attempted robbery in early 1993. (After the murder, he was convicted of robbing a convenience store and sentenced to two to six years.)
His parents said they tried everything to keep him out of trouble. "I didn't want him to become another statistic," said his father, Luis Tealdo. They escorted him to school each morning, attended counseling, and gave him a new computer and a 1991 Suzuki.
Nothing worked, not even the threat of punishment. "I tried the nice way; I tried the hard way," his father said. "What else could I do?"
Gilberto was also a troublemaker. He skipped 55 classes at Flushing High School from September 1992 to November 1992, according to a school official who spoke on condition of anonymity. When he was in class, he was disruptive and argumentative.
In February 1993, he was arrested on robbery charges after he waved a box cutter at another student and tried to steal the student's book bag, the police and others familiar with the case said. Gilberto said the book bag had been stolen from him and that he was just trying to get it back.
 
JEFFREY WASHINGTON, 15
Pleaded guilty to murder; sentenced to 5 to 15 years
 On Aug. 8, Sixto Marte, 43, and his niece came down the stairs of a footbridge that crosses the exit ramp from the Third Avenue Bridge in East Harlem. Jeffrey approached them and asked for the girl's black mountain bike. When Mr. Marte refused, Jeffrey shot him and took it anyway.
"I asked him for the bike. He said no," Jeffrey said in a Manhattan courtroom in early March, when he pleaded guilty. He offered no more explanation for his action.
The shooting at East 129th Street and Lexington Avenue, across from where Jeffrey lived with his mother, Debra Washington, and his twin sister, Debrina.
Jeffrey and his sister grew up in Yonkers, where their father was a postal worker. But the father was killed when Jeffrey was 9, shot as he tried to rescue someone being robbed. His mother moved the family to Harlem.
Jeffrey dropped out of Richard Green Teachers High School in the ninth grade and spent the second half of the school year at home, his mother says, passing the day playing Nintendo and listening to rap. She says he planned to move to another school to study computers. He had no prior arrest record.

Jump Into Europe Leaves Delta With Some Aches

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Three years after Delta Air Lines stormed into the trans-Atlantic and European air market with the purchase of the European operations of the bankrupt Pan American World Airways, the Atlanta-based carrier says it may finally be heading toward success in Europe. At the same time, Delta acknowledges that it is struggling to compete profitably against cutthroat American rivals and heavily subsidized European airlines, both across the Atlantic and within Europe itself.
"Our financial improvement over the North Atlantic is really impressive," said Robert W. Coggin, Delta's senior vice president for marketing, "but it is not where we want it to be." 
 The airline, which had virtually no visibility in Europe before acquiring the Pan Am routes and repainting its planes, has battled to establish an identity in a market swarming with European and American airlines. The company has had particular difficulty recognizing that the ways of Atlanta, Georgia, are not necessarily the best ways for Frankfurt, Paris or Warsaw.
 
Varied Strategies
 Delta has advertised aggressively in Europe and made agreements with some European airlines to coordinate flights. Delta has also purchased $150 million worth of seats on Virgin Atlantic Airways to get a toehold at Heathrow Airport in London, the busiest in Europe. Delta has been shut out of Heathrow under aviation agreements between the United States and Britain, which let in American, Continental and United.
Still, in the last three years, Delta has lost nearly $1.3 billion over all; the company declines to detail the losses of its European operations. The airline recently announced that it would slash $2 billion a year from its operating expenses within the next three years and reduce its work force by 15,000 jobs, or about 20 percent.
Analysts suggest that much of Delta's loss stems from difficulties competing profitably on routes across the Atlantic and within Europe.
"Domestic operations are two-thirds of the business," said Helane Becker, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, referring to Delta. "But the international problem is the bigger problem." She estimated that 60 percent of Delta's losses could be attributed to the carrier's international routes.
Paul P. Karos, an analyst at CS First Boston, said, "I think they clearly have had the largest losses internationally of any American carrier in the last two years on the trans-Atlantic, worse than anyone, although there's no data on the European operations."
Delta recently said its traffic across the North Atlantic was up 13 percent in the first quarter of 1994, with operating revenues per available seat-mile -- a conventional industry measure -- up 9 percent. The airline also said its costs per seat-mile on those routes fell 3 percent. It did not say how much it was losing on routes to and within Europe.
"The airline has gone through a major strategic review of operations," Mr. Karos said. "It's going to result in a reduction of capacity, basically exiting unprofitable routes, basically trans-Atlantic routes."
Like all airlines, Delta has been hurt by the recession in Europe, particularly in Germany, where Delta has its European hub, in Frankfurt.
"The economy has been the single biggest negative factor in our European operations," Mr. Coggin said. "The German economy has been one of the poorest performers in Europe, and that's where we have an awful lot of our resources."
 
Making Some Mistakes
 Mr. Coggin, who oversees Delta's international efforts from the company's headquarters in Atlanta, said the push into Europe in 1991 was accompanied by a series of missteps.
"We tried to do all the advertising from here based on our knowledge of what a customer in Finland would like to book a seat on Delta," he said, citing one miscalculation. "And that didn't work."
So in 1993, the airline hired a British travel specialist, Michael Medlicott, to coordinate its marketing efforts across Europe. Since then, Delta has been promoting golf tournaments and other sporting and cultural events, and even sending out door-to-door mailings. But an advertising campaign aimed at European business travelers, using the American management expert Tom Peters, failed in part because Mr. Peters was not known to Europeans.
While Delta's visibility in Europe is slowly improving, Mr. Coggin said, the airline's European service has suffered from a lack of recognition in the United States.
"Delta has not been traditionally thought of as a big European carrier, as a big trans-Atlantic carrier," he said. "And we have had a devil of a time breaking through that. The mind-set of the people in New York just don't think of Delta.
"We were about two-thirds of the way through a major campaign in New York -- where Delta has more service to Europe than all services combined. And I received a letter from a frequent flier complimenting us on our service on a flight. Then he said he only wished Delta flew to Europe."
Delta also inherited small, but frustrating problems from Pan Am. Mr. Coggin said the lavatories in the Pan Am planes were plagued by "horrible odors," a problem that was baffling mechanics. They eventually found that the air filters had never been changed and had corroded. "The creature comforts of the airplanes were not what we expected," he said.
Mr. Coggin said the home office's own perception of Delta's quality tended to override the realities of the European market, creating more problems for the airlines.
"Pan Am dealt with so many consolidators," he said, referring to travel agents who buy large blocks of seats at discount. "We thought our product would be so superior we wouldn't have to deal with the consolidators and we would fill the back of the airplane with higher-rated traffic. That was naive on our part. The product we inherited just wasn't sufficient to attract the business traveler. It took a year to really come to grips with that situation."
Delta has fixed many of its problems, but one central problem, in the view of analysts, remains: the ferocity of trans-Atlantic competition, which is based on low prices that virtually preclude profits.
"Its biggest problem is on the North Atlantic routes, and that is the same as all other airlines flying between the United States and Europe," said Cees Haasnoot, an analyst at Kempen & Company in Amsterdam.
"The market conditions are very difficult," Mr. Haasnoot said. 'For example, KLM tried recently to increase its fares on the North American routes, but it had to abandon those fares after just a few weeks. There is tremendous overcapacity."
In the most recent price war, Continental announced one-way fares of $349 to some European destinations from Newark. "Some of the U.S. carriers are doing more damage to the pricing structure over the North Atlantic than any of the European carriers," Mr. Coggin said. "This is below levels we've seen for the peak summer period. The fare structure is basically contaminated."
Delta has trimmed the number of weekly flights to Europe from 293 to 257, a reduction it cushions by offering 21 code-sharing flights. Delta can book passengers on those flights, but they are operated by another airline like Swissair, Sabena, Austrian Airlines, Malev and Virgin Atlantic.
Mr. Coggin said he anticipated a significant improvement in business this year, particularly in the peak summer months, with flights more than 80 percent full. "Our bookings for May are up 27 percent, June, 39 percent, and July, 44 percent, than at this point last year," he said.

In Fur Coats for Fall, a Lighter Touch

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS 

 BODY:
As the fall fur shows began yesterday in New York, furriers were smiling. After being pummeled by a worldwide recession and by the protests of animal-rights advocates for a number of years, they are now breathing easier. Fur sales improved last year, up 20 to 30 percent at some SC.3houses over the previous year.
Arnold Scaasi opened the week of shows with a well-planned, luxurious collection for Mohl, his fifth for that house. And Kaitery-Global Fur decided to have a show for the first time "because we're coming off a good season, our best ever," said Jimmy Kaitery, vice president of the company, which was started by his father 45 years ago. 
 Demonstrations sponsored by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group whose headquarters are in Washington, took place behind police barricades at the two Seventh Avenue buildings where the shows were held. Six demonstrators cried out, "Shame!" to fur workers carrying skins into the building. The workers yelled back, "Are your shoes rubber?" Three of the six at the first building were wearing sneakers. Four more protesters turned up before the second show.
"Our main target is Karl Lagerfeld," said Peter Wood, a spokesman for the protesters. "We hope he will join Calvin Klein and Anne Klein by getting out of the fur business."
Mr. Lagerfeld's furs for Fendi in Rome are considered the best in the world. His furs for Maximilian will be shown today.
Mink is expected to account for as much as 80 percent of the sales at some houses, but furriers are buoyed by interest in more expensive furs, like sable. Most collections include a sable coat or two. Typically, a top quality mink coat sells for $14,000, a sable one for $65,000.
The mink category is buoyed by the use of sheared mink, often in colors like spruce green or sapphire. And most furriers include cloth coats with lavish fur trimmings and also reversibles -- silk on one side, fur on the other -- in their collections.
The two main lengths for coats remain just above the knees and near the ankles. One manufacturer has high hopes for 42-inch-long coats that just about cover the knees.
At Mr. Scaasi's show, white rabbit coats decorated with motifs inspired by Alexander Calder shared the runway with the opulence of sable coats. Like most of the shows this season, it was held in the fur company's showroom. Lavish hotel presentations are rare, though Dennis Basso plans one later this week.
 
Little Restraint
 There are few signs of restraint in the fur designs themselves. "We used to treat fur as if it were fabric," Mr. Scaasi said. "This time I handled it as fur."
That meant luxurious collars that could be drawn cozily around the neck, skins worked horizontally as well as vertically in the same garment, ample rounded sleeves, and fluffy fur pompons instead of buttons, which the designer used as a motif.
Among his enthusiasms is tightly curled Persian lamb, which is particularly effective in a long, lightly fitted gray coat with a sweeping skirt, and in a double-breasted style cut like a man's chesterfield, in brown.
In addition to his opulent minks and sables, the designer offered some casual styles, like a nutria-lined black leather jacket and white rabbit coats striped in black and decorated with red and yellow circles. The rabbit styles are for women who already own a mink or two, the designer said.
Calvin Klein's place as designer for Alixandre Furs has been taken by Oscar de la Renta. Mr. de la Renta offers a varied assortment of wraps including shearlings, reversibles and elaborately fur-trimmed styles. There are some exotic details, including braid embroidery at the collar and cuffs and paisley printed silk on one side, fur on the other. A duffle coat with leather toggles in wild mink is one of his more casual styles.
 
Fluted Edges
 Like many other furriers, Alixandre avoided a formal fashion show, presenting its styles individually to store buyers. So did Jerry Sorbaya, whose lively styles include beaver coats decorated with parrots and leaves, carefully inlaid in the fur. Sheared mink is important in his trench coats and in fluttery coats with fluted edges. Mr. Sorbaya is an advocate of ruching, shirring, tiers and scalloped details to give a soft, feminine look to mink coats.
Similar effects are prominent in the Ben Kahn collection. "Everything has to look soft and feel light," said Edward Graf, whose grandfather founded the company around 1920. "It is a lot different from my grandfather's day."
The Kaitery-Global furs, which are produced in Montreal, include barrel-shaped jackets in sheared furs like beaver and muskrat that reverse to leather, and puffy clouds of Canadian lynx. Prices for this extensive collection range from $2,000 for the jackets to $20,000 for the lynx styles. Raccoon, fitch and, of course, mink were also widely represented.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
FEDERAL RESERVE RAISES KEY RATES TO CURB GROWTH

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised two short-term interest rates by half a percentage point today, the sharpest increase in more than five years, but signaled that further increases were unlikely to follow soon.
Abandoning the gradual pace of three previous increases this year, the nation's central bank sought today to brake the nation's economic expansion before it feeds inflation, and to protect the value of the dollar in international markets. 
 In a lengthy statement, the Federal Reserve said that today's actions -- raising two rates that affect what banks charge for short-term loans -- "substantially remove" the stimulus to the economy that low interest rates provided last year, and that top central bankers contend is no longer needed.
Today's decision delighted Wall Street, where investors sent stock and bond prices sharply upward on the assumption that short-term interest rates would stay steady into early summer. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 49.11 points, to 3,720.61, while the yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell to 7.26 percent, down from 7.44 percent on Monday. [Page D1.]
But the Federal Reserve move dismayed Congressional Democrats and some business groups, who warned that the move could stall the economy and increase unemployment.
President Clinton said this morning, before the Fed acted, that economic growth would continue despite higher interest rates. And Administration officials refused to criticize the Federal Reserve decision afterward.
"There is clearly some room for short-term interest rates over the rate of inflation that won't slow down our economic growth," the President told reporters.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reinforced that view after the Federal Reserve acted. "The Administration believes that the economy is on a path of sustained growth, strong employment creation and low inflation," she said. "Today's actions by the Federal Reserve do not alter our basic forecast for the economy."
Big commercial banks moved quickly today to translate the Federal Reserve's action into higher borrowing rates for consumers. The banks, led by Citibank, matched today's increases by pushing up their prime rates by half a percentage point, to 7.25 percent. Banks used to charge the prime rate to their best corporate customers, but now use it as a benchmark for setting the interest rates on credit card balances and other loans.
For the first time this year, the nation's central bank increased two important interest rates. It pushed up its target for the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, known as the Federal funds rate, to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent. And it raised the key discount rate, which the central bank charges when it makes overnight loans to banks, to 3.5 percent from 3 percent.
The Federal Reserve had already increased the Federal funds rate three times this year, on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18, by a quarter percentage point each time. The discount rate had remained unchanged at 3 percent for nearly two years until today.
 
Decision Termed Unwarranted
 Critics of the Federal Reserve said that today's decision was unwarranted. Martin Regalia, the chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said: "With virtually all current indexes showing little or no inflation, and with many indicators showing that economic growth was already slowing from its rapid pace at the end of last year, we are becoming increasingly concerned that Federal Reserve policy may be moving too fast and too far. We are concerned that monetary policy not choke off an economy that only recently has begun to generate income and job growth."
Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, said, "The Federal Reserve is once again putting the brakes on the nation's economic recovery and in doing so, hurting hard-working Americans."
But consumers could benefit from today's decision through cheaper rates on loans like fixed-rate mortgages, if the Federal Reserve succeeds in its ultimate goal of reducing long-term interest rates.
The Fed paradoxically pursues this end by raising shorter-term rates, hoping that this will cool the economy a notch, and thereby also cool investor expectations about inflation. If investors think that inflation will not be a problem because the economy is growing more slowly, they will be more willing to lend their money long term at lower interest rates.
High rates for short-term loans by banks hold down inflation by discouraging companies and individuals from borrowing money. Without this borrowing, fewer factories operate at full capacity and so do not encounter bottlenecks in labor and materials that force them to bid up prices.
 
Treasury Yields Tumble
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds did tumble today as investors apparently concluded that the Federal Reserve's moves would restrain inflation and prevent it from eroding the returns from long-term investments.
Recent Government figures on the economy have provided little if any evidence that inflation has already become a problem. Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of a percent in April, while producer prices fell a tenth of a percent, the Labor Department announced late last week.
But several different concerns have prompted the nation's central bank to push up interest rates steadily this spring despite the lack of evidence of current inflation, top Federal Reserve officials have said in interviews over the last month. The biggest concern has been to prevent the economy from overheating in the coming months, which could feed inflation next year.
The weakness of the dollar in recent weeks has heightened the concern of central bankers. When long-term interest rates rise as they have this spring and the dollar nonetheless weakens, then international investors are in effect signaling that inflation so worries them that they are unwilling to buy American bonds even when these bonds pay unusually high rates.
 
Shift by Administration
 The President's comments this morning were the latest sign that the Administration has shifted away from the aggressive pro-growth stance that it advocated a year ago. President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen have tempered and even reversed their former oratory that favored a lower dollar and low interest rates.
The Administration is now as concerned about excessive growth and higher inflation as it is about inadequate growth and higher unemployment, several top Administration officials said in interviews over the last two weeks. They are acutely aware that rising inflation forced the Fed to raise interest rates very sharply a year before the 1980 Presidential elections, a move often cited as having cost Jimmy Carter his Presidency.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, gave a guarded reaction when asked this afternoon whether the Federal Reserve's action would slow the economy. "We'll have to see," she said. "I think that we'll watch signs in the economy and try to maintain sustained growth -- so far all indications are that the predictions for growth are good."
The White House had strongly signaled the Federal Reserve in the last two weeks that it wanted the central bank to do two things regardless of how much the central bank chose to raise interest rates today. Administration officials urged Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to announce that no further increases would be made in interest rates for a while, and to explain his actions clearly, so as to reassure financial markets and prevent long-term interest rates from climbing higher.
Today's statement by the Federal Reserve appeared to address those concerns. The statement said that the higher short-term interest rates were "designed to maintain favorable trends in inflation" -- language that skirted the zero-inflation goal of the central bank's hard-liners. The statement also indicated that the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had reached its goal of a so-called neutral policy in which it supplies only enough money to the financial system to allow the economy to grow at a noninflationary rate.
"These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the F.O.M.C., substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993," the statement said.

HEADLINE: A TELEPHONE ROLE BY TIME WARNER

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
In the first plan of its type in the nation, Time Warner Inc. intends to use its cable-television system in Rochester next year to provide telephone service to residential and business customers in competition with the local phone company.
Such direct competition between cable and telephone companies has long been foreseen. But it has not yet occurred for ordinary customers because local utilities have resisted such head-to-head competition and because Government regulations have prevented it. 
 But yesterday, state regulators in New York opened the door to local phone competition, reaching a preliminary agreement with the Rochester Telephone Corporation. In exchange for giving Rochester Telephone greater freedom to retain profits it earns from greater efficiency, the company has offered a detailed program for letting rival companies connect with its network.
The ability of rival companies to connect with a traditional telephone network is crucial for competition to occur because this allows customers who subscribe to different services to communicate with each other as if they were using the same company.
The new agreement comes amid a broad effort by state and Federal regulators to spur competition in local phone service, a trend most experts say is likely to bring lower prices and new services. New York regulators are working on similar policy changes for the Nynex Corporation, parent of New York Telephone. Within Rochester, a number of companies -- including MCI Communications, Teleport Communications and MFS Communications -- have expressed interest in providing local phone services of one kind or another.
In Illinois, the Ameritech Corporation has developed a detailed proposal similar to that of Rochester Telephone. And Congress is considering legislation that would let telephone companies offer cable television programming if they opened their networks to new competitors.
 
P.S.C. Approval Required
 Yesterday's agreement, which was approved by top staff members of the New York State Public Service Commission, must be ratified by the commission's members. But that is considered almost certain because the New York commission has long been a strong advocate of increased competition in local telephone service.
Executives of Time Warner said the agreement set the stage for it to offer ordinary telephone service throughout Rochester by the end of 1995.
"This settlement is the basis for being able to make economic sense out of local phone competition," said Thomas J. Morrow, president of Time Warner Communications, the unit leading the company's entry into the telephone business. "The phone companies obviously make huge profits. We think we can lay claim to a fair share by offering better service, and more services."
Time Warner officials said their Rochester cable-television network had already been upgraded with fiber optic lines that reach into every neighborhood. As a result, they said, they only need to install switching equipment to offer two-way voice communications.
Over time, the company hopes to offer high-speed data communications to households. Cable-television companies may have an advantage because their lines reaching into homes have far more carrying capacity than the thin copper wires that deliver today's telephone service.
As envisioned, Time Warner or some other rival would assign telephone numbers the same way that telephone companies do now. Customers would use a regular phone, but dial out over a coaxial cable-television line. If they were calling someone served by Rochester Telephone, the call would be relayed to a switch owned by that company and forwarded.
Each company would then pay the other for each of the calls it had helped complete.
One key element in achieving yesterday's agreement was that the companies worked out a broad approach to pricing these interconnecting services, each agreeing that it would charge the other the same rate for completing calls. That, Mr. Morrow said, made it possible to profitably offer local phone service.
 
End of Monopolies?
 John K. Purcell, corporate vice president of Rochester Telephone, said his company could prosper under competition by being freed from restrictions that have limited its efficiency.
"Our theory is that the monopoly is dead," he said, "and that trying to fuss with it and prop it up is a waste of time. We believe it is time to get on with another model for doing things."
Under the settlement, Rochester Telephone essentially agreed to freeze its prices for basic service for the next seven years, and to drop a small surcharge for touch-tone telephones. In return, the regulators agreed to adopt a much more liberal system of price regulation. The company will now be able to retain any profits that come from new efficiency.
At the moment, New York regulates telephone companies under a "rate of return" method. That allows Rochester Telephone to earn an 11 percent profit over its cost of doing business, but it also creates incentives for a company to add to its costs. The new approach would use "price caps," meaning that the company could not raise prices, but could hold onto profits from cutting costs.
Industry experts argue that telephone companies have enormous room for cutting costs as the result of advances in networking technology. While many states have adopted price-limit regulations, most systems require a telephone company to give back profits that exceed a particular level. The New York plan would have no restrictions.
The agreement would also give Rochester Telephone much greater freedom to acquire businesses outside its operating region.
The company has been buying small telephone and cellular companies for several years now, but the process has been slowed by the need to get regulatory approval for each transaction. Now, Rochester Telephone can create a holding company and put all its outside businesses in a subsidiary separate from the local phone company.
 
What Competition Might Yield
 In addition, Rochester Telephone would divide its core business into two subsidiaries, one for the regulated telephone business and one for a new, unregulated company that would be free to package and market a full array of communications services, ranging from combinations of call waiting or call forwarding to complex private networks for companies.
Local phone companies would still be prohibited by Federal law from entering the cable-television business. But Congress is working on legislation that would remove that restriction in exchange for the kinds of market-opening moves that Rochester Telephone envisions.
Legislation is also under consideration that would relax restrictions on the regional Bell companies, preventing them from entering long-distance business and manufacturing equipment. But those restrictions do not apply to Rochester Telephone, which is not owned by any of the regional Bell companies and was not part of the break-up of the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in the early 1980's.

HEADLINE: 40 Years After Brown, Segregation Persists

SERIES: Still Separate -- A special report.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan.

 BODY:
Topeka Boulevard, a nine-mile-long stretch of commerce, fulfills most needs of the 120,000 people in this city on the plains. But the four-lane thoroughfare also serves an unintended purpose: dividing the races. Whites live to the west, blacks to the east.
Therein lies the problem for the city's public school system. The elementary schools, which were once deliberately segregated on school board orders, are segregated still, only now it results from housing patterns, not laws. 
 Those housing patterns have proved to be the implacable foe of school desegregation here and in some 1,200 school districts nationwide that are under Federal court desegregation orders. Such patterns have withstood busing programs that transported black children into predominantly white schools; they have withstood the creation of theme or "magnet" schools designed to lure white students from the suburbs to inner-city schools, and they have withstood the one-two punch of school consolidations and closings to achieve racial balance in the classrooms that remain.
Forty years have passed since the United States Supreme Court decided the landmark case, Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., that outlawed segregated education and marked this city as the cradle of the school desegregation movement. The board no longer designates which schools white students should attend and which are set aside for blacks. But 11 of Topeka's 26 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school are still as segregated as the neighborhoods that feed them.
Nationwide, nearly 70 percent of black students attend segregated schools, that is, schools with mostly black and Hispanic enrollments. In 1968, the first year in which educational data were collected, some 78 percent of black students and 54 percent of Hispanic students attended predominantly minority schools. The only difference the intervening years have made is that minorities are now more likely to attend segregated schools in the Northeast and the Midwest than in the South.
Other forces have also undermined the desegregation of schools: stubborn attitudes about race, and the rampant unemployment and underemployment that condemn many minorities to inner cities. Also blunting the effort, civil rights workers say, is the absence of a national will to embrace aggressive solutions like raising taxes or redistributing tax dollars to bring the budgets of poor districts up to those of rich ones.
"School desegregation was not supposed to be a cure-all," said Gary L. Orfield, director of the Harvard Project on School Desegregation. "There was supposed to be a housing act and job opportunities. Most of them have been beaten down. School desegregation is one of the last legs standing, although it is bruised and beaten."
But there are glimmers of hope, Mr. Orfield and other policy analysts said. Among them are these: Palm Beach County, Fla., which is encouraging homebuilders to racially mix their housing developments; Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C., which has harnessed the diversity and financial strength of its large, countywide school district in the development of magnet schools, and Dade County, Fla., which has opened schools at the integrated sites where people work, not in the segregated neighborhoods where they live.
 
Topeka
Striving Again For Elusive Goal
 In many ways, Topeka's experience is a microcosm of the history of desegregation nationally since 1954. Over the decades, the city became more integrated as employers offered good-paying jobs to black men and women, enabling them to enter the middle class and move their families into traditionally white neighborhoods. But whole neighborhoods were still inhabited by low-wage earners -- blacks and, increasingly, other minorities, too.
In 1979, the American Civil Liberties Union reopened the Brown suit, asserting that the existence of 13 racially segregated schools on either side of Topeka Boulevard violated the 1954 High Court ruling. Signing on to the suit was Linda Brown Thompson, who was 11 when her father and other black parents brought the first Brown suit.
After years of legal maneuvering, in 1993 a Federal court agreed with the A.C.L.U. Now the Topeka district is proposing to close some of the segregated schools, bus more of its 15,000 students across neighborhood lines and create magnet schools, all in the name of integration.
But while several polls have shown that people support desegregation efforts nationally, they tend to fight it locally. Topeka is no exception. The school superintendent, Jeffrey W. Weaver, says he has received anonymous letters and calls with racial slurs from whites and blacks opposing the proposed plan, which was unveiled earlier this school year. He says the attitude among parents whose children will likely be affected by closings and busing is, "Why me?"
This was not the vision of Oliver L. Brown, a minister, or the 12 other parents who went to court in 1951 in an effort to end the city's system of segregating elementary school students by race. They had long recognized that separate was not equal, that the all-black schools their children attended were educationally inferior to the all-white schools down the road. They reasoned then, as research has now shown, that if black children, especially those living in poverty, were sent to well-financed, solidly middle-class schools, they were more likely to adopt middle-class values and get a better education.
"It was unrealistic to expect that we could overcome all these entrenched problems, even in 40 years," said Ted Shaw, associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. "But it's not too late to turn this around. The question is whether the commitment is there."
 
Housing
Tackling Root Of Segregation
 The Civil Rights Act of 1968 gave members of minority groups the right to buy and sell property wherever they wanted. The notion was that creating integrated neighborhoods would lead to integrated schools.
More than 25 years later, the legislation has still not delivered on all its promises, in part because the Government has repeatedly subverted the plan. Even as Congress was approving the bill, the Department of Housing and Urban Development was building large public housing projects in inner cities, effectively concentrating huge numbers of minority families there. In the 1980's, the Reagan Administration's Justice Department allowed hundreds of complaints against biased real estate agents and landlords, filed under Federal fair-housing laws, to languish.
Battling against this history, the Palm Beach County district decided to attack school segregation at its roots. In 1991, the district unveiled an innovative program, which called on home builders to devise strong advertising campaigns for black newspapers and radio stations, with the aim of selling houses to a greater racial mix. Some of the county's 37 incorporated communities also altered their building codes, allowing builders to erect more modestly sized and priced homes in areas that previously restricted housing to large lots and structures.
In return for making these changes and attracting minority families, the school district rewarded builders by letting children living in the new developments attend neighborhood schools rather than be bused to achieve integration.
 
Progress in South Florida
 While 29 of the county's communities have signed agreements with the school district, which has 110,000 students across 2,500 square miles, success has been uneven. "In some communities, it has helped us," said Murray Harris, a district spokesman. "But over all, it has not helped us in the way we thought it would."
The percentage of minority residents in communities has increased, sometimes significantly. In Crestwood, it rose to 12.3 percent in 1994 from 3.1 percent in 1991; in Riverbridge, it increased to 11.5 percent this year from 2.3 percent in 1991. But housing prices in some communities remain too high for many black and Hispanic families.
Palm Beach County, however, is no longer alone in taking aim at segregated housing patterns. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will embark this summer on a $70-million model program, Moving to Opportunity, that will involve 6,200 families in New York City, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.
The program will assist families as they search for new housing in suburbs and other neighborhoods where they would ordinarily not look. The intent is to break up concentrations of poverty.
But the program may also be a boon to education, since studies indicate that concentrations of poor families with children place a heavy burden on the local schools that must serve their educational, medical and emotional needs.
 
Magnets
A Powerful Lure, But Mixed Results
 Build a curriculum around a special theme, like math or health. Lure the best teachers in those subjects to that school and invite students from all over the city to enroll in it.
The result is a type of public school, a magnet, that has been widely used to draw white students to predominantly black schools and black students to predominantly white ones. Such magnet schools are increasingly viewed as the most effective means to integration, because they give students and parents the freedom of choice. Still, they have a mixed record.
Kansas City, Mo., ringed by predominantly white suburbs, is struggling to make its magnets attract. By contrast, Montclair, N.J., has successfully used magnets to integrate its school-age population. New York City, the nation's largest school system and the home of the largest constellation of magnets, has also effectively used them as lures.
 
Success in Charlotte
 So has Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the nation's 29th largest school district, which has been desegregated largely as a result of magnet schools. But these were magnets established in a large and diverse countywide school district that sprawls over 527 square miles and serves 82,000 students. Twenty-seven of the North Carolina district's 115 schools have been turned into magnets since the program began in 1991 with 9 schools.
The percentage of blacks attending mostly black schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg fell to 29 percent this year from 31 percent in 1991. Without magnets, district officials say, the percentage would have risen to 34 percent this year.
Suburban white parents in the Charlotte area say they embraced magnets because of the strong coursework they offer, even though attending a magnet school can sometimes require a bus ride of 1 hour and 45 minutes.
"I am more concerned about the quality of their education than who they are sitting beside at school," Brenda Emmons, a white parent, said of her children's participation in the program.
Still, the introduction of magnets there has not been tension free. As white students enrolled this year in Marie G. Davis Middle School, an inner-city magnet program with a communications theme and advanced classes for high-achieving students, "there was some wariness among the parents," said Gwendolyn Johnson, who is black and whose 11-year-old son attends the school.
But black and white parents have worked closely with each other this year, and next year Mrs. Johnson will share the presidency of the Davis P.T.A. with a white parent, Deborah Holmes.
Charlotte, however, stands apart from much of the nation. Its enrollment mix of 60 percent whites and 40 percent minority members has remained essentially unchanged for two decades, primarily because people can move to urban, rural and suburban areas without ever leaving the school district.
 
Pessimism in Kansas City
 By contrast, the Kansas City district, which has labored under court-ordered desegregation since 1986, extends only as far as the city itself and its 37,000 students.
Kansas City has become increasingly black and Hispanic because of white flight to its suburbs and despite an expenditure of $1.2 billion -- half from the state, the rest from the city -- to improve curriculums and turn 58 of its 78 schools into magnets. A new Central High School was built at a cost of $32 million and old school buildings were upgraded, but the district's white enrollment has remained virtually unchanged at 24 percent.
The city's superintendent of schools, Walter L. Marks, who devised successful desegregation plans in Montclair and Raleigh, N.C., says Kansas City schools were so academically and structurally impoverished that it has taken more than $1 billion to right their course. Some $400 million was used simply to bring buildings up to code, Mr. Marks said.
"Progress is slow," he added, noting that the district's dropout rate tumbled to 39 percent this year from 52 percent in 1991 but remains far above the 11 percent national average.
Ultimately, the success of the Kansas City desegregation plan will depend upon the district's ability to persuade suburban parents like Brenda Gann of Lee's Summit, Mo., to transfer her two children from the Raymore-Peculiar School District south of the city into the city district. That will take quite a selling job. Raymore-Peculiar has a new high school and a rigorous curriculum, and the community offers a swim team for Mrs. Gann's 14-year-old daughter, Aubrey, who begins high school next fall.
"There's not much city schools can offer us," Mrs. Gann said. "We have everything we need out there."
 
Workplace Schools
Miami and Bases Point the Way
 On the edge of the Miami International Airport is an elementary school for students from kindergarten through second grade. It is also integrated without the compulsion of a court order. The secret: the 78 pupils are children of the airport's employees, who are white, black, Hispanic and Asian.
By locating schools in or near work sites, some school systems, like that of Miami-Dade County, are having an easier time of integration than those whose educational institutions remain anchored in neighborhoods.
The airport school and four others at workplaces were conceived seven years ago by Joseph A. Fernandez, who was then county Superintendent of Schools.
Financed by the Dade County public school system, the workplace schools were not designed to achieve racial integration but to encourage Miami's business community and parents to participate in the education of the young. As a side effect, though, all five institutions have produced a lustrous ethnic and racial tapestry of students.
 
Environment for Tolerance
 Nationwide, the 67 public schools operated on 16 military bases also have a rich student mix, thanks to both integrated workplaces and integrated neighborhoods.
At Fort Benning, Ga., an Army base with 23,592 residents, half of whom are families with children, Lieut. Col. Bruce Grant and his wife, Pat, both white, their three daughters and 3-year-old son live on Lumpkin Road, a street with 22 homes. Seven neighboring families are black; the rest are white.
This environment "teaches tolerance," Mrs. Grant said, "because we live next to one another, work with one another and go to school with another."
If the military is colorblind, so are some of the students in schools on bases, parents say. "When I talk to my children about their friends, I must admit the only way I know their color is when I see them," said Mrs. Grant, whose daughters attend Fort Benning schools. "I'm kind of proud of that."
Many others, parents as well as policy makers, remain hopeful that the task of school desegregation is coming to its slow but inevitable end.
"I'm not depressed because I've come from a long, long way," said Melba Pattillo Beals, who wrote the recently published "Warriors Don't Cry" (Pocket Books), her memoir as one of nine black students who desegregated Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957. "When you have fought your way up the stairs at Central High School, you know it can be worked out."

HEADLINE: Clinton's New Policy on Haiti Yields Little Progress So Far

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
President Clinton's new strategy to restore democracy to Haiti has thus far failed to weaken the ruling military junta, elicit help from other countries in resettling refugees or stem criticism by lawmakers, refugee groups and human rights leaders.
The policy initiative, unveiled by Mr. Clinton nine days ago, included the appointment of a new special envoy, William H. Gray 3d, and the announcement that refugee processing centers would be created on ships and in third countries. A few days before, the United States spearheaded a campaign in the Security Council to impose a near-total trade embargo on Haiti that is due to take effect on Saturday. 
 But the policy has been slow in getting under way, and critics of the Administration have charged that Mr. Clinton was responding to domestic political pressure in changing the Haiti policy and has no comprehensive plan to restore to power Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Administration officials stress that it will take some time for the tightened sanctions, which include a ban on noncommercial flights, to be fully carried out and effective.
"The U.N. sanctions that have been adopted are a strong expression of the international community's commitment to restoring democracy," Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser, said in a telephone interview. "Our envoy, Bill Gray, has hit the ground running. We're moving ahead on changes in our refugee policy as quickly as possible. The President said it would take some weeks. There are no surprises here."
Among the indicators of a less than a smooth start, however, is the fact that Mr. Gray, the new special envoy and the former head of the Congressional Black caucus, has yet to meet Father Aristide or even to talk to him on the telephone, although both men were in South Africa last week for the inauguration of Nelson Mandela.
Mr. Gray said that he first tried to call Father Aristide upon his return. "He was not in when I tried to call him," Mr. Gray said in a telephone interview today. "No one answered the phone over the weekend. It's nothing but a little telephone tag. We're close to having a meeting set up, hopefully by the end of this week. It will be a courtesy call."
Another problem has been the failure of the Clinton Administration to convince any other country to process potential Haitian refugees on their soil or to grant political asylum to more refugees.
President Clinton telephoned Prime Minister John Major of Britain on Monday to ask that the island group of Turks and Caicos, a British dependent territory, be used for processing refugees. Mr. Major replied politely that in principle he would like to help, but made no commitment, senior White House officials said.
Similarly, Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative at the United Nations, asked Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Ottawa last week whether Canada would be prepared to take more Haitian refugees. "We noted our interest in cooperating, but gave no commitment or immediate answer," a senior Canadian official said of the request.
There have also been problems in enforcing the economic isolation. Despite embarrassing violations of existing sanctions by the Dominican Republic, through which fuel is routinely smuggled across the border into Haiti, the United States has no intention of threatening its Government with economic sanctions or reducing its sugar quota to the United States.
 
Dominican Disdain
 Joaquin Balaguer, who was narrowly leading today in his bid for re-election as the Dominican President, has made no secret of his disdain for Father Aristide and has been criticized by the Clinton Administration for not cooperating with the sanctions against Haiti.
Defending the idea of not confronting the Dominican Republic, Mr. Gray said, "This is not the time to make threats against the Dominican Republic, but the time to work with them to solve some of their problems."
Although Mr. Clinton and his top aides have said publicly that the trade embargo is intended to send a message to Haiti's ruling junta that it must step aside, senior officials in the White House, State Department and Pentagon say in private that they doubt the strategy will work.
Far from quieting Congressional criticism of the Administration's policy, the new initiative has generated more calls for a military invasion of Haiti. Except for English-speaking Caribbean countries and Argentina, however, other governments in the hemisphere have expressed opposition to military action.
France and Canada also said last week they would not support or participate in an American-led invasion.
 
Speculation on Invasion
 But the difficulties with the Administration's policy have fueled speculation both inside and outside the Administration that the United States is moving inexorably to an invasion of Haiti to oust the junta by force.
"There is no hope for Haiti without an immediate military intervention," said Robert I. Rotberg, president of the World Peace Foundation and author of a book on Haitian history. "The policy is one of a big voice without a big stick. Teddy Roosevelt must be turning in his grave."
As for the delays in permitting some Haitian refugees to enter the United States, senior White House officials said that it will take "some weeks" before American immigration authorities can begin shipboard interviews of potential political refugees fleeing Haiti.
Word of the delay was conveyed by senior White House officials to more than 100 representatives of refugee and human rights organizations in a stormy meeting last Friday. Until the new policy is under way, the Coast Guard will continue to send back Haitians caught trying to flee by sea, as it did with 341 Haitians on Monday.
The Administration still has not decided how it will conduct shipboard interviews or whether it will allow Haitians to have legal counsel.
The head of the lobbying group TransAfrica, Randall Robinson, whose hunger strike helped push the Administration into changing its Haiti policy, said that he is organizing scores of lawyers to work on a voluntary basis to help insure that Haitians have private legal counsel.
 
Restrictions on Applications
 For the moment, the Administration will not change the way it allows Haitians to apply for refugee status inside Haiti. Under new restrictions put in place in February, Haitians cannot even gain an interview with an American immigration official until they fill out a written questionnaire and qualify under a specific category. These are the categories:
*Senior or mid-level officials in Father Aristide's ousted government;
*Close associates of Father Aristide;
*Journalists, educators and other political figures who have experienced significant and persistent harassment;
*Unspecified "others" in whom the United States has an interest and who are in immediate danger.
One problem with such restrictive procedures is that applying for asylum inside Haiti is potentially dangerous for the applicant. In Port-au-Prince, for example, the refugee processing center is housed in an open area of the Rex Theater, where applicants can be seen by passers-by.
Mr. Gray stressed that the new Administration policy needed time to work and that other changes might be made along the way.
The person who feels most strongly about not tampering any further with the refugee policy is Secretary of State Warren Christopher, senior Administration officials said.
It was he who argued -- unsuccessfully and without the support of other national security advisers -- in the weeks before the policy shift that the United States should do nothing to change its policy of forcibly repatriating Haitians fleeing by boat. He warned that it would trigger a new flood of refugees, many of whom might die at sea.

HEADLINE: CHINA MAY ALLOW U.S. BROADCASTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
China took another step today toward meeting President Clinton's human rights conditions, a sign of progress that the Administration quickly highlighted, apparently in an effort to prepare the public for a decision to renew Beijing's trade benefits with only a few symbolic conditions attached.
A senior Administration official briefing reporters in Jerusalem, where Secretary of State Warren Christopher is traveling, said that China had agreed to a visit by a team of American technicians to talk about halting its jamming of Voice of America radio broadcasts. 
 "Significant progress" by China toward ending jamming of foreign radio and television broadcasts was one of seven human rights demands President Clinton set a year ago as his condition for renewing China's most-favored-nation trade benefits, which allow the lowest tariff rates.
Of those seven demands, China had to make "significant progress" on five. They were to end the jamming, to account for political prisoners, to allow prisoners to be visited by the Red Cross, to ease the repression in Tibet and the pressure on Tibet and to take steps to begin adhering to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The two other Clinton demands were "mandatory," meaning China had to fulfill them entirely. They were to end the export of prison-made products to the United States and to allow the free emigration of certain dissidents who had been barred from leaving the country.
What is significant is that the senior official also told reporters that China has largely met these two "mandatory" conditions. He cited the recent agreement between China and the United States curbing prison labor exports and the recent easing of restrictions by Beijing on certain dissidents.
In disclosing this progress -- which many human rights groups dismiss as symbolic gestures at best -- the Administration appeared to be trying to lay some groundwork for what is widely expected to be a decision by the President to renew China's trade benefits by the June 3 deadline, with a few minor conditions.
Many top Administration officials seem to be coming to the conclusion that the public would easily accept a decision by the President to renew the trade status and to put this annual trade threat ritual behind him. They say that would be worth taking criticism from some editorial writers.
But Administration officials said that a decision still had to be made about the conditions that would be attached to that renewal, and that would depend in part on what the Chinese do in the next few days.
Some officials advocate that the President renew China's trade status across the board, but couple it with political and diplomatic initiatives that would underscore a continued American commitment to human rights.
For instance, 106 members of the House of Representatives, from both parties, wrote to President Clinton today asking him to renew China's trade status unconditionally and to create a bilateral commission with Beijing to address human rights issues, said Representative Jim McDermott, the Washington State Democrat who organized the effort.
Others in the State Department and among the liberal Democratic wing in Congress argue that the President should renew China's trade status with certain exceptions. They contend that it would be politically too embarrassing, and morally too dishonest, for the President to climb all the way down on his China policy.
They argue that President Clinton could renew most-favored-nation status for exports from China's privately owned factories. But, they add, he should withhold low tariff benefits from exports by China's state-owned factories or factories owned by the military.
The betting in Congress is that President Clinton's final decision will be a blend of these two approaches. That is, he will renew China's trade status and couple that with a call for the creation of a bilateral human rights commission, a voluntary code of conduct for American companies doing business in China and some symbolic economic sanctions to acknowledge the fact that China has not fulfilled all the Administration's human rights demands. But any symbolic sanctions are likely to be mild.
Anything else will be very complicated to enact and is vociferously opposed within the Administration by the Commerce Department, the Treasury Department, the United States Customs Service, the Council of Economic Advisers and the United States Trade Representative.
Members of the Administration's economic team argue that sanctions against state-owned industries would be impossible to enforce. For instance, a private Chinese shirtmaker may get all its silk or cotton at subsidized rates from state-owned factories, then manufacture that silk into shirts in its privately owned factory and export those shirts to the United States through a state-owned trading company.
Moreover, the United States has recently struck a deal with China that insures Beijing's cooperation with the Customs Service to identify which of its products are made with prison labor so that they will not be exported to the United States.

HEADLINE: Japan Debates Emperor's Visit to Pearl Harbor

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 17

 BODY:
Just when Japan thought it was patching over the damage done by a Cabinet member's insistence that the Rape of Nanking never happened, a new and even more politically charged argument has broken out inside the Government: when Emperor Akihito makes his first state visit to the United States next month, should he stop off at Pearl Harbor?
The Emperor's schedule, though not officially published, calls for him to visit Honolulu on the way back from a two-week tour across the United States. Until a few days ago, Japanese officials were whispering that the Emperor would visit the memorial at the battleship Arizona and express his sorrow over the war, which was begun under the reign of his father, Hirohito. 
 But in another display of Japan's unease about how to deal with the war, the Government is suddenly getting cold feet. Influential right-wing bureaucrats and some Japanese editorial writers are against the visit. Hanging onto power by a thread, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's Cabinet is clearly fearful of being blamed if the Emperor is perceived to be apologizing for an air attack that many Japanese still believe was a justifiable response to American economic sanctions.
"The pendulum is swinging," one Japanese official said, insisting on anonymity, "and there is a good possibility that Pearl Harbor will disappear from the schedule."
Although Akihito visited the Arizona as Crown Prince in 1960 and Emperor Hirohito visited Hawaii two decades ago, no Japanese Emperor has paid respects at Pearl Harbor.
The situation is particularly delicate because Japanese diplomats are still apologizing for the words of Shigeto Nagano, a former general who was forced to resign as Justice Minister after he said that the Japanese pillage of the Chinese city now known as Nanjing was a "fabrication" and that Japan was merely liberating Asia from its colonial masters. The remarks prompted outrage from Singapore to South Korea.
 
Similar Debate to China Trip
 In its broad outlines, the argument over the Emperor's schedule is a replay of the debate over Akihito's trip to China two years ago, the first time a Japanese emperor ever stepped on Chinese soil.
Influential right-wing politicians tried to scuttle that trip altogether, protesting that it would violate the apolitical role of the Japanese monarch in the postwar Constitution, and humiliate modern Japan by seeming to kowtow to China's leadership.
But Akihito, who became Emperor in 1989, was determined to set a different tone, and issued a fairly strongly worded statement of regret for the suffering Japan caused.
To many Japanese, however, Pearl Harbor is a very different issue. The widely accepted interpretation of the attack is the one written by Gen. Hideki Tojo, Japan's wartime Prime Minister, who said the embargo on oil and steel deliveries to Japan made it inevitable that the country would lash out. "For Japan, doing nothing would have meant the destruction of the nation," Tojo wrote.
The problem now, Japanese officials say, is that both recent imperial history and travel logistics make the Emperor's failure to show up at Pearl Harbor as big a political statement as his presence.

HEADLINE: Boys Are More Comfortable With Sex Than Girls Are, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
High school girls are less comfortable with their sexual experiences than are their male counterparts, according to a new nationwide survey of high school students.
In a random telephone survey of 503 teen-agers in grades 9 through 12 by Roper Starch Worldwide Inc., 36 percent said they had had sexual intercourse, and an additional 5 percent reported having engaged in sex other than vaginal intercourse. 
 But while 81 percent of the sexually active boys said "sex is a pleasurable experience," only 59 percent of the girls said they felt that way.
Only 46 percent of the sexually active girls said they "really feel good about their sexual experiences so far," as against 65 percent of the sexually active boys.
 
'Differences Are Fascinating'
 In addition, 62 percent of the sexually active girls said they "should have waited until they were older" before having sex, and 48 percent of the boys said that. And 71 percent of the girls said they were in love with their last sexual partner, while 45 percent of the boys said that.
"The gender differences are fascinating," said Dr. Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, vice president for research of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group concerned with reproductive health. "The question is whether it reflects what they're comfortable saying, or whether it's continuing evidence of the differences in how guys and girls feel about sex."
Although the percentage of sexually active teen-agers was lower in the new survey than in previous ones, experts cautioned against drawing any broad conclusions about teen-age sexuality.
"This was a telephone survey of 500 teens, in which there is naturally going to be some underreporting compared to a survey of 11,000 teen-agers using sealed envelopes," said Debra Haffner, executive director of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, a non-profit group that promotes sex education.
 
Under 15 the First Time
 The study, commissioned by "Rolonda," a syndicated television talk show, in association with Ms. Haffner's organization, was conducted last month and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The margin of error for subgroups would be higher: for the 208 sexually active teen-agers, for example, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus seven percentage points.
Among the sexually active teen-agers, the average age they reported for their first intercourse was just under 15 years. Most of the high school students who said they engaged in sexual intercourse reported doing so in family homes, with 41 percent saying sex generally took place in their parents' home, and 31 percent saying it was generally at their partner's. Nine percent said they usually had sex in a car.
Dr. Forrest said those findings were "not out of line with what other researchers have found."
 
Influence of Alcohol or Drugs
 Of the sexually active teen-agers, 59 percent reported that they always used birth control, and 11 percent said they "practically never" did.
Ten percent said they had had a sexual experience for which they had not given their consent, and 8 percent said they had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they first had sex.
Only 2 percent said they had had a sexual experience with someone of the same sex.
Asked their opinions about the right age to start having sexual intercourse, the high school students, on average, said 18 years old. The teen-agers who had already had sex said 17, but the virgins said 19.

HEADLINE: Work Starts On Theater In Times Sq.

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
After an overture that lasted more than a decade, the reclamation of 42d Street's neglected playhouses was officially declared under way yesterday with a ceremony at the Victory Theater, which is to reopen next year with performances and programs for children.
The 94-year-old Victory, a delicately ornamented two-balcony house, would be the first of the historic theaters along the street to be renovated. So there were celebratory speeches yesterday and billowing cascades of balloons. 
 But there have been many speeches since 1981, when the redevelopment of 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue was first announced. More important than rhetoric was the work permit from the Buildings Department that was brandished by Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d Street Inc., a nonprofit group overseeing the restoration and eventual operation of six theaters on 42d Street, including the Victory, that are now empty.
Equally important, Ms. Cahan said, was the fact that money for the $9.2 million rehabilitation of the Victory is "beginning to flow" from the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, which are providing a total of $18.2 million for theater restoration as part of a deal under which they would build four large office towers at the Times Square crossroads.
 
Wary Entertainment Industry
 It may be just a matter of weeks before sidewalk sheds appear and the Victory's marquee is removed -- the first palpable sign of reconstruction.
A skeptical public and a wary entertainment industry will be watching 42d Street closely in coming months to see whether there is truly the momentum necessary to rebuild the street after years of failed promises and false starts.
The Victory project is critical to that perception, as is the New Amsterdam Theater across the street, which the Walt Disney Company has agreed to lease and rebuild with the use of a low-interest loan from the government.
Disney, however, has said that it will not be committed to the New Amsterdam renovation until early next year, after it sees who the neighbors will be. It has welcomed the transformation of the Victory.
"The tangible evidence of the turnaround, of new construction taking place, is a good first step toward bringing back the entire street," said David L. Malmuth, vice president for corporate real estate at the Disney Development Company, in an interview yesterday. "It makes us that much more comfortable that 42d Street is going to be a great success."
From the street, the most obvious change at the Victory -- whose marquee boasted "Best Porn XXX in Town" a few years ago -- will be the re-creation of a grand double staircase on the exterior. The original was removed more than 70 years ago.
Inside, seating will be reduced to 500 from 936, allowing for the creation of public space at the back of the orchestra. Dressing rooms will be built in two small structures at the back of the Victory, facing 43d Street.
"We have the ability here to make old bones do new dances," said Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, architects of the restoration.
Programs in the 1995-96 season are to include presentations by the Night Kitchen, a national children's theater company founded by Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks; a puppetry series curated by the Jim Henson Foundation, and a film series curated by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.
"This is the first groundbreaking on 42d Street and there will be many, many more after this," said Vincent Tese, chairman, president and chief executive of the state Urban Development Corporation.
 
Slow Pace to Tower Talk
 John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said at the ceremony that there was some tenant interest in the office buildings that Prudential and Park Tower is to construct on land owned by the state along 42d Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
The office project was postponed two years ago in the face of a collapsed real-estate market. Since then, the developers have been negotiating with officials over an interim plan to bring stores, restaurants and other attractions to the sites where the towers would eventually rise, after the market recovers. Those talks have not always gone smoothly, and agreement has yet to be reached.
Acquisition by New York City of the western end of the block, which is still under private ownership and where pornography stores continue to thrive, was proposed in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. The $35 million needed to condemn the property was kept in the city's budget under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
City and state officials have independently pursued the restoration of nine historic theaters along 42d Street, including the six under the charge of the New 42d Street group, which was established in 1990.
"The public has long grown weary of unfulfilled plans," said Marian S. Heiskell, chairwoman of New 42d Street, shortly before she pulled a pink banner across the stage yesterday to rename the house the New Victory Theater.
"The New Victory is a high-stakes gamble where we have far more to gain than to lose," Mrs. Heiskell said.
While the New Amsterdam is certainly the grandest theater on 42d Street, the Victory is the oldest. It was built in 1900, before Times Square was even known as Times Square, by the impresario Oscar Hammerstein, grandfather of the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d.
Perhaps the most astonishing feature in the auditorium is a central dome, around the rim of which are perched eight pairs of plump putti, their legs dangling over the orchestra seats far below.
Originally called the Republic, the theater was designed by J. B. McElfatrick and opened with "Sag Harbor," which ran for 76 performances. A more celebrated tenant was "Abie's Irish Rose," which played 2,327 times in the 1920's. In 1931, the Republic became a burlesque house, which it remained until 1942, when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia banned burlesque.
Renamed the Victory in the middle of World War II, the theater showed second-run movies. In the 1970's, its fare turned X-rated. Under lease to the Durst Organization, a real-estate concern, the Victory was the home in 1990 of the play "Crowbar" and in 1991 of "Romeo and Juliet." It was taken over by the state in 1992.
The first performers in the New Victory yesterday were Audra Ann McDonald, who sang "America the Beautiful"; the Ghettoriginal Productions Dance Company, which hopped, bounced and twirled vibrantly, and the general contractor, Frank J. Sciame, who played his own composition, "Fanfare for the Common Jackhammer," on a jackhammer in the box at stage left as Mrs. Heiskell unfurled the banner.

HEADLINE: Crucial Freeway Link, Damaged in Quake, Reopens Early

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 17

 BODY:
A section of Interstate 5 in far-north Los Angeles reopened today, four months after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and not a moment too soon for tens of thousands of commuters and truck drivers who have suffered through lengthy delays and detours.
"This is going to put the area, Los Angeles specifically, back on the fast lane for recovery," Gov. Pete Wilson said in a ceremony this afternoon in which he removed small barricades on the southbound side of the freeway at Gavin Canyon. "California is showing the world that they can shake us, but there's no way that they can break us." 
 A two-mile-long northbound section of the Interstate remained closed tonight as detour barriers were still being cleared. Officials said they expected it to be opened on Wednesday.
 
An Economic Lifeline
 Interstate 5, called the Golden State Freeway, is California's commercial lifeline, running the length of the state. More than 13,000 trucks travel on it to Los Angeles every day, and itis also a major commuter route, with an estimated 100,000 cars daily.
The Interstate 5 bridges and ramps damaged in the quake were near the tremor's epicenter. Construction crews worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to repair them, and today's reopening was a month ahead of schedule.
The sole death on the city's freeways during the quake was that of Officer Clarence W. Dean, whose motorcycle careered off an elevated interchange two miles from Gavin Canyon.
The reopening of Interstate 5 leaves only two freeway sections still closed because of quake damage. State officials said that the linking ramps where Highway 14, the Antelope Valley Freeway, connects with Interstate 5 were scheduled to be repaired by late July and that reconstruction of the Route 118 Simi Valley overpass 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles was to be completed by September.
 
Bonuses for Contractors
 The contractor on Interstate 5, the E. L. Yeager Construction Company, earned $14.8 million for its work, as well as a $4.8 million bonus -- $150,000 a day -- for finishing the job a month early. The company that rebuilt the damaged section of Interstate 10 between downtown and Santa Monica, C. C. Myers Inc., earned more than $14 million in bonuses for completing that job on April 12, three months early. The Federal Government has provided most of the money.
In the first days and weeks after the earthquake, drivers leaving and entering Los Angeles on Interstate 5 had to take detours that added up to five hours to their trip. The lost time amounted to $250 a truck trip, according to the California Trucking Association, and the estimated average daily cost was more than $500,000.
But as the detours were streamlined and drivers adapted their routes, the delays were greatly reduced. The use of mass transit, which shot up in the first few weeks, dropped off quickly. Business at telecommuting centers north of Los Angeles also boomed and then declined.
"When the freeways were totally clobbered by the earthquake, there was a tremendous interest in staying off the roads," said Connie Worden-Roberts, director of the Santa Clarita Valley Telecenter, 25 miles north of downtown. "But as the roads were repaired, people started going back to them. It just takes a longer time to get the public firmly committed."
Trucking companies welcomed today's reopening of Interstate 5. "We will be profitable again," said Bob Milling, manager for Vecta Transportation Systems Inc.

TEACHERS UNION SUPPORTS OVERHAUL
For the first time, the powerful teachers union has thrown its support behind a plan to overhaul the community school boards, some of which have been plagued for years by corruption and patronage. The proposal would change the way the boards are elected and strip them of the authority to hire principals and other school administrators. B3.

The explosion of a gasoline tanker truck on a Long Island Expressway ramp in Queens on Sunday probably would not have happened had a ban on bigger trucks in the city still been in force, some truck safety experts said. B2.
 
OVERCOMMITMENT SEEN IN YOUTH SPENDING
Giuliani administration officials said that the Department of Youth Services had committed to spend up to $11 million more than is in its budget, with much of the overdraft coming from contracts that were improperly approved in the last months of the Dinkins administration. B3.
 
VOICES RISE FOR SAKE OF YOUTHS
The point, Webnesh Hylton made clear, is that the City Hall grown-ups looking to trim the budget by cutting back on Youth Services have their priorities wrong. "They may think that what's at stake is just after-school Ping-Pong, but that's wrong," said Mr. Hylton, a 20-year-old student at the New School for Social Research. "What's at stake is the destiny of youth and the destiny of the city." About New York, B3.

COURT BACKS ARBITRATION
The New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed a 17-year-old law that requires binding arbitration to settle contract impasses between local governments and their police and firefighter unions. But the court said that, in two cases, arbitrators had erred by awarding contracts based on countywide salaries rather than the pay scales in the individual towns. B5.
 
NEW JERSEY WARNS OF MERCURY IN LAKES
Deep in the heart of the Pine Barrens, surrounded by the protected forests of Wharton State Park, something unnerving is going on at Batsto Lake. Notices posted at the water's edge warn of elevated levels of mercury in the lake's pickerel, bass and yellow bullhead. B5.
 
APPARENT LAG IN TRACKING SLAIN GIRL
Connecticut officials apparently squandered several opportunities to track down a 10-year-old Bridgeport girl who had not attended school since last September and whose slashed body was found Saturday night, discarded near the squalid house she shared with her mother, three siblings and her mother's boyfriend.

HANDGUN BILL IS KILLED IN HARTFORD
The Connecticut House of Representatives killed a gun-control measure intended to restrict the secondary market in handguns by making all sales of pistols, even between individuals, subject to registration and waiting periods. B6.

HEADLINE: U.S. Clashes With Russia Over Bosnia

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, May 17

 BODY:
Beneath the show of unity on Bosnia and Herzegovina finally contrived last week by the United States, Russia and the European Union, a sharp diplomatic dispute flared between Washington and Moscow that underscored the fragility of international efforts to end the Bosnian war.
American officials said today that the dispute raised new questions about the effectiveness of diplomatic attempts to stop 25 months of fighting in the former Yuguslav republic. 
 The clash stemmed from Russian anger at what was seen by the Yeltsin Government as tacit American support for the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government's claims to 58 percent of the country's territory, the officials said.
After five days of United States-sponsored talks in Vienna, the Bosnian Government and its Croatian allies last week requested 58 percent of Bosnian territory, substantially more than the 51 percent offered under a plan officially endorsed by the United States, Russia and the European Union in Geneva last Friday.
 
Unease in Washington
 "The Russian view was that, because of our close involvement with the Muslim-Croat federation, they could not have demanded 58 percent of the territory without our backing," an American official said. "Because of the Russian concerns, a formal signing ceremony for the federation in Geneva last Saturday was downgraded to a mere reception."
The officials said that while the Clinton Administration's backing of the 51 percent figure was sincere, there was considerable unease in Washington at the notion of pressuring the Bosnian Government to abandon its 58 percent goal.
After more than two years of war, the Bosnian Serbs hold about 70 percent of the country. To satisfy the claims of the Muslim-Croat federation, they would have to give up almost one-third of this.
 
Involved as Peacekeepers
 Apart from American difficulties with the Russians, whose support for the Serbs is rooted in their shared Orthodox Christian heritage, marked strains persist with the Europeans over how best to stop the Bosnian war, the officials said.
The British and French, who are heavily involved in an expensive United Nations peackeeping operation in Bosnia, are anxious to stop the war by virtually any means, but the Clinton Administration still balks at the notion of the Muslims suffering too overt an injustice.
European impatience became clear today as France indicated that it intended to withdraw about 2,500 of its 6,800-member contingent in the region by the end of the year if diplomatic progress is not made.
 
Concern Over Muslim State
 France has the largest single contingent in the United Nations force and the high cost of its maintenance -- close to $3 billion since the Bosnian war began -- has become a highly sensitive matter in a country suffering from economic stagnation and soaring unemployment.
The differences between the United States and Europeans also center on the issue of the emergence of a Muslim-dominated state in Europe.
While this development is not viewed as a matter of strategic concern in Washington, it causes deep, if generally unspoken, unease in Europe, where the Algerian civil war and an influx of North African immigrants into recession-hit economies have heightened unease over Islamic militants and Muslims in general.
 
Fighting Continuing
 With these differences persisting, the Serbs and Muslims have as yet shown little readiness to comply with the call for a cease-fire followed by new peace negotiations made by the United States, Russia and the European Union last Friday.
Fighting continued today in the northern Tuzla region of Bosnia, where Government forces have started an offensive on several fronts and the Serbs have responded by shelling Tuzla and its airport.
United Nations military officials said Bosnian Government forces appeared to have secured some territorial gains to the east of Kladanj, where they are fighting to return to the town of Vlasenica, which was mainly Muslim before Serbian forces evicted or killed all the Muslim population in 1992.

HEADLINE: Killed by Her Friends, Sons of the Heartland

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young -- A periodic report.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa, May 13

 BODY:
In the middle of a silent country night last August, 17-year-old Michelle Jensen was shot to death. Her body was left along a dusty rural road, near a cornfield not far from the center of the city.
Three teen-age gang members murdered her, a jury ruled on Friday, for the keys to her Ford Escort. The killing by the youths, all from Davenport's blue-collar West End, rocked the eastern edge of the state, not only because of the cold-blooded brutality of the crime but because Iowa boys are supposed to join the Scouts, not gangs; they are supposed to be committing pranks, not murder. 
 Three other young men arrested in the case pleaded guilty to lesser charges and testified against the fellow gang members they had vowed to die for. But what seemed to shock people even more then the big-city style of the gang violence were the suspects themselves: six white sons of the heartland.
"People were amazed when they saw them on TV and found out all six of them were white," said Michelle's mother, Cheryl Jensen. "For some reason, that blew people's minds."
Seeing the suspects shuffle into the courtroom in handcuffs forced people here to question beliefs about race and crime and the boys down the block. When many people here used to talk of gang violence, they were referring to black and Hispanic youngsters in big city ghettos, not young people in Iowa cities like Davenport, which has fewer than 100,000 residents.
Dan Wulff, coordinator of a neighborhood youth program here, said, "I think the Jensen case made a dent in those stereotypes, but I'm afraid they're still alive and unwell."
Davenport, along with Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline, Ill., make up the Quad Cities, clustered on the banks of the Mississippi River. The police say there are 2,000 to 2,500 gang members of all races in the Quad Cities, which have a total population of about 200,000. Asian, black and Hispanic residents make up about 9 percent of that number.
About a third of the gang members are white, a percentage that some criminologist and sociologists say is high compared with the rest of the country. Nationally, experts say, more whites are turning to gangs for the same reason that black and Hispanic youngsters do: family, esteem and fast money.
Youth workers here say that before Michelle was killed, white gang members were ignored in a way that black and Hispanic gang members were not, even though some of the whites were conspicuous with multiple gang tattoos and clothing adorned with gang insignias. One worker said, for example, that white and black gang members would go shoplifting together, then split up by race, knowing that the shopkeeper would follow the blacks and not pay attention to the whites.
"I see white kids running around here with gang colors and flashing gang signs and nobody pays them that much attention," said Prof. James Houston, who teaches criminal justice at St. Ambrose University here and is an expert on street gangs. "But if you're black and you do it, then everybody's radar goes off."
 
The Background
Copycat Gangs, A Girl With a Car
 Michelle Jensen's body was discovered on Chapel Hill Road shortly before 2 A.M. on Aug. 29. Within hours, according to her sister, Veronica, 14, the police had rounded up six members of an all-white chapter of the Vice Lords street gang.
One of Chicago's oldest black street gangs, the Vice Lords have haunted that city for 30 years and spawned chapters or copycats around the Midwest. The authorities here said gang members from Chicago and St. Louis often come to Davenport on weekends to sell drugs, recruit members and escape the heat from the hometown police. Chicago is a three-hour drive from here.
Cpl. Henry Hawkins of the Davenport Police Department grew up in Chicago and never imagined that so much of the mean streets would follow him to Iowa. Now he spends a lot of his time talking to school and neighborhood groups about street gangs.
 
'The Saddest Part of All'
 One thing Corporal Hawkins tells the groups is that white and black teen-agers join street gangs for basically the same reasons. Some are lured by money, others by the rush that comes with a gang fight or trying to outrun the police. A lot of them do it for love. Being in a gang provides them with a sense of family they have not found anywhere else. "That's the saddest part of all," Corporal Hawkins says.
Lieut. Phil Yerington of the Police Department said: "A lot of these kids don't have much to cling to. I think these guys were closer as a gang than they were in their own homes."
Only one of the six involved in Michelle's killing lived with both birth parents, and he provided the gun for the killing. Fathers, for most of them, were only faded memories. All six had dropped out of school, although one earned a high school equivalency degree.
Michelle was not a member of the gang, but she was friendly with several members, and close enough to one, Jason Means, 17, that he accompanied Michelle and her family on a camping trip last July.
The night Michelle died, the Vice Lords wanted to borrow her 11-year-old Escort to use in the robbery of a convenience store, according to court testimony. They had high hopes for the stolen cash. They planned to start a drug ring, so they could jump into the major leagues of the gang world, the police said.
 
Only Blocks Apart
 The evening began with a party at the home of Anthony Hoeck, 18, a high school dropout and would-be gang leader. He lived with his father, Lavern, a former steel foundry worker who had been disabled, and his mother, Marsha.
Michelle lived a few blocks away. Her mother, Cheryl, works at a gift shop, and her father, Mark, is an electrician. A good student, Michelle loved drama and music and helped out at the Zion Lutheran Church preschool on Sundays. She also worked at a summer camp for disabled children, where she had met a new boyfriend, a college freshman her parents were crazy about.
"I said, 'Thank, God, finally, Michelle has met a decent boy,' " her mother recalled. "She was so happy."
Michelle and her mother had the usual conflicts, Mrs. Jensen said, and one particularly bitter battle, when she thought her daughter might be sniffing glue. But Mrs. Jensen said Michelle could not resist the bad-boy charms of the Vice Lords; they looked so cool with their tattoos and red gang bandanas. Michelle had dated a gang member who was in jail the night she was killed. She considered the Vice Lords her friends.
"They put up a good front when they were around us," Mrs. Jensen said. "We never realized they were a threat. Michelle never thought they would hurt her."
Before going to the party, Michelle cleaned up her family's house. Then she lied to her parents. She told them she was going baby sitting. She gave her sister $5 not to tell where she was really going.
"She had her troubles, but we got through them; at least I thought we did," Mrs. Jensen said. "She was on the right track. I could trust her again. I did everything in my power to protect my kids. I thought I had it under control."
 
The Night of the Killing
A Demand for Keys At a Party
 At the party, everyone was drinking gin and malt liquor, said Christopher Felgenhauer, 19, who pleaded guilty to robbery and kidnapping. Also at the party were the other two who pleaded guilty, Shawn Shewmake, 18, the leader of the gang, and Joe Hager, 20, who lived with the Hoecks.
Their plan was to rob a convenience store that night, and they needed a car. They chose Michelle's. But when Michelle refused to turn over her keys, Chris Felgenhauer testified, Tony Hoeck told him to hit her in the head with an electric fan to knock her out. When he hesitated, Chris said, Tony threatened to kill him if he did not carry out his order. Chris then hit Michelle once in the face, knocking her onto the bed but not unconscious. When he tried to take her keys, he said, Michelle got angrier and louder.
Hearing the noise, Mrs. Hoeck came upstairs and told her son to get Michelle out of the house because she was drunk, Joe Hager testified.
Chris testified that Michelle had complained to Mrs. Hoeck that he had struck her, but he said he had denied it.
Chris said Tony then gave Jason Means and Justin Voelkers, 19, another gang member, a sawed-off shotgun that he kept under his bed and called "Bud." The gun had been stolen and the barrel sawed off, a prosecutor said. Tony told Jason and Justin to take Michelle outside and to get her car, according to court testimony. The witnesses, including the three suspects who pleaded guilty, provided this account of the slaying:
The boys convinced Michelle that she was too drunk to drive and promised to take her home. They drove away with no destination in mind, turning down Chapel Hill Road. Justin had to urinate. He got out of the car with the shotgun. Michelle got out and walked down the road. Justin ran after her, hiding the gun behind his leg, and ordered her to sit down in the road. She refused. He gave her until the count of five. When she continued walking, he shot her. The blast tore away part of her head.
Justin, in a videotaped confession, never said why he pulled the trigger. He said he had been drunk and had been told "to take care of the bitch" because she knew too much. "I didn't look," he said. "All I saw was a big flame, a big flash."
Justin and Jason went back to the house and picked up the other boys and headed for the convenience store. But they decided against robbing it because it was too crowded. Instead they drove to a Hardee's for hamburgers before driving back out to Chapel Hill Road to prove to the other gang members that they had had the nerve to kill someone. The police were already there, so they went back to Davenport.
The police woke most of them up a few hours later.
Jason, who also gave a videtaped confession, was asked by a sheriff's deputy if it had been hard for him to eat after Michelle was shot. He replied: "No, not really. I was hungry. I wasn't even thinking about it."
 
A 'Wrong Place' Defense

Tony, Justin and Jason all pleaded not guilty. Tony's lawyer said his client, with an I.Q. of 77, was not smart enough to be the leader of the plot, as the prosecution contended. The lawyers for Justin and Jason said their confessions had been manipulated. Justin's lawyer said the killing had been an accident. Jason's lawyer said his client had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. The three did not testify.
The Scott County District Court convicted Justin of first-degree murder and Jason and Tony of second-degree murder. All three were convicted of kidnapping and robbery and under Iowa law will be sentenced to life in prison without parole. The sentencing is scheduled for May 31. There is no capital punishment in Iowa.
[Shawn Shewmake and Joe Hager were each sentenced on Tuesday to two 25-year terms to run consecutively. Chris Felgenhauer is expected to receive about the same term when he is sentenced on Thursday. They will have to serve at least a quarter of their sentences before being eligible for parole.]
 
The Personalities
2 Teen-Agers On Different Paths

Earlier in August, Michelle had been so excited about starting her senior year at Davenport Central High School that she had loaded her school locker with new notebooks and decorated the gray metal door with photographs of her new boyfriend.
She also had some photographs taken of herself. Her mother said she had never looked better. She had dark hair and an easy smile, though she still worried about her weight and chewed her nails constantly.
In the morgue, her mother said, the only way she was sure it was Michelle was by looking at her fingernails.
Justin Voelkers, who was 18 at the time he killed Michelle, had been in and out of trouble at school and with the police.
 
Farm Life Doesn't Mean Safety
 His background is not that of the stereotyped gang member. He grew up about 45 minutes from Davenport, just outside of Calamus, population 450, on a 250-acre farm owned by his stepgrandparents, Clara and Robert Wilhelm. There is a rope swing at the farm and a yardful of cats and dogs.
His mother, Dorinda Voelkers, commutes to Davenport to tend bar.
Justin was shifted from one school to another in Calamus and Davenport for students with behavioral or learning problems.
Niki Soto, who drives a school bus in Calamus and developed a close relationship with with Justin, said: "I'd have him into my house. I just wouldn't trust him. There's a difference."
She said Justin had a lightning-fast temper and a short attention span. "He's not a kid with a bad heart," she said. "I've had others that you could actually fear."
In his videotaped confession, Justin said the gang was after money and power when Michelle was killed.
"Money will get you power," he said. "Power and money are everything."
Justin said he did not feel too bad about the dead girl because he did not know her well.
"I ain't worried about going to jail," he said between sobs. "I'm worried about my mom. She might kill me."
 
The Gangs
Substitutes For a Family
 Street gangs began showing up in Davenport in the 1980's, about when the hard times hit. From 1980 to 1987, the Quad Cities area lost 17,000 jobs when large farm-implement and construction concerns trimmed their payrolls, according to the Quad City Development Group, which tries to attract business to the area.
The jobs had kept families and dreams together for decades, but in 1983 the unemployment rate for the area was 14.8 percent. It was fertile ground for gangs. Then, in 1987, crack came to town and the sound of gunfire in the night became more common.
The unemployment rate is down to 5.5 percent but Malcolm W. Klein, director of the Social Science Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who has been studying street gangs since the 1960's, said once gangs come to a town they are hard to get rid of. "There are almost no ex-gang cities," he said.
Today, the police say there are at least 23 street gangs in the Quad Cities. "We're a real melting pot," said Lieutenant Yerington of the Police Department. "We have black Asian Tigers and white Black Gangster Disciples." It has been that way here almost from the birth of the gangs, and in that respect, at least, Davenport is different, when so much of life in other places remains segregated.
 
'You Got to Be There With Us'
 "Black, white, Mexican, gook, it don't matter to us," said Hershey McFarland, 19, of the Imperial Gangsters, another largely white gang and the main rival of the Vice Lords. "What matters is, 'Is you down?' When we go out and mob somebody, you got to be out there with us, throwing blows, pulling the trigger."
Lieutenant Yerington said the average gang member in the Quad Cities is a "wannabe tough guy." For these gang members, bricks, bats and bottles are still the most common weapons. But about 500 teen-agers and adults are listed in the police files as hard-core gang members, the ones mostly involved in serious crime. The six Vice Lords arrested in the Jensen case were not considered to be hard-core gang members until Michelle was killed.
Elliott Currie, a criminologist and the author of "Confronting Crime" (Pantheon Books, 1986), said one reason white gang members are not studied more is that they blend into the American mainstream more easily than their black or brown counterparts.
"We don't see the white gang members as much but they're there," Mr. Currie said. "They're a rural phenomenon, a small-town phenomenon and an inner-city phenomenon. I think it's only going to grow."
Mr. Currie said white gang members, especially in Midwestern cities like Davenport, are the bitter fruit of years of corporate cutbacks. "The white kids and their families are going through what black kids in ghettos have gone through for generations," he said. "For black kids, it's worse."
Realff Ottesen is the first assistant Scott County Attorney and the head of the gang and drug unit in Davenport. White gang members take up most of his time these days.
A total of 2,829 people under 18 were arrested for murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in 1992, the last year for which the Federal Bureau of Investigation has records. More than 40 percent of them, 1,162, were white. The same year, 63,683 young people were arrested for aggravated assault; 56 percent of them, 35,865, were white.
 
Investigation and Trial
'A Lot I Didn't Know'
 An early break in Michelle's slaying came when the police learned that the last person she had been seen with was a skinny youngster called "Opie," because of his resemblance to the son of the sheriff on the old "Andy Griffith" television show. That was Jason, the only one of the six who is not tattooed.
His mother, Cheryl Means, is a 40-year-old single mother and a housekeeper at a nursing home. Five years ago, her oldest boy died of heart failure, at 16. Now her 16-year-old daughter is in a home for troubled children.
Mrs. Means said she had her put there "so she wouldn't end up dead on the street."
The weekend Michelle was killed, Jason was supposed to be driving with his mother to visit his sister, who lives 160 miles away. They were going to leave the day before Michelle was killed, but Jason left home that Tuesday, and Mrs. Means says she did not see him again until he was under arrest in the slaying. She said she had not been concerned about his absence because it was summertime and he was 17.
Mrs. Means said she had never seen any of his fellow gang members until a month before Michelle was killed. She saw one of the boys for the first time in the courtroom.
 
History of Truancy
 "There's a lot of things I have to admit that Jason did that I didn't know about," she said. "I didn't even know he knew Michelle. Later, I heard he went camping with her."
Mrs. Means says Jason's father left the family when his youngest boy was 5 years old and was not around when Jason, a shy boy, fell in love with baseball and football. But sports was not enough to keep the streets away.
Jason had been in trouble before for shoplifting, his mother said. Jason hated school and dropped out when he was 16, as soon as the system allowed it, his mother said.
"I tried a good two years to get help for Jason," she said. "I would call the truant officer on my own son. I did that four times. 'Hey, do your job,' I'd say. 'I want my son to grow up and be someone.' But when he turned 16, it was like nobody cared anymore. It was like everybody stopped trying."
In July, five weeks before he took Michelle to her death, Jason accompanied her and her family on a camping trip to celebrate her parents' 20th wedding anniversary. For six days, he tried his best to please, Mrs. Jensen said. He washed dishes, he gathered wood, he helped with the cooking. And he followed the Jensens everywhere, like a lost child.
"It was almost impossible for me and Mark to get a bike ride alone," Mrs. Jensen said. "I don't understand it. We treated him decent and he turned around and got involved in this."
The trial lasted a week and a half. The jury reached its verdicts in a few hours. Guilty, guilty, guilty, the foreman said, looking as sad as Tony Hoeck's father, who put his head down and began to sob.
Across the aisle, Michelle Jensen's father was also crying. "Let's go," he said to his wife. "No, wait," she said.
She wanted to watch as the deputies put each boy-turned-killer into leg irons and handcuffs and led them away.
"We're pleased with the verdict," Mr. Jensen said later, his eyes filled with hurt. "But we don't like to see these teen-agers waste their lives like this. We just hope other teen-agers will look at this and think twice."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Prices Drop Steeply With North Sea Oil Plentiful

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices took their steepest dive in seven weeks yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as a flood of North Sea crude met a slowdown in buying by United States refiners.
Light sweet crude oil for June delivery fell 47 cents, to $17.59 a barrel. It was crude's steepest one-day slide since March 28, when near-term deliveries fell $1.05. 
 Crude prices were due for a correction after rising from less than $14 a barrel in late March to Friday's high of $18.54 "with hardly taking a breath," said James Fiedler, a vice president of ED&F Man International Futures Inc. in New York.
He said the availability of North Sea crude had increased, but United States refiners have become reluctant to buy at such high prices.
Some Russian crude has also arrived in the Gulf of Mexico, an unusual event, said Ric Navy, vice president of Paribas Futures Inc.
He said refiners had trimmed operations because the rapid rise in crude prices had reduced their profit margins. Consequently, "people are worried we're going to start building crude stocks," he said.
But a weekly industry report released after trading ended contradicted expectations for a rise of one million to three million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute said United States crude oil stocks fell by three million barrels last week.
Although refinery activity declined slightly, the group said gasoline stocks rose by 870,000 barrels, contrary to expectations for a decline of up to three million. Supplies of petroleum distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose by 2.7 million barrels, as expected.
In other energy trading yesterday, June unleaded gasoline fell 0.70 cent, to 50.47 cents a gallon, while June heating oil tumbled 0.77 cent, to 47.04 cents a gallon.
On other commodity markets, platinum led precious metals after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to calm inflation fears. July platinum fell $6.10, to $399.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, June gold fell $1.70, to $382 an ounce. May silver sank 5.5 cents, to $5.508 an ounce.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
HOME DEPOT INC. (HD,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Home Depot Inc. said yesterday that its first-quarter net income surged nearly 31 percent, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, as expansion into the Midwest and Canada fueled a strong sales increase.
Based in Atlanta, Home Depot, the nation's largest home-improvement retailer, said net income in the quarter ended May 1 rose to $139.7 million, or 31 cents a share. Wall Street was expecting the company to earn 29 cents a share, based on the mean estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Results reflect a 3-for-2 stock split in July and a 4-for-3 split in April. 
 Revenue increased almost 32 percent from the corresponding period a year ago, to $2.87 billion.
Home Depot's chief financial officer, Ronald Brill, said that while the quarter exceeded expectations, he cautioned against raising annual estimates, for which the consensus is about $1.32 a share. He cited a dilution of a penny or two from an acquisition propelling the company into Canada and concerns about rising interest rates.
Sales rose 7 percent at stores open at least a year, even though last year's numbers received a boost from a construction boom in South Florida after Hurricane Andrew. Excluding the 10 South Florida stores, same-store sales rose 10 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. In 1993, Home Depot posted an average 7 percent gain in same-store sales.

HEADLINE: Housing Shows Vigor Even as Starts Slip 2.5%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Housing starts dropped 2.5 percent in April, led by declines in the South and West, the Commerce Department said today.
April's annual rate of 1.455 million starts followed a 12.3 percent jump in March, to 1.492 million, as builders in the Northeast and Midwest recovered from the harsh winter. 
 The results exceeded the expectations of economists in a survey. They had predicted that rising mortgage rates would send housing starts down 3.4 percent in April.
 
 
'Still Pretty Strong'
 "The housing market is still pretty strong," Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, said.
While rising mortgage rates are likely to slow things down later this year, "it's going to be a pretty good market at least for most of the summer," she said.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to 8.77 percent last week, the highest in two years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
"Housing is not as frenzied as it was, but you're still going to have more starts this year than last year," Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank, said.
Housing "is still going to be a contributor to the economy unless mortgage rates get a lot higher," Mr. McGee added.
Another analyst, Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, emphasized that the housing expansion was running out of steam.
"The end of the housing surge is now upon us," he said. "Housing has probably done its job for this expansion."
Economists, home builders and mortgage bankers expect rates to continue to rise, putting a damper on housing construction and home sales for the rest of the year.
Higher lumber prices were also driving up housing costs, Tommy Thompson, the president of the National Association of Home Builders, said. "This situation will not improve until harvests resume in the national forests of the Pacific Northwest," he added.
Mr. Thompson also said rising rates were probably responsible for the larger declines in the South and West, which were less affected by winter storms.
Starts fell 6.8 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 342,000, and declined 4.9 percent in the South, to a 608,000 pace.
In the Northeast, though, starts rose 3.6 percent, to a 143,000 rate, and in the Midwest, they advanced 4 percent, to 362,000.
Permits for new construction rose 4.4 percent in April to an annual rate of 1.371 million after rising 4.9 percent in March.
Single-family home starts fell 4.4 percent in April to a 1.205 million rate, while new construction of apartments and condominiums rose 7.8 percent, to a 250,000 pace.

HEADLINE: Eating Well: The Debate Over Milk and an Artificial Hormone;
More Milk, More Confusion: What Should the Label Say?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
PUBLIC apprehension about milk from cows treated with the artificial bovine growth hormone is not going away, despite the efforts of the hormone's manufacturer to allay the fear.
The conflict over the hormone, which the Federal Food and Drug Administration approved for use last November and which is meant to increase milk production, is reflected in torturous confusion over labeling of milk products. 
 Before it was approved for use, there had been warnings that using the drug -- known as recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) and recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) -- would result in a drop in sales of milk products because of public concern about the hormone's safety.
But there is no way to tell yet whether national sales have been affected. Lisa Watkins, a spokeswoman for the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, which is manufacturing the drug under the trade name of Posilac, said there was no change in milk sales in February, when the drug went on the market. But dozens of companies are advertising that their milk comes from cows that have not been injected with the hormone.
Use of the drug, which is genetically engineered, was approved over the objections of those who believe it has not been sufficiently tested on humans.
The critics include the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and scientists like Dr. Michael Hansen, a scientist at the Consumers Union, and Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago. They also include public interest groups, like Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet, an environmental and consumer group; Women's Health Network, an organization devoted to women's health issues, and the Pure Food Campaign, a project of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a group headed by Jeremy Rifkin, a critic of biotechnology.
In its decision to permit the use of the hormone, the F.D.A. acknowledged certain risks it described as "manageable." In the warning statement included with the drug, Monsanto says there are possible detrimental health effects on cows treated with the drug. They include reduced pregnancy rates and a greater risk of disorders involving reproductive and digestive organs. There is also an increased risk for mastitis, an inflammation of the udder.
At the center of the confusion is a statement issued in the Federal Register by the F.D.A. on Feb. 10, about voluntary labeling of dairy products from cows treated with the hormone.
Calling the suggested wording "interim guidance," meaning it has no force of law, the agency said that because all milk contains the natural hormone bST, it would be false and misleading to label any milk product as bST-free. But the term "rbST" could be used because rbST is the artificial hormone used in treated cows. Even labeling a milk product as rbST-free could be misleading, the agency said, because it implies that the "milk from untreated cows is safer or of higher quality than milk from treated cows."
To avoid such an implication, the F.D.A. suggested that a statement be added to the label to put the claim in proper context: "No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treated cows."
The agency has not recommended or required similar caveats for products whose labels say things like "no MSG," "no artificial color," "preservative free" or "organic."
The agency's statement has caused confusion among those who have pledged not to use the hormone in their herds and would like to put some kind of statement on their products to that effect. It has also confused state authorities who are uncertain how to regulate the labeling.
Monsanto has added to the confusion by warning companies through letters that labeling is false and misleading unless it complies with the F.D.A.'s suggested wording. Ms. Watkins said letters had been sent to at least six companies that have used advertisements, letters or labeling to indicate that their milk products contain no rbST. Monsanto neglected to mention that the F.D.A.'s statement on labeling does not have the force of law -- so that whether someone follows the suggested wording is of no consequence unless the statements are false and misleading.
Many of the parties believe that if there are regulations governing labeling, they should be in the hands of the F.D.A., not states, individual producers or retail markets. And some believe that products containing the artificial hormone should be labeled. An F.D.A. official acknowledged that instead of clearing the air, the interim guidelines have muddied the waters, and the agency is trying to figure out what to do next. Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of the F.D.A., said that the agency wanted "to make it clear that voluntary labeling is permitted, and it would be best to put it in context."
The F.D.A. has received thousands of comments about the labeling issue, but they have not been compiled yet.
Even within individual state governments, there is disagreement about how to proceed. The Attorney General of New York, G. Oliver Koppell, advocates full disclosure because, he said, "I do not believe that a sufficient time period has elapsed to make conclusary statements that rbST is harmless." But Richard T. McGuire, the state's Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, does not want products labeled because, he said, there is no difference between treated and untreated milk.
Ms. Watkins said Monsanto believes that voluntary labeling is all right. In March, the company sent a letter to Dr. Kessler, asking him to "take immediate steps to stop this false and misleading food labeling and to inform the public and the marketplace that F.D.A. intends to enforce its interim guidance." The company enclosed examples of advertisements, food labels and promotions that they believe to be misleading.
One example is a newspaper advertisement for the Elfco Food Co-op of East Lansing, Mich. "Concerned about the use of synthetic bovine growth hormone?" the advertisements asked. "Elfco offers milk, yogurt, cheeses and butter from farmers committed to dairy production without the use of rbGH."
Elfco's statement did not include the suggested caveat.
Monsanto has sued two companies that have made similar claims, saying they have made false and misleading statements.
In addition, several trade associations -- the International Dairy Foods Association, the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the National Food Processors Association -- have sued the state of Vermont over a law that starting in June will require all products made from the milk of cows injected with the artificial hormone to say so on the label. The Nutrasweet Company, which is owned by Monsanto, is a member of the first two trade associations.
"Everyone is terrified," said the owner of a wholesale dairy in the Northeast that was threatened with a lawsuit by Monsanto because of an advertisement the company had run in a newspaper. "It is quite ominous."
The owner asked not to be identified because, he said, he did not want any more trouble with Monsanto.
There are dozens of other companies that continue to label their products, including Farmland Dairies of Wallington, N.J. The company, which sells milk in the New York metropolitan area, has labeled its milk as follows: "Farmland Dairies Farmers have pledged in writing that they will not use rbST (recombinant bovine somatotropin) on their cows. When administered to dairy cows, rbST increases their milk production. Although the F.D.A. has approved the use of rbST and found no significant difference between milk derived from rbST-treated cows and those not treated, we want to know how you feel about this issue." The president of the company, Marc Goldman, said the company had received 800 letters and more than 1,000 telephone calls, all but two of which supported the decision not to use rbST.
And earlier this month, Land O' Lakes, a huge dairy cooperative in Minnesota, began selling a Superior Brand milk that is free of the hormone, in addition to its regular line of milk, which contains it.
Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet has compiled lists of other companies that are notifying customers about their artificial-hormone policy. The lists include supermarket chains and distributors that, according to Mothers and Others, have documents stating that they will carry some dairy products from cows that have not been treated with the synthetic bovine growth hormone. Products from brand-name companies on the list are all untreated. Regional lists are available from Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet, 40 West 20th Street, New York, 10011.

 BODY:

Cat in the Hat Is Back
It was more than a year ago and Audrey Geisel, the widow of Theodore Geisel, commonly known as Dr. Seuss, was going through the painful, painstaking task of sorting through old papers at home in La Jolla, Calif. Buried at the bottom of a drawer was an old typescript of a unpublished story in Dr. Seuss's distinctive style. She began to read. "It's hard to believe such a thing could be true/And I hope such a thing never happens to you," it said. "But it happened, they say, to poor Mayzie McGrew."
Narrated by the Cat in the Hat, the star of his own previous book, the new story, "Daisie-Head Mayzie," tells of a girl who unexpectedly finds a daisy sprouting from the top of her head. Ridiculed by her friends and pursued by bees, Mayzie (who is not related to the identically named bird in the 1940 "Horton Hatches the Egg") hires a press agent and capitalizes on her new-found acclaim, only to learn valuable lessons at the end. Mrs. Geisel said in an interview yesterday that her husband, who was 87 when he died, had mentioned the idea to her just once, many years earlier. 
 "To find something like that after I no longer had him was just wonderful for me," Mrs. Geisel said.
Mrs. Geisel took the book to Random House, her husband's publisher, which recently announced that it planned to publish "Daisy-Head Mayzie" in the winter. The story, 20 years old, was written as a screenplay for an animated feature but will be released as a regular Seuss-style narrative, with drawings based on black-and-white pencil sketches that Dr. Seuss included in the manuscript. The story is also to be made into an animated television special, to be shown on the TNT cable network.
Mrs. Geisel said that she particularly liked the character of the daisy, who doesn't say anything but who is depicted as quite emotional, expressing fear, disdain, arrogance, amusement and concern. "It feels everything that Mayzie feels, which is very hard to do when you just have a stem," she said.
As for Mrs. Geisel, who is 72 and was married to Dr. Seuss for 23 years, she said that unearthing "Daisy-Head Mayzie" was like "having him back in the only understandable way that one could."
"Very few people have that marvelous opportunity of revisitation," she said. "Had I a daisy on my own head, it would have been quivering with joy."
 
A Void at the Top
 The death over the weekend of Erwin A. Glikes, 56, the former publisher of the Free Press, stunned people in publishing, who had come to consider him one of the industry's biggest brand-name editors for a certain kind of book. He had just been settling into his new job at Penguin U.S.A.
Having made several best sellers out of serious nonfiction books, many of them politically conservative, Mr. Glikes had amassed a formidable list of loyal authors. Although many are contractually obligated to remain with the Free Press (which is now owned by Simon & Schuster), at least two authors with books scheduled for the fall -- George F. Will and Sen. John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri -- had editor's clauses allowing them to remain with Mr. Glikes.
As a result, the future of the two books has been thrown into confusion. John Ekizian, a spokesman for the Free Press, said that people there were still too shocked to focus on the issue. Peter Mayer, the chairman of Penguin U.S.A., said essentially the same thing. "I'm shaken still and we just haven't had time yet to raise business questions," he said in an interview.
In Washington, Steve Hilton, a spokesman for Senator Danforth, said that the Senator had not made up his mind where to publish his book, "Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas," a sympathetic look at Justice Thomas's confirmation battle by his chief sponsor in the Senate. And Mr. Will, whose book is to be a collection of essays entitled "The Leveling Wind," did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
 
The Choice of Norton
 For the fifth time in its 71-year history, W. W. Norton, an independent publisher that is owned entirely by its employees, has appointed a new president. He is W. Drake McFeely, the vice president, editor and associate director of the company's college department, and he is to take over the job from Donald S. Lamm.
Mr. Lamm, 62, who is to remain as publisher, said in a statement that the appointment of Mr. McFeely, who is 39, would help the company move into a new era. "Drake McFeely's appointment affirms Norton's resolute commitment to independent publishing, uncompromisingly free of control or interference from outside interests," said Mr. Lamm, who has helped the company rebuff takeover offers in recent years. "With Drake at the helm, a new generation of leaders is now in place."
Mr. McFeely, who joined the company in 1976 as a college representative, has been an editor since 1982, focusing on books about economics and physics.
 
An Auden Poem
 From "Shadowlands," the novelization of the film (which was based on a play based on a docudrama inspired by a real story), to "Like Water for Chocolate," the American translation of a Mexican novel that had been made into a successful film, books are being served very well by movies these days. This may well extend to poetry, too, says Vintage Books, an upscale trade paperback arm of Random House Inc., which reports unexpected consumer interest in W. H. Auden since the release of the movie "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Auden's anguished poem "Funeral Blues" is read to great effect in the movie's funeral scene.
As a result, Vintage plans to publish a $6 soft-cover volume that includes "Funeral Blues" and nine other Auden poems. The publisher will print 40,000 copies, to be distributed in special displays near bookstores' checkout counters.
Forty thousand is an enormous number; most poets, even the most distinguished, are lucky to sell several thousand. The 36-page book, "Tell Me the Truth About Love," is to be advertised in stores by a photograph of Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant, the winsome stars of "Four Weddings and a Funeral." An audio version will also be available, to be read by John Hannah, the actor who recites the poem in the movie.

HEADLINE: Forty Years and Still Struggling

 BODY:
Yesterday's celebration of the 40th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark school desegregation decision, was an occasion both for national pride and national shame. In 1954 the Supreme Court knocked over the bankrupt notion of separate but equal. Chief Justice Earl Warren, guiding the Court to unanimity with both moral fervor and political sense, liberated the nation from centuries of apartheid.
Forty years later, it seems the national consciousness has changed but the reality lags far behind. An unacceptable number of minority students still attend all-minority or nearly all-minority schools. Where statutorily sanctioned segregation once kept the races apart at school, now the trends of suburbanization, white flight, industrial decay and political ennui have combined to keep minority students in poorer districts, in schools with lower expectations for their students' achievement, in communities that are nurseries for failure. 
 The Supreme Court said in 1896 that separate seating on public transportation did not deny equality to anyone. It fatuously argued that if enforced segregation stamped one race as inferior, that was "solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it."
America could not begin to move forward before rejecting that bogus sociology. The Chief Justice held simply that separate facilities were "inherently unequal" in education, and later in transportation and other aspects of life.
That, however, only began a new chapter of the struggle that met widespread resistance in the South and more subtle non-compliance in the North. The goal of genuinely integrated schooling suffered a tragic setback in 1974 when the Supreme Court, in a case from Michigan, allowed the city line across which many whites had fled to set the boundaries of Detroit's efforts to desegregate its schools.
Still, the school decision slowly awakened America's conscience and energized Congress to topple segregation in other areas, most conspicuously in public accommodations, where anticipated resistance quickly melted away. While legal employment barriers also were hurdled, many minorities still see only a widening income gap in a shrinking economy.
Another conspicuously successful product of Brown, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, brought thousands of minorities to elective office. Indeed, President Clinton told the pupils of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Beltsville, Md., yesterday that his own election was due in large part to the support of empowered minorities.
The anniversary's blend of satisfaction and frustration would not have surprised Thurgood Marshall, strategist of the movement that won the Brown case. He and his colleagues in the NAACP Legal Defense Fund were under no illusions of immediate success.
The struggle continues. Lawsuits all around the country are now challenging the inherent inequities in the funding of school districts with local property taxes -- creating huge disparities in the resources available to children in city and suburban districts -- and in the district lines themselves, which allow residential segregation to be reflected in the schools.
In the decade between this year and the 50th anniversary of this revolutionary decision, Americans owe it to their children to find ways to live up to its promise. If they do not, the price will be high.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Prudent Course

 BODY:
The decision by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates surprised no one. The hike of one-half of one percentage point was twice as high as many economists believe is warranted. Yet in an uncertain economic environment, the Fed's decision is a defensible move to ward off future bouts of inflation and bring order to volatile currency and financial markets.
Some will criticize the Fed's move as an unnecessary blow to economic growth. Others will say it should have raised rates even higher. The squabbling reflects disagreement about the best way for the Fed to set monetary policy in order to achieve steady growth without igniting inflation. The Fed's effort since February to nudge interest rates higher one step at at time is within prudent guidelines. 
 The economy is moving along at a 3 or 4 percent annual clip. Growth puts upward pressure on interest rates as businesses borrow money to expand capacity. If the Fed were to keep interest rates low, it would have to pump more and more money into the economy to satisfy the demand for loans -- a misguided policy that would stimulate an economy that is already growing and thereby trigger higher inflation. But how high should the Fed set short-term rates? The arguments for steep hikes include steady growth, falling unemployment and factories operating near capacity. By the end of the year, unemployment is expected to drop well below 6 percent, a range that could ignite wage and price inflation. To keep that from happening, the Fed has to start now to rein in the money supply.
On the other hand, unemployment remains above 6 percent, retail sales are lagging and there is no current evidence that inflation is rising. The Fed has thus been forced to choose. Should it keep rates low, thereby risking rapid growth, rising inflation and a day of reckoning when it might be forced into a clampdown that could send the economy into a tailspin? Or should it lift rates, risking a slowdown in economic activity?
The Fed chose the latter course -- and the reaction in financial markets was favorable. Banks raised their prime rates, the basis for many consumer loans. But long-term rates in financial markets tumbled. Apparently traders decided that the Fed's decision proved inflation would not creep higher. They thus bid down long-term rates, which incorporate their expectation about future inflation. The Fed's three previous rate hikes did not turn the economy sour. Nor, judging from yesterday's market reaction, will the fourth.

HEADLINE: A City in the Enterprise Zone;
Trenton Wrestles With a New Old Way of Beating Urban Ills

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Amid the abandoned factories and urban blight of central Trenton, the Apex Lumber Yard stands out as a island of hustle and bustle.
"My parking lot is bursting at the seams," said Mark Goitein, the owner of Apex Lumber. "Sometimes it gets so busy we have to go out and start directing traffic." 
 What's the attraction? As a company in Trenton's state enterprise zone, one of 10 inner-city business tax havens that New Jersey established in the last decade, Apex Lumber is allowed to sell its goods with only a 3 percent sales tax. That's half the usual rate. In six years, the sales appeal of lower taxes has helped the lumber and hardware store double its revenues to $10 million a year, and double its work force as well, to 48 employees.
 
Inventive About Incentives
 Long dubbed the laboratories of democracy, the states have rarely pursued that function so thoroughly as in the mushrooming of enterprise zones around the country.
While Washington was paralyzed by ideological warfare between conservatives and liberals, 37 states and the District of Columbia, like so many mad scientists trying to breathe life into a corpse, offered widely varying concoctions of tax breaks and other incentives to encourage business to locate or expand in poor areas.
New Jersey's program, at an annual cost of about $15 million in reduced state sales tax receipts, is considered one of the best state efforts. New York is expanding its mix of tax credits, low interest loans and reduced utility rates to as many as 34 cities. Connecticut has extended its basket of tax abatements to 11 cities.
So far, experts say, the urban enterprise zones have become neither the boon their promoters dreamed nor the boondoggle their critics feared.
Trenton is a case in point. Thanks to its enterprise zone, the rundown city is the unlikely home of one of the largest Steinway piano dealers in the country. But the city may also be the only state capital in America that cannot support a movie theater or a top-quality hotel.
 
No Magic Bullet
 "Enterprise zones do not possess magical qualities which can overcome all physical, social and economic barriers to revitalization," Margaret G. Wilder of Cornell University and Barry M. Rubin of Indiana University concluded in a study of state programs to be published this year. Still, "despite their limitations, enterprise zones appear to have some capacity to stimulate new employment and investment in certain areas," they wrote.
Experience varies widely. If run energetically and tied to other programs -- as in Trenton, Syracuse and several other places -- the incentive programs have helped struggling cities save some businesses that might have failed and retain some jobs that probably would have migrated elsewhere.
By doing so, several declining cities have bolstered their tax base at a comparatively low cost. Enterprise zones, generally not as dependent on political connections as many other economic development projects, have also been relatively scandal free.
Despite serious setbacks in Camden, a severely troubled city, a study found that Trenton and other New Jersey cities with enterprise zones added a total of almost 10,000 new jobs in the latter half of the 1980's. Estimates of the cost to the state varied from about $5,600 a job to $13,000. Similarly troubled cities that did not establish zones lost twice as many jobs altogether.
 
'You Have to Be Realistic'
 But as an antipoverty program, enterprise zones have minimal results. They have not overcome the fundamental ailments of the urban slums or done much more than slow the flow of jobs and people out of the inner cities. And the state efforts have not enabled more than a relative handful of America's urban poor to find decent work.
"You have to be realistic," said Alan Mallach, director of Trenton's Department of Housing and Development. "Even the most effective urban economic development strategy imaginable would not do much to help those without jobs who are most in need of them. They are held back by poor education, substance abuse, and a tangle of other personal and social ills."
An archetypal Northeastern city, Trenton has watched its industrial base vanish during the last few decades. "The steel I-beam was invented here," said Thomas McGough, Trenton's enthusiastic and voluble enterprise zone coordinator. "We supplied the wire rope for the Brooklyn Bridge. But ask a Trentonian today and, by gosh, they don't even know it. It's tragic!"
Today Trenton, a city of 88,000, relies largely on jobs in government services and health care. It reached its employment peak of the last decade in 1989, when more than 25,000 people worked within its city limits.
Even then, according to Census figures, one in 10 of its residents was unemployed and nearly one in 5 lived in poverty. That compared with a statewide jobless rate of 5 percent and a poverty level of 7.6 percent. Despite having an enterprise zone since 1985 that covered most private workplaces in the city, joblessness was actually worse than a decade earlier and the state's overall economic improvement had barely dented Trenton's poverty rate.
 
The Downturn
 And 1989 was as good as it got. In the 1990's, the region's severe economic downturn and a cutback in state government employment have cost Trenton more than 4,000 jobs, pushed unemployment over 13 percent, and left even more people in poverty.
Despite their limitations, the appeal of enterprise zones remains strong. Today, more than 15 years after Representative Jack Kemp first proposed enterprise zones as a Republican answer to inner-city poverty, a Democratic White House is trying to turn the basic concept into an elaborate, Government-supported reality.
Under legislation approved last summer, the Clinton Administration is scheduled by the end of the year to designate six sizable "empowerment zones" within impoverished areas of major American cities. Applications are due next month; each winner will receive $100 million in grants and other Federal benefits. In contrast with most state programs, the Federal plan looks well beyond business. Local development agencies are supposed to offer a comprehensive package of community-based education, housing and anticrime services.
"The Federal program is modeled after the broader approach we pioneered here," said Liz J. Abzug, an official who ran New York State's economic development zone program and is now lobbying to win Federal designation for New York City.
 
The Candidates
 A part of New York City beginning as a broad swath of Harlem and extending into the South Bronx around Yankee Stadium, is all but certain to be one of those six. A zone called Philadelphia-Camden, encompassing rundown sections of those two cities, has an excellent shot at the designation reserved, at the impetus of Senator Bill Bradley, for an empowerment zone crossing state lines. But Newark, whose politicians and community leaders are working overtime to win it designation as an empowerment zone, is likely to be shut out because political considerations impel the Government to favor regional diversity.
In a kind of consolation prize, Washington also plans to grant $3 million for each "enterprise community" in another 65 smaller urban neighborhoods around the country.
Meanwhile, state enterprise zones are multiplying across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Connecticut, which began its enterprise zone program in the early 1980's, recently expanded its 11-city program to Stamford and widened the zone in New London. Among other benefits, the state provides property and corporate tax abatements to manufacturers, tax deferrals to other businesses, and tax savings to owners who improve rental housing.
New York, which began its program in 1987, is about to name as many as 15 new economic opportunity zones to join the 19 that now exist. The state offers tax credits, reduced utility rates and low interest loans to businesses that locate or expand within the zones. It also requires local administrators to work with social service organizations to provide job training, child care and transportation assistance.
New Jersey recently decided to make another 10 cities eligible for its program. Its most visible gains have come in Elizabeth -- where Ikea, a home furnishings store, heavily advertises the 3 percent tax savings -- and in Jersey City, which has lured lots of back-office jobs from Wall Street because of its convenient location and lower costs.
 
For Some, a Waste
 For all their popularity with local politicians, some critics say the zones remain largely a waste of resources that distract from more direct efforts to help the poor.
"State and local officials feel the need to do something about inner-city decline, and tax abatement is one of the few tools they have at hand," said Henry Coleman, director of the Center for Government Service at Rutgers University. "But if the only thing you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Instead, Mr. Coleman favors more specific antipoverty programs and help for inner-city schools.
To advocates, though, enterprise zones are more promising than anything else within reach.
"Most academics scoff at this stuff, but what other politically viable choices do we have?" asked Prof. Marilyn Marks Rubin of John Jay College in Manhattan. She is working on New York City's application for a Federal empowerment zone.
"Are they going to work?" Professor Rubin said. "I don't know. Is is worth a try? Absolutely."
Trenton provides fodder for both points of view. Its zone covers 30 percent of this city, and more than 50 businesses qualify for its special tax benefits. The 3 percent sales tax break is particularly attractive for small retailers.
"About 80 percent of our clientele comes from out of town," said Al Kotsch, owner of Chopin Piano and Organ, one of the three largest Steinway piano dealers in the country. Chopin sells 800 pianos a year, from a few thousand dollars to $100,000 each. "They come to the city because of the sales tax savings. For me, the enterprise zone is the difference between staying and leaving."
The zone helps in other ways. For the first time in years, Trenton has lured an industrial concern, Pennington Metals, to a new $2.3 million factory being built with Federal, state and city money. Because it is in the zone, all purchases of supplies and equipment are exempt from sales tax.
Outside the zone, Trenton has a thriving Italian restaurant district in Chambersburg, east of downtown. Mercer County built a new baseball stadium for the Trenton Thunder, an AA minor league team in the Detroit Tigers farm system that just moved from Canada. After years of neglect, the city started more than 500 units of new low-income housing under Mayor Douglas H. Palmer, who was re-elected last week to a second four-year term.
 
Decades of Decline
 But it is still all but impossible to overcome decades of decline. Trenton has no big supermarket. This state capital has no decent hotel or movie theater and only got a bookstore last year. The downtown business district shuts down by 6 P.M. A plan to redevelop the mostly-empty 40-acre Roebling Complex, which provided the suspension cables for the Brooklyn, George Washington and Golden Gate Bridges, has been stalled for eight years.
"Sometimes you have to wonder about all the sweat and effort it takes just to get a Laundromat built," said Mr. Mallach, Trenton's housing and development director. "And then you see how easy it is to put up an entire suburban shopping center."
"We're fighting 30 years of neglect of the cities," he said. "The private sector, left to its own devices, has basically written off urban America."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trims Early Losses After Rate Increase by Fed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, paring early losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year to head off the inflation that often accompanies economic growth.
Many traders bought dollars after the Fed pushed up short-term rates by half a percentage point, raising its discount rate to 3.5 percent and lifting the Federal funds rate to 4.25 percent. Higher interest rates usually make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. 
 "This may not be the beginning of a huge rally, but it should stop the rot in the dollar," said Keith Cheveralls, director of foreign-exchange at First National Bank of Boston. "It was a good move by the Fed. The markets liked it."
 
 
Earlier Concern
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6725 German marks, little changed from 1.6735 marks on Monday. It had fallen as low as 1.6619 marks before the Fed acted, amid concern that the central bank's rate increases would not meet expectations.
The dollar also ended at 104.68 Japanese yen, down a fraction from 104.80 yen.
The dollar failed to rise further after the rate increases because so many traders had already expected the Fed, at its policy meeting yesterday, to push up rates to quell investor concern about inflation and to shore up the American currency.
The dollar has fallen sharply against the mark and the yen so far this year.
Strong rallies in the stock and bond markets also helped the dollar yesterday after the Fed's move.
Stocks and bonds surged in part because the Fed suggested that it was finished raising interest rates for now. Yesterday's rate increases, and the three others before it, "substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993," the Fed said in a statement.
 
 
Confidence Cited
 David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company, said: "The fact that they indicated they're done raising rates for a while gave people the confidence to buy U.S. assets again. That really helped the dollar, too."
Currency traders have been waiting for the Fed to raise rates since May 4, when the Clinton Administration called on the Fed and 18 other central banks to buy dollars to stem its slide.
Still, some traders remained skeptical of the prospects for the dollar because of its failure to rally after this year's previous rate increases. Unless the Fed's actions succeeded in restoring confidence in American stocks and bonds, the dollar would suffer anew, they said.
"All the Fed did today was stabilize the dollar," said Earl Johnson, foreign-exchange adviser at the Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "Bonds and stocks have to keep rising after today to keep the dollar moving higher."

HEADLINE: CHINA SEES RISK TO ITS STABILITY IN U.S. DEMANDS

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 18

 BODY:
China's leaders have told the United States that they are willing to make further gestures on human rights to build more constructive relations. But they have asked for understanding on what they see as the need to clamp down on dissent and preserve "social stability."
The importance of President Clinton's decision whether to extend China's preferred trading status, a decision that is expected next week, has prompted an extensive high-level dialogue, including the dispatch of a secret envoy from the White House. 
 According to a senior State Department official, the envoy, Michael H. Armacost, a former Ambassador to Japan and Under Secretary of State, was recruited for the mission by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The official said Mr. Armacost, in his talks with Chinese leaders, had reviewed "in painstaking detail" the seven areas in which Washington insists that Beijing improve its record on rights. He made progress in several areas, the official said, and Washington expects other gestures soon.
In addition to Mr. Armacost, other American experts on China have had conversations with Chinese leaders. These experts and diplomats here say the Chinese expressed deep concern about social unrest rising from widespread unemployment, inflation and rampant corruption.
Because of these real and perceived threats to stability, China has clamped down on dissent, even as it has taken some steps to meet Washington's demands.
Thus China is pursuing these two goals at once:
*A stronger relationship with the United States, to protect $30 billion in export trade that is an engine of China's growth, and is desperately needed to satisfy the demands of a fast-growing population.
*The preservation of stability at all costs, even if that means confronting Washington over a rights policy that some Chinese say is aimed at undermining Communist rule.
Diplomats say these contradictory goals account for the mixed signals China has been sending.
Prime Minister Li Peng, in remarks this week, urged the White House not to listen to dissidents and rights advocates who say Beijing's mixed record over the past year warrants canceling or restricting China's trade privileges.
"Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes in their decisions if they base their understanding of China merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese, and ignore the interests and wishes of all other Chinese people," Mr. Li said to Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. Mr. Li's comments were reported by the New China News Agency.
Mr. Li voiced what has become a fundamental appeal from the Chinese leaders, as well as a warning: stable growth in China will contribute to world peace in the next century, and an unstable China could be a disaster for Asian security, the international economy and the environment.
"In the early period of establishing a socialist/market economic structure, it is of strategic importance to maintain social stability," Mr. Li told party officials this week.
 
'Excruciating Dilemma'
 Similar messages delivered to emissaries from Washington underscore the hard choices Beijing faces.
"China's leaders face an excruciating dilemma," said David M. Lampton, an American specialist on China who has just completed a week of discussions with party officials. "They cannot send a signal of accommodation to the United States without seemingly encouraging dissidents at home, and they cannot stifle dissent at home without further complicating relations with Washington."
Mr. Lampton is the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, a nonprofit foundation in New York that finances research and exchange programs with China.
On the one hand, China has released on medical parole the "black hands" behind the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989, Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, both of whom were serving 13-year sentences. The United States Ambassador, J. Stapleton Roy, has characterized their release as a "significant" gesture of progress on human rights.
 
Prisoners and More Prisoners
 But on the other hand, security forces continue to make arrests anywhere dissent breaks out.
There are still at least 3,000 political prisoners in China, and more are discovered by rights organizations every day. Indeed, Human Rights Watch, based in New York, released a list of 500 political prisoners today who it says are still being held from the 1989 uprising.
At the same time, economic reforms begun 15 years ago by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, are entering a new and decisive stage, pushing hundreds, perhaps thousands of state-owned factories into bankruptcy and forcing others to close. Millions of workers are being sent home, and there is no welfare safety net to rescue them.
"For the first time, the reforms are creating losers as well as winners," said Michel Oksenberg, a China expert traveling with Mr. Brzezinski. "The reform process is creating enemies as it never did before, and at the same time they are having to bring down the growth rate and deal with the problems of inflation," said Mr. Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center in Hawaii. "These are the reasons for their nervousness."
 
A Few Areas of Progress
 As the grievances of millions of workers merge with those of political reformers into a wave of protest and strikes, party leaders have gone into a defensive crouch. Still, they continue to make some concessions.
This week, China agreed to begin "technical" discussions with the United States on ending the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts; President Clinton had asked for progress on that issue.
The Foreign Ministry has also responded to an inquiry from Washington about Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known dissident, who was re-arrested in March. The ministry said Mr. Wei was under investigation but was not facing "treason" charges, as one news report said this week.
Still, whether China's leaders can control all the forces turned loose by 15 years of economic reform remains an open question.
"The authority of the regime continues to erode," Mr. Oksenberg said in an interview. "As that authority erodes, there are more opportunities for testing the limits of the regime's control."
Chinese officials insist they are making steady progress on human rights, but they have told United States diplomats that this progress should not be confused with a willingness to turn lose dissident forces, especially when those forces are a threat to Communist Party rule.
The Politburo's fear of being overturned cannot be underestimated. With Mr. Deng's health in serious decline -- he will turn 90 this year -- the next generation of leaders is aggressively guarding its rights of accession.
Since March, when China gave Secretary Christopher a bruising reception, senior leaders have reiterated that they are willing to confront any Administration whose rights policy seems aimed at undermining Beijing politically.
These officials see the State Department's embrace of Mr. Wei, who says the Communist leadership is irredeemably tainted by its past repression, as the beginning of a destabilization campaign.
Mr. Lampton, of the U.S.-China committee, said a meeting in Beijing on Feb. 27 between Mr. Wei and the State Department's top rights official, John Shattuck, "increased the level of suspicion and the Chinese elite's resolve to take a tough public line during Secretary Christopher's visit."

HEADLINE: SOUTHEAST ASIANS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WELFARE IN U.S.

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years after the end of the war in Southeast Asia brought thousands of Cambodians, Laotians and Vietnamese refugees to this country, many still languish in poverty, giving Southeast Asians the highest rate of welfare dependency of any racial or ethnic group.
More than 30 percent of all Southeast Asian households in the nation now depend on welfare for survival, according to a report on the economic diversity of Asian-Americans released Wednesday in Washington. Among some groups, like Cambodians and Laotians in California, the percentage of those on welfare reaches 77 percent. Nationwide, only 8 percent of households received public assistance in 1991. 
 Still, Southeast Asians account for a small fraction of the welfare budget. Of the one million here, about 300,000 receive public aid, making up about 2 percent of the total welfare population.
In addition to highlighting the poverty of Southeast Asians here, the report seeks to add depth to the nation's often two-dimensional picture of Asian-Americans, who are the fastest-growing segment of the population. Their numbers have risen from 1.4 million in 1960 to more than 7 million in 1990, or 3 percent of nation's total.
The report, based on variety of sources like the Census Bureau, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and state governments, was prepared by the Asian Pacific American Public Policy Institute, based in Los Angeles, and the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California in Los Angeles.
The success of Asian-American entrepreneurs and professionals has fostered an image of a "model minority" -- ostensibly more affluent, stable and highly educated.
Indeed, the report showed, the stereotype is true in many respects. Asian-Americans have the lowest divorce rate of any racial group (3 percent), the lowest rate of teen-age pregnancy (6 percent), the highest median family income ($35,900) and the lowest rate of unemployment (3.5 percent). The number of Asian-owned businesses skyrocketed by nearly 1,000 percent from 1972 to 1987.
But, the authors argued, those figures mask the group's economic problems. For example, many of the Asian-owned businesses suffer high turnover and low profits, and the per capita income of Asian-Americans, $10,500 in 1990, is lower than that of non-Hispanic whites, $12,000.
Paul M. Ong, a professor of architecture and urban planning at U.C.L.A. and co-author of the study, said the stereotype of the "model minority" and public ignorance of the diversity of Asian-Americans had prevented the group from being adequately considered in national policy debates on issues like poverty, economic development and health care.
 
'Complex Population'
 "It's been a problem in that people say, 'Asian-Americans, they don't have any problems,' " Dr. Ong said. "What we're trying to do is educate people so they know there is more to it than just median income. This is a very complex population."
The public policy institute that cosponsored the study is affiliated with Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics, a nonprofit organization created to expand the leadership roles of Asian-Americans.
Asian-America has become a world of striking contrasts, the report said. For every Asian-American family with an annual income of $75,000 or more, there was roughly another making less than $10,000 a year. While more than a third of all Asian-Americans have at least a college degree, another 23 percent of those older than 25 had less than a high school diploma. For every Asian-American scientist or engineer, there was another making minimum wage.
The bustling atmosphere of neighborhoods like Chinatown in Manhattan belie the harsh reality that many businesses in these areas pay low wages and provide no health care benefits. The unemployment rate in Chinatown was 6 percent in 1990, but a quarter of all families were nevertheless living below the poverty level.
Asian-American professionals have become significant members of fields like medicine and engineering. Yet they have also been frustrated by a "glass ceiling," an inability to advance into management positions because of discrimination or language and cultural barriers, the report said.
 
Few in Management
 A study of three major public hospitals in Los Angeles revealed that while Asian-Americans made up 34 percent of all doctors and nurses, they filled only 12 percent of management positions.
The institute says the "model minority" image also obscures the economic diversity within Asian-America. For example, 47 percent of Asian Indians hold professional or managerial jobs, while 22 percent of Korean-Americans do. (This compares with 24 percent for whites.)
The report found the severest economic difficulties among Southeast Asians, a finding that will not surprise social workers or advocacy groups.
Dr. Ong said the Southeast Asians' prolonged and pervasive reliance on government assistance provides a grim lesson in the failure of current welfare programs that stress cash over long-term job training.
"The country has not dealt very well with those on the margins," he said. "It's a tragedy and it affects us all."
The flow of refugees from Southeast Asia began in 1975 after the end of the Vietnam War. The influx was originally seen as temporary, but the flow continues today as new political upheavals and natural disasters draw more refugees to this country.
 
Trauma of War
 The first large group of refugees that came between 1975 and 1978 was almost entirely Vietnamese. Many had advanced educations and job skills and assimilated with relative ease.
But many of the refugees in later migrations came from rural areas with few skills to survive in the United States. In general, the study says, this group, which included Cambodians, ethnic Chinese from Vietnam and Laotians, spent longer periods detained in refugee camps in Thailand and elsewhere, further burdening their adjustment to America.
Their transition has been made all the more difficult by their war experiences, by the traumatic journey to America and by welfare programs that do not account for their special needs, the study said.
Today, three-quarters of all Southeast Asian adults on welfare in California have less than a high school education and limited proficiency in English. Forty percent of the nation's Southeast Asians live in California, and the welfare rate is substantially higher there than in other states, partly because of California's less restrictive treatment of two-parent households.
The lack of skills, low pay and lack of health benefits in the jobs available to them have kept the Southeast Asians trapped on welfare, the study says. Possibly more than a quarter of Southeast Asians will remain on public assistance after more than a decade in this country, Dr. Ong said.
He also noted that many welfare programs have been designed for people with different needs. For example, nearly 90 percent of Southeast Asian families on welfare have both parents present, making them ineligible for some programs that are meant to help the more traditional welfare population of single-parent families and families headed by teen-agers.
Changing welfare programs to place greater emphasis on job training would help Southeast Asians free themselves from public assistance, Dr. Ong said.
"This population is now so enmeshed within the public assistance system that their well-being is and will be determined by this system and future reform," the report says.

HEADLINE: A Thief Dines Out, Hoping Later to Eat In

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

 BODY:
Every now and then, Gangaram Mahes slips on his best donated clothes and lives the high life. He strolls to a nice restaurant, sips a fine aperitif, savors a $50 meal and finishes with hot black coffee. The waiters call him sir, but Mr. Mahes could not dig a dollar from his pocket for a bus ride to heaven.
He is a thief who never runs, a criminal who picks his teeth as the police close in. To be arrested, to go home to a cell at Rikers Island, is his plan when he unfolds his napkin. 
 Homeless off and on for several years, he steals dinner from the restaurants because he wants the courts to return him to a place in New York where he is guaranteed three meals a day and a clean bed. In a prison system filled with repeat offenders, the 36-year-old Mr. Mahes is a serial diner.
He has committed the same crime at least 31 times, according to his prison record, always pleads guilty and never urges his lawyer to bargain for a reduced sentence. In his eyes, he is just tunneling inside again, with a knife and fork.
"It's tough on the outside," said Mr. Mahes, who is serving 90 days for stealing a swordfish steak from a midtown Manhattan restaurant.
Prosecutors say it is not their job to consider whether locking some criminals up actually gives them what they want: refuge from poverty or hunger. But Legal Aid lawyers, while they have no statistics, said they had seen a small but growing number of people who commit petty crimes with the intent of going to prison. Mr. Mahes is unusual because of his method, and his persistence.
It is life in a cage, sometimes violent, often demeaning, but to Mr. Mahes it is better than drifting from shelter to shelter or living in cardboard boxes. There is order to prison, and you always dine on time, he said.
"I like to live decent," he said. "I like to be clean."
Christina Swarns, a young Legal Aid lawyer defending a man who does not want her help, faces Mr. Mahes through the wire screen of the holding pen at criminal court and does not know whether to laugh or cry.
"It's funny at first, 'The Serial Eater,' " she said. "But it's a very sad thing. How bad is it, his life, that he would prefer prison?"
On one hand is a man who goes to jail at will without hurting anyone, who steals only expensive New York restaurant food. Instead of throwing a rock through a window, he orders a T-bone.
On the other hand is a man who seems to have abandoned hope of ever having anything better, who prefers society's idea of punishment to his place in the society, said Ms. Swarns. In the past two years, he has seldom been free more than a few days before enjoying an illegal entree.
 
Not Too Cheap
 He has patronized the American Festival Cafe and the Taj Mahal in Manhattan, and Tony Roma's in two boroughs. He chooses restaurants that are not too cheap, not too expensive. If a restaurant is too pretentious, it might not seat him. If it is too cheap, he might not be arrested for stealing its food.
"If they really wanted to punish him," said Ms. Swarns, "they would stand outside Rikers and say, 'You go away.' "
Instead, Mr. Mahes does 90 days for stealing fish.
It costs taxpayers $162 a day to feed, clothe and house Mr. Mahes at Rikers Island. His 90-day sentence will cost them $14,580, to punish him for refusing to pay the $51.31 check. In five years he has cost them more than $250,000.
Louis Fasulo, a supervising lawyer at Legal Aid, said the real shame was that Mr. Mahes was returned to jail over and over before anyone questioned if it was the right thing.
"No one took the time," he said.
His lawyers have asked for alternative sentencing, including counseling, but prosecutors denied it. If Mr. Mahes wants to live in prison, the City of New York will let him.
Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney, said Mr. Mahes was returned to prison because he was a thief, with a long record of stealing.
"He does belong in jail," she said. "It's the same as if it were a string of shopliftings."
Ms. Thompson said Mr. Mahes was not snatching bread crusts to keep from starving.
"One of his meals cost $100," she said.
 
Nothing Left to Lose
 All around Mr. Mahes in the holding cages at criminal court are inmates who just want to go home. He is already there, said Ms. Swarns.
She said her client had no expectations, so there were no disappointments: he did not envy people who were free, because they were free to suffer.
Once an inmate accepts where he is, what he is, jail has its good times, Mr. Mahes said.
"Last night," he said, "we had beef stew."
Even in the open room he sits with his arms close to his body and his knees together: people who do time, who share space, sit that way. He tells his life story in a detached monotone, as if he were just some vague acquaintance he used to know.
Raised in poverty and fear as a child in Guyana, he left for the United States in 1976, when he was 18. His myth of New York shimmered in the distance.
"I thought it was going to be milk and honey," he said.
What he found was a country in a recession, with lines for gas, lines for work.
Looking for refuge again, he joined the Army. The Army took care of its own; clothed them, fed them. He would have stayed, but five years and one drug addiction later -- to hashish -- he was on the street.
He wandered to Florida and Virginia to pick collards and peaches in migrant camps where conditions were barely human. One camp fed its workers just once a day.
He went home to Guyana, and returned to the South Bronx with a wife, who left him. For years he drifted, homeless, drinking himself happy.
"I would drink to forget how the day passed," he said.
By the late 1980's, the one constant in his life was jail. He had done time for a string of misdemeanors. Jail took care of its own; clothed them, fed them.
Getting inside was easy. All he had to do was pretend to be part of the mainstream, the middle class. Then, when the waiter brought the check, he told the truth.
In that golden space of time between being shown to his table and the second the check arrives, he is as good as anybody.
He has the same rights, the same respect, the same choices between fried cheese sticks and French onion soup. He can ask for a table near the window, or send back a steak if the center is not pink enough.
He likes a glass of Johnnie Walker and the chicken and rib platter at Tony Roma's.
"No dessert," he said. "But they did offer."
He was fond of the buffet at an Indian restaurant in midtown, but it closed.
"The curried lamb," he said. He almost smiles.
 
He Knew What He Wanted
 On April 10, he visited the American Festival Cafe at Rockefeller Center. He ordered swordfish, lightly grilled, delicately seasoned.
"He had very good taste," said Paul Sharpe, the cafe's manager.
Mr. Sharpe said Mr. Mahes did nothing to attract attention at first. "He didn't order 50 lobsters to go," he said.
Instead, he acted like a man who knew what he wanted and expected to get it.
"I think he was drinking Chivas Regal," Mr. Sharpe said.
That was a Sunday. He had been released from prison on Thursday.
Court has become purely a formality for him. But in that, he is nothing special.
Arraignments in criminal court in New York are not personal things. An army of blank-faced men and women wait in the pews or in the holding pens for their cases to be called. Most plead guilty and wait for a blank-faced judge to rule on a negotiated sentence.
Over and over, he glided through without complication, accepting 10, 40, even 180 days. Most times they did not even bother to spell his name right. He is also known as Gram Mays, Gangaral Mahez, Gangaram Males and Reggie Mays.
He expected this time to be no different, that he would be assigned another charity lawyer who would glance at his file and cut a deal with thinly disguised indifference.
In walked Ms. Swarns, for the defense.
Fresh from law school at the University of Pennsylvania, a 25-year-old in her first job, she bothered to ask why he did it.
Christina Swarns would argue paint off a wall.
Members of her family on Staten Island have learned to agree with her. That, or leave the room and shut the door. Her voice carries.
"I love to argue," she said.
It was clear to her and to Mr. Fasulo that punishing Mr. Mahes by putting him in jail was like throwing Br'er Rabbit in the briar patch.
Mr. Mahes could commit more serious crimes and go to prison for years, but that is not who he is, said his lawyers. He does not want to hurt people or rob a bodega or hold up a taxi driver. He just wants to eat well and sleep in peace.
Mr. Fasulo fears that jail is becoming a warehouse for the poor. The courts dump them into Rikers because it is the easy thing to do, he said.
In winter, "they take batteries out of cars and stand there waiting, so they can be out of the cold," he said.
Before his arraignment in April, the prosecutor wanted Mr. Mahes to serve a year. Mr. Fasulo and Ms. Swarns argued for placement in a halfway house, where he would have food and counseling.
"We felt that, given his record, it was appropriate to ask for a year," said Ms. Thompson, the District Attorney's spokeswoman.
His lawyers knew that would just continue the cycle.
The judge offered 90 days in jail. Mr. Fasulo and Ms. Swarns did not want to take it, but behind them Mr. Mahes chanted, "Take the 90 days."
She said it was maddening to defend him. Every time she gives him her card and tells him to call, so she can help when he gets out, he throws it away. She cannot compete with prison. The food at Rikers is tasty, said Mr. Mahes. For supper, he had pork chops.
He said he was thinking of quitting this life someday. But when the bus came to take him back to Rikers, he was content. It was almost lunchtime.
"Fried chicken," he said.
He does not have a family to miss him. He does not have an old neighborhood where people know his name.
The bars at Rikers Island are there to hold him in, and to hold onto.

HEADLINE: House Leaders Are Criticizing Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to change the nation's welfare system hit another snag this week, when leaders of the House sharply criticized the Administration strategy for financing it.
In a closed meeting with top Administration officials on Tuesday, several House leaders also expressed regrets that events were forcing the White House to propose a bill this year, said several people who were at the discussions. 
 The Congressional leaders said they recognized that Mr. Clinton had publicly committed himself to going forward with a bill this year, but they stopped short of asking him to change his mind. They said they were worried that the contentious welfare debate could detract from the effort to pass a health care plan.
Nonetheless, Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, said the Administration planned to propose a bill in early June. He outlined possible cuts in other program as well as tax changes the Administration was considering to try to raise about $9.5 billion over five years. The people affected by the potential changes include veterans, farmers and affluent investors, all of whom are represented by powerful Washington lobbies that oppose the money being spent on welfare recipients.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said at the meeting that some of the ideas were not politically feasible He also warned that "we need every dollar for health care" and other pending legislation, people at the meeting said.
"The cupboard is bare," Mr. Rostenkowski said publicly after the meeting. "There are few ways of funding that are palatable."
While most of the meeting was devoted to the financing questions, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley reminded the Administration officials that he had warned them last year not to propose a welfare bill this session. He said it was unfortunate that Mr. Clinton had committed himself to doing that in the State of the Union Message.
Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, expressed a concern that the welfare debate would consume the time and political leadership needed for health care legislation, people in the meeting said.
The meeting underscores the tangle of financial and political problems President Clinton has encountered after making a prominent campaign pledge to overhaul the welfare system by expanding training opportunities for welfare recipients, while requiring those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
But Mr. Clinton is now facing a struggle to raise the necessary money and to demonstrate his sincerity to rivals inside and outside the Democratic Party. Citing Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it," House Republicans have accused Mr. Clinton of dragging his feet, and they are trying to take charge of the issue by forcing a vote on their own proposal.
House leaders warned Mr. Clinton last year that debate on welfare could slow his health care bill, since both proposals must travel through the same Congressional committees.
But when it was disclosed that Mr. Clinton was thinking of slowing down the welfare plan, the President was publicly rebuked by an ally, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The New York Democrat is chairman of the Finance Committee, which oversees both health care and welfare legislation.
 
Political Embarrassments
 Questioning the President's sincerity, Mr. Moynihan accused him of using welfare only to score campaign points, employing the issue as "boob bait for the bubbas." Mr. Moynihan said he might hold the health care plan hostage unless the White House sent up a welfare bill.
Several weeks later, in his State of the Union Message, Mr. Clinton said he would send a welfare bill to Congress this spring.
The search for welfare financing has produced a series of political embarrassments for the Administration, as one option after another was disclosed only to meet a wave of political opposition. Top officials have been forced publicly to disown options like taxing food stamps and taxing gambling receipts.
At Tuesday's meeting, Mr. Panetta outlined a number of items that remain on the list, including cuts in programs for veterans and farmers, cuts in the Superfund environmental cleanup program, and changes that would restrict disability payments for drug addicts and alcoholics.
Several people at the meeting said Mr. Panetta had all but ruled out the cuts in veterans' programs, which would have raised about $2 billion over five years. The House leaders warned Mr. Panetta and Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, that they would encounter fierce opposition to a plan that took money away from veterans and spent it on welfare recipients.
Mr. Rostenkowski sharply criticized another option that Mr. Panetta outlined, which would limit the amount of tax-deferred interest that could accumulate in annuities. The life insurance industry has been vigorously fighting the proposal, blanketing Washington with Mailgrams opposing the move.
Mr. Panetta said the Administration might attempt to obtain some money by lowering the interest rate paid to people who redeem savings bonds before they mature. But Mr. Bentsen told the legislators that he did not like that idea, and that it, too, seemed destined for a drawing-board death.
The House Republican proposal would require recipients to join a work program after two years but probably offer fewer exemptions and require longer fewer hours than the plan the White House is expected to propose. The Republicans would pay for their bill by cutting about $20 billion over five years in aid to legal immigrants. The Administration is proposing a much smaller set of cuts for those immigrants, raising only about $2 billion over the same time.
The Hispanic caucus and outside advocacy groups have vowed to oppose a welfare bill financed with deep cuts in programs for immigrants.
A Congressional aide who attended the meeting said the list of financing options was discouraging to both sides. "They didn't put this forward with trumpets of great pride, and it wasn't received with great enthusiasm," the person said.
Asked about the meeting, Barry Toiv, a spokesman for Mr. Panetta, declined to discuss the specific financing options. "Financing a package like this is never easy, but we're confident that we'll get it done," he said.

HEADLINE: Etienne Hirsch, 93, Backer of a Europe United Like the U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
Etienne Hirsch, a French administrator who was a leading advocate of a United States of Europe, died on Tuesday in Paris. He was 93 and lived in nearby Sevres.
The cause was a heart problem, his family said without releasing further details. 
 After World War II Mr. Hirsch directed a program to modernize the French economy. He served later as an administrator of the European Coal and Steel Community, created in 1951 to pool the production of six Western European countries, and the European Community, founded in 1957 to forge a common market. He was an assistant to Robert Schuman and to Jean Monnet, who were among the guiding forces of postwar European cooperation.
In 1959 Mr. Hirsch became the chairman of the European Atomic Energy Community but was removed after only 18 months in office by President de Gaulle, who felt Mr. Hirsch was putting the interests of Europe before those of France.
 
Attacked Nationalism
 On leaving office in 1961, Mr, Hirsch attacked the nationalistic spirit that he felt had scuttled his dreams of fusion. He argued that the executive branch of the European Community should be allowed to operate in "complete independence," without accepting instructions from any government. He said he had tried to uphold that ideal, but "I must tell you in all frankness that I had difficulties in doing so."
The steel, trade and nuclear institutions eventually merged into one entity, the European Union, which now has 12 member countries. In 1993 it eliminated its internal trade barriers, and its members seek to forge common positions on foreign policy.
Mr. Hirsch was a chemical engineer. Immediately after the fall of France to Hitler's Germany in 1940, he and his wife and four children fled to London, where he became an officer in the Free French forces. General de Gaulle put Mr. Hirsch in charge of supplying arms to the French Resistance forces on the Continent.
He is survived by his wife, Genevieve, two daughters, Francoise Roth and Helene Eisenmann, all of Sevres; and a son, Antoine, of Paris.

HEADLINE: For Whitman, Applause in the Early Acts

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 18

 BODY:
Take it or leave it, Christine Todd Whitman has been saying since she took office four months ago, pressing her unwavering drive for lower taxes and smaller, more efficient government.
And while legislators wilt and worry, while state workers fume about attacks on their pensions and pay and while Wall Street frets about some of the Governor's budget plans, the people of New Jersey seem to be loving every minute of it, and of her. 
 The hard-headed Governor widely known by the little-girl name of Christie is riding a crest of popularity in the state that was quantified in a recent poll and can be measured, more subjectively but just as significantly, in the diffidence that the opposition Democrats in the legislature display toward her.
The statewide poll, released Sunday by The Asbury Park Press, found that 78 percent of the respondents said Mrs. Whitman was doing a good or excellent job, and she scored nearly as high on questions about her financial responsibility, personal integrity and compassion. The poll of 628 people had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Mrs. Whitman won the election against Gov. Jim Florio by less than 1 percent of the vote.
 
Democrats Are Reticent
 Popularity like hers has not been reported in New Jersey polls since 1986, when Thomas H. Kean, then the Governor, was winning similar approval ratings at the start of his second term. New Jersey and Mr. Kean were riding the giddy crest of an economic boom at that time, while Mrs. Whitman presides over a far more somber mood, grumpy about taxes and suspicious of government.
But that is a mood that exactly fits her message and may help explain her popularity, said Steven Salmore, a professor of politics at Rutgers University and a Republican campaign consultant.
"She's pretty effective in getting out a pretty good message," Mr. Salmore said. "She talks about cutting taxes, she talks about cutting government, she talks about belt-tightening, and people react positively."
Mrs. Whitman's popularity, and the fact that polling has not turned up strong negative views about her, has stifled dissent among the Republican legislative majority and left the Democrats shaking their heads in rueful admiration.
"The Governor has very successfully assumed the role of governor in many important ways, and I give her credit for that," said Senator Bernard F. Kenny of Hoboken, a Democratic member of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. "It's not easy being governor and she has addressed the issues she's interested in very effectively. But in politics each day is a new chapter, and you never know what's around the corner, what minefield or what breaks you're going to get."
 
Remaking Government
 Democrats and Republicans agree that Mrs. Whitman is clearly bent on storing up as much public acclaim as she can during these early months of budget writing, against the day when the political weather changes. Since her inauguration on Jan. 18, the Governor has been on an ambitious round of speeches, in Washington, up and down New Jersey, and in New York, selling her state and her policies.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Whitman delivered two keynote addresses before noon, and two other smaller-scale speeches by mid-afternoon. A third keynote, before an international management conference, was delivered today.
In each speech, as in the radio and television call-in shows that have become her hallmark, Mrs. Whitman touches again and again on the themes of her young administration: law and order, lower taxes, efficient government, an investment and a regulatory climate friendly to business.
Nothing less than a revolution will do, the Governor told a management meeting with the heads of several transnational corporations in Princeton today.
"In order to reshape government's connection with business, we must begin to remake government itself," she declared.
 
Growing Budget Protests
 As it happened, Mrs. Whitman shared the dais today with Colin Powell, the retired head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff whose position as a national and international figure only underscored Mrs. Whitman's rising national profile.
The Governor's name is already in play among Republicans as a potential vice presidential candidate. Richard Nixon, in an interview that was not published until after his recent death, said as much: "Christie Whitman would be a real sleeper on the ticket," he said of the woman who, as a little girl in the 1950's, the daughter of the New Jersey Republican state chairman, sold lemonade to raise pennies for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket.
Governor Whitman's critics complain that her popularity is unearned, because she has not yet faced real tests in governing.
Her first budget, containing a second installment on the 30 percent income tax cut she has promised to deliver for three years, has not yet been enacted by the Republican-controlled legislature, and the narrow streets around the State House have echoed in recent days with the shouts of state workers, public college students, teachers and social services recipients demonstrating against the governor's hard-handed budget reductions to pay for her tax cuts.
Several other nettlesome problems also lie before her, including finding the money to pay for a huge deficit in a state-financed auto insurance pool and for an expected court order requiring a sharp increase in state aid to poor school districts.
Looming above all other challenges, however, is the growing protest against her budget plans from teachers and state employees. To close a $2 billion deficit and save enough money to cut income taxes by 10 percent next year, the Governor wants to end a 2-percent subsidy to these workers' pensions as well as end a practice of pre-paying some pension expenses.
 
Sparring With Teachers
 On Monday, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. plans to put thousands of workers on West State Street in front of the State House to howl down this plan. "Florio revalued the pension in '92 and stole $1.6 billion from us, and we're not going to let her tinker with our pensions any longer," said Bob Yackel, a firefighter who heads the public employees council of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We're going to put 5,000 people in the streets while the Senate is in session and we're going to let them know they won't get another bit of that apple."
Mrs. Whitman has also picked a fight with the state teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, whose muscle and money destroyed Democratic control of the State House following Governor Florio's tax increases and set the stage for Mrs. Whitman's victory over Mr. Florio last November.
The Governor all but applauded a widespread rejection of school budgets last month, saying voters must force local governments to control costs.
Governor Whitman has attacked lifelong teacher job security, a bedrock issue for the union, by calling for periodic teacher recertification. She has begun planning for a trial parental-choice voucher program for Jersey City that would send tax dollars to private schools, and she has suggested a two-tier pay scale, separating the best teachers from the rest, perhaps as a way of underlining her belief that some schools suffer from "burned-out" teachers.
On Friday, the leadership council of the education association will decide whether to approve a plan, advanced by the union's executives, to raise a $10 million war chest over the next two years by assessing each member $50 per year. The fund would be used to fight "anti-public education disinformation," the union said.
The Governor has two words for recipients of tax dollars who complain about her policies: "special interests."
"If I eliminate the Governor's Study Commission on the Transmission of Blood by Transylvanian Vampires," she joked at a February speech, "someone will accuse me of cutting funds for health care."
Mrs. Whitman's success in painting public workers as tax spenders has hardened the unions against her, but it has also brought the public closer to her view, as reflected in polling attitudes towards union demands, making the unions' task all the harder, and perhaps stifling dissent even among Republicans for her program.
"Everyone is taking note of how passive the Legislature is in all this," Senator Kenny remarked. "If there is one criticism of the style of the administration that explains why people back off, it's that they characterize anyone who disagrees with them as having a negative motivation."

HEADLINE: An Uncertain Future For 3 Deep-Water Ports

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
The bananas unloaded off ships from South America keep 62 longshoremen busy for two days every week at the port here. The manager for Turbana Corporation, the banana importer, says the port is one of the most efficient in the nation.
But the workers unloading the bananas face an uncertain future. New Haven Terminal Inc., the private company that owns and operates the port, is seeking investors or a buyer because of financial problems, and the amount of cargo coming into Bridgeport is less than half of what it was five years ago. 
 The picture is even bleaker at the port of New London, which has been closed since last year when the state-owned pier collapsed.
 
100 Workers Laid Off
 Connecticut's three deep-water ports -- Bridgeport, New Haven and New London -- which had thrived handling raw materials for the state's once-vibrant manufacturing economy, have been on the decline for decades. New Haven still serves as a major port for petroleum products. Volume there declined during the early 1990's, but picked up with the resurgence in the economy.
But shipments of other cargo at all three ports have been falling, and in the last four years, the ports of New Haven and Bridgeport have laid off 100 workers. Most Connecticut businesses that ship by sea use the container port in Elizabeth, N.J. The state's small ports cannot handle large volumes of container traffic.
The state concedes that it has paid little attention to its ports. Maintenance and infrastructure improvements in Bridgeport and New Haven have been in the hands of private businesses. Before the pier collapsed in New London in April 1993, the state had spent only $3.2 million for maintenance, design work and emergency repairs in seven years.
However, that may be changing.
The state has begun studies to assess the liabilities, assets and potential of its ports, with an eye toward improvements and more aggressive marketing.
"We have to look at what it is that we have to sell," said Richard Strauss, Connecticut's deputy transportation commissioner. After the reports are completed, the state plans another study to assess what role the state should play in investing in the ports' infrastructure, he said.
 
Ports Were Ignored
 It wasn't until the recession hit that Connecticut even began to talk about the value of its ports, business leaders and officials say.
"Everyone figured all you needed was highways," said Sally Bolster, vice president in the Bridgeport office of the Connecticut Development Authority, a quasi-public agency. "In my experience, there was no long range planning in this state."
Business groups, and some government officials, say improving the ports could help the state's economy.
"The state is losing out on economic opportunities because our port development capacity is not sufficient to handle opportunities out there," said Paul Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, a group with 1,100 members. "I don't think the state saw the ports as an economic opportunity. Finally, now, they are paying some attention to it."
 
Not Like the Port Authority
 Connecticut stands in sharp contrast to its neighbors to the west, where the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey generated $90 million in revenue from its ports last year. Its operations handled nearly 28 million tons of bulk cargo plus container traffic last year, and they employ 3,500 longshoremen.
By comparison, Connecticut's revenue from the port of New London was $90,000 in the last fiscal year. The ports of Bridgeport and New Haven, which are privately run and employ 144 longshoremen, handled less than nine million tons last year, and most of that was petroleum products coming into the tank farms of New Haven.
Bridgeport, which handled steel shipments until the late 1980's, now handles only fruit. Before it shut down, New London handled mostly wood pulp.
Some Connecticut businesses say they are losing time and money because they have to use ports outside the state. Yet most Connecticut business groups say they don't expect to see any of the state's ports becoming big container ports like the one in Elizabeth.
 
Niche Ports
 Instead, Connecticut's ports would compete as niche ports for cargo like steel, fruit, wood pulp and paper products, which are not shipped in the large steel containers that come through Elizabeth, Connecticut officials say. But there is still talk about attracting limited container cargo.
"To develop a port here in Connecticut would take a major investment and a lot of infrastructure," said Steve Cerchia, traffic manager for the Devtec Corporation in Windsor, Conn., which exports about 70 percent of the aircraft ground-support equipment it makes. Devtec is well served by Port Elizabeth, Boston and Wilmington, Del., he said. It ships its manufactured goods in containers and in specialized ships.
"If you put in a viable port in Connecticut and can support it and not have it be a tax boondoogle for the state, I'd certainly support it," said Mr. Cerchia. "As a businessman, I don't think it's worth the investment."
But others like Richard Bodine, vice president of sales and marketing of the Bodine Corporation in Bridgeport, says Port Elizabeth is so busy he sometimes has to wait weeks for the Customs office there to clear his shipments of parts used to build assembly machines. Having a port capable of handling containers in Bridgeport would be a "tremendous advantage," Mr. Bodine said. He estimated that his shipping costs would be cut by 20 percent if he could ship through Bridgeport.
 
No Agency of Its Own
 Unlike New York, New Jersey and other states in the region, Connecticut has had no port authority to market its ports or issue bonds for improvements. Compared with other states around the country, it is also unusual that two of the state's general-cargo ports are privately owned.
Last year, the General Assembly created a Connecticut Coastline Port Authority, but it has no financing. John Byrne, deputy city administrator of Bridgeport, one of 13 commissioners, describes it as advisory.
A bill to give the group more power and take away the state's authority over the three ports didn't make it out of the legislature's Transportation Committee this year. "It was wishful thinking, but not realistic," said Matthew Nemerson, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce and a port commissioner. "We have no revenue base," he said.
So far, only one port study has been completed. The Bridgeport report, released in January, estimates that a $53 million investment would be needed to capture a bigger share of refrigerated cargoes like fresh fruit and attract containerized cargoes and new markets like automobiles. By the year 2000, such an investment would generate 623 jobs at the port, the study said.
In New London, the state has demolished a storage shed and gone ahead with design work to for reconstruction. Mr. Strauss said he hopes to have a portion of the pier operating by the end of next year.
But some port commissioners and shipping executives have questioned why the state is spending money in New London before the port study is even finished. The two general cargo operators are concerned that a company chosen to run a new facility in New London would have a competitive advantage.
"It's going to be a first class, well constructed dock and to simply allow someone to operate from there and have a monopoly is a concern," said Orest Dubno, marketing director of Gateway Terminal, a cargo operator in New Haven, which employs 100.
 
Worried About New London
 During a tour of the gritty, largely unpaved port in New Haven, the state's biggest with 135 acres, Marty Tristine, vice president of New Haven Terminal, said, "A lot of money has been put into this business. It's not in terrific shape now, but it'll be in worse shape if the state continues what they're planning" in New London.
Mr. Tristine and Joseph Crowley, the company's president, whose grandfather founded the business, said New Haven Terminal would not be able to compete with a state-subsidized port. Mr. Strauss responded that New Haven Terminal could apply to the state for low-interest loans for improvements.
"We have a responsibility to repair that publicly owned facility," said Mr. Strauss. "Essentially, this is taking care of deferred maintenance."

HEADLINE: G.A.O. Seeks Sweeping Rules for Derivatives

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
A two-year Congressional study of the explosive growth in financial derivatives that was released yesterday calls for sweeping new regulation of the companies that create these often complex financial products and the companies that use them.
The General Accounting Office said the banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies that deal in derivatives should be subject to uniform rules on how to manage the risk of their trading positions, how much capital to keep to cushion against losses, and how to disclose data about their derivatives activity. 
 Currently, banks are subject to strict supervision, but other derivatives dealers are more lightly regulated, if at all. While the recommendations effectively seek to force all market participants to follow what are generally regarded as the best industry practices, derivatives dealers were quick to call the recommendations unwarranted.
Derivatives are contracts with values that are based on, or derived from, underlying financial markets. The owner of a stock option, for example, can make profits or lose money as a stock price rises or falls, without owning any shares of the stock. Some derivatives, like options, are used by investors to speculate or to hedge positions in stocks, bonds and commodities. Others, like swaps, are used by corporations to reduce their risks from the fluctuations of interest rates and currencies.
The G.A.O., which is the investigative arm of Congress, said more regulation was needed because the use of derivatives might increase the risk of a financial crisis. On the other hand, the report said, derivatives could also reduce the risk of such a crisis.
Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the House subcommittee that requested the report, endorsed its recommendations. "It is a tour de force, blistering, scalding indictment of the deficiencies in the current regulatory safeguards," he said. "They identified a regulatory black hole when it comes to derivatives."
Mr. Markey said he endorsed all the recommendations and he expected to introduce a bill to enact them this year in his subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, which oversees brokerage firms. The House banking committee is working on a separate bill to strengthen regulation of derivatives activities by banks. Congressional aides say that none of the bills are likely to pass this year.
The Clinton Administration has not decided whether derivatives activities of brokerage firms and insurance companies should be subject to increased regulation, but it opposes new legislation regarding banks.
"I don't know of any new authority that bank regulators feel they need," Frank Newman, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, said. Over all, he played down any danger of derivatives to the nation's financial system. "It's a risk that needs to be looked at," he said. "But I don't think anyone, including the G.A.O., is portraying this as some imminent, likely danger."
Banks and brokerage firms were uniform in denouncing the report.
"Derivatives are an essential component of modern financial activity and a critically important risk management tool for corporations, financial institutions, and governments around the world," said six banking and brokerage trade associations in a rare joint statement. "If implemented, the G.A.O. recommendations would increase the cost and reduce the availability of these essential transactions," the associations said.
The G.A.O. did not propose restricting any derivative products or limiting their use. Instead, the 200-page report raised concerns that derivatives activity is concentrated at a handful of banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies and that derivatives may increase the linkages between various markets.
As a result, the report said, some regulators and market participants felt that if one major dealer failed or withdrew from the market, it could cause problems for other dealers and in other markets.
Other regulators, the study noted, argue that derivatives actually reduce the risk of such cascading problems. "No empirical evidence was available for determining the actual effects of these characteristics because no crisis caused by derivatives has occurred," the report said.
Still, the report concluded that the potential for such a crisis was sufficient to require greater Government involvement.
 
Dealers Assail Recommendations
 Derivatives dealers were especially critical of the report, saying its data did not back up the assertions. "They don't have material in the report that justifies their recommendations," said Mark Brickell, an executive of J. P. Morgan and vice chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.
The report does present data to show that all but one of the largest United States banks have greater credit risk from loans than from derivatives. And though the report warns that derivatives' principal risks to the system result from the relatively small number of dealers, the G.A.O.'s own survey shows that just 11 percent of the credit exposure of American derivatives dealers are with other domestic dealers.
Most banks would face more losses if another financial firm failed from foreign currency trading or from loans than from derivatives trades, Mr. Brickell said. "Why does a dealer in derivatives deserve those burdens when a dealer in foreign exchange is not faced with them?" he asked.
James L. Bothwell, the director of financial institution and markets issues for the G.A.O., argued that the study found many weaknesses in risk management and that those problems justified the report's concerns.
"We have no empirical basis to say the risk is likely, but the risk certainly is there; it could happen," he said.
 
Seeks Routine Disclosure
 The G.A.O.'s principal recommendation is that derivatives dealers at brokerage firms and insurance companies be subject to the same sort of strict regular examinations and rules for disclosure, internal controls and capital as Federally insured banks.
Other recommendations included updating accounting standards to reflect derivative exposure better; fostering uniform international regulations, and forcing corporations that use "complex derivatives" to have adequate controls and disclosures.
More broadly, the G.A.O. said Congress should consider more sweeping reform of financial regulation because it has not kept pace with the blurring of lines between industries.
"Banking, securities, futures and insurance are no longer separate and distinct industries that can be well regulated by the existing patchwork quilt of Federal and state agencies," the report said.

For as long as anyone can remember, the favorite breakfast here and in much of the former Soviet Union has been a hearty plate of sausage, cold cuts, potatoes, eggs and a few slices of thick, chewy bread slathered with wonderfully high-cholesterol butter.
But now one of the great missionary enterprises in American business, the Kellogg Company of Battle Creek, Mich., is trying to change the way hundreds of millions of Russians, Latvians and other former Soviet citizens start their day. 
 Attracted by the prospect of reaping fortunes in one of the few remaining cereal frontiers in the world, the company has opened a plant in the birch and pine woods on the outskirts of this Baltic capital to make Kellogg's Corn Flakes. And Kellogg is pressing ahead with one of the more ambitious education programs in the annals of eating.
 
A New Way to Eat Breakfast
 "We have to teach people a whole new way to eat breakfast," said Philip D. Stewart, a specialist in Soviet affairs who left Ohio State University to command Kellogg's forces in the former Soviet Union.
Kellogg is making its biggest push here in Riga, a medieval city of towers and spires with a population of nearly a million people. But Kellogg is also testing the waters in neighboring Estonia and Lithuania and has established beachheads in a few Russian stores in St. Petersburg and Moscow.
To win converts, Kellogg is relying mainly on slick television advertisements showing a family joyfully digging into their Corn Flakes, and on demonstrations in grocery stores that the company refers to as "taste testings."
The emphasis is on American-style health and nutrition, but there's the unmistakable suggestion that breakfast can be fun, too. As a column of creamy white milk cascades into a bowl of Corn Flakes in the television ad, the camera moves in for a tight shot and the message "eight vitamins" flashes across the screen.
One recent afternoon in Kekava, an old town just south of Riga, a young Latvian sales representative for Kellogg stacked a table in the immaculate Dalderi grocery store with red and white boxes of Corn Flakes and little white paper bowls. Behind the display were chest-high deli cases displaying giant blocks of cheese, a dozen varieties of sausage and glistening slabs of fatty bacon.
The Kellogg display drew a cluster of women and children and a few men. The sales representative held a bowl of Corn Flakes and urged someone to have a try.
"It's delicious," she said, "It has lots of calories, lots of vitamins."
Ausma Meijere, a woman in her 60's in a heavy black coat, reached for the bowl and took in a couple of crunchy mouthfuls.
 
A Different Taste
 "It's quite substantial," Mrs. Meijere said with mild surprise. "Normally I have boiled macaroni with milk and sugar. But I'm planning to buy some of these. The crispiness is different from what we're used to."
On another afternoon in the Baltic Sea resort of Jurmala, Ilze Sulmane, a journalism lecturer at the University of Latvia, said her children adored cornflakes. But at the equivalent of a little more than a dollar and a half for a box in a country where most Latvians earn less than $100 a month, she said, "we can't afford them."
"Sometimes," Mrs. Sulmane said, "we buy them for a gift."
Juris Paider, the editor of Dienas Biznes, a financial newspaper in Latvia, can afford cornflakes. But like many Latvian men, as Kellogg discovered in focus groups and other research, Mr. Paider scoffed at the new breakfast food.
"This is not food for a man," he said. "My wife likes it because it is very fast, easy to serve. The kids eat it not only in the morning but between meals. They take little bits in their hands. But it's not for me. I've been eating a different kind of food all my life. I'm too conservative to change."
The grumpy reaction of some men notwithstanding, Richard Lovell, the head of corporate communications for Kellogg in Battle Creek, said that initial sales in the former Soviet Union, as well as in the new markets of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, had been encouraging. Mr. Lovell would not say how much cereal the company was selling in the region or give other details of Kellogg's sales or marketing strategy.
 
No Quick Return Seen
 Kellogg invested $22 million in its Corn Flakes plant in Riga without expectation of a quick return. "We don't expect to realize profits for years in an operation like this," Mr. Lovell said. "It's going to be part of long-term growth."
It took 40 years to develop the Latin American market, Mr. Lovell said, and the company views Latvia, its 18th international outpost, in the same spirit.
Already the world's most successful cereal company, with 51 percent of the market, Kellogg is opening another plant in Bombay, India, this summer and has started work on one in China that is expected to begin turning out breakfast cereal in mid-1995.
Since becoming independent in 1991, Latvia has created a climate for foreign investors that seems tranquil compared with the chaos in much of the former Soviet Union. It has established its own currencies and has managed to rein in inflation.
But Kellogg tumbled into Latvia through a series of improbable developments that began eight years ago. The first overture came not from Battle Creek but from Moscow. On a visit to the United States, Georgi A. Arbatov, an adviser on American affairs to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President, fell in love with Kellogg cereals and wanted to see them on breakfast tables at home.
So when Mr. Stewart, as a consultant to the Kellogg Foundation while at Ohio State, went to him in 1986 to ask for help in arranging some seminars on the military, Mr. Arbatov saw a chance for some horse trading.
It was an easy sell, Mr. Stewart said, because Arnold G. Langbo, then president of Kellogg's international division and now chairman and chief executive officer, already had his eye on the Soviet Union, as well as China and India.
But discussions sputtered along for two years before Mr. Arbatov suggested a joint venture with a collective farm outside Riga. Before the deal could be closed, the Soviet Union collapsed, Latvia became independent and Kellogg decided to go it alone.
Mr. Stewart retired from Ohio State University and took charge of building Kellogg's plant in Latvia. Every step of the way meant reinventing the wheel. Kellogg wanted to build its plant with Latvian workers but, Mr. Stewart said, "No local builder understood the kind of standards we were talking about."
So Kellogg brought in architects, engineers and supervisors from England and Germany. The company also hauled in hardware and plumbing supplies as well as the machinery to make cornflakes. Kellogg has been able to buy some supplies locally, but the most important ingredient -- corn -- is still imported, reportedly from Canada and Argentina.
Once the plant officially opened in November, Kellogg had to reach retail outlets in a country where there was no effective distribution system.
Instead of recruiting a work force by word of mouth or through old relationships, Kellogg advertised in the Riga newspapers and interviewed hundreds of applicants. Every employee hired had a high school education and many had college degrees, Mr. Stewart said. But factory workers had to learn how to make Corn Flakes, a technique that is a closely guarded company secret. Office employees also had to learn Western management and accounting methods, and the sales force had to learn what it means to sell.
"We started with a work force of people who had never seen a cornflake," Mr. Stewart said. "And the skills of salesmanship and merchandising, none of that had existed here for more than 50 years."
But gradually, Kellogg has been making a dent. These days, Mr. Stewart said, "You'd have a hard time finding a store in Latvia that doesn't have Kellogg's Corn Flakes."

HEADLINE: Why the Fed Acted

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
On the face of it, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Tuesday mainly to take some steam out of a growing economy so that it would not become inflationary.
But that explanation, offered by the Fed itself, hardly tells the whole story. Quite apart from inflation, which is still quite modest, the Fed was forced to deal with a concoction of events -- most of them only loosely connected to the real economy -- that had pushed up interest rates. More than in the past, rates and reality became disconnected. 
 Even Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman famous as an inflation fighter in the 1980's, acknowledged as much. "The apparent sensitivity of the markets to inflationary fears seems overdrawn," he said in a recent speech that he cited again during an interview. "I am not in the school of those concerned that any significant economic growth will bring stronger price pressure."
The problem is that the higher interest rates that have resulted from the concoction of events -- financial speculation was one, trade policy and the weak dollar was another, a selloff of Treasury securities by the nation's banks was a third -- could be damaging. By restricting borrowing, the higher rates have the potential of taking more steam out of the economy than the Fed may have wished, greatly diluting an economic expansion that was so promising and powerful during the winter, but has now lost some of its bloom.
"Interest rates at today's levels certainly hasten the day when the economic recovery begins to peter out," Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, said. "There have to be people on the margin already closed out from buying houses and cars."
Interest rates had risen by more than 1.5 percentage points since October on most loans of two years duration or more. Recognizing this upward trend, the Fed in February raised a key rate that it controls to catch up, and to signal its intention to fight inflation by slowing the economy, if necessary.
But the Fed's February action, along with similar quarter-point increases in March and April, only seemed to excite the markets and to push up interest rates even more, beyond the Fed's goals. The bigger half-point increase on Tuesday finally brought calm -- for the moment.
"The marketplace is satisfied; we have gotten the dark cloud of uncertainty from over our heads," said Albert Wojnilower, senior economic adviser to the CS First Boston Investment Corporation, a Wall Street firm. "For a few months, we can let the economy roll on, but then the Fed will probably have to raise rates again."
 
The Inflation Haters
 Mr. Wojnilower is a member of a powerful constituency -- embodied in the nation's bond markets -- that wants to keep inflation down. It argues that the best way to do this is to push rates high enough, at least for a while, to slow the economy.
The bond market, in effect, represents the nation's lenders. They are wealthy individuals, banks, mutual funds, pension funds, brokerage houses, insurance companies and money managers. They have out on loan more than $8 trillion to business and to government. That is $2 trillion more than the value of all shares on the nation's stock exchanges.
The lenders make these loans by investing in Treasury securities, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. And they are worried that the expanding economy will generate inflation, reducing the value of their bonds. To make the point, they often overstate the inflation danger -- and the Fed finds itself responding to the pressure.
"I am an economist, and as an economist I don't understand why interest rates went up so much," said Nicholas Sargen, who is also chief investment officer for a Prudential Insurance Company fund that lends $4 billion, most of it on behalf of mutual funds and pension funds.
As an economist, Mr. Sargen ticks off reasons why the pressure among lenders for higher interest rates to prevent inflation lacks justification in the real economy, with its stagnant wages and numerous companies that can't make price increases stick. "I personally agree that the markets may have overstated the risk of an upsurge in inflation," he said.
 
Cuts Back on Treasuries
 But as a lender, he has added his voice to the hue and cry about inflation. More to the point, he has sharply reduced his purchase of Treasury bonds. That strategy remains in place, despite the Fed's Tuesday rate increase and despite Mr. Sargen's private skepticism about inflation. Besides, he has an alternative.
More easily than in the past, he can shift money quickly into foreign bonds, and he has. His fund holds European bonds, and it recently purchased long-term Australian government bonds, which offer an annual yield of nearly 9 percent, well above similar American Treasuries.
Mr. Sargen's reluctance to purchase American bonds, multiplied many times over, helped to make interest rates rise. Because of the Sargens in the marketplace, bondholders wanting to sell have not found enough eager buyers. If a bondholder is offering for sale a $100 bond, for example, he has had to lower the price to entice a buyer. Perhaps he receives only $80. If the bond pays $6 a year or 6 percent interest, then that $6 annual payment represents a 7.5 percent yield for the bond's new owner, who has invested only $80.
 
Speculation Emerges
 This reluctance to buy coincided with a rush to sell, not so much because of fears about inflation, but because of speculation. During a long period of weak economic growth and unchanging interest rates -- a period that ended late last year -- bond buyers invested not only their money, but also money they borrowed.
They would borrow at, say, 3 percent for six months and invest in 10-year bonds that paid 6 percent interest. That leverage worked as long as interest rates stayed steady. But when they began to rise, and fluctuate, the game became dangerous. There was a rush to sell, and the difficulty in finding buyers forced down prices and pushed up yields.
"You say to yourself, 'Bonds are a good value, and I should buy,' but then you say to yourself, 'Maybe I can wait until tomorrow, because they are still going down in value,' " said Robert Johnson, a managing director for funds sponsored by the financier George Soros. "And then you say, 'I would like to buy bonds,' but then you say, 'That's crazy, because there are all these people who still have to sell first.' Only now is that selling finally coming to an end."
The selloff by speculators coincided with another selloff, by banks, for a different reason. During four years of weak economic growth, the banks, lacking borrowers, invested their depositors' money instead in Treasuries, which paid interest rates higher than the depositors received. The Fed had encouraged this safe and profitable tactic to strengthen banks, which had been hurt by loan defaults.
 
Banks Sell Treasuries
 But with the economy expanding again, businesses and consumers borrowed more, and to raise money to service this loan demand, the banks have been selling Treasury securities, driving down their value and driving up their yields.
Finally, a weak dollar has put upward pressure on interest rates. Rather than risk currency losses, foreigners, particularly the Japanese, sold Treasury bonds and converted the dollars into their own currencies. American trade policy inadvertently aided this process. When trade talks with Japan broke down in February, foreign exchange traders concluded that the Administration would respond by favoring a weaker dollar against the yen -- a tactic that might hurt Japanese exports.
The Administration denied such a tactic, but the dollar fell anyway. And the United States, with 16 other countries, finally intervened, buying dollars to stabilize the currency's value. But to really stabilize the dollar, bondholders reasoned, the Fed had to endorse the currency intervention by raising rates to make Treasuries, purchased in dollars, more attractive. And the Fed did so on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Fails to Respond To the Fed's Rate Increases

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against many leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates failed to restore the market's confidence in the American currency.
Many traders had expected the dollar to gain after the Fed pushed up both its discount rate and the Federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks by half a percentage point on Tuesday. Higher rates usually bolster the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. 
 But the dollar fell instead, as traders concluded that the Fed was unlikely to raise rates again soon and that Tuesday's increase was not large enough to justify buying dollars.
The Fed suggested that further rate increases were not needed to head off the inflation that often arises with strong economic growth. But at 3.5 percent, the Fed's discount rate on its overnight loans to member banks is still a full percentage point lower than the rate in Germany.
"The dollar looks like it's heading lower," said Bill Arnold, chief currency dealer at the Chemical Bank. "Market participants have concluded that there won't be any more rate increases" in the United States in the near future.
 
Yen and Mark Up
 In late New York trading, the dollar was down 1.5 pfennigs, at 1.6575 German marks, from 1.6725 marks on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 103.55 Japanese yen from 104.68 yen.
Traders lost confidence in the dollar earlier this year when previous rate increases by the Fed failed to drive it higher. A flight of capital from slumping stock and bond markets also weighed on the dollar.
Some traders suspect that the Fed raised short-term rates as part of its effort to shore up the dollar. The Fed and other central banks bought dollars on May 4 to stem its slide. A week later, the Bundesbank lowered German interest rates in what looked like a coordinated effort to drive the dollar higher.
"This is a dangerous scenario for the dollar," said Hunt Taylor, managing director at the Reynwood Trading Corporation, a Short Hills, N.J., currency trading firm that manages $100 million. "The strongest weapon a government has to defend its currency is interest-rate policy. If that doesn't work, nothing will."
The dollar remains weak against major currencies in part because European assets are more attractive right now, traders said. With interest rates falling on the Continent, European stocks and bonds promise to rally more than American assets.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Most Treasury Rates Lower in Active Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Interest rates on most Treasury securities moved lower again yesterday in what dealers said was active but orderly trading.
But weakness in the dollar and a rise in some commodity prices preyed on long-term bond yields, which were rose fractionally following Tuesday's big drop. 
 The dollar's renewed weakness was a source of concern because it came only a day after the Federal Reserve Board's aggressive increase in two key short-term interest rates. Since interest rate rises are not usually associated with a declining currency, some bond traders voiced concern that the Fed might have to raise rates again to support the dollar if the currency continues to falter.
"The dollar has been the big discussion topic," said William Michaelcheck, president of Mariner Partners, a private New York firm that concentrates most of its activity in trading short-term Treasury securities.
"We have a risk that if the Clinton Administration and the Fed appear to send out a message they have gone as far as they are going to go" in raising interest rates, "then currency traders will hit the dollar."
 
Raising of Interest Rates
 In its statement announcing the half-point increases in the overnight Federal funds rate and the discount rate Tuesday, the Fed left the clear impression that for the time being it has finished raising interest rates.
In a statement that rattled currency traders, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen underscored that notion yesterday. Mr. Bentsen said he "would hope" the Fed's latest rate increase will provide a "respite" from additional increases.
Mr. Bentsen's comments "were a mistake," Mr. Michaelcheck said, because they will likely be viewed by currency traders as an opportunity to test the Administration's commitment to supporting the dollar.
"The market certainly has the impression that there is a tacit understanding between the Fed and the Treasury that this was it for a while," he said. "The foreign exchange market is kind of nervous about that."
Yet, even as the prospect that the Fed may for the time being be finished with raising interest rates sent small ripples through the bond market, the same possibility was providing comfort to traders of short-to- intermediate-term securities.
Indeed, after Tuesday's chaotic session, traders and analysts said they were satisfied with the market's overall performance yesterday.
"Tuesday's rally was explosive," said Steven Saslow, an executive managing director at HSBC Securities. "Today was more gradual, with a continued flow of retail investors coming into the market. There is increasing comfort that the Fed will sit for a longer period of time."
The big drop in yields on Tuesday also provided corporations and tax-exempt municipal bond issuers the opportunity to price new issues yesterday.
More than $1 billion in new corporate bonds were priced yesterday, while states and cities offered just over $750 million worth of new securities.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the benchmark 6 1/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2023 were offered late yesterday at a price of 87 22/32 , down 1/8 of a point from late Tuesday, to yield 7.27 percent. During overnight trading, before the dollar began to weaken, bond prices had been as much as half a point higher.
Among intermediate- and short-term Treasury issues, the 6 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at a price of 99 5/8, up 1/4 point, to yield 6.58 percent. And prices of the 5 1/2 percent two-year notes rose by 6/32 , to 99 1/2, to yield 5.77 percent.
Confidence that the Fed has finished tightening monetary policy for the foreseeable future was visible in the Treasury bill market, where rates eased by as much as 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was the biggest issuer in the corporate debt market yesterday, as it offered $500 million worth of 10-year notes.
The notes were priced at 100, or par, to yield 7.50 percent, 46 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.25 percent ten-year notes at the time of pricing.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for the issue, which is non-callable for life. The securities are rated AA-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The State of Maryland had the largest offering in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, selling $120 million in general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
The bonds, which are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, were priced to yield as much as 5.65 percent on bonds maturing in 2009.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs by 12.28 in a Late Recovery

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
It was a baffling day in the markets yesterday, as traders pondered the steep interest-rate increase they had long lobbied for and got. The stock market drifted in the morning, but recovered strongly in the afternoon, especially as measured by the broad-based Standard & Poor's 500.
For much of the day, however, stock traders scratched their heads over the course of the dollar, which failed to rally after the Federal Reserve Board's increase in interest rates. 
 "All day the stock market was confused because of the dollar," said David F. DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The dollar began to stop selling off around noon and then the bond market recovered, so the stock market decided to recover, too."
As near as he could piece it together, Mr. DeRosa said, European traders had been enthusiastically buying dollars as of 3 A.M., Eastern time, but as buying waned, other potential buyers were expecting dollar purchases by the Federal Reserve Board and European central banks. When the expected intervention did not happen, the dollar, which had been unsteady, began to fall.
"This was a major disappointment for the dollar bulls," said Mr. DeR osa, who described himself as bearish on the dollar. "It spilled over into other markets."
The American currency declined against the yen and the Deutsche mark yesterday, despite recent European cuts in interest rates, notably in Germany. The dollar fell to 103.55 yen, from 104.68 yen at the previous close, and to 1.657 marks from 1.6725 marks.
Meanwhile, the bond market seemed to be coming out of its tailspin, in large part to the Fed's action Tuesday. Bond prices were little changed yesterday, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged up slightly to 7.27 percent.
 
A Steadying of Bond Prices
 The steadying of bond prices helped the stock market. In heavy trading, stock prices rose on all the leading indexes, although much more strongly on the Nasdaq composite index, which failed to rise Tuesday after the Fed action. High-technology stocks, battered for weeks, recovered moderately.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.28 points, to 3,732.89 and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 4.32 points, to 453.69. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 10.38 points, to 721.90.
The fact that the markets recovered was the only important conclusion from the day, said Easton Ragsdale, chief quantitative analyst for Kidder, Peabody. "As long as you have decent volume and the market is up, that's a good thing. The market may be getting back to important questions like, Are corporate earnings going up? And the answer to that is yes."
Yesterday, the number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 337.7 million shares, 12 percent above this year's average of 302 million shares.
Indeed, the New York Stock Exchange announced yesterday that the trading value of shares bought and sold, as of yesterday, totaled $1 trillion so far this year, three weeks ahead of last year's record. The $1 trillion mark was reached on June 10 last year.
By Tuesday, more than 28 billion had been traded on the Big Board, compared with 25.1 billion in the period a year ago. A record $2.25 trillion worth of stock was traded last year, or about 67.2 billion shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.60 points, to 250.73. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,629 to 679. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.92 points, to 434.90.
Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow industrials, 16 rose, led by Philip Morris, whose price was up 1 1/2 points, to 53, on no discernible news.

Soybean Rally Helps to Push Price Index to 3 1/2-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices rose to a three-and-a-half-year high yesterday as soybean prices surged, even though the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates the day before in an effort to slow growth in prices.
The bureau's index rose as high as 231.45, its highest since October 1990, before settling at 230.98, up 1.45 points. Of the index's 21 components, which include everything from copper to coffee, 14 were higher. 
 The rise in the bureau's index is evidence of a turnaround for goods that have been depressed by a weak global economy and ample supply, Bill O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Company, said.
"There are a number of commodities that have been in long down cycles," including copper, coffee and sugar, Mr. O'Neill said. "What we're seeing is a recovery in some of those markets."
The prospect of inflation also concerns investors, he said, even as the Fed raises rates to contain it: "It shows that even with the Fed doing this, there is still a certain background fear of inflation."
 
Weather Forecast Moves Grains
 Soybeans rose to a four-month high on forecasts that dry weather in the Midwest will last for at least the next few days. Soybeans for July delivery gained 21.50 cents, to $7.0075 a bushel, extending a 5.5 percent rally this week on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Among other grain contracts, July corn rose 2.25 cents, to $2.6925 a bushel, but July wheat fell 2.00 cents, to $3.24 a bushel.
Little rain is expected during the weekend and temperatures should be above normal, according to the Weather Services Corporation of Bedford, Mass. Traders said this season's lack of rainfall was particularly disturbing. Stockpiles are low after flooding last year reduced the harvest.
"Any little turbulence makes you nervous," Victor Lespinasse, vice president with Dean Witter in Chicago, said. "If you fall this time, you're going to get hurt because there's no cushion."
 
Oil Prices Rise
 Elsewhere, crude oil joined the commodity market rally, following the American Petroleum Institute's institute's weekly report that showed a decline in crude oil stocks.
June crude rose 40 cents, to $17.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while unleaded gasoline rose 0.85 cent, to 51.32 cents a gallon, and heating oil gained 0.66 cent, to 47.70 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Japan Likely to Retain Curb on Software Raiding

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 18

 BODY:
In an apparent victory for the United States, the Japanese Government is expected to abandon a plan to revise its copyright law in a way that would have made it easier for one company to reverse-engineer another company's computer software.
An advisory committee to Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs has finished its deliberations without reaching a conclusion on whether and how the law should be changed, according to committee members, industry officials and Japanese press reports. 
 "Right now the committee couldn't reach an agreement to prepare a draft of an amendment to revise the copyright law," said Shigeru Miki, a Tokyo lawyer and a member of the advisory panel.
Without a recommendation from the committee to change the law, the cultural agency is expected to drop the matter, at least for now.
Washington, as well as American computer and software companies like Apple, I.B.M. and Microsoft, vigorously protested the contemplated change in copyright law, saying it would have made it easier for Japanese companies to learn how American programs work and to develop competing products. Software is an industry in which American companies are the acknowledged world leaders and in which the Japanese are considered weak.
 
Some U.S. Companies Dissent
 But a smaller group of American companies led by Sun Microsystems argued in favor of revision, saying it would spur innovation and competition and make it easier for different programs and different machines to work together.
The advisory panel's report, which is expected to be made final on May 30, reportedly lays out several positions on the matter without backing any of them. "There are so many opinions," Mr. Miki said. "The chairman couldn't get a single agenda."
But if a lack of consensus is the official reason for shelving the proposal, the real reason might be that Japan does not want to stick another thorn in the side of the United States at a time when it is trying to ease touchy trade relations.
Overall trade negotiations broke down in February, and Japan's politically weak coalition Government is having trouble delivering on promises to deregulate the economy, increase spending and open markets. Washington has begun to ease pressure on Japan for immediate results.
At issue in this case is a process called "decompilation," a way of dissecting computer programs to learn how they work.
When software is written in a programming language, like Fortran, it undergoes a process of compilation that turns the program into the ones and zeroes understood by the computer. Such a collection of ones and zeroes, which are on the disk or tape a customer buys, are extremely difficult to decipher. Decompilation turns this binary code back into a programming language that trained people can more readily understand.
 
Japanese Litigation Seen
 In the absence of a change in the law, experts said, it is somewhat unclear whether decompilation is permissible in Japan under some circumstances. The matter is likely to be tested in Japanese courts, just as it has been in American courts.
Washington thinks that Japanese law prohibits the practice. But Mr. Miki, the lawyer on the advisory panel, said the practice might be permissible under some circumstances, just as making copies of a copyrighted work is allowed in some situations.
The European Union in 1991 allowed decompilation when it is necessary to make one program operate with another. In the United States, two court decisions have let video-game software companies use the practice to evade lockout devices preventing them from making games for Sega and Nintendo machines.
Proponents say decompilation speeds innovation because one program can build on another. Learning how a program functions is legitimate, they say, because copyrights do not protect ideas, only how ideas are expressed. They also say the practice allows smaller companies to make programs that work with, or compete against software from giants like I.B.M. and Microsoft that have become industry standards.
Opponents say there are other, legal ways to find out how a program works. The process of decompilation itself involves making a copy of the software being analyzed, which is illegal, they say.

HEADLINE: Daimler Says Sales Rose

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 18

 BODY:
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, said today that sales rebounded in the first quarter.
Edzard Reuter, the company's chairman, said at the annual shareholders meeting in Berlin that sales in the quarter were up 19 percent from the corresponding period in 1993, when Germany was in deep recession and export sales were slumping. 
 An upturn in the United States market led the surge in Daimler's biggest division, the luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz. The report said Mercedes's United States sales rose 45 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 28 percent increase in all of Western Europe and 17 percent in Germany. Mr. Reuter said the company over all showed a 30 percent increase in sales in the United States for the quarter.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
All the Signs Are Pointing to Another Major-League Strike

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
How naive it all seems now.
March 1990, wee hours of the morning, a hotel ballroom filled with stale cigarette smoke, half-empty coffee cups and fatigued players, management officials, labor negotiators and reporters. And, everyone thought, a breath of fresh air. 
 Baseball's power brokers were signing a peace treaty, but in a far different fashion from the hostile ends of previous stoppages. In 1981, negotiators would not even be photographed together after a bitter 50-day strike ended. In 1985, player-negotiators broke open champagne, but refused to offer sips to their counterparts on management's team at the end of a two-day strike.
March 1990 was different. A lockout that wiped 32 days from the spring-training schedule had ended. And the combatants turned the pact signing into a public soul-searching and love fest, applauding each other and tantalizing their weary fans with thoughts of tending to their responsibilities to the sport with much less hostility and mistrust.
"This is a very resilient industry, but it's really important for this industry that we lift it out of the anger, end these whacks we take at each other every three or four years," Bud Selig said that day.
Selig, the owner of the Brewers and an active participant in labor negotiations, is now the acting commissioner and responsible for keeping the games going.
A little over four years later, those promises and hopes seem all but forgotten. As life preservers tossed to what was then and still is a troubled game, they proved to be all but useless.
For baseball's owners and players are back at the bargaining table. And it's beginning to look as if nothing short of a miracle will enable the game to avoid another work stoppage.
It has been almost five months since the collective bargaining agreement has expired. It has been almost five months since the collective bargaining agreement has expired. It has been twice that long since the owners opted to open the agreement in order to allow an extra year to try to hammer some revolutionary ideas into the players' heads, mainly a salary cap.
Not surprisingly, the extra year -- a call for the invention of a better wheel to make baseball owners' financial world go round -- has resulted in little, if nothing.
Oh, the two sides met yesterday at a midtown hotel, the first negotiating session since March. "It was a useful, constructive conversation," said Richard Ravitch, the president of the management's Player Relations Committee and the man who will have his first experience leading the owners into a labor fracas. "But there are no headlines."
The two sides will meet again on Monday in Los Angeles to discuss non-economic issues. The owners have given the players a slew of financial reports to look over, a precedent-breaker and required reading for a group trying to determine if they share a moral obligation to buck up foundering franchises. But even if the players find more money in the coffers than they were initially led to expect, it probably will not matter.
"The owners are no longer pleading poverty," Lauren Rich, the assistant general counsel for the Major League Baseball Players Association, said after yesterday's session. "They want a cap no matter what."
That is not likely to endear the owners to the players. Just as the lack of a proposal has not. The owners have not detailed their salary cap idea, which illustrates how preliminary the talks remain even though both sides must realize a countdown on a labor stoppage may have already begun. The players' union representatives are scheduled to meet in Pittsburgh on July 11, the day before the All-Star Game, and may vote on setting a strike date.
"It is clear that the owners are in no great rush to speed up negotiations," Rich said. "It's been 18 months since they re-opened and we still have gotten a proposal."
Management negotiators, with fresh memories of a detailed proposal that was rejected in 1991, sought to work out a proposal with the players this time, Ravitch said.
But the players do not want a salary cap. So, quite naturally, they see no reason to help construct one.
So Ravitch says he plans to present the owners' cap proposal in mid-June, without the players' input. He can only hope it lasts more than the short-lived pay-for-performance issue did in 1990.
So baseball's antagonists stand where they usually do -- poles apart. Until a crisis forces them to settle on a more traditional deal. Nothing thus far suggests that the crisis will not enter, stage right, on cue, as always. That is why the players' executive board will meet in Chicago on June 9, and all of their representatives will meet in Pittsburgh on July 11 to discuss the one step that they may already have concluded is the only way to stop the owners from forcing the salary cap upon them.
The owners? Even though they did not lock the players out earlier this year, they did flex their muscles by requiring that any deal with the players be approved by two-thirds of the 28 owners as opposed to a simple majority. Many immediately saw that rules change as assuring that a militant few can shut down the game and keep it shut.
Ravitch, the self-described optimist, does not buy into such inevitabilities, not as long as there are good-faith negotiations. But, he added: "Strikes and lockouts occur when one side underestimates the determination of the other side. Where the union may think that the owners won't insist on change, I think that the union is going to be wrong. So I hope that this gets done without miscalculation on anybody's part."
So much for the island of peace the two sides supposedly stumbled upon that March day in 1990. One can only hope that day turns out to be more than a failed cease-fire in baseball's otherwise unrelenting version of the 100 Years War.

HEADLINE: On the Brink With North Korea

 BODY:
Tiring of cat-and-mouse bargaining with North Korea over its nuclear program, the two Senate leaders, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, want to rush to impose economic sanctions. Their impatience is especially ill timed: international inspectors arrived yesterday at the site of the North's nuclear reactor, which has been shut down for refueling. A move to sanctions is almost sure to get them sent home.
Washington's top priority is to prevent North Korea from diverting spent nuclear fuel to bombs while refueling. The inspectors' presence over the coming months is the best guarantee that that will not happen. Only if North Korea impedes the inspectors from witnessing the refueling would immediate sanctions be warranted. 
 The Senators are understandably disturbed that the North is resisting inspectors' efforts to determine whether it diverted nuclear material to bombs in the past, and if so, to restore that material to international safekeeping.
But first things first. As long as the North allows the inspectors to monitor the refueling and prevent any new diversion, bomb-making will be held in check. Washington can meanwhile negotiate with Pyongyang about untangling its past nuclear history when high-level talks resume.
The North seems to be amenable to inspection of the refueling. That, in turn, could open the way to a deal allowing investigation of the past. Refueling a reactor takes time -- at least two months, to unload thousands of fuel rods. The rods and spent fuel have to be handled with care; they are brittle, hot, toxic and radioactive. They must be removed and placed in water-filled storage tanks.
The fuel rods themselves are made of low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for bomb-making without further enrichment, a process the North is not believed to be equipped to do. But the spent fuel also contains plutonium, which, when separated, can be fabricated into bombs.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has cameras in place to record the refueling, which inhibits diversion of the spent fuel. But the inspectors' presence would give the world added confidence that no diversion can take place. If North Korea does not intend to make nuclear arms, it has an interest in assuring the world of that.
The inspectors also want to draw samples from the reactor core. Those samples, when assayed, could help determine whether any diversion had taken place in 1989, before inspections began. As long as the inspectors can catalogue and store samples of the core for subsequent assaying, they may be able to retrace the North's nuclear history. But Pyongyang may want a deal with Washington before allowing that to happen.
The Clinton Administration has rightly said it would negotiate with North Korea as long as it was assured the North was not diverting nuclear fuel and separating and reprocessing the plutonium in it. But North Korea's cooperation with inspectors has been grudging and fitful. In March it kept inspectors from taking swabs and radioactivity readings to ascertain whether any reprocessing had occurred over the past year. Now, however, if the North allows the inspectors to complete the work they began in March and to monitor the refueling, as it has pledged, the way would be open to resumption of high-level talks.
At those talks, Pyongyang could trade a verifiable end to its nuclear program in return for U.S. diplomatic recognition, security assurances and political and economic ties. That will take patient diplomacy, not rash sanctions. But why be in a hurry to go over the brink with North Korea?

HEADLINE: A Rank That Rankles: New York Slips to No. 3;
Now Texas Is 2d Most Populous State

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
New York, first in the American League, second in apple production, has slipped to third in population, behind not only California but now Texas.
Texans have already laid claim to unofficial bragging rights as the nation's second most populous state. And yesterday, the Census Bureau disclosed population projections indicating that Texas had indeed overtaken New York sometime in January. 
 "I don't know what difference it makes, frankly," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, not entirely a good sport. "I think we're regularly undercounted, so I don't believe the Census Bureau." Of course, the other biggies -- California, Texas, Florida -- have some problems with undercounting as well.
Other New Yorkers conceded it was inevitable that the Empire State, which ranked first in population from 1810 to 1970, was being bumped to third -- a status it last held in 1800, when it was poised to leapfrog over Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.
"Once you're not No. 1, it doesn't matter where you are," said Jerry Della Femina, the New York advertising executive and reputedly the fastest quote in the East. "Nobody ever shouted they were No. 2 except for Avis."
 
Texas's Edge
 The Census Bureau had figured that Texas would not overtake New York for another six weeks or so, but, responding to a request, it produced a revised projection yesterday to reflect the latest trends.
Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 1, Paul R. Campbell of the Census Bureau estimated, New York's population edged up by a mere 1,000 to 18,151,000. By contrast, Mr. Campbell said, Texas swelled by 26,000 in January to 18,163,000 by Feb. 1.
A relative loss in population hurts a state's standing in Congress, but Texas's expected gain of two more Congressional seats at New York's expense will not occur until the reapportionment after the next decennial census in 2000. Federal aid is typically disbursed according to a state's population, rather than its rank.
The most immediate impact of the shift may be on states of mind in the two states, where superlatives are taken for granted. Egos in both may be too large either to be deflated by a statistical demotion to New York, which remains home to the nation's biggest city, or to be enhanced by the Government's validation of what Texans already consider gospel in Texas, which, with less than half the land area of Alaska, remains the biggest of the 48 contiguous states.
A New Yorker was churlish enough to point out that Texas also ranks first among the states in the number of homes without complete plumbing (85,000) and in cattle population (nearly 14 million). That prompted Mr. Della Femina to suggest that perhaps census takers had counted hooves and divided by four.
Until the last decade or two, Texans considered growth synonymous with progress.
"It's still the dominant view, but it is no longer the only view," said T. R. Fehrenbach, second to none as a Texas historian. "There is a strong feeling today that untrammeled growth brings problems."
Still, the Lone Star State has plenty of space for new Texans as the nation's population continues to shift to the South and the West, which, since 1980, have been home to a majority of Americans. Its population density averages 67 Texans a square mile; New York crowds 384 people in the like space. (And New Jersey has the nation's greatest population density, at 1,050 souls a square mile.)
"I have no doubt that Texans will burst with pride that they've passed New York, although New York is no longer the bete noire it was," Mr. Fehrenback said. "But to assume a mantle of superiority from this, I think, is quite dubious. No way either of us is going to surpass California."
New Yorkers, who still smart from Chicago's claim to having the world's tallest building and from California's primacy in population, struggled, with varying success, not to sound like sore losers.
"There's almost no connection between numbers and spirit," said Bobby Zarem, the publicist, who helped conceive the "I Love New York" promotional campaign and who recently began another, more defensive slogan: "New York -- It ain't over."
 
No Less Congestion
 Mr. Cuomo expressed no envy of Texas's gains. "They have a whole lot of people pouring over the border," he said, "so I don't take this to be a sign of economic growth or of added confidence by couples having larger families. What I think is significant," he added, changing the subject, "is how New York is situated to compete in the global economy in the years ahead.
"I wouldn't trade places with Texas -- or California, for that matter," Mr. Cuomo declared.
The shift in ranking does not mean less congestion in New York because the state is shrinking only relatively. Because of a continuing surge of immigrants from abroad, New York had defied earlier projections that it would slip to third by 1990.
Texas is growing faster, though, while New York has been hemmorhaging population to other states, including Texas. There the annual population increase is as much as 400,000, or more than all of Staten Island.
"Demography isn't such an exact art that we can figure it to the day," said Dr. Steven H. Murdock, chief demographer at the Texas State Data Center of Texas A & M University.
Texas grew by 2.1 percent or more than 300,000 from 1992 to 1993, Dr. Murdock said, absorbing more newcomers than any other state. He said the growth reflected a net gain in immigration from other states, a net gain from overseas and a natural increase, or surplus, of births over deaths.
In the years between decennial counts, the Census Bureau resorts to what Mr. Campbell described as a "computerized cohort component projection model" to estimate population. Life expectancy trends are applied by age, sex and race to the most recent population figures for each state. Births come from health records. Migration patterns are extrapolated from the 1990 census and from Internal Revenue Service returns. After projecting the nation's population, demographers refine the figures state by state and recalibrate them periodically.
In 1993, the Census Bureau said, 7 of every 100 Americans lived in New York. That share is projected to shrink to fewer than 6 in 100 by 2020, by which date Florida is expected to pass New York as third in population, in the bureau's 30-year projection. New York is projected to add 3.4 million people from abroad during that period but lose nearly 500,000 to other states.
Texans are expected to constitute nearly 8 in 100 Americans by 2020 as a result of an influx of 2.2 million immigrants from overseas, 333,000 transplanted Americans, and of about 6 million more births than deaths -- owing, in part, to higher fertility rates among the state's growing Hispanic population.
David C. Huckabee, an analyst with the Congressional Research Service, said if population projections pan out, New York's Congressional delegation will shrink to 29 from 31 after the 2000 Census. The Texas delegation will grow to 32, adding two seats, and California's representation will expand to 55 from 52 -- unless, he said, the membership of the House of Representatives is increased, which last happened in 1911.
"New York is not unique," said David R. Lamphere, an associate demographer with the New York State Department of Economic Development. "Even though we've been gaining in population slowly, we still have considerable out-migration. It's the entire Northeast. New York just gets more attention because we're the biggest," Mr. Lamphere said -- in the region, he meant.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Census projections showing Texas passing New York State in population misspelled the surname of a Texas historian at one point. He is T. R. Fehrenbach, not Fehrenback.

HEADLINE: TENNIS;
A Youngster Looks Ahead Amid Troubled Time in Florida

BYLINE: By CHARLIE NOBLES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 18

 BODY:
Venus Williams, a promising junior tennis player, will celebrate her 14th birthday on June 17, an occasion that will allow her to become a professional. But the more important date for her father, Richard Williams, is July 6, when Venus will receive her final report card from school.
A straight-A report card, Williams said today, would be rewarded with an opportunity for Venus to play in her first professional tournament, the Virginia Slims championships in Manhattan Beach, Calif., in August. 
 "There is a great possibility that she will go into Manhattan Beach as a professional tennis player," Williams said today.
 
Moved to Florida
 Richard Williams recently moved his family from Compton, Calif., to Florida, lured by the prospect of improving his family's quality of life and securing the best possible chance of preparing his two talented daughters, Venus and Serena, 13, for pro tennis careers.
The move comes at a time when women's tennis is struggling with a shortage of stars, and Florida offers a junior tennis industry in which talented prospects are schooled by professional coaches at a number of academies.
Williams said he would not comment on the recent problems affecting another Florida product, Jennifer Capriati, who dropped off the women's pro tour last August.
But Bobby Curtis, the director of youth tennis for the Florida Tennis Association, returned to work today and voiced concern about the Capriati case. Curtis said he was not surprised that Capriati, now 18, seems to be rebelling. She was detained briefly in December in Tampa for shoplifting. On Monday, in a dingy Coral Gables motel, came another red flag: she was arrested on a charge of possession of marijuana.
 
'Potential Problems'
 "You had a situation where the family was mostly living off the daughter's earnings, when the daughter was a juvenile still," Curtis said. "I think when the teen-ager in the family is the big bread-winner, that sets up all kinds of potential problems."
Curtis recalls Capriati as "a bouncy kid winning all the time and moving rapidly through the ranks."
"All the way up, she was in a division only one year instead of two like everybody else," he said. "Her father kept pushing for her to move up. I guess he was right. She was that good."
At what price, people are wondering now.
The Capriati case follows another incident that hit the Florida tennis scene, the violent death of one of Curtis's former players, Steve Vasquez. Curtis said he was stunned by the Mother's Day killing here of the 23-year-old Vasquez by Vasquez's unemployed and divorced father, Rene.
While Curtis was teaching tennis to Vasquez, Curtis said he could see that the father was stern in dealing with his son, who rose to a No. 5 state ranking in the boys' 18's in 1990.
"He could be pretty tough on Steve, but I never expected anything like this," said Curtis, who lived next door to the Vasquez home. After returning from a junior tournament in Tallahassee, Curtis learned that the father had killed not only his son, but also had killed his own girlfriend and then himself with a gun Curtis said was kept at the house.
"The gun was handy, that's the big thing," said Curtis.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up Sharply, With Dow Rising 26.09

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Continuing the rally that began when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates Tuesday, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, as bond prices continued their rise.
Blue chips like International Paper and General Motors, widely held companies like AT&T and Coca-Cola, technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft, which were battered for weeks, all benefited from the surge. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.09 points, to 3,758.98, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3 basis points, to 7.23 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The market has recovered enough that the Dow has edged into the plus column, up 0.13 percent for the year, from the 3,754.09 close at the end of last year.
 
A Lag in Key Indexes
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.79 points, to 456.48, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.41 points, to 727.31. But these indexes still lag for the year, down 2.14 percent for the S.& P. 500 and down 6.37 percent for the Nasdaq.
Dennis Jarrett, a market analyst, said that this week's market activity reflected the general market jubilance over the Fed's increase Tuesday of key interest rates, a pre-emptive move against inflation that was seen as bullish for stocks. But it won't last, he said.
"The market acted nicely" yesterday, Mr, Jarrett said. But he said that some of the activity might be due to the exercising of stock options that expire today in a so-called double witching hour, when options on stock indexes and individual stocks simultaneously expire. Such expiration days often lead to "use-it-or-lose-it" pressure, prompting increases in trading volume.
Nonetheless, what Mr. Jarrett expects for the near-term is "probably a lot more sideways action for the bond market, which translates into similar action in equities."
If stock traders were taking their cue from currency markets, they probably should not, according to David F. DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
The dollar was at 104.33 yen, up 0.78 yen, although new trade data showed the Japanese trade surplus with the United States growing. But, at the same time, Administration officials expressed optimism that trade talks with Japan were getting back on track.
But many currency traders are bearish about the value of the dollar. "No one I know -- and I mean no one -- thinks that the Clinton Administration does not have a weak-dollar policy," Mr. DeRosa said.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.43 points, to 252.16, on normal volume of 307.4 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,318 to 886. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.14 points, to 437.04.
Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow, 18 rose, led by International Paper, which rose 1 7/8, to 68 3/8, on no discernible news.
Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 286 stocks rose, led by AT&T, which rose 1 1/2, to 56 3/4. AT&T won a multi-billion dollar contract from Bell Atlantic to offer advanced entertainment and other services to eight million homes. The other major winner, General Instrument, also saw its shares rise by 4 1/4, to 59 1/8.
But the most active stock yesterday, at 9.5 million shares, was the loser in the Bell Atlantic project, DSC Communications of Plano, Tex. DSC Communications shares fell 811/16 , to 491/16 , when analysts raised questions about the company's ability to win similar contracts from other phone companies. The equipment to be provided by AT&T is a linch pin for video-on-demand and other critical services for the so-called information superhighway. Other regional Bells may follow Bell Atlantic's lead.

New President of Columbia Asks Graduates to Lead

 BODY:
In his first commencement address at Columbia's helm yesterday, President George E. Rupp told graduates that he hoped they would strive to become leaders.
"You will challenge us and lead us not only in your various disciplines and professions, but also in our common life as we engage the tasks that generations preceding you have left undone," said Dr. Rupp, who was named president last fall. 
 But borrowing a metaphor from the storminess of the day, Dr. Rupp also spoke of difficulties clouding the futures of this year's graduates.
"For some of you the place where you will work is not yet certain," he said. "We are confident that you will find what you are seeking, but you more than most of us are acutely aware that, even before the cheering stops on occasions like this one, celebration is tinged with anxiety.
"The arena of further work and study that you are entering," he continued, "is not the land of limitless opportunity that college and university graduates once at least thought they were entering."
In the full commencement ceremony marking the end of Columbia's 240th year, 8,215 graduate and undergraduate degrees were conferred.
 
A Call to Sacrifice
 The tone of sacrifice was taken also by the United States Surgeon General, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, during an address at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. She challenged the 136 graduating medical students to follow the example of the legal profession in providing services to the poor.
Dr. Elders said medical attention was a basic right, no less than legal aid, in a comment that drew applause from the 48 men and 88 women who had taken the Hippocratic Oath hours before.
"The only group of citizens in America that has a constitutional right to health care is our prisoners," she said. "We've got to make sure that we change that."
The medical school commencement was held in a soaking rain under tents in the chapel garden of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Washington Heights. It followed the large ceremony for all of Columbia's schools on the steps of the library on the Morningside Heights campus.
Seven honorary degrees were conferred in ceremonies at Columbia, including those given to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the United States Supreme Court and Betty Friedan, the feminist author.

 NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., May 19 (AP) -- Rutgers conferred nearly 10,000 degrees at its 228th commencement today, including an honorary degree for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
The university awarded 7,064 bachelor's degrees and 2,928 graduate degrees at ceremonies in the Louis Brown Athletic Center on the school's Livingston College campus.
While the university held the campuswide ceremony at the athletic center, actual diplomas were handed out at separate convocations held by each college.
Speakers at those ceremonies included Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who told the 2,058 graduates of Rutgers College that they were making a transformation to life after college at the same time the United States made a transformation to deal with a new world.
Other speakers included the ABC News correspondent Morton Dean, who spoke to the 843 graduates of Livingston College, and the jazz pianist Billy Taylor, who addressed the 65 graduating seniors and 59 master's degree candidates of the Mason Gross School of the Arts.
The Rutgers president, Francis Lawrence, also presented an honorary doctor of science degree to Robert M. Solow, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics in 1987. Honorary doctor of humane letters degrees were conferred upon Charlayne Hunter-Gault, national correspondent for the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour; Mort Pye, editor of The Star-Ledger of Newark, and Alvin J.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler to Raise Dividend and Finance Pensions

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 19

 BODY:
Flush with record earnings and anticipating further growth in the North American auto market, the Chrysler Corporation announced today that it would raise its quarterly dividend by a nickel a share, to 25 cents, and that it would fully finance its pensions by the end of the year.
If Chrysler makes good on its vow to set aside the money required to meet its obligations for current and future retirees, it will be the first time in its history that the No. 3 auto maker has fully financed its pension plan. 
 Today's announcement on the dividend gives Chrysler shareholders their second dividend increase in six months. In December, Chrysler raised the dividend to its current level from 15 cents, where it had been since Chrysler halved it during the grim days of 1991.
In a statement during the company's annual shareholders meeting today in Toledo, Ohio, Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said the company had not planned to act so quickly on the dividend or pensions. "But because of our strong cash flow and what looks like a continued strong auto market and general economy, we believe these actions are warranted," he said.
 Moody's Investor's Service, which monitors the long-term health of companies, responded to Chrysler's pension announcement by raising its rating of the company's senior debt and preferred stock. Moody's cited Chrysler's "conservative financial policy" and improving product mix as reasons for improving the rating. Moody's raised its rating on $17.5 billion of Chrysler senior debt two notches, to A3 from Baa2.
Investors were also pleased with the announcements, bidding up Chrysler stock on the New York Stock Exchange to a close of $47.125, up 62.5 cents a share, in active trading.
During its lean years, Chrysler fell behind on payments to its pension fund, until by the end of 1991 it owed $4.4 billion, the widest gap in the company's history. By the end of last year, it owed $2.2 billion.
To finance pensions fully this year, Chrysler plans to contribute $1.8 billion, on top of $700 million set aside in the first quarter. Previously, the company planned to contribute $600 million more in 1994, and to finance pensions fully by the end of 1995.
Chrysler's strong sales this year, which generated record earnings of $938 million on record revenues of $13.2 billion in the first quarter, appear to have given the company the confidence to make the additional investment. Mr. Eaton said Chrysler had $5.9 billion in cash after the first three months of the year, up from $4.5 billion at the end of 1993. He has set a goal of $7.5 billion in cash to protect Chrysler during the next downturn in the auto market, which many analysts predict will come after 1996.
"Chrysler has never been in such a strong financial position as it is today," Mr. Eaton said.
In its lean years, Chrysler fell behind in setting aside money for its pension plans. While the Ford Motor Company's pensions are fully financed, the General Motors Corporation estimated that it owed $22.3 billion at the end of 1993. Since then, G.M. has set aside $1.9 billion, and it is awaiting Federal approval to contribute $10 billion in cash and stock by October 1995.
The dividend announced today will be payable on July 15, to shareholders of record as of June 15, Chrysler said. Last month, Ford bolstered its quarterly dividend 12.5 percent, to 45 cents a share. G.M. pays 20 cents a common share, down from 40 cents in the third quarter of 1992.

HEADLINE: Bank Takes Giuliani Incentives To Keep Workers in New York

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that Republic National Bank of New York, the banking subsidiary of the nation's 20th-largest bank holding company, had accepted $6.4 million in incentives to remain in New York City and was canceling plans to move 900 workers to New Jersey.
Under the agreement, the Giuliani administration will help the bank by issuing bonds to finance construction of a $55 million, 232,000-square-foot addition to its midtown Manhattan headquarters at Fifth Avenue at West 40th Street and to finance a $23 million renovation of its data center at 1 West 39th Street. 
 City officials said they would also waive the sales tax on $6.4 million in machinery and equipment that the company will buy in connection with its expansion.
At a news conference at City Hall, Walter H. Weiner, Republic's chairman and chief executive, said that the package meant the bank would keep 900 data center workers in New York City and that the expansion would enable the bank to hire another 200 workers.
The agreement represented the first incentive package negotiated with a major corporation in the five months since Mr. Giuliani took office. During the mayoral campaign, Mr. Giuliani often criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins for losing too many battles to keep companies in the city.
The package offered fewer incentives than some of the deals reached in recent years, including the $32 million in incentives accepted in October by Kidder, Peabody & Company, the Wall Street firm, to move its headquarters from Lower Manhattan to Rockefeller Center. Under another deal two years ago, Morgan Stanley & Company, which had threatened to move to New Jersey or Connecticut, accepted an incentive package worth $39.6 million to remain in New York.
Mr. Weiner declined to comment on where in New Jersey the company had considered relocating. But he said the company had finally decided to remain in New York City because of "the efficiency of keeping our operation in one place."
The decision to remain in New York City was based in part "on the continuing improvement in atmosphere," he said, particularly since Mr. Giuliani's election.
"It's an atmosphere that makes businesses more comfortable," he said. "We feel more comfortable here."
The bonds, issued by the city Industrial Development Agency, will allow Republic to pay lower interest payments over the 15-year period of the agreement because it will exempt the company from paying taxes on interest to the city and the state.
"We provide the vehicle to get lower interest rates, but it doesn't cost the city any money do it outside of the administrative costs," said John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. "And we actually ask people like Republic to help subsidize that. So in the end it really doesn't cost the city anything. But they get a very significant savings in the cost of interest."

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Reaches Into Impoverished Albania

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, May 19

 BODY:
Dirt-poor Albania has hardly an economy to speak of, but as of today it has Coke.
The average wage is less than $30 a month. Its main export is its unemployed, with an estimated 300,000 Albanians working abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy, and sending money home. 
 But today, in a lush field outside the capital, President Sali Berisha joined Coca-Cola executives from the United States and Italy to cut a red and white ribbon that opened a $10 million Coca-Cola bottling plant, the first major foreign investment in the country and another step in Coca-Cola's march into formerly Communist, now liberated, Eastern Europe.
"It might not be what they need the most," said Hans Christian Jacobsen, a food industry expert with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, who attended the opening today, "but it has symbolic value to create awareness that Albania is still here."
 
Coca-Cola's Shrinking Globe
 Albania becomes the 197th country where Coca-Cola is made, leaving only a handful of blank spots on the Coca-Cola globe, most notably Libya, Iraq, Cuba and North Korea, where the soft drink remains banned.
But for some of Albania's struggling 3.3 million people, the reinforced-concrete factory gleaming under sunny skies resembled a Martian spacecraft landed amid the country's pervasive poverty and shimmered like light at the end of the tunnel.
"This is a country where only three years ago foreign investment was forbidden by law, and foreign investors were considered agents of treason," Dr. Berisha, a cardiologist, said before the ribbon ceremony.
"It's a real symbol of the deep changes that have taken place in Albania in the last two years."
Dr. Berisha later pressed a button, and bottling machines shook and hissed while young Albanians clad in red T-shirts emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo scurried about loading bottles or shouted orders at each other.
The factory is a joint venture involving the development bank, Coca-Cola, an Albanian company called Invest P.F. that is affiliated with the Ministry for Foodstuffs and Italy's Busi Group, the largest franchised bottler of Coca-Cola in Italy. The factory will have the capacity to turn out 24,000 bottles of Coke an hour and will provide jobs directly for about 100 Albanians and indirectly for another 400 to 500, like truck drivers or distributors.
"It's a completely different experience, in every sense," said Lalo Idlir, a 33-year old mechanical engineer who joined Coca-Cola three months ago. "The organization, the discipline, the manner of working, the technology -- it's a totally new experience."
Mr. Idlir guessed that Albanians, who traditionally drink beer or wine with their meals and consume enormous quantities of clear white raki, a potent grape brandy, would snap up Coke.
Fatbardh Ganai, a 40-year-old engineer who worked for 12 years at the Government's Institute for Food Research before joining the factory, said the jobs there were prized. "We get about twice what you'd make outside," he said, casting nervous glances at the rattling line of six-ounce refillable bottles.
At current wage levels outside the Coca-Cola plant, an Albanian would have to work about an hour and a half to buy a bottle, which costs 25 lek, or about 25 cents.
Mr. Ganai tasted cheap imitations of Coca-Cola brought in from Greece about three years ago, "but there's no comparison with the real thing," he said.
 
A Media Event
 Coca-Cola celebrated the plant opening with a media event, chartering an Alitalia jetliner to haul 38 reporters and eight television crews into Tirana's scruffy airport.
Coca-Cola officials stressed their commitment to rebuilding Albania, which United Nations officials have classified a "least developed nation," the only one in Europe.
E. Neville Isdell, senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Export Corporation, said Coke was "doing more than opening a bottle plant."
"This is the crucial first step in building a strong, thriving, world-class business system," he said.
The Stalinist totalitarian regime that ruled Albania since 1944 fell apart several years ago with the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. Albania was in chaos until the elections of March 1992, which the Democratic Party of Dr. Berisha won in a landslide.
His Government has been committed to shock therapy, and today Dr. Berisha boasted of its achievements to reporters. Inflation, he said, fell to 30 percent last year from 400 percent two years ago, and is projected to drop below 20 percent this year.
Albanians bought 50,000 new cars last year, he said, and installed 30,000 satellite dishes, a revolution in a country whose old Communist leadership allowed Albanians virtually no access to outside information.
In downtown Tirana, traffic is bustling and boutiques and snack bars are sprouting. Everywhere, big gray satellite dishes have been affixed to crumbling apartment blocks.
Foreign officials like Mr. Jacobsen agreed that projects like the Coca-Cola plant served a useful function, galvanizing local efforts to transform the economy.
According to the Government, foreign investors have committed $290 million to Albania, more than 50 percent of it from Italy, and the figure is expected to double this year. But little of the investment money has flowed in yet.
Muhtar A. Kent, the 41-year-old president of Coca-Cola East Central Europe, said the company expected a positive cash flow in Albania "very soon," perhaps within 18 months. The capital, he said, would be plowed back into more trucks, equipment and retailing capability.
Mr. Isdell said Coca-Cola's success in Eastern Europe was based on pent-up desire for the symbols of the West.
"We're all about refreshing people around the world," he said. "That's what we do."

HEADLINE: Clarkstown Court Loss May Bring Trash War

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CLARKSTOWN, N.Y., May 19

 BODY:
Charles Holbrook says garbage has been the hallmark of his tenure as supervisor of this Rockland County town.
In nine years, he has presided over the state's forced closure of Clarktown's dump, an anxious moment when it seemed no one would take the town's garbage, the establishment of a lucrative recycling program and the curious turn of events when garbage haulers and the town began competing for trash. 
 Now, national attention has been drawn to the trash of Clarkstown, a town located at the western end of the Tappan Zee Bridge.
On Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down Clarkstown's "flow control" law, which required that all garbage collected here be taken to the town's transfer station, rather than landfills elsewhere that might charge lower rates. The law, like others throughout the country, was intended to insure an adequate volume of garbage to make the transfer station economically viable.
 
From Trash, a Fight
 "From that residue," Mr. Holbrook said, pointing to a heap on the transfer station's floor, "we went to a nationwide fight on garbage. Who would have ever thought we'd fight about this."
Mr. Holbrook's struggles mirror battles throughout the region, and the Supreme Court ruling has left many towns wondering how much the new free-market garbage economy might cost them. So far, no one is willing to speculate on how the decision will affect the average homeowner.
But in states like Connecticut, which has floated $1 billion in bonds since the late 1980's to create five waste-to-energy plants, six landfills, 18 transfer stations and three recycling centers, the cost of competing for garbage might be considerable.
"Connecticut is probably affected more than any state in the union," said William R. Darcy, president of the state's Resources Recovery Authority, who estimated that 86 percent of Connecticut's garbage now goes to its waste-to-energy plants. "Residential pickup is usually done by the towns anyway, so that should stay the same. But the commercial and industrial sector now has the opportunity to go to out of state landfills."
 
A Bidding War for Trash?
 About half of Connecticut's three million tons of garbage a year is commercial waste which could, under the Supreme Court ruling, be trucked out of state by haulers who can beat the local price. The Hartford waste-to-energy plant now charges $51 a ton, but the one near Danbury charges $78 a ton.
In New Jersey, officials say the ruling will have no impact, saying that their "flow control" laws are so different from Clarkstown's as to be unaffected. That position is viewed skeptically by both Mr. Holbrook and Mr. Darcy. However, New Jersey has informed the state's garbage haulers that, until the courts say differently, the New Jersey law is valid and will be enforced.
Nationwide, 27 states have "flow control" laws allowing municipalities to require that all garbage be taken to a government-owned center for processing. Clarkstown's law was challenged by the C. & A. Carbone carting company of Nyack.
Under pressure from the state to close its town dump, Clarkstown, in 1990, contracted with a private company, Clarkstown Recycling, to build a transfer station. At the station, all of Clarkstown's non-recyclable trash was sorted and baled and reloaded onto trucks and shipped to a landfill or incinerator at a cost of $81 a ton. The town has a contract that guarantees Clarkstown Recycling 120,000 tons a year of garbage. If less than that is delivered, the town is required to make up the difference.
 
Court Leaves an Opening
 C. & A. Carbone sued the town, saying that it could dump commercial garbage at a lower rate out of state.
The Supreme Court struck down the Clarkstown law by a 6-3 vote, citing its interference in interstate commerce, but it left open the door for Congress to enact a Federal law allowing flow control.
Mr. Holbrook thinks the decision will have little impact here.
Unlike communities that have huge debts to repay on expensive projects like incinerators, Clarkstown's transfer station, a relatively simple corrugated steel structure, will be paid off by the end of 1995, when the town's contract with Clarkstown Recycling will elapse.
 
Concern and Consternation
 But elsewhere, there is consternation.
"The Federal Government encouraged this," Mr. Darcy, of Connecticut, said. "All of these facilities were built in the belief that these laws were legal." He said Congress must now act "so that their increasingly strict mandates, on recycling and solid waste, are implemented."
Some environmentalists are also concerned about the impact of the ruling.
"It's going to make the financing of projects, particularly recycling projects, more costly," said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist with the National Resources Defense Council.
But for all the jitters among government officials, garbage haulers have hailed the Supreme Court decision as a victory for consumers.
"The moment you have a monopoly, you lose efficiency," said Kenneth H. Resnik, the lawyer for C. & A. Carbone. "Now that you have no monopoly, prices will go down. Flow-control laws led to a kind of toll-booth operation that only drove prices up."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap With Japan Widens as Talks Start

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
As new data today showed America's trade deficit with Japan soaring, American and Japanese officials held talks to see whether they could revive their moribund negotiations for gaining more access to closed Japanese markets.
The talks extended late into the evening and were not expected to conclude until Friday morning. Late today, however, an official involved in the talks said that the Japanese side had come with "detailed, serious proposals" that the American side felt were worth exploring. 
 But officials cautioned that it was still too soon to say whether the Japanese overture would provide enough of an incentive for the Clinton Administration to resume full-scale trade negotiations with Japan. The American side does not want to restart the talks only to have them fail again, or to provide political help to a weak Japanese Government without producing any breakthrough.

 As the negotiators sat down at the table, the Commerce Department reported a 25 percent jump in the American trade deficit with Japan in March. The deficit ballooned to $5.8 billion in March from $4.63 billion in February, making it the third-biggest monthly trade deficit with Japan on record. There was also good news in the figures: The nation's trade deficit with all nations shrank as American exports grew.
Deputy Trade Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi of Japan spent the day closeted with the White House trade experts W. Bowman Cutter and Charlene Barshefsky, trying to hammer out language that would entice both sides to resume the negotiations that were broken off Feb. 11.
Before the negotiations started, a senior American trade official said that the "magic words" the White House wanted to hear from the Japanese side were that Japan would accept an overall goal of "increased access and sales" for foreign companies to five relatively closed sectors. Those are autos, auto parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance.
Since the negotiations began last July, the Japanese have resisted committing to that specific goal, or to the numerical indicators that the American side has demanded as proof that Japan really is meeting that goal. The Japanese came to Washington with new language meant to address American concerns on both of these points, American officials said.
 
Differences in Economies
 One big reason for the rising deficit with Japan is that the American economy has been very strong -- pulling in imports from all over the world -- while the Japanese economy is just climbing out of recession and the leadership there has been reluctant to cut taxes and engage in measures that could stimulate consumer demand.
Hidden in these overall trade numbers, though, was some good news. While it is true that American imports from Japan grew 10.5 percent in March, American exports to Japan grew by 7.5 percent. That is well above the world average for American export growth, which is about 5 percent this year. In other words, Japan is buying more from the United States, but the problem is that the surging American economy is buying even more from Japan.
The American trade deficit for goods and services with all nations shrank to $7.5 billion in March from $9.2 billion in February. American exports registered increases in virtually every category of manufactured products, capital goods, aircraft, consumer goods, agricultural products and services.
 
Japan Asked for Meeting
 It was the Japanese who asked for today's meeting with Clinton officials to see if there was some basis for restarting the negotiations aimed at opening Japanese markets. The United States broke off the negotiations when Japan refused to accept that the goal of the talks should be increased access and sales by foreigners to designated markets, with numerical indicators that would prove whether Japan was really living up to that commitment.
American officials were wary about re-engaging with the Japanese. They believe that the fragile new Government in Tokyo, led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is eager to show some progress in dealing with the Americans to demonstrate to the Japanese electorate and Parliament that it is taken seriously abroad and can manage the relationship with the United States. In addition, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan are scheduled to visit Washington on June 10 and the Japanese are anxious not to have trade tensions sour their stay in the United States.
But the questions American officials have been asking themselves are: Do the Japanese want a deal or do they want a conversation? Do they want progress or do they want a photo opportunity that will make it appear that tensions are being resolved without any substantive movement?

Prices of Bonds Rise, Tracking Dollar's Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields of Treasury securities declined modestly yesterday, despite rising commodity prices that threatened to reignite inflation worries among some investors only days after the Fed moved to calm those fears.
In a seesaw session, the bond market managed to erase morning losses after the release of new trade data, rebounding in sync with the dollar amid reports that the Fed was buying intermediate Treasury securities for the accounts of foreign central banks. 
 Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said: "In general, you couldn't point to anything specific behind the market's move, but when the dollar recouped so did the market. Rumors of the Fed being in the market buying securities for customer accounts gave bond prices an added boost."
 
 
'A Level Field'
 It is not unusual for the Fed to make purchases in the market for customer accounts. Foreign central banks often have the Fed do such buying for them after they have intervened in the currency market and ended up with a lot of dollars, as happened after recent moves by the United States and its allies to support the sagging dollar.
Analysts note that the market has been trading well since Tuesday's half-point increase in short-term interest rates. The reason, they say, is that the move removed all uncertainty about the Fed's intentions. "Everyone is now playing on a level field," Mr. Alexy said. "The cash that has accumulated over several months is now being put to work."
The market largely overlooked the nearly two-point rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index of commodities, because soaring coffee and soybean prices have been the primary driving force. But analysts say the strong rise in the index could be a red warning flag for bonds, since the index is regarded as a harbinger of future price pressures.
 
Lower Trade Deficit
 Yields initially rose after a Government report showed that imports and exports jumped in March, a confirmation that the economy was still doing well. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit in goods and services fell to $7.5 billion, compared with a revised gap of $9.2 billion in February, orignally reported as $9.7 billion. Economists had expected an $8.4 billion gap in March.
 Exports rose to $58.33 billion from $53.24 billion, and imports rose to $65.79 billion from $62.39 billion.
Both exports and imports sharply outpaced market estimates. It was the surge in exports that narrowed the trade gap more than expected. The data also showed that while the overall gap had narrowed, the nation's trade deficit with Japan widened sharply, by 25 percent.
By the close of the New York cash market, the 30-year bond was up 16/32 , to 886/32 , for a yield of 7.23 percent, down from 7.27 percent on Wednesday. Outstanding two-year notes, which were thought to be among the maturities being bought by the Fed, saw yields drop 6 basis points, to 5.71 percent, while a 10-year maturity dropped 7 basis points, to 6.94 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auctions, the new two-year issue was yielding 5.77 percent, an improvement from the 5.84 percent on Wednesday. The five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.53 percent, down from 6.61 percent.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that unemployment claims fell 14,000 last week to 367,000. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had predicted that claims would drop by 24,000.
Also released was the Philadelphia Fed index, which rose to 14.8 in May from 11.6 in April, in line with many expectations. The report of regional business activity showed the prices-paid index retreating slightly to 27.4, after surging to 33.1 in the previous month, and the prices received index rising to 12.1 from 6.4. Employment fell to 2.0 from 11.1. Analysts said the prices paid and employment subindexes were slightly positive for bonds. "However, most of the data just canceled each other," Mr. Alexy said.

HEADLINE: 2 Exchanges Set Uncovered Short Sales Records

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Continued volatility in financial markets encouraged those betting that stock prices will fall, as short-selling activity climbed again in the month ended May 6, the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange reported yesterday.
The Big Board reported that the number of shares borrowed and sold short, but not yet covered by repurchasing the shares, rose 6 percent, to a record 1.48 billion shares, surpassing the previous record 1.39 billion shares set the previous month.
Meanwhile, the Amex reported that short interest rose 1 percent, to a record 113.76 million shares, from 112.55 million in the period ended in mid-April. 
 The increases came as the stock market remained vulnerable to rising interest rates. The figures cover trades settled May 13, which means those transacted a week earlier.
 
A Steady March Higher
 Short interest has been rising for well over a year, but proved a largely unprofitable strategy as long as leading market indexes were marching to record highs. While there are several reasons someone might sell a stock short, the most common is the expectation that the stock's price will fall.
Over the last few months, those expectations have begun to be realized, in large part as a result of sharply rising interest rates.
"Through the end of April, the shorts were up an average of 7.1 percent," said Harry Strunk, a Palm Beach, Fla. investment consultant who tracks the performance of short- sellers. "That is the best four-month period they have had since 1990."
Shorting a stock is the flip side of buying a security in the hope it will go up; a short-seller borrows shares, sells them and later buys them back to return to the original owner. If the share price has dropped in the meantime, the short-seller makes a profit.
Traditionally, a high short-interest level indicates that many investors are bearish on the markets. But some analysts say that big short-interest positions are a positive sign, because the short-sellers will eventually have to buy shares.
 
Motorola Short Sales Jump
 High-technology companies have been a favorite of short-sellers. Last month, Motorola Inc. showed the biggest increase in short positions. Short interest in Motorola shares nearly doubled from the previous month, to 12.28 million shares.
For the second straight month, the largest short-interest position was in RJR Nabisco. The company is trying to put a new financing plan in place. Short interest in the stock rose to 40.69 million shares, from 36.63 million the previous month.

Crude Oil Tops $18 a Barrel; Coffee Reaches 5-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose above $18 a barrel yesterday amid perceptions that falling stockpiles in the Midwest would mean a shortage of crude available for delivery against the New York Mercantile Exchange's June contract.
Coffee rose to a five-year high as rain caused floods on the Indonesian island of Java, and cotton rose as much as is permitted in a day amid speculation that China or Pakistan would buy more United States cotton. 
 The increases helped to push the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities up 1.45, to 232.43, the highest level since October 1990. The index is a closely watched gauge of inflation.
Today is the last trading day for West Texas intermediate crude oil to be delivered in June. Stockpiles in the Midwest, which includes Cushing, Okla., where crude is delivered, fell last week and are 10.8 percent below a year ago.
Midwest stockpiles "are down significantly from a year earlier," said Elaine Levin, a trader with Smith Barney Shearson. "With the contract expiring tomorrow," she said, traders are eager to secure supplies.
Crude oil for June delivery rose 46 cents a barrel, to $18.45 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while unleaded gasoline rose 0.76 cent a gallon, to 52.08 cents, and heating oil rose 0.16 cent, to 47.86 cents. Natural gas gained 1.4 cents, to $1.957 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Strong demand from refiners who need to make gasoline for the summer driving season is lowering the stockpiles, Ms. Levin said.
"These runs have just been chugging along," she said. Refineries were running above 95 percent of capacity last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
Coffee soared to a five-year high, as concerns grew about falling supplies from Indonesia, Brazil and Colombia, the three largest producers.
Coffee for July delivery gained 7.60 cents a pound, to $1.3255, extending a rally this month on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York that has sent coffee prices up 49 percent.
Brazil's crop is expected to fall 18 percent from last year, according to United States Department of Agriculture estimates, and Colombia's crop will also be reduced by worm infestation. Heavy rains on the island of Java, Indonesia's largest coffee-producing region, are hampering the harvest there and could damage coffee trees.
Cotton prices rose their daily limit, settling just below a three-year high, on speculation that China would buy more American cotton. July cotton rose 2 cents, to 82.65 cents a pound.
Traders speculated that a report on export sales from the Agriculture Department would show either China or Pakistan buying more American cotton. The report, which was issued after trading ended, did not any show sales to China or Pakistan.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
License for Torture

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Finally and with startling clarity, the Chinese Communist dictatorship is sending its core message to the United States: Nationwide repression by arrest of dissenters will not only continue but widen.
By June 3, President Clinton will decide whether to live up to his executive order to remove China's low-tariff privileges unless it makes significant progress toward giving the Chinese and Tibetan people some relief from such instruments of government as political arrests, forced labor and torture boards. 
 No longer is there any possible doubt that the Communists have failed to do that -- and will not unless economic pressure is applied. The Communist regime is working with some American officials and businessmen to dredge up a few fringe human rights crumbs that Mr. Clinton can call "progress" if he decides to betray his word and the cause of human rights.
But Beijing is increasingly terrified of human rights. It is increasingly unsure of its hold on the Chinese people. It is increasingly fearful of them. Now it tells diplomats and American business executives that the right to dissent without being arrested would bring instability.
To dictatorships, "instability" is a synonym for weakening their police-terror control in any way.
So even as it makes a public-relations release of a prisoner or two, Beijing carries out more political arrests. And at least 500 political prisoners, previously unknown to the West, have been added to the list of thousands of others, by Human Rights Watch/Asia. In China, of course, arrest means electric shock, iron rods, floggings and deprivation of food, visits and shower water.
In its renewed insistence on smashing dissidence and dissidents, Beijing demolishes the arguments of the U.S. China-trade lobby and its servants in Congress, the Treasury, the National Economic Council and the Commerce Department. These fellows campaign openly against the President's own human rights policy. He does not shut them up.
For years now the China lobby has been peddling the line that economic growth in China would bring political liberty. That propaganda is a perversion of history, an insult to all who died under Hitler and Japan's dictatorship during their economic surge.
The lobby preaches also that removing low-tariff privileges will somehow hurt the U.S. more than China. But as the deadline approaches, Beijing itself drops that economic bluster and admits its fear of losing those privileges. Thanks to the low tariffs and to slave-wage labor costs, China has built a $30 billion annual trade advantage over Uncle Sucker.
Billions of that export profit come from products made in the factories and prisons of the Chinese Army -- rifles and assault weapons by the boatload, plus furniture, toys, tools, machinery. Other forced-labor prisons export pumps, carpets, clothes, machinery -- dozens of products undercutting American labor.
China lobby propaganda about Great China slamming its market shut on America is ludicrous. That market sells us four times as much as it buys and would keep exporting even with higher tariffs.
The lobby's little secret is that the Chinese Communists have shown themselves susceptible to economic pressure -- so important to them is their huge rake-in from the U.S. and American investment.
Revocation of low tariffs stands much greater chance of freeing prisoners chained to torture boards than have the fruitless years of American appeasement.
Some members of Congress have surrendered to the lobby, become defectors from the human rights cause they once backed. But a strong group of human rights supporters remains -- people like Representatives David E. Bonior of Michigan, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Tom Lantos of California, Frank Wolf of New Jersey and, of course, San Francisco's gift to America and the people in the prison cells, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and supporter of Mr. Clinton.
"I still believe in Hope," she says.
If Mr. Clinton does walk out on his executive order or weasels it down to a mockery, he will be giving the Chinese Communists the special license they now ask for:
A license for more repression, more arrests, more torture cells, all handsomely subsidized by the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Clinton Spells Out Reasons He Might Use Force in Haiti

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
President Clinton today offered the clearest explanation yet of why his Administration is considering the use of military force in Haiti while resisting it elsewhere in the world.
"It's in our backyard," the President said at a White House news conference as he ticked off the first in a list of six reasons why he is weighing military action to oust Haiti's leaders if economic sanctions do not force them to step down. 
 He said Haiti's proximity to the United States and the danger that more of its citizens could seek refuge in southern Florida meant that his Administration had an obligation to promote an end to the military dictatorship there.
Mr. Clinton's comments, in response to a question at a joint appearance with India's Prime Minister, also represented a response to Republican critics who say it would be wrong to risk American lives to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
With a tighter United Nations embargo on Haiti to take effect at midnight on Saturday, aides to Mr. Clinton emphasized that no American military action there was imminent. After facing criticism on past occasions in which the Administration has appeared to back away from tough talk on Bosnia, the aides said no decision on whether to use military force in Haiti would be made until the sanctions have been given time to work.
But with opinion polls showing mounting public dissatisfaction with his conduct of foreign policy, the aides say that Mr. Clinton has grown concerned that he has failed to cast the challenges he faces in proper context and that, in particular, he has not adequately explained why his Administration is suddenly devoting so much attention to Haiti after 32 months of military tyranny there.
A senior White House official, who said Mr. Clinton had planned his answer, described it as part of an effort to build public support for military action in Haiti that would allow him to act even if other countries remained opposed to such a mission.
Among the six reasons Mr. Clinton mentioned today as adding up to a "significant" American interest in restoring democracy to Haiti were its proximity and the fact that Haiti had been used as a staging area for drug shipments bound for the United States. In addition, he said Haiti was now the only country in the Western Hemisphere where military leaders have seized power from an elected leader, making it and Cuba the hemisphere's only remaining non-democracies.
 
'Massive Outflow' Feared
 He also mentioned the several thousand Americans who live in Haiti and the one million Haitian-Americans who live in the United States as reasons Americans should be intent on restoring democracy there.
But Mr. Clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as "the continuous possibility" that Haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a "massive outflow" and seek refuge in the United States.
Mr. Clinton spoke after a meeting with Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of India on a day in which he devoted unusual attention to security issues. He had back-to-back meetings with his top foreign policy advisers and with American military commanders from around the globe.
His meeting with Mr. Rao was the first between an American President and an Indian Prime Minister in seven years, a lag emblematic of the uneasiness between the two countries after successive Administrations have spoken disapprovingly of India's human rights record and its development of nuclear weapons.
 
Protest March Over Kashmir
 Outside the White House today, hundreds marched in opposition to India's policies in Kashmir and other northern regions, and Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the United States and India still had differences over human rights and the spread of nuclear weapons.
But the President praised India for having overcome internal strife and remaining the world's second largest democracy, and he said of the disagreements that "in the context of our common interests and our common values, we believe they can be managed in a constructive way."
The yearlong American standoff with North Korea over nuclear weapons still has the potential to become the Administration's biggest foreign policy crisis. But Mr. Clinton and his aides have made clear in recent weeks that they are looking with more impatience at the intransigence of Haiti's military leaders, who seized power in September 1991 from Father Aristide, the democratically elected President, and have refused since last fall to honor an agreement in which they pledged to step down.
The strict United Nations sanctions that are to be imposed on Saturday represent a new effort by the United States and other powers to force Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his fellow commanders from power. But the President has been forthright in saying he would consider using military force to oust them if the sanctions fail, and Administration officials say the misery the embargo may inflict means that the White House could reach that point of decision as soon as this time next month.
 
'Time for Them to Go'
 Mr. Clinton said recently of the military commanders that "it's time for them to go," and aides have described him in recent weeks as increasingly determined to see democracy restored.
The President's new special adviser on Haiti, William Gray, held a well-publicized meeting here today with Father Aristide in a sign of the White House's commitment to stepping up its efforts on his behalf.
Asked today why he appeared to be putting Haiti in a different category from Bosnia and Rwanda, where he has ruled out putting United States forces in ground combat roles, Mr. Clinton said he was not prepared "to discuss hypothetical uses of force." But he went on to make clear that he believed that the American interests in Haiti set that country apart from more distant trouble spots.
His remarks seemed intended in part as an answer to critics like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, who this week said an American invasion of Haiti "would be the wrong act at the wrong time for the wrong reason." Senator Dole and other Republicans have called on Mr. Clinton to seek a compromise with Haiti's military leaders that would restore democracy without providing for Father Aristide's return, but that is a step the White House has been unwilling to take.

HEADLINE: Severance Begins to Take Its Toll;
As New York City Workers Depart, Agencies Juggle Needs

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
With thousands of city workers leaving their jobs today, signs have been posted on the doors of the Parking Violations Bureau's Manhattan center warning motorists fighting parking tickets that next week the office will cut its hours, opening later and shutting earlier.
The City Health Department is bracing to lose 3 of its 10 pharmacists who man the Poison Control bureau 24 hours a day, dispensing such information as what to do if a child has just swallowed bleach. At the Parks Department, one of three specialists who restore and maintain the city's 700 monuments will be departing.
 
4,800 to Leave Today
 And at the small Conflicts of Interest Board, which is charged with monitoring the ethics of more than 200,000 government employees, the only attorney charged with enforcement will be leaving. 
 Across the city's vast municipal landscape, it was easy to find the signs of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's effort to pare the city work force. Today, 4,800 workers are scheduled to clean out their desks, the first to leave under Mr. Giuliani's offer of a severance package to cajole 6,800 off the payroll.
As the deadline approached, managers have spent the last few weeks trying to juggle workers, rearrange priorities and assess needs in an effort to do more with less. But how successful they will be remains in question.
Many commissioners say much will depend on how well and how quickly the administration is able to redeploy people from less critical jobs into crucial ones and how adaptable employees are to new work in different fields.
"There's going to be a transition period," said Abraham M. Lackman, the city budget director. "Will redeployment work? That's the great unknown."
The severance program marks the first phase of Mr. Giuliani's larger plan to pare 15,000 employees, or 7 percent of the municipal work force, from the payroll by July 1995, through severance and attrition. So far Mr. Giuliani has declined to spell out how the cuts will affect government services.
"The reason that we can't predict for you where the effects on services will take place is that I am asking the people who manage New York City to manage it more effectively," he said when he announced his budget on May 10. "I am asking people for something revolutionary, to work a little harder."
Outside the government, others were skeptical about how the redeployment process would work. "It's either Russian roulette or musical chairs, and where everyone ends up, nobody knows," said Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "This is a city government that has a tough time doing its job when everyone stays in the same place."
The employees who are departing range from clerical workers to senior employees with highly specialized skills, from computer specialists to social workers with years of experience. Their ranks include essential workers and scores of employees whom managers say they will not be sorry to see leave. About another 2,000 workers will be leaving on June 3, bringing the work-force reduction to near 6,800.
 
Waiting for Replacements
 For the last week, senior city officials have held back-to-back two-hour meetings with the commissioners of 26 senior agencies, trying to avert problems as crucial employees walk out the door. Donna Lynne, the director of the Mayor's Office of Operations, said that about 100 employees, set to leave today or on June 3, were asked to stay on until no later than July 15 so that replacements can be found.
One of them is the only employee in the Community Development Agency who knows how the antipoverty agency's 20-year-old computer system functions. Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the agency's commissioner, said she had been greatly relieved when the employee agreed to stay. "It can only work if the employee agrees to it, and this employee does agree to it, thank heavens,"she said.
In creating its severance offer, the administration prohibited uniformed officers like police, firefighters and sanitation workers from applying and also excluded engineers and scientists judged as essential employees. It created goals for individual agencies, but beyond that the program was uncontrolled, leaving uncertain which workers would opt to leave, lured by cash packages ranging from $3,500 to $25,000 or a year's pay. The packages also provide health benefits for nine months and leave the workers eligible for unemployment compensation.
 
Some Agencies Hit Hard
 The result has been that some agencies have been hit harder than had been desired. The Health Department, for example, had so many unfilled vacancies in its roster that it needed to lose only 55 employees to meet a staff reduction goal set by the Mayor. But 296 people applied for the buyout. The Commissioner, Margaret A. Hamburg, said some of the employees leaving have such specialized skills that the department will have to look outside the city government to hire replacements. Redeployment of existing employees will not fill the gap, she said.
"It's sort of ironic," Ms. Hamburg said. "We're paying people to leave only to rehire to fill those jobs."
Other agencies like the Transportation Department fell far short of their severance goals. Elliot G. Sander, the Transportation Commissioner, said only 335 people in his department had decided to quit, well below the target of 935. In addition, he said, many of those who took the severance packages do not work in the areas that the Mayor's budget had slated for consolidation or reductions.
Because of such discrepancies, administration officials have designated such agencies as the Transportation Department, the Human Resources Administration and the Homeless Services Department as "donors," agencies that will be called on to offer surplus workers to other agencies. The administration is aiming to carry out the redeployment over the next six weeks to two months.
 
Complicated Procedures
 But the redeployment procedures the Giuliani administration negotiated with the municipal unions are complicated. The administration agreed to begin by asking for volunteers to switch agencies. Then it must move workers, starting with those with the least seniority.
Besides adhering to the redeployment agreement negotiated with the unions, the administration must also adhere to existing Civil Service rules. If Civil Service lists of potential candidates already exist for certain jobs, hiring must be done from the lists. "It will certainly be," Ms. Lynne paused, "the word we're using in the administration now is challenging."
Ms. Lynne said that commissioners will not be able to screen and reject employees sent to them through redeployment. She admitted that some of the commissioners were not pleased to learn that.
In the meantime, city agencies will be struggling to make do. At the Conflicts of Interest Board, Mark L. Davies, the executive director, pointed out that the severance program, coming on top of past cuts and vacancies, had reduced his staff by a third. "Is there a commitment to ethics in city government or isn't there?" he asked. "The message we're getting right now is it just doesn't make that much difference."
At the Consumer Affairs Department, where 14 of 41 people are leaving the licensing division, Marc A. Wurzel, the department spokesman, said the agency would seek quick redeployment. "Thankfully all of our licenses don't come up at one time or we'd have lines wrapped around Wall Street," he said. He said that the Department is expected to take over some of the staff and functions of the Taxi and Limousine Commission in several months, which could bring in more employees to handle licensing. The department licenses 82 types of businesses and activities.
The Health Department averted an immediate staffing crisis in the Poison Control Bureau by persuading the three departing pharmacists to stay on past today until a backup system is in place. Ms. Hamburg said she would be using redeployed workers, overtime and resident fellows from the Bellevue Hospital Center to keep the bureau running 24-hours.
At the Human Resources Administration, about 75 of the 470 caseworkers in the Division of AIDS Services have taken severance. A senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the division, which helps AIDS patients wend their way through the city's social services bureaucracy, would "begin more of a triage approach to case management and deal with emergencies as they come up."
Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner, said he was losing 17 percent of his recreation workers who supervise activities at city playgrounds and recreation centers. Harking back to one of his predecessors, Robert Moses, Mr. Stern said, "In the two generations since Moses built them, hundreds of the city's playgrounds have lost what is practically all the staffing." He said he would be seeking more help from volunteers.
Mr. Stern was delighted, however that he had kept all three of the city's monument restorers from accepting severance. "All three were going and we persuaded two to stay," he said. "Two out of three ain't bad."

HEADLINE: Citing Progress, U.S. Plans New Talks With North Korea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Deciding that North Korea has met key United States demands on inspection of its nuclear program, the Clinton Administration decided today to resume high-level talks with the North Koreans, American officials said.
The decision was made at a White House meeting of top Administration officials this afternoon against a backdrop of rising concerns about nuclear efforts, officials said. 
 The United States previously held two rounds of high-level talks with the North Koreans. But it refused to hold a third round, at which a package of political and economic incentives was to be discussed, until the North Koreans agreed to Washington's initial inspection demands.
Explaining today's decision, an Administration official said that the International Atomic Energy Agency told Washington that North Korea has not diverted any of the fuel it recently removed from its reactor for nuclear weapons purposes.
North Korea, Administration officials said, also allowed agency monitors to complete a long-sought inspection of its plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon and to replace the film and batteries in cameras in the nuclear reactor there.
Administration officials acknowledged that there were still important differences between North Korea and the atomic energy agency. They said Washington was prepared to break off the talks if North Korea took steps that made it impossible for the atomic energy agency to conduct measurements of how much plutonium North Korea might have diverted in the past or otherwise impeded the agency's inspections.
The agency's assurance that the recently removed fuel was not being diverted was publicly disclosed today in a series of unusually explicit statements by top Administration officials. The statements appeared designed to counter the impression that North Korea was refusing to accept any constraints on its nuclear program.
Administration officials said that North Korea has not been informed of the new stance and that no date for the high-level talks has been set. The American delegation will be led by Robert Gallucci, an Assistant Secretary of State and the Clinton Administration's point man on North Korea.
Before that assurance was given, the Administration had been confronted by a quandry. On the one hand, Washington is eager to explore every diplomatic opportunity before trying to muster support for economic sanctions. On the other hand, the Administration does not want to be portrayed as weak, particularly in light of criticism that it has vacillated on foreign policy.
The problem was compounded last week when North Korea announced it was beginning to withdraw fuel rods from its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. That development worried Washington because the fuel, if reprocessed at North Korea's plutonium separation plant, could provided enough material for four or five nuclear bombs.
The pressure also intensified when Hans Blix, the director general of the atomic energy agency, sent a message describing the removal of the fuel as a serious violation of its agreement with North Korea.
But today, Administration officials took pains to describe the developments in less alarming terms.
One Administration official, who asked not be named, said that North Korea has removed about 5 percent of the 8,000 rods in its reactor and that they have been placed in special ponds that the atomic energy agency is allowed to monitor.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who has underscored the danger of allowing North Korea to proceed with its nuclear program, also played down the military significance of the move, describing the removal of the rods as a technical violation.
"The I.A.E.A., in fact, has told us that it is confident that there has been no diversion of the fuel that has just been discharged," Mr. Perry told reporters today.
 
No Irrevocable Steps
 Administration officials also said the North Koreans have not taken irrevocable steps that would prevent the atomic energy agency from conducting measurements of some of the rods.
The agency wants to analyze the spent fuel from the reactors to determine how long they have been in the reactor. That, in turn, would enable the agency to determine if North Korea has previously unloaded enough fuel from the reactor for one or two nuclear bombs, as the Central Intelligence Agency believes, or has simply withdrawn a small number of damaged fuel rods, as North Korea maintains.
To conduct the measurements, the agency wants to examine 300 of the rods from specific parts of the reactor. The agency has asked North Korea to either set aside the rods for inspections or leave them in the reactor so that the measurements might be carried out in the future.
So far, however, the North Koreans have rebuffed the agency's demands. But they have also not brought the dispute with the agency to a crisis by removing the rods that the agency wants to measure.
An Administration official said that if the North Koreans continue to remove the fuel at their current pace and according to their current procedures, it could take weeks before they remove the rods in question.
At the same time, Mr. Gallucci, the Administration's point man on the dispute, said the North Koreans have allowed international monitors to complete the inspections of the reprocessing plant that they had sought to carry out in March.
Administration officials described the North Korean moves as part of a perplexing pattern that has left Administration experts divided over whether Pyongyang is simply trying to drive a hard bargain in its negotiations with the Washington or is determined to build a nuclear arsenal.
"They are skirting right to the edge of the red line, but without crossing it," an Administration official said.
While Administration officials sought to portray their decision to proceed with the talks as a sober exploration of a diplomatic opening, it was likely to stir debate about whether Washington was being prudent or timid about North Korea.
Throughout its diplomatic dealings with Washington, North Korea has continued to work intensively on building a new larger reactor and on expanding its plutonium reprocessing capability.
There are other unanswered questions as well, including exactly what position the Administration will take in the talks.
Washington has offered to expand diplomatic and economic ties with Pyongyang if it agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But the Administration has not made clear exactly what incentives it plans to propose.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK SHIFTING FOCUS OF WELFARE TO JOB PLACEMENT

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 20

 BODY:
Having rejected many of the punitive measures embraced by other states, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo says New York State is trying to reduce welfare dependency by changing welfare offices into places that push applicants to find work instead of simply processing checks.
Governor Cuomo's "Jobs First" strategy, announced in an election year when his opponents are already making welfare a major issue, would direct welfare applicants into job training and job searches even before they are approved for welfare benefits. 
 Both state and local social services officials say Mr. Cuomo's approach would require a major change in the state's welfare bureaucracy, which historically has been preoccupied with determining eligibility.
For example, in Albany County, home of one early example of this new approach, some applicants who are able-bodied and childless must show evidence that they have applied for at least six jobs a week during the 45-day waiting period when eligibility for welfare benefits is determined. If they do not take proof of their contacts with employers to their caseworkers, they can be rejected for benefits.
The Cuomo administration is pressing other counties to impose similar requirements or to adopt other job-training and job-search programs that are being tested with some success in other parts of the state.
But state officials concede that there are many obstacles, especially in New York City, which has two-thirds of the state's welfare recipients, higher unemployment than in the rest of the state, and union rules that make it difficult to give welfare workers new responsibilities.
Mr. Cuomo is also seeking permission from the Federal Government to offer welfare applicants one-time grants, if such payments would help them stay employed. For instance, applicants could be given enough money to fix a car, or to hire a child-care worker, if such measures would eliminate obstacles to working.
Mr. Cuomo is offering his new approach at a time when measures have been gaining approval in other states to curtail benefits to discourage certain behavior or to pressure recipients to leave the rolls.
The Governor says New York will not place a two-year limit on welfare benefits, as Florida does. It will not deny increased benefits to mothers who have additional children, which is New Jersey's new policy. It will not eliminate its welfare program for able-bodied adults without children, as Michigan recently did. And unlike Oklahoma, which reduces welfare benefits for families whose children skip school, New York is proposing both to cut benefits in cases of chronic truancy and to increase them for good attendance.
Mr. Cuomo has scoffed at such sanctions, calling them counterproductive.
Just as Mr. Cuomo offers life without parole as an alternative to the death penalty, his approach to welfare gives him alternatives in both political and policy discussions.
The notion of transforming welfare offices into job-placement offices may seem like "a fanatical implementation of common sense," to use the words of Jane G. Lynch, a social services official from Monroe County. But welfare experts, like Mark R. Greenberg, senior staff attorney at the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington, contend that the new direction in Albany is no less radical than that in Tallahassee or Trenton.
 
Seeking Fundamental Change
 "I think that the goal of this kind of approach is not simply to put forward a catchy slogan but rather to fundamentally change the day-to-day operations of the welfare system," Mr. Greenberg said.
One of every 11 New Yorkers -- a total of 1.6 million people -- is now on welfare. Seventy-six percent, or 1.2 million people, are supported by Aid to Families with Dependent Children, a program largely for mothers and children that is financed by the Federal, state and local governments. The remainder, 388,000 people, are recipients of Home Relief, a state and local program primarily for childless, and often able-bodied, adults.
Fully 60 percent of the state's adult welfare recipients are considered employable. Yet recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children stay on the rolls for an average of 2.5 years, significantly longer than the national average. Many return more than once, although the state does not have reliable statistics about recidivism.
The state's welfare rolls grew by 32 percent from 1989 to 1993, and its spending on welfare increased by 48 percent to $4.07 billion, or 13 percent of the state's general fund budget. An additional $5.3 billion was spent on Medicaid, much of it to pay for health care for welfare recipients.
 
Opposing Punitive Measures
 Mr. Cuomo's strategy, which is being put in place in selected counties, acknowledges that New York's welfare system must be revamped to place a new priority on jobs. But the plan also reflects the Governor's arguments that many measures embraced by other governors, and by President Clinton, may be both counterproductive and inhumane.
In a speech on welfare earlier this month, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, ridiculed the practice of denying increased benefits to women who have additional children. "If you make another baby, I'll take the money away from you and then you and the baby are going to starve," he said. "That's terrific. What a dumb thing that is."
Republican lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates laud Mr. Cuomo's new emphasis on jobs. They also support his calls for expanding the state's experimental program of fingerprinting welfare recipients to combat fraud and for tougher enforcement of child-support orders.
But many Republican leaders support more Draconian measures, and they question why Mr. Cuomo waited 12 years to propose his Jobs First plan.
"I'm always amused that Mario Cuomo comes up with proposals after problems reach alarming proportions," said Herbert London, a Republican candidate for governor.
Cuomo administration officials said that a major jobs program would have had little success at a time when there were few jobs to be had, particularly for low-skilled workers. After losing more than 500,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993, employment in New York has started to creep upward only since January.
Since 1988, when Congress passed a welfare package that funneled new money for job training to the states, New York has nearly doubled the number of welfare recipients in programs that require schooling, job training or work.
But fewer than one of every six employable welfare recipients participate in such programs, at least in part because of inadequate financing. And the number of welfare recipients who joined the work force increased to only 44,709 in 1993 from 32,245 in 1988.
Mr. Dowling, who was appointed Commissioner of Social Services last year, acknowledges that even now the state's job growth is too lethargic to move large numbers of people from welfare to work. But he is urging business leaders to make more jobs available to welfare recipients and has called for larger tax credits for those who do.
 
A Message About Work
 His goal, looking toward a day when the economy blossoms, is for every welfare office to send a message about work. "From the moment someone walks in, instead of the worker saying, 'I'm here to see if you're eligible,' they should say, 'I'm here to make sure you don't become eligible,' " he said.
As part of its effort, the state is expanding a demonstration project, highly regarded by the Clinton Administration and academic experts on welfare, that encourages welfare mothers to find jobs by allowing them to keep part of their benefits while they work. The project, known as the Child Assistance Program, is being expanded this year from seven counties to 14, including Brooklyn, its first location in New York City.
A recent state-financed study found that the program, which is voluntary, significantly increased the average participant's income while modestly decreasing the state's costs. It was inconclusive about whether the program will ultimately reduce long-term welfare dependency.
Mr. Dowling said it would be difficult, but not impossible, to put the whole Jobs First plan to work in New York City.
Besides the sheer magnitude of the welfare caseload there, the city has a higher unemployment rate. Its welfare eligibility offices are currently distinct from those that administer its job training and employment programs.
Union rules regulate the tasks performed by caseworkers, making it difficult to require bureaucrats to take on new responsibilities. And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed cutting 4,658 of the city's 23,696 social services workers, meaning the city will have fewer workers at a time it wants its welfare system to do more.
Marva L. Hammons, the Commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, said the Giuliani administration fully supports the state's initiative and is planning to experiment with it this year. But she also said she did not underestimate the challenge.
"Over the last 10 to 15 years, we've been asking welfare agencies to get the checks out and to have good participation rates in a variety of programs," she said. "We've gotten very good at doing that. But when we change the goal to job placement, that is a very big change in philosophy and direction. It may not seem like a big change, but really and truly it is."
At Albany County's main welfare office, there are few physical manifestations of that change. Like many public assistance offices, it consists of a dingy waiting room cluttered with plastic chairs and a warren of paper-strewn desks.
But by adopting the Jobs First philosophy, the county managed to trim its Home Relief caseload to 2,137 in late April from 2,775 in early February, a decrease of 23 percent.
Ross A. Prinzo Jr., social services commissioner for Albany County, said much of the caseload reduction came from forcing Home Relief applicants to look for work during the 45-day period that is used to determine eligibility for benefits.
Once applicants are determined to be employable, meaning that they are not disabled, addicted to drugs or alcohol or lacking vocational skills, they are required to apply in person for at least six jobs a week. A job search handbook advises applicants to "dress neatly" and "smile!"
Increasingly, those who cannot find work on their own are placed into programs that require them to earn their benefits as custodians, groundskeepers and file clerks in government offices -- with an eye toward building their experience in the working world.
Using a two-year-old state program called Working Toward Independence, the county has placed 120 Home Relief recipients in part-time jobs, usually averaging 18 hours a week, for state agencies like the Office of General Services and the Department of Social Services.
Some welfare recipients, after learning of the new requirements, simply drop from the rolls, Albany County officials said.
"The younger ones say: 'I never had to do this before. All I had to do was show up,' " said Concetta M. Dominski, a senior social welfare examiner in Albany. "I say: 'Surprise. The taxpayer is tired of footing the bill.' And then I say, 'Come on, you don't want to do this the rest of your life.' "

HEADLINE: Collecting Child Support. A special report.;
Private Firms Help Single Parents Get What's Due

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Casey Hoffman knows plenty about the difficulties of enforcing child-support orders.
He used to run Texas's child-support office, and in 1990, the year he left that job, his program was rated the most improved in the nation; indeed, Mr. Hoffman was named the outstanding child-support manager of the year. 
 But these days Mr. Hoffman plays a different role as a private entrepreneur in child support, a kind of bounty hunter who tracks down absent parents, makes them pay, and keeps a third of the money he collects.
The very existence of a private company like Mr. Hoffman's Child Support Enforcement, and about 100 others that have sprung up nationwide in the last five years, is, to advocates for single parents, a stark indication of the inadequacy of the state child-support system.
The Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, an advocacy group based in Toledo, Ohio, sees the private companies as leeches whose fees siphon off money badly needed to support children in single-parent families.
"If they take 33 percent of the money that's supposed to feed the children, what are they taking? Breakfast, lunch or dinner?" asked Geraldine Jensen, the founder of the association, which lobbies for stronger child-support laws and teaches parents their legal rights. "It's a symptom of how badly broken the system is that women are turning to private profiteers. It's true, the system doesn't work unless you really push it. But we need to fix the system, not let private companies profit at the expense of kids."
Many women for whom Mr. Hoffman has recovered money disagree, arguing that a third of the money is a reasonable fee for the personal attention and fast results his company provides.
"I got child-support money for maybe a year after we separated in 1981, and then it stopped," said Nancy Sissons, 47, of Glen Cove, L.I. "I filed with Nassau County, but that went on for nine years and I got nothing. Finally they gave up. The woman in the Nassau office told me I might as well forget it. But a girlfriend in Texas told me about Casey Hoffman's company. I was little bit leery of it, to tell the truth, but I didn't have anything to lose."
 
Laws Are No Help For State Collections
 What happened next seemed little short of miraculous to Ms. Sissons, who for years had worked two jobs to support her two daughters.
"Within three days they called to say they had located him," she said. "He ended up paying $37,000, and after their fee, I got $25,000. That seems reasonable to me. After we got his address, my older daughter wrote to him. And this year, for the first time in 12 years, she got a birthday card from him."
Despite child-support laws that have steadily been made tougher, the percentage of cases in which the state collects child support remains small -- and largely unchanging.
According to the Department of Health Human Services's Office of Child Support Enforcement, overburdened state agencies nationwide collected money in only 18.7 percent of their child-support cases in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1992, compared with 19.3 percent the previous year.
Private child-support enforcement is still a new field and one that is completely unregulated. State officials and consumer advocates alike warn that the potential for consumer fraud is high. Some companies have taken in application fees from hundreds, even thousands, of clients and then quickly folded.
There are also complaints that some companies have been overly zealous, hounding the relatives of those who have not paid their child support. Mary Wilson, an Arlington, Tex., woman whose son owed support, said she was harassed with constant calls at work by a private child-support company in Houston, threatening to put her son in jail. The company subsequently went bankrupt.
But for many mothers, and a few fathers, who are frustrated by the government's failure to collect their child support, the calculation is simple: 66 percent of something is more than 100 percent of nothing.
Such was the case of Connie Velasco, a 24-year-old Austin woman whose former husband had ignored child-support orders for their son, Jaime, now 6, and moved to Oklahoma, frustrating efforts by the Texas Attorney General's Office to collect. So Ms. Velasco signed up with Mr. Hoffman's company: "Within a few months, I was getting my money," she said. "It does bother me, how much they take as their fee, but it was the only way I was going to get anything."
Most of Mr. Hoffman's clients have spent years trying to get the state to collect the money they are owed. In many cases, the absent parent is out of state, complicating enforcement for state workers already burdened with overwhelming caseloads. And most of the state agencies' attention goes to the welfare cases that make up the bulk of the 15 million cases in the system -- cases in which the state keeps much of the money it recovers to recoup its welfare payments to the mother.
"We don't have any magic that the state doesn't have," said Mr. Hoffman, who practiced family law and headed the Massachusetts bar association before he moved to Texas. "But they have huge backlogs and more cases than they can handle. We don't handle welfare cases, our investigators have reasonable caseloads, and we have the financial incentive."
Ron Dusek, press secretary to the Texas Attorney General, warns that the field is unregulated and ripe for fraud, but he acknowledges that the state can use private companies' help in collecting child support. "We're a free service with hundreds of thousands of cases, and there is plenty of work to be done, so there is certainly an opportunity for private collections," Mr. Dusek said. "And it's true, they can work a case a lot quicker."
 
State System Shows Improvement
 Critics of the state child-support offices acknowledge that the system is improving, thanks to tougher laws that provide for wage garnishment, computerization, better interstate collection procedures and more.
Still, the states' collection efforts are stymied by the millions of babies whose paternity is not officially established, making it impossible to collect money from their fathers. Although states seek paternity orders, they succeed for only about a third of the 1.5 million babies born each year to unmarried women.
Even where paternity is not an issue, millions of mothers never get a court order requiring child support. And even among those who have court orders requiring support, only about half get the full amount they are entitled to.
Experts say unpaid child support is a prime reason that more than one in five American children live in poverty. According to an Urban Institute study, children in single-parent families would get $34 billion if all child-support obligations were met.
The Clinton Administration may include in its proposal to overhaul the welfare system a Federal registry of all child-support orders and a provision making it possible to track noncustodial parents as they move from job to job by requiring all new employees to complete a form about whether they owe child support. But Mr. Hoffman and others say it will be decades before government has a smoothly functioning system.
"With all the attention the problem has gotten, and all the new laws, the percentage of paying cases nationwide grew 1.6 percent in 14 years," Mr. Hoffman said. "I would love to be put out of business if the state could collect money for all the children who should be getting it. But we're light years away from that."
Other entrepreneurs have reached a similar conclusion. Just last month, Find Dad, a private child-support company with the most elaborate marketing program -- complete with a catchy phone number, 800 PAY-MOMS -- was acquired last month by Casino & Credit Services Inc., a publicly traded company in Conshohocken, Pa., that provides credit information to casinos.
And Charles Drake, who in 1988 in San Antonio, Tex., started what was apparently the first private child-support business, Children's Support Services (Its slogan: "We can't make him care, but we can make him pay."), has served as a consultant to dozens of others joining the field. But as many as half the new child-support companies that were started in the last five years have failed.
With advice from Mr. Drake, Mitchell Levin invested $100,000 two years ago to expand his Long Island collection agency to include child-support enforcement, but he dropped out of the field after a few months. "It's a very hard game to play," Mr. Levin said. "We did a lot of advertising, and we got 10,000 phone calls from people who wanted help, but most were on welfare, and it only turned into 35 cases. There's certainly a big problem with child support in this country, but it's not one a private company can solve."
 
An Alternative To Lawyers
 Still, private companies can fill a need for some parents who have a court order, are not on welfare and are owed a large amount in back support payments. While affluent parents have used lawyers to collect child support, lawyers typically charge high retainers and hourly fees, payable whether or not any money is recovered.
Mr. Hoffman's company sometimes gets support payments just by tracking down and contacting the absent parent, usually a father. More often, though, the company must have his wages garnisheed, go to court to collect the money or persuade local law-enforcement officials to arrest him.
In one creative case, where the former husband was unemployed and broke, Mr. Hoffman's company arranged for the wife to receive a mobile home that the man's mother's will had bequeathed to him, to his former wife and to a charity, which agreed to donate its share to the woman.
The big draw of the private child-support companies is that they work on contingency. Though many charge a nonrefundable application fee -- Mr. Hoffman's is one of the few that does not, though his 33 percent cut is higher than most -- the private companies get their cut only if they collect. Some companies take a percentage of the back support payments only; others keep a portion of every payment.
In the Hancock Center shopping mall here, Mr. Hoffman's company gets thousands of calls every month from parents, mostly mothers, who are not receiving the money they are owed.
For all the demographers who chart the breakdown of the American family, all the statisticians who track the rise in childhood poverty, it may be Vanessa Diaz, sitting in her basement mall office, who knows the problem best.
Ms. Diaz is one of Child Support Enforcement's client-service representatives, taking calls on the 800 line and sifting out the people on welfare, the ones with no court order, the ones who are not owed at least $5,000 in back support.
She hears it all: the mother of four facing eviction because she cannot pay the rent, the mother with a seriously ill child and no medical insurance, the mother whose ex-husband just bought a new boat but will not pay a cent in child support.
 
A Sympathetic Voice On the Phone
 To callers who meet the company's guidelines, Ms. Diaz sometimes offers her own story -- part reassurance, part marketing tool -- of spending six years trying to collect child support through the Texas Attorney General's Office. Then she found Mr. Hoffman, and got her money in eight weeks.
Soon after, Mr. Hoffman offered her a job. "I thought it was important that women who call us talk to women who can identify with what they are going through," he said. "I knew she'd be great when she told us how mad she got about being put on hold every time she called the Attorney General's Office. One time it went on so long, she got in her car, drove to the office, and said, 'See those blinking lights on the phone? That's me.' "
For investigators, Mr. Hoffman has turned primarily to alumni of the state child-support collection office, many of them former repo men, who see child support as a sort of repossession in the public interest.
"There's not a lot of personal satisfaction in repo-ing a mobile home, knowing the family has nowhere to go," said Al James, an investigator who started as a repo man and went to the Fort Worth child-support office before joining Child Support Enforcement. "Here, I know I'm doing something that benefits children."
Finding the absent parent is usually the easy part, investigators say, given the availability of credit bureaus, law-enforcement authorities and, sometimes, disgruntled former girlfriends.
"Finding them isn't the problem," said Shepherd Green, another investigator who has in the past worked as a repo man, an undercover policeman, an investigator for a bank and a loan officer. "The problem is what you find. They could be homeless. They could be dead."
Mr. Hoffman says his the company finds about 85 percent of the parents it looks for, and about 60 percent of those ultimately pay something.
Besides the "gotcha" moments of tracking down someone who has eluded discovery for years, what investigators seem to relish most are the cases in which a father who has long been incommunicado renews contact with his children after paying what he owes.
"Sometimes after a father starts paying, he'll send a letter for us to forward to the kids," said Mr. James, who handles 200 to 300 cases at a time, compared with the 2,800 he was responsible for when he worked for the state. "Once they pay, they can stop being ashamed, and start having a relationship with their kids again."

HEADLINE: Thousands of Rwanda Dead Wash Down to Lake Victoria

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 20

 BODY:
As many as 10,000 bodies from Rwanda's massacres have washed down the Kagera River into Lake Victoria in Uganda in the last few weeks, creating an acute health hazard, a senior Ugandan official says.
Cloaking the countryside with the stench of death, the bodies -- as many as 100 an hour -- are being washed ashore in the Rakai district of southern Uganda or onto islands in Lake Victoria and have been seen as far north as Entebbe. 
 A clean-up operation by the Ugandan Government and international relief agencies has been hampered by the remoteness of the area, heavy rains and the difficulty of fighting off the wild animals and dogs feeding on the bodies. Worried about epidemics of cholera and other diseases, the Health Ministry of Uganda is telling villagers to boil drinking water and to cook all fish thoroughly.
"It's basically an appalling sight," said Keith Sherper, the director of the United States Agency for International Development in Kampala, who is assisting the Ugandan Government in the clean-up.
The Kagera River flows through southern Rwanda, mostly through Government- and militia-controlled territory, and bodies have been carried by the current for weeks. Relief officials say the killers must have dumped the bodies into the river by the truckload. Many are mutilated.
"I've never seen hatred like this in my life," said Manuel Pinto, a member of the Ugandan Parliament from the Rakai district and the head of the clean-up operation who gave the estimate of up to 10,000 bodies. "There are so many of them. Children are skewered on sticks. I saw a woman cut open from the tail bone. They have removed breasts and male genital organs."
The massacres in Rwanda began on April 6 when its President, Juvenal Habyarimana, was killed in a suspicious plane explosion. Most of the killings have been done by the majority Hutu military and militia and have been directed against the minority Tutsi tribe in what human rights officials say is an "ethnic cleansing" of the Tutsis. Battle deaths in fighting between the military and the Tutsi rebels have been relatively few in comparison.
Reliable estimates of the death toll are hard to find, but some range up to and beyond 200,000.
The Kagera River empties into Lake Victoria in the Rakai district near the fishing village of Kasensero, once an important trading center but now decimated by AIDS and with about 1,000 inhabitants. It was in Kasensero that the first cases of AIDS were reported in the 1980's.
The clean-up operation in Uganda began on April 25 but was at first limited to a local effort. Western donors have now pledged more than $150,000. World Vision International and the Lutheran World Federation are the two main relief agencies, but in a broad show of support, Ugandan volunteers are providing time, money, trucks, fuel and excavators for mass graves. The Ugandan Government is trucking in drinking water.
 
Working Round the Clock
 Workers are trying to remove bodies before they reach the lake, and crews work round the clock, Mr. Pinto said. They use motorized canoes and must somehow trap the bodies, pull them to shore, wrap them and load them onto trucks.
Many bodies have already washed ashore and are rotting. This attracts wild animals and dogs and fills the area with a gagging stench. On one island, as many as 700 bodies had washed ashore, Mr. Pinto said.
At first villagers dug shallow graves, but heavy rains have washed away the sandy earth and exposed the bodies. Mr. Pinto said the clean-up force has assigned people to shoot scavenging dogs. The rains have also made dirt roads impassable, and the bodies have to be ferried with the canoes.
There is the danger of pollution as well. Lake Victoria, the second largest body of fresh water in the world, borders Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya and is also the source of the Nile. The fishing of Nile perch is the backbone of local economies. Health experts believe that the perch, who like to eat live prey, will not feed on the bodies, but the experts have advised the local inhabitants to cook the fish thoroughly.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed on Fears Of a 5th Rate Increase

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday as the market focused on the dollar's sharp decline against the German mark, which raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for a fifth time this year.
Adding another shiver of anxiety to the markets yesterday was a surge in commodities prices, which could point to possible inflation. The Commodities Research Bureau's futures price index, which has been rising this week, hit a new high for 1994 yesterday. 
 "All of this could pressure the Fed," said Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities Inc. "But the markets are actually holding together fairly well at the moment, so we'll just have to see how next week works out."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.37 points yesterday to close at 3,766.35, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.56 points, to 454.92.
 
Clearer Statement Needed
 Earlier this week, the Fed pushed up short-term interest rates by half a percentage point in an effort to insure that inflation remained under control and to support a sagging dollar.
But some traders contend that the Clinton Administration needs to make a clearer statement that it wants a strong dollar rather than simply trying to avoid a weak dollar. "Right now, we're just as confused as anyone else," said Kevin J. Laurie, manager of foreign-exchange trading at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Indeed, German interest rates remain higher than American rates, despite the Fed's recent action, and thus mark-denominated securities are still more lucrative than dollar-denominated securities.
The weakened dollar helped push down bond prices, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, jumped to 7.30 percent, from 7.23 percent on Thursday.
With the exception of blue-chip stocks, the overall stock market declined as well.
Yesterday was the "double witching hour," when two kinds of options on indexes and individual stocks expired, but that did not seem to push up trading volume, which totaled 293.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Traders said that much of the options-related trading probably occurred on Wednesday and Thursday during the rising sessions that followed the Fed's raising of interest rates.
 
Philip Morris Up
 Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 12 stocks rose, led by Philip Morris and Sears, Roebuck, which accounted for all of the Dow's rise. Philip Morris rose 2 1/2, to 53 3/4, after an analyst for Merrill Lynch said in a report this week that Philip Morris stock could be worth $64 if the company split into separate food and cigarette units. Sears rose 1 1/8, to 50 7/8, on no discernible news.
Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 287 stocks fell, led by Royal Dutch Petroleum, which fell 3 5/8, to 107 3/4, despite a jump in crude oil prices yesterday. Analysts said there was concern in the market about the supply of crude oil available for delivery.
The most active issue yesterday, at 5.3 million shares, was the American depository receipts for Telefonos de Mexico, the Mexican phone company, which because it is widely held often acts as a proxy for the entire Mexican stock market. The A.D.R.'s, which each represent 20 ordinary shares, rose 7/8, to 60 1/4, after it was announced that Telmex was part of a consortium that would link the United States and Chile with advanced fiber optic cable.
Among other market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.61 point, to 726.70, and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.16 point, to 438.20. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.58 point, to 251.58. Declining stocks edged out advancing stocks by 1,146 to 1,027.
In Tokyo, stocks ended higher yesterday on a late flurry of index-linked buying. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 120.83 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,342.17.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
June Oil Ends Day at $18.92; Surge Lifts Precious Metals

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The surging June oil contract touched $19 a barrel yesterday before it expired just short of that level as strong demand for crude oil drove the market upward.
Domestic refiners were operating at a feverish pace, partly to insure plentiful supplies of gasoline for the coming driving season, analysts said. 
 June crude rose 47 cents, to $18.92 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price since mid-June of last year.
"June crude is going out in a blaze of glory," said Hans Kashyap of Analytics Research Corporation in Bethesda, Md.
The July oil contract gained a modest 31 cents, to $18.21 a barrel. June gasoline rose 0.52 cent, to 52.60 cents a gallon, and June heating oil added 0.46 cent, to 48.32 cents a gallon.
 
June Gold Contract Climbs
 The rallies in oil and soybean prices helped touch off a rise in inflation-sensitive gold and other precious metals. The moves combined to push up the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities for the fourth straight day. It hit 233.73, its highest since October 1990, before receding to 233.69, up 1.26.
Continued weakness in the dollar also made gold attractive to some investors, and the June contract climbed $4.50, to $386.30 an ounce, at the Commodity Exchange in New York. July silver rose 11.5 cents, to $5.66 an ounce, and July platinum ended $5.40 higher, at $405.90 an ounce.
Soybeans continued a recent price surge that has pushed the market up more than 5 percent in the last week. A strong ridge of high pressure lingering over the Midwest has caused fears of a dry growing season that would reduce the crop.
"Monday's open depends on the moisture amounts over the weekend and Monday's forecast, how much and where it falls," said Nick DeBrown of E.D. and F. Man International.
"If there is no rain this weekend we'll be sharply higher Monday, but if it rains we'll be sharply lower -- it's that simple," another trader said.
The wheat crop, which is nearing maturity, was affected by frost worries, since maturing wheat stands need warm, dry weather to enhance final development.
July soybeans rose 8.25 cents, to $7.02 1/2 a bushel; July corn edged up 0.75 cents, to $2.68 3/4; July wheat added 3.75 cents, to $3.26 3/4, and July oats rose 1 cent, to $1.23 1/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops vs. the Mark On Interest-Rate Outlooks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the German mark yesterday amid signs that American interest rates may have peaked and that short-term German rates are unlikely to fall anytime soon.
German interest rates remain as much as a percentage point higher than American rates even though the Federal Reserve pushed up short-term rates this week by half a percentage point. 
 "People are convinced that German interest rates aren't going down again and that U.S. rates aren't going up," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6470 German marks, down from 1.6577 marks on Thursday. But it was little changed at 104.25 Japanese yen, down from 104.33 yen, amid growing optimism about American-Japanese trade talks in Washington.
The dollar is down 5.4 percent against the mark and 7.1 percent against the yen this year, hurt by a capital flight from American stocks and bonds, a widening trade deficit and lingering concern about the Clinton Administration's trade policies.
Even so, the dollar may be close to a bottom, some traders said. Marc Cohen, managing director at C-Wave Capital Management, a currency trading firm in Fort Lee, N.J., predicted that economic growth would eventually push up interest rates, thus buoying the dollar. "The recent slump is overdone," he said. Higher American interest rates usually make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
Many traders sold dollars yesterday after unidentified officials of the German central bank were quoted in in a leading German newspaper as saying they expected a surge in the German money supply growth, the Bundesbank's gauge of future inflation.
With the money supply rising so fast, fewer traders expect the Bundesbank to cut interest rates anytime soon.
Similarly, many traders gave up hope for higher American rates on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve raised the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent and suggested that the increase was the last one for some time to come. The Fed raised its discount rate on loans made directly to banks to 3.5 percent from 3 percent.
The dollar fell further yesterday after the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, was quoted by the German weekly Der Spiegel as saying that the dollar's decline against the mark this year was more a result of the mark's stability than the dollar's weakness.
"Mr. Tietmeyer's comments really hurt the dollar," said Lynn Tierney, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "He sounds like he wants a strong Deutsche mark."

HEADLINE: Man Charged in Slaying of 2 Prominent Maryland Lawyers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
An unemployed handyman with a record of committing burglaries was charged by the authorities in Maryland today with two counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of two prominent Washington lawyers.
Scotland E. Williams of Arnold, Md., was arrested by the police on Thursday night at his home after he had used a bank card that had belonged to one of the victims, Jose Enrique Trias, 49, the chief counsel for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase, Md. 
 In all, Mr. Williams had used the cards three times since the slayings and had been photographed each time by the bank cameras, the police said.
The bodies of Mr. Trias and his wife, Julie Noel Gilbert, 48, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, were found on Monday at their weekend home across the Severn River from Annapolis.
In Maryland, first-degree murder is punishable by death under certain circumstances, including when more than one homicide has occurred. "It's not automatic," said Jerry Anderson a county prosecutor, adding that the decision must be made by the Anne Arundel County state's attorney, 30 days before trial.
Earlier this week in Baltimore, John Frederick Thanos became the first person to be executed in Maryland in 33 years, for the slaying of three teen-agers in 1990.
The Anne Arundel County police said Mr. Williams, 31, who was released from jail last month after his second arrest for burglary, was apprehended at home.
The police said they had the photographs from the cameras above the automatic teller machines at each of the Citibank branches Mr. Williams used. In at least one of the photographs, he wore glasses and a bandana. They also said that when Mr. Williams used the card the third time, at a shopping center south of Baltimore, a witness noticed him and provided a description that resembled the photos of Mr. Williams.
The police said that in their questioning of Mr. Williams he identified himself as the man in the photographs and admitted that he had used the bank card. They also said that at the time of his arrest Mr. Williams was wearing a watch that had belonged to Ms. Gilbert.
Sgt. Rick Tabor of the Anne Arundel County Police said the authorities were investigating the possibility that at least two other people had been involved in the slaying, but that it was too soon to know if Mr. Williams or the others had known the couple. He said he doubted it.
"His forte was being a cat burglar, breaking in when people were home," Sergeant Tabor said of Mr. Williams. "But before this, violence had never been attached to any of his burglaries before."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Young to Reject Pessimism

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 20

 BODY:
President Clinton today urged a troubled new generation of American adults to overcome pessimism and embrace an obligation to community that he portrayed as crucial to the nation's future.
In his message, an address at the University of California at Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton served striking notice of his intent to use the Presidency to preach not just about what government should do, but also what Americans must do. 
 The President's call for young Americans to hew to their responsibilities sounded a more traditional theme than his more familiar monologues on governmental activism. But his aides made clear that it reflected a determined effort to call attention to the moral burdens that citizens still carry.
Today's speech was the first that Mr. Clinton has addressed so explicitly to Generation X, the vaguely defined group of Americans born after 1964 who, public opinion polls suggest, regard the future with unusually scant hope.
 
'A Generation of Seekers'
 "What I have seen today is not a generation of slackers but a generation of seekers, and I am much encouraged," the President said, expressing faith that the young people in the audience and their contemporaries could triumph even in a whirlwind world.
But his speech in mortarboard and gown at Pauley Pavilion on the U.C.L.A. campus was a pointed and Kennedyesque call on the graduating class to "act in the spirit of America" by doing more to contribute to their society and its institutions.
Speaking at an academic convocation marking the university's 75th anniversary, Mr. Clinton issued a stark warning against the example set by members of what F. Scott Fitzgerald called the "Lost Generation." Fitzgerald wrote that that generation had come of age in 1919 to find "all gods dead, all wars fought, all faith in man shaken."
The President said, "Many say that this generation of college graduates is filled with pessimism, with a sense of generational despair that our glory days are behind us." . He said his own generation had been bombarded by unflattering images of today's young adults, and acknowledged that this year's college graduates faced "uncertain times."
But he urged the 9,000 people who filled the gymnasium to turn for answers not just to government but also to "the far, far greater power of the American people to transform themselves, their families and their communities to seize the future and make it yours."
 
An Echo of Kennedy
 As he has in the last week in speeches at Gallaudet University and before the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., Mr. Clinton portrayed that ideal as an essential complement to his own attempts to use government as an instrument of change.
But his exhortation to young Americans to do more for their country carried a deliberate echo as he reminded listeners that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who died Thursday night, had -- as had her first husband -- wanted Americans to see the world as "possibilities, not problems; to build up, not tear down; to unite, not to divide."
The President's emphasis on value-based themes is described by aides as an effort to address what he regards as aspects of American life that are too often neglected. But it has also served to inject new variety into addresses that in recent months had become repetitious soliloquies on health care and crime, and for that reason may serve to distract attention from more sensitive subjects, including efforts by Mr. Clinton and his lawyers to devise a strategy to fend off a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment.
As the President noted today, many of those graduating from U.C.L.A. and other universities this year were born in 1973, a year he described as "a watershed year in American life," when he said the steady increase in family incomes that began after World War II came to an abrupt halt.
Some public opinion polls seeking to measure sentiment among members of the generation have found that three in four of those surveyed believe they will never be as prosperous as their parents. But Mr. Clinton insisted today that there was no reason for cynicism, that an American breakdown could be reversed, and that the future remained "something you have to make."
Before his address, he was presented with an honorary medal by the university's chancellor, Charles E. Young, and the citation praised him for having "engaged the spirit of America in a renewed sense of national community."
This was Mr. Clinton's 12th trip to California since he took office, a frequency that is a measure of his concern about his political prospects in a state whose economy is still sagging.
 
Stop at Closed Base
 Even on the way to the convocation, the President made sure that Air Force One landed first in San Bernardino, 70 miles to the east, so that he could visit the former Norton Air Force Base, one of several California military installations that have been closed since the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Clinton sought to portray the experience as more of a success than a setback, and noted the local authorities were in the process of transforming the sprawling base into a new international airport.
But he ran into stern words from Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who is running for re-election this year. She called attention once again to the burdens that cuts in military spending have inflicted on the state by urging the small crowd gathered near a runway to "importune the President to give us some breathing ground" by postponing the next round of base closings from 1995 to 1997.
Mr. Clinton also planned to use his trip to California to raise at least $2.5 million for Democratic candidates for Congress, including Senator Feinstein.

HEADLINE: U.N. to Help U.S. With Haitian Refugees

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United Nations will work with the Clinton Administration to help insure that refugees from Haiti who fear political retaliation are not forcibly returned, the White House said today.
The new arrangement was agreed on in a one-hour meeting Thursday evening between William Gray, President Clinton's new special adviser on Haiti, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, a White House statement said. 
 Mr. Gray, a former Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, met with ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide for the first time just before the White House meeting. A stepped-up United Nations embargo against Haiti, to include all but humanitarian aid, is set to take effect on Saturday if Haitian military leaders have not stepped down. There was no indication they would do so.
Under the cooperative agreement, the United Nations refugee agency will counsel Haitians and make training available to the United States officials involved in determining who are legitimate political refugees. United Nations refugee officials will also monitor the overall process and help place political refugees in other countries, the White House said.
Mr. Clinton named Mr. Gray and spelled out the new policy on May 8 as criticism mounted that his Administration was sending back to Haiti not only people seeking relief from economic trouble but legitimate political refugees.

HEADLINE: Japan Spares No Expense in Effort to Control Yen

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 20

 BODY:
Japanese officials have contended for months that they cannot accept the Clinton Administration's demands for guaranteed increases in imports because the measures would amount to interference with the free play of the markets. Yet, in another realm, the Japanese Government has engaged in one of the heaviest waves of market intervention in memory in an attempt to manage the value of the yen and keep Japan's exports flowing.
Data on Japan's foreign exchange reserves show that since the beginning of last year, the Bank of Japan has used more than $35 billion in an effort to brake a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar, one of the most sustained and costly campaigns to control currency values ever attempted. 
 Some economists say the intervention amounts to a policy of controlling Japan's trade flows, since the yen's rise -- to 104.32 today in Tokyo trading -- is expected to reduce the huge trade surplus by making Japanese goods more expensive overseas and by encouraging imports.
 
Some New Figures
 Their concern was underscored by the release on Thursday of bilateral trade figures, which showed that the American merchandise trade deficit with Japan soared from $4.63 billion in February to $5.8 billion in March, the third-largest monthly deficit on record.
The critics have also said that the intervention flies in the face of a responsible interplay of supply and demand, a principle to which Japan's Government says it adheres.
"This has been a waste of money," said Kazuaki Harada, the chief economist at the Sanwa Research Institute. "The reason for the yen's rise is the trade surplus. And judging from the continuing large size of the surplus, I think we can expect an even stronger yen."
C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, agrees: "This is the most dramatic example of managed trade in the relationship between the U.S. and Japan over the last year or so. It's very clear that the yen would have strengthened well beyond 100 in the absence of this intervention."
The issue touches on one of the most sensitive aspects of the United States' troubled relationship with Japan -- not just Japan's gaping surplus, but what methods are appropriate for tackling it.
The United States has said Japan must cut its trade surplus or relations cannot improve. The reform-minded Japanese Governments in office since last summer have said they share this goal. But they have asked for more time to devise a plan.
Nevertheless, the Bank of Japan, which operates under the influence of the Finance Ministry, has consistently sold yen to buy dollars, trying to counter heavy purchases of the yen by investors, corporations and speculators, both here and abroad. Those purchases have driven the yen's value to 104.25 yen to the dollar in New York today from 145 yen in 1990.
Japanese Government officials have said the bank's intervention has been aimed at calming jittery markets or smoothing out the many excessively volatile swings in trading. They have also said the yen's appreciation does not reflect underlying economic factors like the anemic economic growth rate or low Japanese interest rates.
Privately, some senior officials characterize the heavy intervention as a holding action. The logic is that if the yen's rise can be halted long enough for the Government to enact a credible program to reduce the surplus, the market will take over and push the yen lower. The problem has been that the previous and current coalition governments have been so weak that they have been unable to push through such a plan.
In some instances, the Bank of Japan has had help from abroad. The Federal Reserve in the United States and other central banks acted in concert with the Bank of Japan earlier this month, spending billions of dollars when the yen suddenly lurched and ignited fears of disruptions in stock and bond markets.
But a number of economists argue that the sustained nature of the Japanese intervention and the huge amounts involved make clear that the effort is an attempt to interfere with market forces and, ultimately, manage trade in Japan's favor.
 
A 'Both Ways' Approach?
 "They are spending money like water," said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "If you are saying you are in favor of free trade, that means that you should let the yen go. If you intervene as they have, you are saying you don't want the price-adjustment mechanism to work. You can't have it both ways."
One of the best measures of the intervention by a central bank in the currency markets is its reserves of foreign currencies and gold. Economists and Bank of Japan officials say that increases generally reflect occasions when the bank has been selling yen and buying foreign currencies, usually dollars.
Since February 1993, the value of Japan's reserves has risen from $69.15 billion to $104.6 billion last month, a record high, according to the Bank of Japan. The reserves are likely to increase another $5 billion or more this month, economists say, because of further intervention.
In the last decade, the major industrial nations acted jointly on several occasions to manage exchange rates to achieve their common policy objectives. During a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York in September 1985, the governments agreed to reduce the value of the dollar and increase the value of the yen, in part to lower Japan's widening trade surplus. The surplus did decline temporarily, but now it has risen to more than $130 billion annually.
When the Clinton Administration took office, it vowed to attack the Japanese surpluses aggressively. After various Treasury officials hinted that they would not object to an appreciation of the yen, traders got the message. The dollar fell from 125 yen at the beginning of last year to lows of almost 100 yen last August and again earlier this month.
 
A Hard-Hit Sector
 The yen's rise has hurt Japanese exporters badly, making it unprofitable for many of them to sell goods overseas. Economists here estimate that exporters break even at a level of about 115 yen to the dollar and begin to lose money below that.
In addition, the slump in exports has slowed the economy, which is already in the midst of its longest recession since World War II.
Many economists thus contend that Japan should take stronger measures to reduce its trade surplus to avoid the punishment of a rising yen. This could be done with a large increase in public works spending, tax reductions, interest rate reductions or some combination of these steps.
Toshihiro Kiribuchi, a former Finance Ministry official and now an executive at the Omron Corporation, an electronics manufacturer, said he sympathized with the Bank of Japan's heavy intervention. He argued, though, that the ultimate solution was not pouring more money into the currency market but aggressive economic policies to reduce the surplus.
"To stop this, the Japanese Government has to come forward with a very effective package of economic stimulus measures, lower interest rates and come up with more deregulation," Mr. Kiribuchi said. "Without these steps, the whole burden is placed on the shoulders of the Bank of Japan. But it cannot stop the dollar's decline alone."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
TALKS ARE CONTINUING
 WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) -- An American official said that the United States and Japan held "good and cordial" trade consultations today and would meet again on Saturday.
"We have had a good and cordial conversation and we will be meeting again," Bowman Cutter, a deputy economic adviser to President Clinton, told reporters.
The two sides met for three hours today, continuing exploratory talks that opened Thursday.
Formal trade negotiations to cut Japan's trade surplus collapsed in February, and the two sides are seeking ways to resume such discussions.

HEADLINE: Migrant Oasis;
Central American Day Laborers Are Drawn to a Suburb

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPRING VALLEY, N.Y., May 18

 BODY:
Journeying across nations in search of work, Lazaro Chinchilla arrived here about a month ago to share a run-down bungalow with seven other men in a rugged settlement of migrants like himself.
"Hunger brought us here," Mr. Chinchilla, an immigrant from Guatemala, said the other day as he wandered along one of the dusty roads that lace the settlement, called El Petencito by its residents. "But it feels like we have come to the edge of the earth." 
 In fact, the small community of some 20 bungalows housing slightly more than 100 is only a few steps from the buzz and neon glow of Route 59, a typically suburban strip of dairy marts, fast-food joints and car dealerships in this Rockland County village.
But tucked behind a wooded area alongside a waterfall, El Petencito -- named after part of Guatemala's frontier -- is an outpost of Central American workers who have come here in search of jobs laying bricks, planting trees, mowing lawns, tending gardens, cleaning homes, whatever they can get.
Only a generation or so ago this same cluster of bungalows was known simply as Hyenga Lake, a popular summer retreat for New York City residents seeking a respite from the urban grind. Its transformation into a migrant camp underscores how the quest for work has driven some of the metropolitan New York region's newest immigrants to improbable places.
The Guatemalans and Salvadorans who have settled in El Petencito are little different from the Mexican day laborers who gather at dawn on a street corner in Mamaroneck in Westchester County or the Hondurans who wait each morning for jobs along Main Street in Mount Kisco farther up county. The Center for Immigrants Rights in Manhattan estimates that there are about 3,000 such day laborers in the region, most of them from Central American countries.
But the striking thing about El Petencito -- where the yards and paths are a jumble of clothes lines, wooden crates, gardening tools and broken cars -- is that, only 25 miles north of the George Washington Bridge, it resembles a tightly knit and secluded Central American village. At dusk, men gather alongside bungalows trading stories and news about their homeland as the rattle of pans and dishes echo from within the houses.
Many of its settlers -- including some who admit they are in the country illegally -- say they are simply passing through with the aim of amassing enough savings to take back a nest egg for their families at home.
Meanwhile, El Petencito represents an inexpensive way station where the rents -- which residents say run $600 to $700 a month for each bungalow -- are split among the men who cram themselves into its bungalows.
"I sleep on the floor or wherever," said Mr. Chinchilla, who is 45 years old.
This is not the first time that Mr. Chinchilla has come to Spring Valley for work. He spent a year here in 1987 washing dishes at a local restaurant for $300 a week before returning to his wife and four children with $1,500 in savings.
This time he makes as much as $50 a day in landscaping and construction work. "I don't know when I will go back," he said. "But this area is good because there are many jobs."
Not everyone is pleased about El Petencito, most of which is within the boundaries of Clarkstown. As the newcomers have proliferated in the last few years, some longtime residents have complained of litter, overcrowding and other problems that they contend have put a strain on local services.
"I've been down there a couple of times, and I'm appalled by the conditions," said Spring Valley's Mayor, Allan Thompson. "I'm sure most of them are law-abiding people who want an opportunity. But it is not the kind of environment I like to see close to my village."
The entrance to El Petencito is marked by rows of metal mailboxes often stuffed with letters arriving from abroad. The people of the settlement gather there each morning, on the edges of Route 59, to secure a day's work from anyone who will hire them.
Their way of life has its risks. Juan Hernandez, 39, said the owner of a landscaping company had hired him to plant trees and flowers one day four months ago. At the end of the day, however, the man drove Mr. Hernandez back to the settlement and refused to pay.
"He told me he'd pay me the next day, but never did," Mr. Hernandez recalled. "Almost all of us have been through something like that. It's part of the life here."
These days, though, he works full time at a factory where he prints designs on shirts. Earning about $200 a week, Mr. Hernandez regularly wires money to his wife and three children in Guatemala.
"It saddens me not to be with them." he said. "But it's a sacrifice that I have to make to support my family."
Jobs are not the only thing that bring the newcomers to suburban hamlets. Many say that such areas offers them a level of security and tranquillity that they feel is lacking in larger cities like New York and Los Angeles.
"My intention was to stay in New York City when I came," said Juan Jose Ramirez, as he washed his car at the edge of a lake near his bungalow.
"But in the city," the 22-year-old Guatemalan immigrant continued, "we would live in despair, locked up inside apartments. This is much calmer; it reminds me of our country."
Likewise, Alejandro Medina, 22, said he left Bridgeport, Conn., where he was living with a friend, after his family urged him to join them in El Petencito. "They told me that there was work and that I would be living with my own people," he recalled.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates Move Up On Weakness in Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates rose yesterday, as the dollar's weakness and rising commodity prices continued to put pressure on the prices of Treasury issues.
The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 26/32 yesterday, to 8711/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.30 percent, from 7.23 percent on Thursday. 
 The dollar helped to pull down bond prices as it fell sharply against the German mark amid signs that the Bundesbank of Germany had little intention of lowering interest rates soon. Despite the Federal Reserve's move this week to push up short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, German rates remain up to a percentage point higher.
A weaker dollar diminishes the value of dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities, making them less attractive to foreign investors.
 
 
Jump in Precious Metals
 Traders were also troubled by strong upward movement in precious metal prices, causing the Commodity Research Bureau index, a closely watched gauge of future inflation, to gain more than a point.
Adding to the bond market's worries were big auctions of Treasury bills and notes next week, said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst for MMS International, a Wall Street research and analysis firm.
"Dealers do not want to be stuck with a lot of paper in a bear market," Mr. Hale said. "One of the reasons the market is particularly nervous is its memory of the May 11 auction of 10-year notes, one of the worst auctions in a long time. Similarly, the five-year note auction last month was also poor. And that has to be on the back of their minds."
For that reason, Mr. Hale said, some dealers are looking to push up yields ahead the auctions to make the Treasury securities more attractive to investors and thus easier to sell.
Aside from the regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the Treasury will be selling $17 billion of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $11 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday, along with $16.5 billion of new one-year bills on Thursday.
 The auctions are expected to be an important gauge of whether the market's sentiment has turned around.
In when-issued trading, the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.81 percent, up 4 basis points, or four-hundredths of a percentage point, from Thursday. The five-year notes were being offered at 6.59 percent, up 6 basis points.
The outstanding one-year bill rose 2 basis points, to 4.84 percent.
Analysts say the bond market will also focus next week on the Government's report on April durable goods orders. While the consensus of forecasts for the survey calls for a 1 percent rise, Mr. Hale thinks it will be more like two-tenths of a percent. "The number has potential for being bullish and positive for the market," he said.
Traders showed little appetite throughout the day to challenge the market's direction one way or the other. They were nervous about the dollar and sold into anything that looked like an uptick.
The Fed's decision to raise short-term rates earlier this week for the fourth time this year, this time by half a percentage point, went a long way toward calming the financial markets.
 
 
Thoughts of Another Rise
 But some economists believe there may eventually be yet another rate increase. Fourteen of 30 analysts in a Reuters survey said yesterday that the Fed could raise short-term interest rates again as early as July, while 13 said the Fed would not move until later this year.
On Tuesday, the Fed raised the discount rate -- the rate it charges banks for overnight loans -- to 3.5 percent from 3 percent. It also allowed the target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate charged for overnight loans between banks -- to rise to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent.
One economist predicted a rate increase in June, and two said the central bank had completed its monetary tightening for 1994.
"After pushing interest rates up 125 basis points in about three and a half months, the central bank will take a moment to see what it has done," said David Blitzer, vice president and chief economist at Standard & Poor's. "Moreover, in the past, the discount rate has often been used to signal the end of a series of tightening or easing moves."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
G.M. Outlines Its Asian Strategy to Shareholders

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SHREVEPORT, La., May 20

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation displayed its strategy today for taking advantage of rapidly expanding Asian markets by building far more cars and trucks there, especially in China. Company executives said that they would begin production in India and Indonesia by the end of the year, and that they were in final negotiations to make mini-vans and subcompact cars in China.
These plans, set forth at the company's annual meeting, held here today, mark G.M.'s latest effort to expand its vastly profitable foreign operations even as its North American automotive units pursue the far more modest goal of showing a net profit this year after repeated losses. 
 General Motors is already leading the Big Three in China. It owns 30 percent of a $100 million joint venture that plans, despite obstacles and delays, to begin making small pickup trucks, similar to the Chevrolet S-10, and sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet Blazer, early next year.
 
 
Ford Is Far Behind
 The Ford Motor Company produces nothing in China, although it is exploring several joint ventures for components production and auto assembly. It is close to at least one agreement, to produce plastic components in Shanghai.
Because of its 1987 purchase of American Motors, the Chrysler Corporation participates in a 10-year-old joint venture that produces about 15,000 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicles a year in Beijing. The factory also produces about 35,000 other sport utilities derived from a Russian chassis, and Chrysler is considering trying to assemble small cars as well.
Together with Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler is also a finalist for the South China Mini-Van Project, a joint venture the Chinese Government is trying to set up to produce about 60,000 mini-vans and 100,000 engines a year.
Auto makers see the world's developing nations, especially in Asia, as their best prospects for the sort of sales growth no longer possible in mature markets. "Eighty-two percent of the world's people live in the new and expanding markets outside the traditional markets of North America, Europe, Japan and Australia," Louis R. Hughes, president of G.M. Europe and head of international operations, told G.M. shareholders at the annual meeting. "Asian markets are experiencing near-explosive growth and are a prime focus for G.M.'s expansion drive."
 
 
More Exports From Europe
 Mr. Hughes noted that exports from G.M. Europe to South America, Eastern Europe, Russia and the Pacific Rim were five times as high as their level of three years ago.
Preparations to start making trucks by G.M.'s current joint venture in China, formed in 1992 with the Jinbei Automotive Company in the northeastern industrial belt, came to a virtual halt last year as the Government moved to cool China's rapid economic growth. G.M. has invested $30 million of the $100 million total cost. Michael Meyerand, a G.M. spokesman, said that training and the renovation of an antiquated assembly line were now progressing well enough to allow production to begin in early 1995.
G.M.'s automotive components group is already involved in eight business ventures there, he said. China requires cars to have at least 50 percent local content, although Mr. Hughes is aiming for at least 60 percent.
The partnerships would make a new version of the Chevrolet Lumina mini-van as well as Opel Corsa subcompacts like those already produced in Europe and Brazil.
In other Asian joint ventures, G.M. plans to start building 18,000 cars and trucks annually in Indonesia this year, and 20,000 Astra subcompacts a year in a partnership with Hindustan Motors of India in the third quarter.
At a news conference after the shareholders meeting, G.M.'s chief executive, John F. Smith Jr., left open the question of whether President Clinton's threatened denial of preferred trading status to China over its human rights record could block the company's plans.
"We're hoping that doesn't happen," Mr. Smith said of the possibility of trade sanctions. "That's caused quite an issue." Mr. Clinton's decision on whether to renew what is called most-favored-nation status for China is due by June 3.
General Motors held its annual meeting in Shreveport to show off its pickup trucks and a local assembly plant that makes them. The site of the meeting, far from Detroit and other large cities, limited attendance to 364 people, the lowest level in 45 years.

HEADLINE: Hiring Welfare Recipients and Making Them Management

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Isabel Cruz's life used to revolve around the 7th and 27th day of each month. Those were the days the welfare checks came.
Then her caseworker handed her a flier from a South Bronx company whose business is attending to the elderly and ill in their own homes. After 11 years on public assistance, Miss Cruz, 34, got a job. After four years with the company, she is running for its board. 
 Miss Cruz works for Cooperative Home Care, a home-aide service begun nine years ago with 20 workers. Today, there are 300, almost all former welfare recipients.
At a time when the nation is focused on the effectiveness of the welfare system, Cooperative Home Care is one of several organizations, both profit and nonprofit, that revolve around finding jobs for people on public assistance.
But while most such organizations place clients in a variety of fields, Cooperative Home Care focuses on one field, and not only trains its employees but also makes them partners in the business.
 
Program Being Copied
 The goal is to improve conditions and promote careers in an industry in which poor people are likely to land jobs. The philosophy: better salaries and training in what has historically been a low-paying, almost transient field will increase motivation and, hence, the level of care.
Jack Litzenberg, a program officer with the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has helped finance Cooperative Home Care, says his organization is now working with other "sectoral development" projects, one in Philadelphia to develop child-care careers and another in Appalachia in food processing.
An operation modeled after Cooperative Home Care opened last year in Philadelphia, one is starting this year in Boston and two more are slated for unannounced Midwestern cities later this year. The Ford Foundation has pledged $400,000 and the Mott Foundation $1 million to help Cooperative Home Care set up the new companies and train personnel. According to the plan, the new cooperatives should become self-financing within two years as they attract clients and a stream of revenue.
"It's a wonderful recipe for success," said Margaret MacAdam, who studies home health care at the Baycrest Center for Geriatrics in Toronto. "They're the model."
The Visiting Nurse Service of New York, which taps 24 home-care agencies for aides, consistently rates the cooperative in the top four or five, said Brenda Lowther-Mandel, in charge of contracting with home-care agencies.
Each day, Miss Cruz goes to the apartment of Lillian Goldson, 96 and blind after two strokes. She makes strawberry shakes, describes the weather, dispenses medicine.
Miss Cruz welcomed the revolution in her life, though she allowed that it wasn't easy. "I was nervous and excited at the same time," she said. Like more than 80 percent of her co-workers, Miss Cruz is a company co-owner: she is buying her $1,000 share in $3.65 weekly installments.
The cooperative recruits half its employees -- most of them black or Hispanic, and all but two women -- through word of mouth and half through New York City's Department of Social Services. On the basis of references and interviews, one of five job applicants is selected.
The workers must pass a four-week training program, with courses ranging from bathing a patient to handling emergencies. In addition, there are regular brush-up sessions.
Rick Surpin, 44, the cooperative president and a longtime community organizer, started the cooperative in response to poor people's statements that they want jobs more than anything else. His strategy, developed in the early 1980's when he worked for the Community Service Society, was to pinpoint a growing economic sector and to improve job satisfaction and the workers' sense of well-being.
 
Less Profit, More Pay
 There are 70,000 home-care aides in New York City. The industry, experts says, traditionally pays slightly more than the $4.25 minimum wage to a part-time work force with no benefits.
Cooperative Home Care pays its workers $7 to $8 an hour and offers medical, dental and vacation benefits. But cooperative workers are still far from financially comfortable, with most earning just a bit over $200 a week.
The company has been set up as a for-profit enterprise to enable employee ownership and dividend payments. Cooperative employees split profits of $150,000 a year on $4.5 million in revenues. The dividends amount to a return of 20 percent to 50 percent. Workers must sell their shares for the $1,000 value when they leave the cooperative.
Aside from profit sharing, the company is bucking industry practices by guaranteeing at least 30 hours of work a week.
"They have created a workplace environment that is startlingly different from most of the home-care agencies in New York City," said Donald Gould, vice president of the United Hospital Fund, a New York hospital philanthropy and policy center that has given Cooperative Home Care $150,000. "Better care comes from better jobs."
Continuing training is vital, in part because learning sessions allow staff members to gather as a group, a break from what are often monotonous and lonely jobs. Four times a year, aides gather to learn new techniques and discuss problems.
It is this active involvement Mr. Surpin most values. He says it represents a shift in mind-set for the aides, who often had long felt it was best for them to avoid attention.
"These women thought if somebody saw them, they'd criticize them," he said. "Now, they become some of the most important people in the world to middle-class people worried about their parents and grandparents. That changes their lives in a fairly substantial way."
Phyllis Brown is an example. She takes care of Annie Peterson, who has diabetes, is nearly deaf and needs an ulcer treated twice a day, in the Jackson Avenue area of the South Bronx. "We are a bunch of serious people, intelligent, good workers," Ms. Brown said.
Mrs. Peterson said of her aide, "Ain't no problem with her."
"Am I a good cook?" Ms. Brown asked.
"A-plus," Mrs. Peterson shot back.
"See, I think that's what she loves me for."

HEADLINE: Piper Will Invest in Its Own Slipping Fund

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
In a highly unusual move, the Piper Jaffrey Companies said yesterday that it would invest at least $10 million, and perhaps as much as $25 million, in a bond mutual fund it managed that had lost nearly a quarter of its value this year.
The firm said the move was not a bailout in that the new money represented a purchase of shares of Piper Jaffrey Institutional Government Income Portfolio and would not increase the value of existing shares. Instead, it said, it is meant as a gesture of reassurance to investors. 
 "We have a lot of confidence in the portfolio manager and want to show our good faith to the shareholders," said Edward Kohler, president of the money management arm of the Minneapolis-based brokerage firm.
The fund, which was meant to offer high-interest payments while keeping principal stable, invested mainly in securities backed by home mortgages and complex derivative securities based on them. It was the best- performing fund in its class from 1991 through 1993, years in which long-term interest rates fell.
But as interest rates shot up far more than expected early this year, prices of mortgage-backed bonds fell sharply. And as investors shied away from mortgage derivatives, prices of those securities fell even further.
As a result, the fund's assets fell from $800 million at the beginning of the year to $593 million. About $160 million of that decline was from the falling prices and $40 million from withdrawals by investors.
Piper Jaffrey said yesterday that it would invest $10 million in the fund and would shut the fund to new investors on June 20 or when the fund's assets hit $650 million, whichever came first. If the fund does not reach that level, Piper said it would invest up to another $15 million in it.
Mutual fund experts said the announcement of the investment by Piper in its own fund was unusual. Other fund managers from time to time invest in their own funds, but they generally do not disclose it. In a handful of cases, mainly with money market funds, the fund managers have actually bailed out funds they ran, buying securities that went bad.
Barry Barbash, director of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Piper's investment seemed to present no legal or ethical problems. "It seems to be a marketing or public relations gesture," he said. "They aren't going to make investors whole, but they want to show they have faith in the investments they made."
 
Prices Below Market Value
 Mr. Kohler said that the shares of the fund were an attractive investment because many of the securities in its portfolio had fallen to prices below their fair value in the recent market turmoil. The fund will be closed to new investors so that if the shares recover in price, as the firm expects, the benefits will go to the existing investors, not to new investors who buy in at fire-sale prices.
Mortgage-backed securities are bonds that represent pools of home loans made by banks and other mortgage lenders to home buyers. They are harder to value than normal bonds issued by governments and corporations because homeowners often prepay their mortgages when they sell their houses or refinance.
If interest rates fall, more homeowners refinance. This hurts the holders of the bonds who owned the previous mortgages that were pegged at higher interest payments.
In recent years, Wall Street brokerage houses have taken pools of these mortgage-backed securities and divided them into separate pieces to appeal to different sorts of investors. A pool typically is divided into one security that offers a regular schedule of interest, with less risk of prepayment, and several other securities that offer higher potential returns but with much higher risk.
These more complex securities, often known as mortgage derivatives, are quite volatile, and some performed quite well last year. But this year many were hit by an unexpected triple whammy.
 
Fewer Refinancings
 First, as interest rates rose, the prices of all bonds fell. Second, since fewer people refinance mortgages as rates go up, it takes longer for mortgage investors to get their principal back, which makes the bonds worth even less. And third, since the securities are complex, and the effect of rates on prepayment is hard to predict, investors have tried to bail out of many of these derivatives, causing the market to fall even further.
The Piper fund is managed by Worth Bruntjen, a Piper veteran, who also managed the Managers Intermediate Mortgage fund and three closed-end bond funds under the American Government name, all of which have had similarly bad performance.
These funds are in the government category because they invest in federally insured mortgages. But that protects only against default by homeowners, not declines in market value.
Mr. Kohler said that the fund would continue the same unusual strategy with only a few modifications. Any new money invested in the fund, including that of Piper, will be used to buy new short-term Treasury securities, which will reduce the fund's interest rate sensitivity somewhat. And it has slightly decreased its participation in the so called roll market, in which the fund agrees to buy mortgage securities on a certain date in the future in return for a fee from a securities dealer. These trades are a form of leverage because the fund can make or lose money on these positions, which it has committed to but not yet actually bought.

HEADLINE: Some at Fed Wanted Rates To Rise Faster, Reports Say

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Some of the Federal Reserve's top officials repeatedly pressed their colleagues this spring to raise interest rates faster than the central bank chose to do, according to summaries released today of their March meeting and a telephone conference call in April.
The disagreements show how strongly the Fed was committed this spring to higher interest rates, Wall Street economists said this evening. "Insofar as there's division at the Fed, there are more people wanting a more aggressive stance than a less aggressive one," said Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan. 
 Two of the 10 active members of the interest rate policy committee -- J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and Jerry L. Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland -- dissented at a meeting on March 22 from the decision to push up a short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point, feeling that a bigger increase was needed.
Three of the committee's eight meetings last year included two dissents, while four of the meetings produced unanimity. One member dissented at the other meeting last year of the panel, known as the Federal Open Market Committee.
The committee has raised rates four times this year, most recently by a half-point on Tuesday to 4.25 percent. It approved increases of a quarter-point each on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18.
In a telephone conference call on April 18, some members of the policy committee argued unsuccessfully for raising two short-term interest rates that the Fed controls instead of just one, according to a summary of that meeting. The Fed's summary did not identify these members, and no vote was taken on the decision to raise rates because interest rate changes between formal meetings in Washington are officially at the discretion of the central bank's chairman.
The minutes of the March 22 meeting even raised the prospect that the Federal Reserve may go on raising rates beyond the so-called neutral level that it has been publicly seeking. Fed officials define a neutral policy as one that uses short-term interest rates to limit growth to a rate that will not feed inflation. It is unclear how fast this neutral growth rate may be in the short run; Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has indicated in Congressional testimony that it may be 2.5 percent in the long run.
The minutes said that the members concluded in March that a neutral level of interest rates "was still some distance away, and the key issue facing the committee was not whether but how promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed."
"Whether further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation," the minutes said.
 
Pushing Up Discount Rate
 But in announcing its latest interest rate increases on Tuesday, the Fed indicated that it might not change rates again soon.
Four times this year, including this week, the Fed has raised its target for the Federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed influences this rate by buying or selling Government securities.
On Tuesday, the Fed also adopted a half-point increase in the discount rate, which the Fed charges to banks for its own overnight loans. It pushed the discount rate to 3.5 percent from 3 percent, the first change in nearly two years. The Federal funds rate and the discount rate influence the level of bank reserves, which in turn influence the level of bank loans and economic activity in the United States.
The summaries released today also indicated the Fed's lingering concerns that the economy was approaching full capacity output, and that further growth could fuel inflation. "Broad indicators of economic activity, supported by widespread anecdotal evidence, pointed to considerable momentum in economic activity and further reductions in already limited margins of unutilized labor and other production resources," said a summary of the telephone conference call on April 18.
 
Criticism of Increases
 Many Democratic members of Congress have criticized as unnecessary the increases this spring in short-term interest rates, particularly given the even sharper increases in long-term rates that have followed in financial markets.
Mr. Greenspan responded to these criticisms in a letter a week ago that was released today. He contended in the letter, to 55 members of Congress, that the rise in long-term rates was inevitable.
"To be sure, long-term interest rates moved up far more than we would have anticipated early this year," Mr. Greenspan wrote. "We had originally expected long-term interest rates to move a little higher temporarily as we tightened. The sharp jump actually experienced, in my judgment, is accounted for by a dramatic rise in market expectations of economic growth and, perhaps, associated concerns about future inflation. Given the sharp change in market perceptions of economic conditions, longer-term rates eventually would have increased nearly the same -- or perhaps even by more -- had the Federal Reserve done nothing so far this year."

HEADLINE: Coliseum Site Appraised at Less Than Developer's Offered Figure

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A preliminary appraisal of the New York Coliseum site has found that it is worth substantially less than what Mortimer B. Zuckerman has offered to pay, a finding the Giuliani administration says bolsters its assertion that the developer's $80 million price for the site is fair.
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, told a City Council subcommittee that an appaiser hired by the city last month put a tentative value of $57.5 million on the development rights to the site. That figure is $22.5 million less than what Mr. Zuckerman has agreed to pay in recent negotiations. The appraisal is based on the development of an office building on the site between 900,000 and one million square feet in size with a small retail component. 
 "This shows that the number we are talking about with Mr. Zuckerman is a low price," Mr. Dyson said after the hearings by the City Council's subcommittee for economic development. "We have never said the appaisal should set the price. But we can now assure the public and officials that we are not selling it below the market."
The appraisal company, James Felt Realty Services, is to make its final report before the end of the month.
In 1989, Mr. Zuckerman signed a contract to build a 2.1-million-square-foot complex on the Coliseum property, and agreed to pay $338 million for it. If he does not close on the deal, he stands to lose his $33.8 million down payment.
Mr. Zuckerman has argued that the original price should be lowered because of the decline in the city's real estate market. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the site, has been in negotiations with Mr. Zuckerman and the city, and has reached a tentative agreement under which the M.T.A. is to get $100 million for about half the site. That transaction would include $20 million in city subsidies.
The M.T.A. declined to join the city in having an appraisal made, saying that the process was counterproductive.
 
M.T.A. Made Inquiries
 However, Susan Fine, director of real estate for the M.T.A., told the City Council panels that the agency had made unofficial inquiries into the property's value, and had been told that the $100 million it is seeking is not unreasonable. But Ms. Fine did not identify who did these appraisals.
The Giuliani administration has pressed for a new development at the Coliseum site, saying the city needs the jobs and taxes it would generate and that it would help spur an economic recovery.
But Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes the Coliseum, has urged the city and M.T.A. to find a way to cancel the deal with Mr. Zuckerman so the project can have a fresh start.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

BYLINE: Robert Hurtado 

 BODY:

I.R.A.'s and Distributions
 
Q. As beneficiaries of my mother's individual retirement account, my siblings and I decided after she died to let it build tax-deferred interest and take distributions over our life expectancies. Is the rate of disbursement based on the life expectancy of the oldest sibling? Some funds have placed my share in an I.R.A. rollover account in my name. Is this correct?
PETER BENINATO, Portland, Ore.
 
A. The life expectancy is based on the oldest child. But the mutual fund should not have established a rollover account for you, said Helmut Soika, vice president and director of the retirement plans department at Gruntal & Company. "Only a spouse has the option of rolling over the I.R.A. assets of a decedent into his or her own I.R.A.," he explained. "The mutual fund probably didn't ask the child to establish status." 
 Designated beneficiaries other than spouses can take a lump-sum distribution or annual withdrawals based on their life expectancies. These distributions are not subject to the 10 percent penalty for withdrawals before age 59 1/2.
The mutual fund should change the account from a rollover to an inherited I.R.A. for two reasons, Mr. Soika said. "It could be challenged and disallowed by the I.R.S., and under the rules for the rollover I.R.A., the mutual fund would report distributions taken before age 59 1/2 as distributions subject to the 10 percent premature distribution penalty."
 
Price of a Living Will
 
Q. What is a fair professional fee for the preparation and execution of a living will?
SID KAPLAN, Southold, L.I.
 
A. According to lawyers listed with the Legal Referral Service, fees can range from nothing for longtime clients to about $200. Under New York State law, doctors are not required to follow a living will, which describes what medical procedures you want in case of extreme illness. A health care proxy, which designates someone to make health care decisions for you, may be desirable as well.
Lawyers frequently prepare both documents and a power of attorney, which names someone to handle your finances if you cannot, for a few hundred dollars. The New York State Department of Health offers a free proxy form, as do many hospitals. Choice In Dying, a New York nonprofit organization, supplies standard forms for living wills and proxies at no charge, (212) 366-5540.
 
Rating Bank Safety
 
Q. I am concerned that the banks and savings and loans with the best rates are the most unstable and precarious. Where can I find rating information on institutions?
CARROLL H. WALKER, Manhattan
 
A. The highest yields are not necessarily offered by weak institutions, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla.
Veribanc Inc., in Wakefield, Mass., will provide data on the financial soundness of an institution for $10, and $5 for each additional bank, (800) 442-2657. The Standard & Poor's Corporation will provide credit ratings at no charge, (212) 208-1527.

HEADLINE: George Gregory Jr., 88, Athlete And a Civic Leader in Harlem

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
George Gregory Jr., the nation's first black All America basketball player, who was later a New York City civil service commissioner and a civic leader in Harlem, died on May 11 at his Manhattan apartment. He was 88.
 The cause was colon cancer, said his wife, Helen Gregory. 
 Mr. Gregory was the captain and star center of the Columbia University basketball team during its 1930-31 season, when the school won its first championship of what was then known as the Eastern Intercollegiate League, the forerunner of the Ivy League.
 During his senior year, college basketball made its debut in Madison Square Garden, and the Columbia team compiled a record of 21 wins and two losses. He was selected an All America by several national sports groups of that era.
 A scholarship student in college, Mr. Gregory, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall, also supported himself by working as a red cap at Pennsylvania Station, which he referred to at that time as "The Leather Factory."
 While still an undergraduate, he became the boys' director for the Harlem Center of the Children's Aid Society. That pointed him toward a career devoted to fighting juvenile delinquency and promoting civil rights.
 
A $150 Season
 After graduating from Columbia, he earned a law degree at night from St. John's University while playing for several semi-professional basketball teams. In his best season he made a total of $150.
 Starting in 1931 and continuing for the next 22 years, Mr. Gregory directed settlement houses and youth clubs like the Harlem Youth Center and the Forest Neighborhood House in the Bronx. He was a founding member of the New York City Youth Board in 1947.
 He was a commissioner on the Municipal Civil Service Commission from 1954 to 1968, and a well-known figure in local Democratic politics. He championed urban redevelopment in Harlem and increased job opportunities for blacks, and was instrumental in starting public jazz concerts and art exhibitions there.
 
Planning Board Chairman
 From 1950 to 1965, during a period when $400 million in public works projects were undertaken in Harlem, Mr. Gregory was chairman of the Community Planning Board 10 in the office of the Manhattan Borough President.
 From 1968 to 1970 Mr. Gregory was an assistant administrator of what now is named the Department of Environmental Protection. He retired in 1970.
 He is survived by his wife, of Manhattan; a daughter, Ginette Gregory Wylie of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BONDS;
Some Municipals Offer Double-Digit Returns

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
THE battering of the municipal bond market has obscured some very good news for investors. Buyers of intermediate-term issues in high-tax states like New York and California may now get after-tax returns of more than 10 percent a year.
Given the uncertainty in the financial markets, these fixed returns look irresistible to some taxpayers. "People who have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for yields to increase are moving into the market," said George D. Friedlander, managing director and retail fixed-income strategist for Smith Barney Shearson. 
 Retail sales of intermediate-term issues, with maturities of 5 to 15 years, have risen since April, Mr. Friedlander said. Long-term issues, which he defined as anything longer than 15 years, are less popular.
The incentive to go long is small indeed. For 15-year issues, the average yield is 6 percent before taxes, and for long-term issues, only a fraction of a percentage point higher, Mr. Friedlander said. "The long intermediates probably have the best risk-reward," he said. That is because issues of more than 15 years may erode in value if interest rates keep rising.
 Because income from municipals is free from taxes, people in high-tax areas have the most to gain. For a New Yorker in the 36 percent Federal tax bracket, who is paying nearly 44 percent when city and state taxes are included, a New York municipal bond yielding 6 percent produces a tax-equivalent return of 10.7 percent a year -- not bad when double-digit returns seem gone with the 1980's.
 Investors concerned about inflation and rising interest rates can move down the maturity scale to reduce risk. Ten-year municipals are yielding an average of 5.5 percent and 5-year bonds about 5 percent.
When municipal bonds hit bottom last October, 30-year insured issues were yielding only 5.2 percent, according to Municipal Market Data of Boston. Yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, began inching up late in the year as the economy grew stronger. The market feared that economic growth would fuel inflation and reduce the value of fixed-income investments.
When the Federal Reserve began nudging up short-term interest rates in February, "the market started going south in earnest," Mr. Friedlander said. The ensuing rounds of tightening by the Fed have pushed down prices further.
The price declines were exaggerated by mutual funds, which had been the biggest buyers of long-term municipals in recent years. When their returns turned negative, funds sold shares to weather redemptions.
The Fed's latest action, raising two key interest rates on Tuesday, may stabilize the market. "The market got the 50-basis-point rise they were looking for," Mr. Friedlander said. "It may not be the last increase, but it was an important one."
 Now may be the time to buy individual municipal issues. The market is expected to grow much stronger in 1995 and 1996 because of a surge of issues 10 years earlier.
New issues rose from $102 billion in 1984 to $207 billion in 1985 and $151 billion in 1986, before dropping back to $105 billion in 1987. Many of them have 10-year "call protection," meaning issuers cannot cancel the debt until that many years have elapsed.
When the bonds issued in 1985 and 1986 are called, their investors will find themselves with significant amounts of cash. Reinvestments in the municipal market will probably soar, pushing up prices.
Shortages are already cropping up in some states, Mr. Friedlander said. He advises investors who have specific requirements -- credit quality, state of issuance, maturity or yield -- to ease into the market now rather than wait for the absolute best yield.

The Essential Mac

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Mac phoned last weekend with "great news." The bank had just cut the monthly payments due on his adjustable-rate mortgage.
This was not great news, of course. It was terrible news, but I didn't tell Mac. The truth about his situation might drive the poor guy over the edge. That truth is: Mac is the Federal Reserve Board's chief economic barometer. 
 I have it straight from Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman. Back when the Fed cut interest rates way down I asked Alan what had got into him and his fellow bankers.
"Nothing got into us," he said. "It's the nothing getting into Mac lately that told us it was time to cut rates."
To put it in non-economist talk, Mac hadn't had a job for so long that after raiding his savings to pay the mortgage he couldn't afford enough groceries to save the American supermarket industry from bankruptcy.
In short, when Mac doesn't eat the Fed knows it's time to cut interest rates.
The cut starts the mighty engine of capitalism roaring again. Builders start building again. Grocers start seeing the gourmet-food counters swept bare again.
In Wall Street the bulls and bears buy and sell again with joy. At sundown they raise glasses to Mac, whose dietary deficiency has moved the Fed to cry, "Let happy days be here again!"
Since that great day when the Fed slashed the rate so Mac could put the grocery business back on its feet, the Fed has raised the interest rate four times.
"Why, Alan?" I asked Greenspan.
"We ordered the first hike after hearing Mac had bought new underwear and was talking about buying a new pair of shoes."
If this sort of thing kept up, Alan explained, Mac could soon be buying new jeans. Then it would be new socks. Who could say Mac wouldn't go all the way and buy a new shirt?
"So we raised the rate a tiny bit. Just enough to let Mac know the Fed was watching, so he'd better mind his step. Could you blame us?"
"Absolutely not, Alan," I said. "The Fed couldn't let Mac destroy the American economy."
"Well, Mac refused to take the hint. Improved diet and new underwear weren't enough for him. He went right ahead and bought the jeans, bought the socks and bought the shirt."
What choice did the Fed have? It plunked him gently with another interest-rate hike. And what did Mac do?
Took a pretty good job. He hadn't been able to find one since the great leaning-down of the corporate lean-and-mean era had filled the unemployment lists with thrown-away talent. Now the minute he saw a good job open up he took it, with selfish disregard for the health of the economy.
Suddenly Wall Street's bulls and bears hated Mac for no longer being unemployed. He was threatening the American economy with a labor shortage which would inflate their money. Then happy days would be here again no longer.
Naturally the Fed had to put Mac back into his place at the unemployment compensation claims window or see the economy collapse and all Wall Street burst into tears.
"We figured a third boost in the interest rate would settle Mac's hash," Greenspan said. "Or to be more precise, would make Mac willing to settle for hash."
But Mac didn't respond. As a mere lad, he had been so deeply imbued with the American work ethic that he refused to quit working, even to save his nation's economy from collapse and Wall Street's bulls and bears from doubled doses of Prozac.
When he phoned with his "great news" about a reduction in mortgage payments, I immediately knew the worst. He was leaving Alan and the others at the Fed no way out. They would have to deliver "the big Mac," as I've heard Alan call it -- an interest rate hike that will have him hocking all those fancy new clothes if he wants firewood to get through next winter.
His mortgage payment of course will soon go stratospheric, ending his impulses to buy a 1955 Hudson and put new tires on it.
If you're reading this, Mac, cheer up. You tell the Fed what it has to do next. Sure it's tough giving up a chance to see if you could make the old Hudson go, but America's future rests on yours -- a bit heavily, it's true, but life's never easy for heroes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fights to Stymie Iraqi Compliance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is wrong on many of the issues he addresses in "Wobbly on Iraq" (Op-Ed, April 28). For example: 
 * The number of countries and people calling for a change in policy toward Iraq, particularly for lifting economic sanctions without delay, cannot be described as a mere "some." They include many Security Council member states, many Arab states and Iraq's neighbors Jordan and Turkey, which have also suffered the economic bite of the sanctions.
* The official statements by the Special Commission, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Secretariat on issues of Iraq's compliance contradict, rather than support, Mr. Christopher's notion that "Iraq is not now in compliance with any of the obligations the Security Council imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war."
That is why the Security Council failed to issue a statement at the end of its March 18 meeting. Many members, including three permanent ones, insist that the Council should acknowledge Iraq's progress in compliance with Security Council resolutions. It was the United States representative who opposed such acknowledgment. Mr. Christopher's assessment does not represent the views of the majority of Council members.
* As to the Kurdish issue in Iraq, between April and August of 1991 extensive and serious talks took place in Baghdad between the Government of Iraq and the leaders of six Kurdish parties, including those of Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. A comprehensive agreement was reached on such issues as the shape and extent of autonomy in the Kurdish region of Iraq, the participation and role of the leaders of those parties in the Government and election of a new legislative council.
As news of the agreement, to be signed for implementation in September 1991, reached Washington, the State Department told the Kurdish leaders to send a delegation to review the agreement. When the delegation, led by Mr. Talabani, arrived in Washington, Edward Djerjian, then Assistant Secretary of State, who remained in his post under Mr. Christopher, told the Kurdish delegation not to go ahead because the agreement would strengthen President Saddam Hussein. Mr. Christopher could check this in the State Department records. All witnesses to the episode are alive.
* The development projects in the marsh lowlands of southern Iraq involve drainage, land reclamation and water resources. They were conceived in the 1950's by American and British experts, and proposed to the Iraqi Government. American, British, Dutch and Russian companies were involved in the plans and their implementation in the 50's and 60's. The projects took many years and were not all completed.
The comprehensive economic blockade imposed on Iraq since 1990 has naturally had a dire impact on the food situation. Iraq was left with no alternative but a policy of self-sufficiency, especially in food production. All national resources were mobilized to complete those projects, because they would result in developing more than 1.5 million hectares of arable land.

HEADLINE: On Macedonia Border Neighbors Grow Cool

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having just returned from a trip to Skopje, Macedonia, I would like to add to your May 11 "Kriva Palanka Journal," about the United States troops participating in the United Nations peace patrol in the Balkans: 
 Three months ago, Greece not only imposed an "economic embargo" on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for its claim to the name "Macedonia," but also closed its borders to the country's two million citizens. This measure has brought political tensions between the two nations to a personal level. Macedonians can no longer vacation in Greece or even spend the day shopping as before. And Greeks, while legally free to enter Macedonia, do not make the trip for fear of retribution.
To cross the border from Greece to Macedonia is like experiencing a ghost town. The only other passengers on the train I took from Salonika to Skopje were four young American soldiers, part of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Skopje, and two Romany gypsies. The return trip was equally desolate.
This lack of contact and exchange between the people of these two bordering countries has led to hostility, friction and nationalism. Not to know your neighbor is to fear your neighbor. And while the European Court deliberates on the case against Greece brought by the European Union in response to the Greek embargo of Macedonia -- which could take two years -- individuals on both sides are becoming more and more estranged.

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:
THE MAN WHO WASN'T MAIGRET:
A Portrait of Georges Simenon
By Patrick Marnham. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.95.
This biography shows that the genius of the prolific Belgian-born novelist was perhaps fueled by his resentment toward his embittered mother. "Mr. Marnham's account of Simenon's troubled world is thorough and convincing," Tony Judt said here last year.
ANGELS & INSECTS: Two Novellas
By A. S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12.
From seances to South American entomology, the author re-creates a Victorian world of obscure preoccupations. In the first of these novellas, "Morpho Eugenia," an impoverished scholar of insects falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy amateur naturalist. The second, "The Conjugial Angel," imagines what might have become of Tennyson's sister, Emily, following the early death of her fiance, Arthur Hallam. Last year our reviewer, Wendy Lesser, said, "A. S. Byatt is a very clever woman, and 'Angels & Insects' exhibits her cleverness even more clearly than did its predecessor 'Possession.' " 

PREPARING FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
By Paul Kennedy. Vintage, $14.
The author analyzes future challenges, including drastic population increases in the third world, the growing globalization of the economy and the environmental impact both trends entail. Much of his reasoning is "a tour de force, required reading for anyone who wants to take the measure of 21st-century realities," Robert Heilbroner said here last year. International markets and the fate of capitalism are also discussed in THE AGE OF DIMINISHED EXPECTATIONS: U.S. Economic Policy in the 1990s, by Paul Krugman (MIT, $12.95), now revised and updated. In 1990 our reviewer, Peter Passell, said, "It is hard to think of another work of popular economics that asks so little of readers, yet delivers so much." It is the vast presence of information -- instantly available through computer and fax -- that is most changing the economic landscape, states Peter F. Drucker in POST-CAPITALIST SOCIETY (Harper Business, $13). Reading his book "is a bit like going to hear the star university professor on the first day of a new survey course," Adam Smith said here last year. Harper Business has also reissued Mr. Drucker's NEW REALITIES: In Government and Politics/In Economics and Business/In Society and World View ($13), in which the author argues that the role of a national government is on its way to being subsumed by civic communities. In 1989 our reviewer, Benjamin R. Barber, called it a "provocative and unashamedly subjective book."
THE TIME OF MIRACLES
By Borislav Pekic. Translated by Lovett F. Edwards. Northwestern University, $13.95.
In this novel the late Yugoslav author shows how the healing power of Christ might actually have been a curse to its biblical beneficiaries. The result is "a book of provocative brilliance," Ernst Pawel said here in 1976. Northwestern has also reissued Pekic's novel THE HOUSES OF BELGRADE, translated by Bernard Johnson ($12.95), in which the decaying mind of the narrator, a builder, mirrors the decline of his houses and of society. In 1978 one critic called it "accomplished and piquant."
THINKING OUT LOUD:
On the Personal, the Political, the Public and the Private
By Anna Quindlen. Fawcett Columbine, $12.
This collection of 87 essays from the author's Public & Private column in The New York Times explores subjects ranging from child rearing to the gulf war. In 1993 the Book Review said, "Many of them remind the reader that almost all the power and authority in the world belongs to men, and that a good reason for this state of affairs is hard to find."
SHIFTING LANDSCAPE
By Henry Roth. St. Martin's, $13.95.
This collection of stories and essays from 1925-87 captures a period in which the author was unable to write another novel, despite the success of his first book, "Call It Sleep." " 'Shifting Landscape' can only excite wonderment as an extraordinary record of . . . stubborn determination," Morris Dickstein said here in 1987.
WRITING DANGEROUSLY: Mary McCarthy and Her World
By Carol Brightman. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $18.95.
According to this biography, Mary McCarthy became successful through a combination of talent and guile, using her four husbands to gain security and free time. In 1992 our reviewer, Sharon O'Brien, praised the author's "mixture of empathy and detachment."
CRY ME A RIVER
By T. R. Pearson. Owl/Holt, $11.
A down-and-out cop tries to solve the murder of his colleague in a small Southern town, a pursuit that is as much an investigation of human nature as of evidence. The result is "a minor 'Middlemarch' in its vivid delineation of a large gallery of complex, driven figures," William T. Vollmann said here last year.
AFTER SILENCE
By Jonathan Carroll. Main Street/Doubleday, $12.
People often pay a price for love, but for Max Fischer, the toll is unusually high: he can either keep a terrible secret about his girlfriend and her 9-year-old son, or yield to his principles and lose them forever. Last year our reviewer, Linda Phillips Ashour, said their story is "so engagingly told that a reader might be tempted to put the world on hold until the very last page."
32 CADILLACS
By Joe Gores. Mysterious Press/Warner, $5.50.
This novel brings together the King of the Gypsies, a staggering automobile scam and the author's favorite private eyes, Daniel Kearny Associates. "For originality, ingenuity and moxie, the inimitable Mr. Gores takes the Caddy," Marilyn Stasio said here in 1992.

HEADLINE: THING;
Inflatable Angst

BYLINE: By Judith Newman 

 BODY:
WHAT IT IS: A 50-inch inflatable doll called the Scream. There is also a 12-inch version called Scream Junior.
 
WHAT INSPIRED IT: "The Scream," the late-19th-century masterpiece by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. The 36-by-29-inch waxed crayon and tempera canvas of a ghoulish waif shrieking against the backdrop of a blood-red sky has become a symbol of modern angst in a century devastated by war, social upheaval, disease, famine and the ascendance of Barney. 

 
WHY: "Everybody can identify with the frustration, the tension, the sense of being overwhelmed that is part of modern existence," said Robert Fishbone, whose company, On the Wall Productions, in St. Louis, makes the inflatables. "That's what the Scream is about. Besides, it looks cool."
 
WHERE IT LOOKS COOL: College dormitories (they're popular graduation gifts) and offices -- especially in California. One was recently spotted on the passenger seat of a New York City taxi. Dave Leavy, special assistant to the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, keeps a Scream Junior perched on his desk. Jodie Foster, a woman with more than her share of unwholesome admirers, received a Scream anonymously, Mr. Fishbone said.
 
WHERE IT'S HYPER-COOL: Japan. About 50,000 of them have been sold there so far this year (compared with 25,000 in the United States). "It's kind of a tough time in Japan economically, and the Scream embodies the national angst," Mr. Fishbone said. "I guess it's hard for a lot of Japanese businessmen to cut loose."
 
GONE WITH THE WIND: Recently, a distraught New York City secretary called On the Wall Productions, demanding the company ship her an inflatable Scream immediately. It seems the woman had wanted to air out the office while her boss was away on business -- and the boss's Scream was sucked out the window.
 
WHY ACQUIRE A SCREAM? About half the people who buy an inflatable Scream don't realize it was inspired by a famous painting, Mr. Fishbone said. But sales of the inflatable figure soared in the United States after the original painting was stolen from the National Art Museum in Oslo on Feb. 12. The break-in took all of 50 seconds and was recorded on a video camera; the thieves left behind a postcard that said, "Thanks for the poor security."
 Anti-abortion activists in Norway, who had adopted "The Scream" as a symbol of their movement, said they would arrange the safe return of the painting if Norway's state television broadcast "The Silent Scream," a propagandist film depicting an abortion. But on May 9 the painting was recovered in a hotel in Asgardstrand, Norway, and three international art thieves were arrested after trying to sell it for $410,000 to undercover police officers.
 
THE PRIMAL PRICE: The Scream retails for about $28 (Scream Junior, $11) at gift stores and novelty shops. Had the thieves made their deal, they could have bought 14,643 Screams.
 
CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES: Macaulay Culkin, Kate Moss.
 
RECENT MEDIA APPEARANCES: On "Murphy Brown" and "Bob." And in The New Yorker, side by side with Elvis in a piece by Bobbie Ann Mason titled "All Shook Up."
 
SCREAM AS MEDIA PUNDIT? When he was with CBS, the correspondent Robert Krulwich talked about the possibility of world recession while surrounded by a troika of inflatable Screams.
 
WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE: On the Wall Productions also sells a companion figure for Scream Junior called Little Happy Guy, a 12-inch yellow smiley-face figure with outstretched arms and legs. "He doesn't sell nearly as well as Scream Junior," Mr. Fishbone said. Welcome to the 90's.

Queens West: Why Not Something Great?

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
NEXT MONTH, GROUND WILL be broken on Queens West, the 74-acre residential and commercial development on a spectacular waterfront site across the East River from United Nations headquarters. By fall, construction is expected to begin on the project's first building, a 39-story apartment building designed by Cesar Pelli. A lot of planning has gone into this $2.3 billion project, and it has produced some excellent features. With the river at its doorstep, the Manhattan skyline for a backdrop and Grand Central Terminal just one subway stop away, Queens West is shaping up to be a wonderful place to live.
But for those concerned about the vitality of architecture in New York, Queens West may turn out to be a disturbing place to visit. Like Battery Park City, the project provides a framework in which individual buildings can be joined together in a cohesive urban whole. What it has yet to do is address one of Battery Park City's most conspicuous shortcomings: its failure to nurture the architectural creativity that could bring the urban whole to life. The shortcoming is not limited to Battery Park City. New York has seen few buildings of genuine distinction arise in recent years. The issue raised by Queens West is whether the public sector has a responsibility to revive an art form that has languished in historical pastiche. 
 Queens West, which is sponsored by a triad of government agencies (the New York State Urban Development Corporation, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York), will be one of the biggest and most visible in a string of recent real estate development partnerships between the public and private sectors. Conceived 10 years ago, at the height of the real estate boom, the project was originally planned to accommodate back office space, along with some luxury housing. Subsequently retooled in response to recessionary realities, the final plan envisions a residential development for people with high, middle and low incomes. The commercial component has been reduced to a cluster of three office towers and a hotel.
As at Battery Park City and the redevelopment of 42d Street, an Urban Development Corporation subsidiary has provided a master plan, infrastructure, public amenities and overall supervision. Private firms will develop individual plots in accordance with the master plan. At Queens West, there are 19 such parcels, stretching along a mile and a half of waterfront. These will be developed incrementally, as the economy permits. Overall, the site is about three-quarters the size of Battery Park City, roughly the size of Riverside South, Donald Trump's planned development on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. And like both projects, Queens West aspires to quality in architecture and urban design.
The Queens West master plan, prepared by the New York architecture firms Beyer Blinder Belle and Gruzen Samton, recalls a number of Battery Park City's most prominent features. The four commercial towers will be flanked on the north and south by residential neighborhoods. Streets from the Queens grid system will be extended onto the site to create continuity with the adjacent community of Hunters Point and provide "view corridors" toward the river and the skyline beyond. A waterfront esplanade, plaza and a generous network of community parks, all intelligently designed by Lee Weintraub and Thomas Balsley, will provide the area with 28 acres of beautifully landscaped areas for strolling and recreation. Public artworks will adorn them.
Queens West is by no means a carbon copy of Battery Park City. Perhaps the most conspicuous difference is the 17-acre waterfront park, which will preserve the ragged edge, the spatial variety and even some old industrial relics of the existing waterfront. Two big gantry cranes will grace the plaza with ready-made arches. Shopping will be dispersed along a central avenue that curves to maximize river views. Towers will peak along this spine, descending in height toward the waterfront and the existing community on both sides. At the southern tip of the site, wedge-shaped buildings will form a circular cluster.
But the design guidelines architects must follow are clearly descended from those devised for Battery Park City in 1979. They will encourage the design of buildings that recall the architecture of prewar New York. Towers will sit on bases designed to maintain traditional street walls. Walls are to be of earth-colored stone, masonry or tile. Metal panels, reflective glass and dark tinted glass are banned. Air-conditioning and other rooftop equipment must be screened behind distinctive building tops. In Queens West, as at Battery Park City, architecture will reside chiefly in the manipulation of the building skin to create a harmonious urban image.
There is no better building skin manipulator in the business than Cesar Pelli, and his design sets a high standard for what can be achieved within the guidelines. If Queens West's architecture is supposed to look backward, one may as well look back at the best, and Mr. Pelli's design, a bow-front tower clad with a vibrantly patterned red, orange and light-yellow brick facade, is a sophisticated echo of Rockefeller Center. Shallow vertical setbacks, terminating in balconies, evoke the RCA -- now G.E. -- Building's sleekly modulated wings, while horizontal bands of contrasting brick, set off by vertical columns of windows, recall unexecuted studies for the building's skin. The result is a more robust, contoured version of the understated (and underrated) apartment tower that Mr. Pelli designed for the Museum of Modern Art in 1985.
But what if you don't think that architecture should resemble a prewar icon? What if you think that architects ought to look to the present for inspiration? And what is the responsibility of the public sector, in these public-private partnerships, to support architecture that breaks the mold?
Battery Park City's 1979 master plan was a superlative idea for its time, even a visionary one. It emerged from a unique convergence of commercial and architectural interests. The Battery Park City Authority had a responsibility to make a financial success of a troubled property. Faced with a history of doomed, aggressively modern designs, the authority determined to create buildings of proven popular appeal.
Its decision to model the design guidelines after places like Gramercy Park and Gracie Square was not based on some abstract idea of beauty or urbanism. Indeed, the abstraction of modern architecture is what they were trying to get away from. The authority modeled the guidelines after places where people wanted to live and were willing to pay a high price for the privilege. If Gramercy Park was a desirable place to live, a place that resembled Gramercy Park would attract paying customers.
At the same time, Battery Park City's esthetic judgments were driven by something more than hard-line economics. In the 1970's, many architects were also looking to popular taste for esthetic guidance. One of the core ideas of post-modernism was that architects had to get off the "Fountainhead" kick of disregarding public preference. The popularity of places like Gramercy Park was not just an index to commercial values. It was a sign of social values as well. By learning from places with popular appeal, architects hoped to re-establish their connection with a public that had grown intolerant of modern architecture's Promethean stance.
Fifteen years later, however, the defect in this logic has become more apparent. Popularity and social value are not the same thing. Sometimes the socially valuable thing to do is to resist the idea of proven popularity -- not for the sake of defiance but to test ideas from which the public might benefit. It is far from clear, moreover, that the way to the public's heart is to cast new parts of the city in the image of old ones. If people choose to live in the older urban centers today, that is partly because they value them as places where new ideas are born, where the atmosphere vibrates around the possibility that some new form of beauty or meaning will emerge in a painting, a book, a song.
Though Battery Park City was valuable as a corrective to modern urbanism, it did not cultivate a creative atmosphere for architecture. Instead, things fell into an arrangement whereby architects were expected to play it safe while public artists got to strut their creative stuff. As an experiment, the arrangement was worth testing. It was beneficial for architects to learn from past examples how to connect buildings to the street and to one another. But amid all this gracious harmony the eye searches in vain for a building that looks connected to the present. There isn't one building with something fresh or stimulating to say about urban life today, the way the United Nations complex embodied the aspirations of the postwar world.
SINCE THE 1970'S, AS government money for housing and urban development has dwindled, public-private partnerships have become increasingly instrumental in defining the city's future. These partnerships ought to be begging our best architects to reckon with that future. The sympathetic support that the public sector offers artists through its Percent for Art programs should be extended to include the art of building.
One way to accomplish this would be to enlarge the public's role in the selection of architects and the approval of designs. At Battery Park City, a distinguished fine arts committee oversaw the choice of artists and their proposals. A similar panel, composed of a changing group of first-rate outside advisers, could lift the level of architecture at Queens West. Juried competitions could be organized to select the designers of some buildings, like the United Nations office building that Queens West hopes to attract to the site.
It is true that the sponsors of large developments like Queens West must deal with community boards and public officials who are not invariably receptive to new ideas. They must also deal with developers who resent being told what to do. These forces can be formidable deterrents to creativity, and it's no use pretending that esthetics will take priority over economics on the agenda of an agency like the Urban Development Corporation. By the same token, it would be foolish to mistake an economic success for an esthetic triumph. And that is the risk of repeating a formula that is 15 years old.

The Many Faces Of Goya, In Miniature

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
ALMOST EVERY AGE HAS wanted Goya for its own. The Romantics saw him as a kindred spirit, which he was. Then the Realists adopted him as Everyman's champion, which he was, too, up to a point. The Symbolists embraced him. The Surrealists claimed him for obvious reasons, the Existentialists for less obvious ones, even the fascist Franco because Goya was Spanish and patriotic and the servant to a succession of rulers. Most recently, a major traveling exhibition in 1989 served up Goya the liberal, a figure more in tune with post-Franco Spain.
Goya is too complex an artist to fit neatly into any of these slots, and it comes almost as a relief that "Goya: Truth and Fantasy," here at the Royal Academy, doesn't try. It celebrates him simply as a brilliant painter. The show, organized by Norman Rosenthal of the Academy, Manuela Mena Marquez of the Prado and the Goya scholar Juliet Wilson-Bareau, is one of the most pleasurable exhibitions in a long time. (It remains on view through June 12, then travels to the Art Institute of Chicago in July.) 
 It is also out of proportion in its impact to the size of the 87 works on view: at their biggest, they're about three feet by one foot, and at their tiniest, two inches square. Goya produced small paintings throughout his career, sometimes as sketches for the famous tapestries, frescoes and larger canvases, but often as independent "cabinet" pictures. While recovering from the illness that left him stone-deaf, he wrote in 1794 in a letter to a friend that "to occupy my imagination, which has been depressed through dwelling on my misfortunes, and to compensate at least in part for some of the considerable expenses I have incurred, I set myself to painting a series of cabinet pictures in which I have been able to depict themes that cannot usually be addressed in commissioned works, where caprice and invention have little part to play."
That's just what one sees in many of the works in this show, an artist whose imagination has been liberated. And there has never been an imagination quite like it, of course, at least not one expressed in such exalted visual terms. Goya's themes include torture, rape, murder, highway robbery, shipwreck, cannibalism, mental collapse, witches, monsters, religious persecution, blood sport and war.
He also did devotional scenes of a saccharine sweetness, portraits and images of figures in the landscape. It's impossible to call an exhibition devoted exclusively to small paintings a proper retrospective, but it is remarkably close to one in terms of the broad range of subjects covered and the levels on which Goya's genius is revealed -- as colorist, polemicist, ironist, humorist, dramatist.
You can appreciate his hand here in a way you can't always in the bigger works. His touch tends to be more intimate, more delicate and more spontaneous, although astonishingly precise. One of his masterpieces is the comparatively big sketch for "The Meadow of San Isidro," which packs into a canvas no more than 15 inches by 36 inches a panoramic view of Madrid, anchored by the great dome of San Francisco el Grande, as a backdrop for hundreds of picnickers, dancers, animals, carriages and tents. Goya describes every building and every figure in the most economical yet exact way, down to the microscopic Madrilenos who have crossed the distant Segovia bridge and are wending their way toward the meadow.
You can also see in this exhibition the amplifying mordancy and the weight of cumulative despair that characterize his long career. At the same time he was constantly experimenting with, and adapting to, new ideas. He was a slow starter. He began as a painter of light palette and light spirit, inflected by contemporaneous Italian art's use of light as a way to sculpture and vivify space. The show's first work, an important recent discovery, is a rapid sketch of Hannibal crossing the Alps, which he submitted to a competition in Parma, Italy, in 1771. Some of the details of Goya's early life are unclear. It's known that he traveled to Italy in 1770, when he was 24, but not known precisely what he did there (another recent discovery, of a sketchbook from his Italian period, helps). He began to receive commissions once back in Spain.
In 1786 HE WAS APPOINTED PAINTER to the King of Spain, and in 1799 he became First Court Painter. He was already 53. It is testimony to his grasp of power, as well as to his gifts as a painter, that he survived the upheavals of the war with France, the persecutions of liberals, and the changes on the throne, to negotiate his own exile from the repressive Spain of Fernando VII and settle in France. He died in 1828 in Bordeaux.
It was during these last years that he painted his bold and free ivory miniatures. They are light on dark, so that the forms stand out in dramatic relief, and as peculiar as almost anything he ever did, while charming. There is a man eating leeks, another scouring for fleas in his shirt, a curious couple, a monk admonishing an old woman.
Scores of other works in the exhibition are so beautifully painted you find yourself swept away despite what they depict: the baroque and gory morass of bulls, horses and bullfighters, set against static rows of black-capped spectators in "Death of a Picador"; the sumptuous conflagration that illuminates the rush of panicked bodies in "Fire at Night"; the twilight series of bandit attacks whose images of rape and murder touch the rawest possible nerve in the most intense possible way.
Goya was a very great portraitist, but not all the portraits here are great. The finest is surely the full-length one of himself before an easel, light flooding in from behind through a huge window, a narrow-brimmed hat on his head with candleholders all around it (so that he could continue to work when it got dark). This is Goya just as you imagine him -- intense, alert, powerful and incisive.
Who was he, in the end? A court artist of the oppressed who freelanced for the bourgeoisie and the nobility. A student of the past, indebted to the likes of Velazquez and Rembrandt, but in many respects also a century ahead of his time. "Goya's 'continuity' insofar as we can know it," writes Janis Tomlinson in a new monograph, "is his vital drive to explore and exploit the potential of his own creativity." The one unimpeachable Goya, as you see time and again in this handsome exhibition, is Goya the virtuoso.

A New San Francisco Is Growing Downtown

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
EVERY morning on the Yerba Buena Gardens Esplanade, a block south of Market Street and four blocks from San Francisco's financial district, dozens of elderly people from a neighboring apartment complex, most of them Chinese, can be seen performing tai chi exercises.
They are a fitting symbol of how San Francisco has succeeded in its attempt to retain its multicultural heritage while redeveloping decaying neighborhoods. 
 Yerba Buena Gardens, a rolling five-and-a-half-acre site that opened in October 1993 after decades of frustration and litigation that delayed one of the nation's biggest urban renewal projects, is helping to transform a deteriorating area of the city without destroying its livability or turning it into a sterile high-rise ghetto.
For more than 30 years the 19-block Yerba Buena area was a legal and political battleground as the city struggled over ways to redevelop the downtown neighborhoods that lie between Market Street and the bay.
Home to the urban poor, retired sailors and longshoremen in the 60's, 70's and 80's, more recently the south-of-Market Street neighborhoods have become a trendy evening spot for the young and hip, with a variety of music clubs and dozens of restaurants. They have also become home to a burgeoning multimedia business, including small production houses that design interactive computer software, recasting the faded industrial lofts into low-cost office space.
In the 70's, San Francisco's Redevelopment Agency planned to transform the Yerba Buena area with high rises and a sports arena. Instead, after a political and legal battle that resulted in a new multicultural focus for the area, the $44 million Center for the Arts, designed by Fumihiko Maki and James Stewart Polshek, was opened last October. The center presents a diverse program of music, dance, theater and visual arts exhibitions.
The center is composed of two buildings, a theater and galleries intended to fulfill the same role as Lincoln Center in New York. The 755-seat theater is one of the best equipped in northern California, and the Arts Forum has three separate galleries and a large room designed for dance performances and receptions that is already fully booked through this year.
Next to the Esplanade, an oval walkway at the center of Yerba Buena Gardens, is a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. the work of the sculptor Houston Conwill, the poet Estella Majoza and the architect Joseph De Pace. Twelve shimmering glass panels are placed behind a 50-foot-wide, 20-foot-high waterfall; each of the panels is engraved with quotations from Dr. King's writings and speeches.
Set next to the city's Moscone Convention Center, the Yerba Center, which includes the gardens and the performing arts center, is still a work in progress. A cinema complex with a 12-screen theater and a giant-screen Imax theater as well as shops and restaurants is being developed next to Yerba Buena Gardens. In late 1996 a Children's Center is to open atop the Moscone Center with a large skating rink, bowling center, garden and carousel.
To the north of the center the redevelopment agency plans a 28-story office tower and retail shopping center scheduled to be completed in 1998.
The center is rapidly becoming a magnet for other institutions. Just across the street, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is scheduled to open next January. The work of the architect Mario Botta, the 225,000-square-foot building will have a steel-and-glass skylight mounted at 45 degrees on a granite-banded cylindrical turret to permit sunlight to pour into the museum's atrium.
The California Historical Society, the Mexican Museum and the Jewish Museum are all planning future sites in the area. Current neighbors include the Ansel Adams Center, 250 Fourth Street, a photographic museum with a permanent exhibit of Adams work, and Opts Art, next to the Adams Center, a gallery for contemporary art primarily from northern California.

'Mostly' Is A Hard Act To Follow

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL, WHICH begins its 28th season in July, has entered the endangered-species list; this summer could be one of its last. Peculiarly, Lincoln Center is sharpening its knives even though the festival seems healthy and robust. Last season, the festival's 39 New York concerts (which were followed by a tour to Tokyo) earned $1.9 million in ticket sales, the second-highest sum in its history; it played to nearly 90 percent of capacity in Avery Fisher Hall. And some of the programming for this season is appealing: Joshua Rifkin conducts Bach's B-minor Mass, Gerard Schwarz leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and performers include Hans Vonk, Vladimir Feltsman, Martha Argerich, Hermann Prey and Shura Cherkassky.
But since 1992, the festival has been operating under a shadow of Mozart-weariness. That summer, a year after its triumphant 25th anniversary, Mostly Mozart seemed a desultory affair, sweeping up crumbs left by Lincoln Center's 19-month commemoration of the bicentennial of the composer's death. Both festivals were heartily attacked in these pages for their lack of imagination. And last summer, the less effective programs were taken as further evidence of sclerosis. 
 So we critics may have contributed to the discontent. But the impulse to replace the festival owes little to the wishes of critics. Even Lincoln Center constituents like the New York Philharmonic, which is seeking a summer home, are mere bystanders. The impulse derives from Nathan Leventhal, the center's president, and Jane S. Moss, its vice president for programming. Mr. Leventhal viewed the Mozart bicentennial extravaganza as a pioneering venture in uniting the center's disparate institutions; he wants to explore similar projects. Ms. Moss was hired to reshape programming as the center seeks to create a distinctive identity.
The Mostly Mozart Festival is an obstacle to both goals. It has little to do with the center's tenant institutions; its style seems almost old-fashioned. It started with a proposal for a monthlong series of Mozart concerts made in 1965 by Jay K. Hoffman, a press agent and impresario. William Schuman, then the president of Lincoln Center, acted quickly, and the festival made its debut in 1966 as "Mid-Summer Serenades: A Mozart Festival."
In its first decade, the festival had a remarkable impact, creating an informal yet serious atmosphere, introducing neglected works and gifted artists, and spawning imitators. In 1975, 31 concerts over five weeks brought in $347,000 at the box office, filling the hall to 82 percent of capacity. Lincoln Center's statistics showed a predominantly young audience: 43 percent were under 35, 20 percent under 25.
Something changed radically during the early 80's. By 1985, only 16 percent of listeners were under 35; 67 percent were over 45. Another survey will be conducted this summer, but a Lincoln Center official said he expected similar results. The festival now resembles the rest of the concert world.
One reason may be the change in ticket prices. In the first summer, every seat cost $3; in 1975, the price was $4.95 (10 tickets for $37.50): rates competitive with the cost of recordings or movie tickets. There were no hierarchies in seat locations or premiums based on the status of soloists. But prices climbed in the 80's, and they now vary throughout the hall and from concert to concert, peaking at $40. The increase reflects a broad change in concert economics: administrative costs, soloists' fees and orchestra salaries have risen steeply (in some cases, outrageously) in the last 20 years. The orchestra, formerly a pickup group, was given a contract. Mr. Schwarz was named musical adviser in 1982 and music director in 1984, further professionalizing the festival.
MEANWHILE, THE FOUNDATIONS HAVE been shifting underfoot. The classical tradition has come to seem less central to American culture; it is difficult to imagine young audiences today flocking to hear the "Elvira Madigan" Concerto.
So there may be profound reasons for Lincoln Center's discontent that have nothing to do with Mostly Mozart. The center yearns for a "young audience." It wants to have as great an impact on the scene now as this festival did in the 60's and 70's. Mostly Mozart's current financial and artistic successes are irrelevant when faced with these ambitions. Those goals may, however, be beyond satisfaction. The "young audience" either no longer exists or cannot afford current prices. The cultural impact sought cannot be found right now with the classical repertory.
Two options being discussed are a theater and dance festival in the New York State Theater, and four weeks of concerts by the New York Philharmonic. No one at Lincoln Center would describe the possible content of such events. But it is difficult to imagine that any replacement short of a New York version of the Salzburg Festival could please audiences, programmers and critics while justifying the demise of a successful enterprise. There are other options: Mostly Mozart can be improved, revised, even expanded, without being discarded; moreover, outside Avery Fisher Hall, in a Lincoln Center that is dark during the summer, there are opportunities for supplementary, inexpensive celebrations. Lincoln Center may also have a brilliant proposal up its sleeve. Otherwise, though, we should all just grit our teeth and resign ourselves to the continuing glories of Mozart.

Istanbul

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; ALAN COWELL is the head of the Rome bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
In a world that is changing rapidly, Istanbul retains a flavor of the exotic that seems increasingly rare, even in Turkey itself. Although the city's outer limits have been transformed by high-rises and freeways, the central core of old Istanbul remains intact: the six minarets of the Sultan Ahmet mosque, the clamorous tangle of the Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace and the spangled confines of the Bosporous itself with its shoreline villas and grand Ottoman palaces.
That is not to say, though, that the newer areas are without attraction. For Istanbul's smart set -- far more at home with Armani suits than with any vestigial memory of the fez -- the city's residential spread onto the eastern shoreline of the Bosporous provides the setting for some of the trendiest new discos and restaurants. 
 And, with the expanding Istanbul International Festival offering theater, classical music and jazz from May through July, the city is also striving to carve a place on a cultural circuit offering a range of drama, opera and ballet.
Yet, for some long-time visitors, the charm of the city is still its simpler offerings -- the ferry ride on the Bosporous to the fish restaurants of its northernmost settlements, or just browsing through the wares of rug dealers, enjoying the bargaining without a commitment to buy.
To all this, though, there is a serious word of warning. Kurdish separatists have exploded two bombs in the Grand Bazaar this year and have threatened a war on tourism similar to that waged in Egypt by Muslim fundamentalists. There is, so far, no State Department warning urging Americans to stay away from Istanbul, but it would be imprudent to travel there if the attacks continued.
Less seriously, the Turkish lira is tumbling against the dollar and many of the more expensive restaurants and hotels quote prices in dollars or adjust their lira price every week to account for this. The tumbling lira helps Americans in places that quote their prices in Turkish lira, like many restaurants, but not big hotels that are priced in dollars.
 
 
Events
 The dominant event in this year's Istanbul calendar is the Istanbul Festival, which started in April with a movie section, moved on to theater, classical music from June 15 to July 21 and ends with jazz from July 10 to 25.
Much of the programming, particularly for the later part of the festival, is still provisional. For precise listings closer to performance time, The Guide, a bimonthly Istanbul publication (telephone 264 25 27) costing around $2, promises details.
The classical section (258 32 12) offers an array of works by Brahms, Wagner and Beethoven, played by several orchestras including the Dresden Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Kirov Opera and Chorus, all at St. Irene's Church on the grounds of the Topkapi Palace. Ticket prices range from $10 to $25. Soloists giving recitals at St. Irene's include the flutist James Galway and the cellist Julian Lloyd Weber. The Ballet National de Marseille and the Spanish Ballet of Clara Romana are both set to perform in Istanbul's Open Air Theater between June 24 and 29.
The jazz program at the Open Air Theater, Harbiye, Istanbul, between July 10 and 25 promises performances by a wide range of jazz and rock artists including the Bobby McFerrin trio, Gary Moore, Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Neil Young.
 
 
Sightseeing
 Many of Istanbul's traditional sights are in the Sultan Ahmet district, where the mosque itself, the former basilica of Hagia Sophia, now a museum (open 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., entrance fee around $1, closed Monday), the Topkapi Palace (9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., entrance fee $1.50, closed Tuesday) and the Grand Bazaar (9 A.M. to 7 P.M., no entrance fee, closed Sunday) are all within easy walking distance of one another.
With crowded sidewalks and too much traffic, Istanbul is not really a walker's city, so it comes as something of a relief that city authorities have broadened the sidewalks around the Sultan Ahmet district. And, innovatively, Istiklal Caddesi, the main shopping street running from Taksim Square down toward the Bosporous, has been turned into a pedestrian area with a turn-of-the-century tramline running down its middle. Sadly, the old Galata Bridge across the Golden Horn, with its accumulation of water-level eateries and vendors beneath it, has been replaced by a newer, more sterile version that, while more suited to the weight of Istanbul's modern traffic flows, offers none of its predecessor's bustle.
No visit to Istanbul is complete without an hour's Bosporous Ferry ride from Eminonu, the principle boat-landing on the Golden Horn near the main Sirkeci railroad station, to Rumeli Kavagi on the western bank at the northern tip of the Bosporous and Anadolu Kavagi on the eastern bank. The ferry from the Eminonu jetty at 10:35 A.M. and 1:35 P.M. and a return ticket costs just over $1. The slightly rundown vessels zigzag up the Bosporous, stopping at just about every landing on the way and giving spectacular views of the two soaring bridges connecting Europe and Asia and of the 15th-century Rumeli Hisari fortress.
Once at Rumeli Kavagi or Anadolu Kavagi there is ample time for a meal at one of many fish restaurants where a lunch of freshly caught Black Sea fish with Turkish meze (hors d'ouevres) costs between $10 and $15.
 
 
Where to Stay
 Istanbul's hotel operators seem to have concentrated in recent years on creating spectacular new places with magnificent views of the Bosporous and high prices so that there is a wide choice of top-flight accommodation. In a lower price and amenity range several hotels offer accommodations with more unusual or historic connotations, albeit at a price. The ornate Pera Palas (Tepebasi, 251 45 60, fax 251 40 89) is the same 19th-century establishment once used by travelers on the old Orient Express as they completed the European leg of their journeys farther east. Close to the American Consulate, the hotel's six suites and some of its 139 rooms have views over the Golden Horn and the minarets beyond. A double costs $180 plus tax.
Less expensive and equally quaint is the 20-room Yesil Ev (5 Kabasakal Caddesi, Sultanahmet, 517 67 85, fax 517 67 80), a restored Ottoman villa equipped throughout with period furniture from the 19th century. It lies close to the Sultan Ahmet mosque and the Topkapi palace. A double costs $125 plus tax.
Budget: Budget hotels abound in the Sultan Ahmet district, as they always have. They are generally smaller and can be rough-and-ready. Residents recommend the following:Historia (23 Amiral Tafdil Sokak, Sultanahmet, 517 74 72, fax 516 81 69), has 27 rooms costing $80 for a double plus tax, and Cordial House (8 Bayram Firin Sokak, Sultanahmet, 518 05 76, fax 516 41 08), with 10 rooms; a double is $45 plus tax.
 Luxury: In this category, the Ciragan Palace Kempinski (Ciragan, Besiktas, telephone 258 33 77, fax 259 66 86) is right on the Bosporous shoreline. Some of its suites are in a restored Ottoman palace that also houses a casino. It has 294 rooms and 29 suites. A double is $240 plus 15 percent tax for a Bosporous-view room and $210 plus tax for a view inland over a park.
The Conrad (Yildiz Bulvari, Besiktas, 227 30 00, fax 259 66 67) commands a Bosporous view from higher above the water and looks over the Yildiz Imperial gardens. Among its 627 rooms and 36 suites, a double costs $220 plus tax for a Bosporous view, and $205 plus tax for a garden view.
 
Where to Eat
 Istanbul's restaurants have boomed in recent years with the economic turnaround of the 1980's and the sudden appearance of a new middle class looking for the same sophistication they would find in Europe. At the same time, it is still possible to eat for a few dollars on a plate of doner kebab and other Turkish specialties at eateries near the main sites in Sultan Ahmet.
For the smart set, the in place is 29 (Yirmidokuz in Turkish) at Ulus Parki, Etiler (265 61 81). It has a stunning Bosporous view and the chef is French. Dinner with wine will cost a minimum of $40 a person, but, for free, visitors can watch Istanbul's see-and-be-seen crowd. Starters include seafood crepes at $6, artichokes in olive oil at $5 and smoked salmon at $8. A la carte specialties include poached sea bass (around $10), lamb fillet ($8) and a variety of kebabs and kofte meatballs at $5 to $8.
Korfez, on the Asian side of the Bosporous at 78 Korfez Caddesi, Kanlica (216-413 4314, closed Monday), is another seaside place in a similar price range. The specialty is seabass oven-roasted in layers of rock-salt above and below it. Then, when it is brought to the table, the waiters crack open the salty shell and serve the fish inside.
In a lower price range, Sureyya at 26 Istinye Caddesi, Istinye (277 58 56, closed Sunday), is one of Istanbul's old favorites, offering Russian, Turkish and European cuisine. Caviar blinis and chicken Kiev are specialties. Prices for dinner with wine start at around $25 a person.
Slightly cheaper is the Asitane in the Kariye Hotel, 18 Kariye Cami Sokak, Edirnekapi (534 84 14), next to the Church of Chora. The cuisine is known as Nouvelle Ottoman and Turkish classical music is played while you eat. Asitane offers three fixed-price menus ranging from $12 to $18 without wine and all composed of traditional Turkish cuisine. The most extensive, at $18, features an array of dishes made with olive oil, such as stuffed vegetables, followed by hot appetizers, the Sultan's Favorite veal stew on a bed of aubergine puree, salads and a choice of desserts.
For budget travelers, any number of eateries at Sultan Ahmet offer cheap doner, rice, lentil soup, beans, lamb dishes and dessert. One of the oldest is Sultanahmet Koftecisi (12A Divanyolu Caddesi, 513 14 38) known for its meatballs. The average price of a meal is around $5.
 
Shopping
 Shopping centers on the Grand Bazaar, where bargaining is routine except in those stores that display and insist on fixed prices. A canny bargainer never pays more than half the starting price, and it may be necessary to feign departure from the shop on several occasions to force prices down. Those who consider this a little undignified can, however, turn to the fixed-price stores at most up-market hotels, where prices are higher but there's more a guarantee of quality on such items as rugs, leatherware and jewelry.
Turkey has made much in recent years of its advances in the textiles business and the good quality items -- jeans and shirts -- abound, particularly in central areas such as Sisli. January and July are sale months, denoted in Turkish by the word indirim.
For those who'd like an older view of Turkish fabrics, Ottoman fabrics are on display at the Topkapi Palace from May 18 to the end of June.

HEADLINE: Seduction or Virtue?

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: Washington

 BODY:
In a town where all socializing is ultimately political, cynics might be forgiven for wondering about dinner at the Huffingtons'.
In less than two years, Representative Michael Huffington, Republican of California, and his wife, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, a biographer and television talk-show host, have been the hosts of 20 dinners with what they call "critical mass." 
 Their idea is to have a diverse group of guests, all connected to a given topic, come together to discuss it and lend their spirit of altruism to problem solving. Their goal, the Huffingtons say, is nothing less than changing the face and focus of American politics: they believe that citizen-to-citizen help could make big government obsolete.
Certainly no one has seen socially conscious dinner parties of the Huffington ilk in the capital before. Instead of the usual talk of politics and economics, the Huffingtons serve up conversations on health care, volunteerism and spirituality along with sumptuous meals amid crystal, candlelight and waiters.
And in a town that is socially bifurcated by race and income, a Huffington guest list includes not only the usual lawmakers, lawyers and business leaders, but also people like Veronica Parke, who heads a soup kitchen here called Martha's Table, and Shahrazad Ali, the author of the provocative book "The Blackman's Guide to Understanding the Blackwoman."
A conservative lion like Irving Kristol is just as likely to be at a Huffington party as is a liberal like the Hollywood producer Norman Lear. At a dinner in April on volunteerism, Hannah Hawkins, who operates a shelter for young children in the Anacostia section of Washington, was as closely listened to as Allan Luks, executive director of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of New York and author of "The Healing Power of Doing Good."
"I'd never been to anything quite like that," said Alan Keyes, a black Republican who was among the guests at a Huffington dinner on race relations. A former State Department official in the Reagan Administration, Mr. Keyes accused the Republican Party of racial bias and lack of support when he ran for the Senate from Maryland in 1992. "The range of people was unusual," he said of the dinner.
Some pundits think the Huffingtons may have tapped into a new politics of virtue, a result of Mrs. Huffington's longstanding interest in melding spirituality and politics. Mrs. Huffington's television show on the conservative National Empowerment Network here is called "Critical Mass." And her new book, "The Fourth Instinct: The Call of the Soul" (Simon & Schuster), centers on her theory that altruism is the fourth instinct, after survival, sex and power.
But others take a more pragmatic view.
They point out that Mr. Huffington, 46, who became wealthy in Texas oil, is running for the Senate seat of Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and has said he may spend as much as $15 million on the contest. Two years ago, Mr. Huffington, then a political neophyte, set a national record for a House race when he spent $5.2 million to unseat a nine-term Republican incumbent, Robert Lagomarsino, from the Santa Barbara district. Mr. Huffington doesn't discount the possibility of a run for the White House.
The Huffingtons build their dinner parties around a belief in a spiritual reformation of American life, a kind of New Age noblesse-oblige reliance on the compassion of the rich toward the less fortunate. Although that credo hasn't worked, neither sees it as a political liability.
"People can make anything look foolish," Mrs. Huffington, 43, said. "There is no point in being in politics and censoring what you believe."
Mr. Huffington, a political moderate whose Senate ambitions have the support of the Republican Party, said that he and his wife of eight years share a spiritual outlook on life and politics.
"It goes back to when we met," he said. "The first question out of my mouth when I met her in San Francisco was, 'What's the most important thing in your life?' She said, 'God.' We both believe in giving back, in a higher power, in looking at the best. I really believe that she is my soul mate."
They live in a mansion in the Wesley Heights section of Washington with their daughters, Isabella, 3, and Christiana, 5.
The first year he was in Congress, Mr. Huffington donated his salary -- $133,000 before taxes -- to the Partnership for the Children of Santa Barbara County, a bipartisan volunteer organization founded by Mrs. Huffington that helps needy children. Mr. Huffington does volunteer work and requires that members of his staff do so, too. Mrs. Huffington makes a point of working in a soup kitchen or lending a hand at a hospital while campaigning for her husband.
Jane Ikard, a longtime Washington social observer and consultant with the Joint Center for Political Studies, a research organization, said of Mrs. Huffington: "She's a brilliant girl, very personable and charming. She's a person who does instead of sitting around criticizing."
Mrs. Huffington, a ginger-haired native of Greece, was president of the Cambridge Union, a prestigious debating society at Cambridge University. Throughout each dinner, she guides the conversation, tape records it and takes notes.
"The format was like a talk show," said Frances Murphy, publisher of The Washington Afro-American newspapers in Washington and Baltimore, and a guest at the race relations dinner. "She put the subject out and gave introductory remarks and people discussed it from various angles. It was structured, but it was very, very pleasant."
The guests aren't necessarily friends or acquaintances of the Huffingtons. The dinner on race relations, for example, was put together by Mrs. Huffington and Armstrong Williams, a black conservative who is a syndicated radio talk-show host and a columnist.
Marsh Ward and Julia Lightfoot, founders of Clean and Sober Streets, a local program for homeless addicts and alcoholics, were mildly amused at being invited to the dinner in April on volunteerism. But they were soon engaged in lively conversations with James Pinkerton, a young conservative from the Bush Administration who tried to create a new approach to government and to solving social problems.
Mark A. Bloomfield, an economic consultant, who himself puts together dinners on economic topics, sees such efforts as attempts to change the "whole policy-making process in Washington."
"The way people learn and engage in debate is changing," Mr. Bloomfield said. "The Mr.-Smith-comes-to-Washington method of witness, hearing and legislation I'm not sure works anymore. Rather, it's through informal off-the-record discussions and debate."
The Huffingtons maintain that their dinners, initiated by Mrs. Huffington, are not politics as usual or even a bid to build a broad coalition of supporters for Mr. Huffington.
"Certainly, everything a spouse does that's positive helps the other spouse," Mrs. Huffington said. "But whether Michael was running for the Senate or not, I would do my show, I would have the dinners, I would do my books. These are ongoing, long-term concerns of mine and independent of Michael's career and much beyond Michael's career."
Noting that her husband has proposed legislation that would provide tax credits for people who volunteer their time, Mrs. Huffington said that the couple's quest was "how to seduce people into doing good."
Of the ultimate political goal of being in the White House, she once told a Los Angeles Times reporter: "There are many people who have been in the White House and have achieved nothing dramatic. What we are talking about is a crusade, which is so much bigger than being in the White House."

HEADLINE: Bottom-Fishing for a Manhattan Co-op

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
EVERY New Yorker has seen advertisements for co-op apartments that seem too cheap to believe. What are those apartments really like?
To find out, this reporter tried to see every apartment listed in the May 1 classified section of The New York Times that met the following guidelines: full two-bedroom apartments under $200,000, one-bedrooms under $100,000, studios under $65,000; between the Battery and 96th Street -- Manhattan's prime co-op area -- with carrying charges for two-bedrooms under $1,400 a month, one-bedrooms under $1,100, studios under $800. 
 Apartments on or below the second floor of doorman buildings were excluded as were walk-ups of more than two flights because the market for such apartments is a more specialized one.
The more than 50 apartments viewed seemed to be clustered in certain areas: around 70th Street on West End Avenue, in the Upper East Side east of Third Avenue and on the fringes of midtown, Chelsea and Murray Hill, although there were exceptions. Surprisingly, there were few apartments in the heart of Greenwich Village or in the East Village, SoHo or TriBeCa and, not surprisingly, there were none in the blocks directly off Fifth Avenue or on Central Park West.
The owners of these apartments often expressed disbelief that their apartments -- priced so low -- had not sold. But as interest rates have risen, owners and agents say, New Yorkers and would-be New Yorkers have come out in force to look at apartments all over town.
While the wealthy may delegate one real estate broker to do their looking for them, less wealthy buyers often comb the want ads themselves, visiting open houses held by owners and brokers alike and working with as many as a dozen agents.
Many of these shoppers are out for bargains. They may feel they can still find a steal, or they may be just looking. They may make an offer far below the asking price.
Many owners seemed eager to bargain further; one woman said she had told potential purchasers to "just put something on the table -- anything."
In the real estate business, bargain hunters are known as "bottom fishers" and right now there is quite a range of apartments to fish for.
The seventh-floor apartment Zelda Eden is selling is next to her current apartment at 255 West End Avenue, between 70th and 71st Streets. It is a classic prewar Upper West Side apartment: high ceilings, original moldings, a maid's half-bath off the tiled kitchen. It has a view of West End Avenue from each of its two bedrooms and a slice of the Hudson River from the living room.
Yet it hasn't sold, despite its $179,000 price.
"I've learned the hard way," Ms. Eden said. "I now put the maintenance in the ad. I now put the square footage in the ad." The maintenance is $1,025, and the apartment has 1,000 square feet.
"When I didn't list the maintenance," she said, "they'd hang up the minute they heard it. They'd hang up the minute they heard the square footage. Since it's been on the market I've heard everything: it's too small, it's too big, it's too dark and it's too light.
"One person who was single told me it was too small. When I was single I lived in a place where I could touch the sides of the living room. What do people expect for $179,000 -- 1,500 square feet and an $800 maintenance?"
ACROSS town, Bill Brandt is trying to sell his one-bedroom at 320 East 42d Street in the Tudor City complex for $99,000. The 21st-floor unit is beautifully restored and has what Mr. Brandt calls a "Euro kitchen" -- a one-piece stainless steel unit with sink, stove and refrigerator, built into about as much space as a large hall closet. There are views of midtown and plenty of sunlight.
Mr. Brandt had lived in Florida for the last few years and rented the apartment out for "about $1,400."
"It's a great location, right near the U.N.," he said, "and if I don't sell it, I'll keep renting it out. The maintenance is $720, so with the tax breaks, I'm making money, but I'd like to get it off my back."
Alfred Tomaselli, who is selling a studio at 237 East 54th Street, near the Citicorp Center and down the block from Vong, the hot French-Thai restaurant, has been running his own advertisements since August 1993.
"Once they hear the square footage they say it's just too small," he said, sitting in a pleasant but tiny studio, with a view of backyard greenery. He is asking $49,500.
"I tell them it's 325 square feet," he said. "Actually, it's smaller than that, but I want them to at least see it before turning it down."
Mr. Tomaselli, who is leaving New York City, said he initially had another obstacle besides the size: Banks would not lend money to buy studio apartments.
"I took it upon myself to locate financial institutions," he said, "so when somebody is interested I can give them some names of lenders who guarantee they will not preclude the loan based on the square footage. But it's an uphill struggle I seem to be fighting. I just can't make this apartment bigger."
Mr. Tomaselli's lament is a familiar one and, after viewing the 50 apartments offered at prices below the average -- the Halstead Property Company's statistics, for example, show the average studio in Manhattan sells for $106,570 -- it seemed that many had what might be called a fatal flaw: They were smaller than average, had higher-than-average maintenance or had badly blocked views.
Agents and owners countered with a logical argument: If they didn't have those problems they wouldn't be so cheap.
None of the apartments viewed had a location generally acknowledged to be unsafe and none were totally dark. About a dozen had obstructed views. Three overlooked a ramp to the Queens Midtown Tunnel, although, oddly enough, they were quiet, at least when the insulated windows were closed.
Then there were apartments that had drawbacks like hefty maintenance, small size or marginal location but that also had one unusual selling point: a huge common garden or roof rights. Many of these involved trading off a bargain apartment in a spectacular prewar building in a great location for a view of the courtyard of the same building or the water tower of the neighboring one.
Sometimes it appeared that the only drawback was that the building was built after World War II.
At 310 East 70th Street, between Second and First Avenues, Apartment 7E is a 1,300-square-foot two-bedroom with two full baths. Unlike many postwar apartments, it has a striking L-shaped living/dining room whose 20-foot-long wall has five double-hung aluminum windows in a row.
The windows have rare narrow moldings and muntins and are unpainted; their matte aluminum is effective, and the layout provides a loft-like ambiance. The bathrooms have been left in their original late 50's state.
This sunny apartment whose views are of nondescript buildings across the street was advertised for $196,000 but the broker explained that that price was a mistake.
The relocation company that owns it actually is asking $191,500. The maintenance is $1,055 (maintenances on the Upper East Side are generally higher than on the Upper West Side, and for the size of this apartment, this maintenance is considered average to low, say brokers not involved in the sale).
A similar apartment was found on a comparable block on the Upper West Side, at 200 West 79th Street. There, a large fifth-floor postwar apartment also had what was advertised as "sep dining," which in these cases referred to the dining L off the living room, outside the galley kitchens. Brokers label these apartments four and a half rooms, or may refer to them as "convertible three bedrooms," explaining that the dining L can be blocked off and a bedroom created, since there is another entrance to the kitchen.
THE 200 West 79th Street apartment faced south, overlooking brownstones on 78th Street. The living room was 22 by 12 feet, the dining alcove 12 by 8 feet, the kitchen 11 by 7 1/2 feet and the bedrooms 16 by 11 feet and 14 by 10 feet. There are three walk-in closets, six smaller closets, a foyer and two bathrooms. The asking price was $199,000.
Also offered for $199,000 was a prewar apartment at 130 East 94th Street. The ad read: "Nineties/Carnegie Hill. PW $199K CHARM: F/S bldg. Two BR fea: Beau arch detail new kit, N/S exposure. 75% fin. Call now!"
Apartment 3E was indeed charming. It was not created with two bedrooms, however, but with a formal dining room and one bedroom. At some point, the 19- by 12-foot dining room was cut into a 12- by 12-foot dining room -- still spacious by city standards -- and a 7- by 10-foot second bedroom or study (with a 2-foot hallway carved out).
The split was made tastefully, and the 8- by 8-foot foyer made this relatively small two-bedroom apartment seem larger. The views were nothing to rave about: from the living room, the backs of buildings seen through the white fire escape; from the bedroom, a tiny needle of street trees seen through gaps in other buildings.
This apartment started at $235,000 in February 1992 and was reduced this March. The original glass-fronted cabinets in the kitchen have been stripped, and the blue and white shirred curtains behind the glass match the blue border of the original white wall tiles, which rise about 5 feet off the tiled floor.
Of the 50-odd apartments, there were only a few that had either a woodburning fireplace or outdoor space.
Tara Greany's tiny studio at 334 East 83d Street had at least a gray marble mantle and a fireplace that once worked. Ms. Greany was having an open house and an observer arriving a few minutes early found her bringing in a crate full of red geraniums for the window box outside the $55,000 studio's one big window directly above street level. With a $290 maintenance, "it's cheaper than renting," she said, readying her pitch.
Anthony Calnek's $99,000 one-bedroom apartment at 360 West 21st Street comes with a bonus: In the rear of the building is a lawn big enough for boccie or croquet and surrounded by a stone walk. There is also a stone patio and a barbecue grill, shared by all 52 residents. The maintenance is $670.
Outdoor space also came with a newly remodeled two-bedroom at the very end of West 70th Street; the roof space above the apartment at 345 West 70th was included in the deal, for $185,000, with a $685 maintenance. The view is the apartment's weakness as well as its strength. The current view is a sweeping one of the Hudson River, and of Donald Trump's Riverside South project. Depending on what is built there, the view may be substantially altered.
ONLY one apartment had both fireplace and outdoor space. It was listed for $99,000. Labeled "HOT PROPERTY," the apartment at 170 East 88th Street was in a red brick building that might have been part of a row of turn-of-the century brick tenements joined and "modernized" sometime in the last two decades. But the fourth-floor unit was as promised: There was a woodburning fireplace in the 18- by 20-foot living room and, off that room, a 3- by 8-foot railed balcony.
The view from the balcony was reminiscent of SoHo: the rear of some fairly nondescript brick warehouses. One was ivy covered and the other belonged to William Doyle, the auction house. The current tenant said she often watched the workers arranging antiques. Looking down, however, one had a panoramic view of backyard city gardens.
The cheapest apartment of all -- per square foot -- was probably May Wuthrich's one-bedroom for $55,000 at 230 West End Avenue, at 70th Street, although it has a rather steep maintenance of $830.
The prewar building has a uniformed elevator operator who escorts visitors into an old-fashioned wood-paneled cab with scissor gates. The building sits at the last corner of prewar West End Avenue; the next block south is a one-story grocery and across the street is the vast Lincoln Towers complex.
Not surprisingly, Ms. Wuthrich's apartment, 10F, is small, between 500 and 600 square feet. Yet there are east and north exposures, giving it morning sun, and three distinct rooms: a 4-by-8 kitchen with a window, a 10- by 14-foot bedroom and a 13- by 14-foot living room, the walls of which are covered with oil paintings by Ms. Wuthrich's grandfather, Frederich Wuthrich.
"The paintings don't go with the apartment," she said, adding that she was leaving only because she was getting married in August and her fiance, Marc Jaffe, owns a big two-bedroom apartment six blocks away.
Outside on the street, a slightly frazzled middle-aged man leapt out of a sedan with New Jersey plates. "Did you see that apartment, the one for $55,000?" he asked the apartment's most recent visitor. "What's it like? I couldn't leave the car; my wife and son just went up. Is it a nice place for a college kid? It seems awfully cheap."
He was told it might be just the place for a college kid.

ON-THE-WALL BOOKS
Books that will never be on the shelves of your local bookstore nor available at the library, make up the exhibition called "Out of Bounds: Books as Art/Art as Books" at the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven through June 25. They may, however, be hung on the wall or displayed in some other fashion. Juried by Richard Minsky, founder of the Center for Book Arts in Manhattan, the 75 pieces were selected from 345 entries.
Some are contemporary versions of tablets and scrolls, harking back to the earliest forms of non-verbal communication. One piece is a spin-off of the medieval monk's "girdle" book, or leather waistband from which a book, presumably a prayer book, was suspended. But most of the works were created by artists and craftspeople who were clearly unbound by any such traditions. 
 Text is subordinate to form, but text does exist in some of the works, written by the artist or someone else. One 3-foot-high tome opens electrically, another is made up of old book spines spines sewn together in the shape of a corset, and a third is a delicate contraption of five glass "pages" on which words are etched.
The most accurate description of the expanding pleated book binding would be a concertina, and a spiral-bound book of steel plates contains text and laminated photos relating to the steel industry. In the perishable category is a book made of two pieces of well-done white toast sandwiching paper pages of lithographs and text.
The workshop gallery is open Monday through Friday from 9 to 5 and Saturday from 9 to noon at 80 Audubon Street. Admission is free, but the "books" cost anywhere from $15 to $5,000, with most priced under $1,000. For more information, 562-4927.
 
ART AND ABSTRACTION
 The ideographic art of Robert Bryden may be seen on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. through August at the Field Museum, a gallery which he opened in his home at 140 Water Street in Guilford two years ago.
Mr. Bryden uses the American Heritage Dictionary definition of the word ideograph, meaning a picture, symbol, or diagram, suggesting an idea or object without specifically naming it. His paintings are actually abstracts, cleanly drawn and geometrically composed in combinations of pleasing colors. Each one is named for the idea that it represents. "Circus: A Variation on a Theme by G. Seurat," "Sun and Seed," or "Green Phoenix" are some examples.
The paintings are not for sale and the nonprofit museum, he says, is not a self-serving project but a place dedicated to promoting and teaching abstract art, which he is attempting to rescue from its current unfashionable status, restoring it to a level that it enjoyed in the 1960's when he was a student of Josef Albers at Yale's School of Art and Architecture.
He and his wife Barbara have established a trust by which they hope to attract 20 students a year to spend four hours at the museum absorbing Mr. Bryden's philosophy of abstraction as the intelligent expression of an idea. It is the oppposite, he says, of abstract-expressionism, which is the emotional expression of an idea.
The students will be paid $100 for making the trip, with a parent if necessary, and applying themselves to the lesson sufficiently to write an essay on the experience. Mr. Bryden expects to compile the commentaries in a book.
The museum welcomes the works of other exhibiting abstract artists, and holds informal talks about art and abstraction on Saturdays at 3 P.M. For more information call 453-5750.
 
AND IF ELECTED. . .
 "Connecticut Votes -- From 1894 to 1994" is the subject of an exhibition at the Unionville Museum through November. Covering the national elections from Cleveland to Clinton, and the state campaigns from Morris to Weicker, the display contains a broad selection of memorabilia.
Some of it was loaned by Connecticut candidates who won and others who lost, but the impressive core collection, owned by Frank Corbeil, president of the museum, has been shown at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Museum of Political History at the University of Hartford.
The Whig ticket on an 1856 ballot, ribbons for Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge worn by Aetna employes in the 1920's, buttons bearing names of candidates whom nobody has heard of since, and a slew of postcards, photographs, hats and souvenirs call up memories of Ella T. Grasso, the state's only woman governor; Ralph Nader of Torrington, who ran for President, Abraham A. Ribicoff, John N. Dempsey, Thomas J. Meskill, John Davis Lodge, and some names that reach back into the state's earlier history, like Trumbull and Baldwin.
The museum is housed in the restored Andrew Carnegie Public Library, built in 1917 at 87 School Street, dedicated to collecting and preserving local history. It is open free of charge on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from 2 to 4 P.M. For more information, 673-2231.
 
RAPTORS ON PARADE
 Hawks, eagles, a vulture, and an Andean condor will be among the avian performers onstage live at the Norwalk Maritime Center beginning Saturday and continuing through Labor Day.
The center's four-story tower will provide a perch from which the raptors will swoop down at their accustomed breakneck speed onto the outdoor stage below, displaying their skill in targeting prey. In addition, there will be other hunting birds, including owls, a red-legged seriema, and Pogo, a chatty cockatoo.
The program originates from Steve Martin's Natural Encounters, Inc. in Minnesota, where Mr. Martin has been training birds and taking his show on the road for 17 years.
The well-traveled birds have appeared in several countries around the world, throughout the United States, and on the "Tonight Show" and "Late Night with David Letterman."
Weather permitting, there will be three shows daily except Tuesday, at 10:30 A.M., noon and 4 P.M. Audiences will view the performances from a new 800-seat grandstand, and admission will be $1.25 in addition to the general Maritime Center admission of $7.50 for adults, $6.50 for children and adults over 62.
General admission tickets entitle the bearers to explore the Baja California exhibit, a 7,000 square foot re-creation of the natural beauty that is the basis for the 1,000-mile peninsula's art, religion and economy.
Another sight to see is the Tango -- a specially designed boat in which Dwight Collins of Darien pedaled his way from Newfoundland to Plymouth, England in 40 days in 1992, breaking the record for human-powered, trans-Atlantic navigation.
The center has many children's programs scheduled throughout the summer as well as other long-term exhibits, including artifacts from the Titanic and a 20-foot model of the wreckage. The display relates to the IMAX film "Titanica," shown Fridays at 7 and 9 P.M.; Saturdays at 4, 7, and 9; Sundays at 4 and 7.
The film tracks the 1991 expedition to the sunken ship by Russian, Canadian and American scientists, engineers and historians. Admission is $9.75 for adults, $7.75 for children and older adults. Packaged tickets are available at a discount.
The center, south of Exit 14 of I-95, is located at 10 Water Street at the mouth of the Norwalk River. The number for more information is 852-0700, extension 206. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Midtown South;
Funky Area Lures Not-So-Funky

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
LAST December, when Mark J. Berman moved his six-person marketing communications company, Townsend Consulting Group, down to 5 West 19th Street, he did it for one reason only: Economics.
He was getting twice the space for half the money he was paying at 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street. He figured his clients would turn their noses up at the area, but that was an easy fix: He'd simply go meet them uptown. 
 Now, scarcely six months later, Mr. Berman is sold on his high-ceilinged space, on the eclectic mix of restaurants, on the ease with which he gets cabs, on his whole life style. What's more, his clients are sold, too.
"I keep offering to go visit my clients and they keep opting to come down here," Mr. Berman said. "It's just more casual and more comfortable than midtown."
Is that only a small-company perspective? Hear Ralph Ammerati, partner in the huge advertising firm Ammerati & Puris. In 1981 he moved from Citicorp Center to 36,000 square feet in 100 Fifth Avenue, at 15th Street. He, too, just wanted to save money.
Today, he has more than 100,000 square feet in 100 and its sister building, 104 Fifth Avenue. It's not a perfect situation. The floors are small, so he's spread out over 10 of them. And he's had to put in interior staircases because the elevators are so slow. Still, he wouldn't consider moving back uptown.
"We seldom go uptown for anything anymore," Mr. Ammerati said.
Until recently, midtown south -- the area between 14th and 34th Streets, river to river -- had only one raison d'etre: It was a cheap alternative when rents in midtown got too high. But lately, midtown south has turned into a neighborhood of choice itself.
"In the 80's a great majority of deals were midtown tenants going to midtown south to save $7," said David A. Falk, a senior director at Williams Real Estate. "Now it's people moving within the neighborhood, going to a better building a few blocks away."
Midtown south is by no means a boom town, though. The area has traditionally attracted entrepreneurial companies, many of which went bankrupt in the last recession. And those tenants who still preferred a fancy midtown address to a funky midtown south one suddenly could afford to move uptown.
MarketSearch, a company in Rye, N.Y., that tracks building vacancies, says midtown south's vacancy rate was about 16.6 percent this month; two years ago, it was 11.6.
But now, with midtown rents starting to firm up -- and with large blocks of midtown space growing increasingly scarce -- tenants are starting to look at midtown south again. And brokers report the tenants are doing so with a great deal more enthusiasm.
"There's just less resistance to midtown south now," said Mitchell Konsker, an executive managing director of the real estate firm Galbreath Riverbank and the leasing agent at 345 Park Avenue South, at 25th Street.
Robert A. Silver, a director at Newmark Real Estate who is leasing agent at 111-115 Fifth Avenue, at 18th Street, concurs.
"A lot of midtown people are coming down to take a look," he said. Over the last 15 months, he said, activity has been so brisk that his buildings are nearly 95 percent full.
Leasing is frenzied throughout the area. Edward S. Gordon, the real estate company, says that some 693,000 square feet of midtown south space was leased in the first quarter of 1994, a 219 percent increase over the same quarter of 1993. Moreover, rents topped $17 for the first time in several years.
And it is not only the "artsy" entrepreneurial companies moving in. The fashion industry is embracing the area en masse. Last year Perry Ellis International moved its offices and showrooms to 115 Fifth Avenue, while J. Crew expanded to more than 100,000 feet at 625 Avenue of the Americas, at 18th Street. Nautica Inc. took 22,000 square feet at 11 West 19th Street. And now The Gap is moving its East Coast offices from 3 East 54th Street into 150,000 square feet at 620 Avenue of the Americas, at 18th Street.
"This really legitimizes the area," said Randy Kohana, a managing director at E.S. Gordon who represented the Gap. "Here's a huge corporate tenant moving to midtown south, and that tells other tenants that this is an O.K. area for a prestigious company."
Indeed, several mainline companies are looking at the neighborhood with a fresh eye. First Boston is said to be seriously considering buying 11 Madison Avenue, the old Metropolitan Life building on 24th Street. Prudential Securities has taken 185,000 square feet at 111 Eighth Avenue, at 16th Street; and Beth Israel Hospital bought 300,000 square feet of office space at 10 Union Square East.
"This whole neighborhood has gone through a substantial demographic revolution," said Martin Turchin, a vice chairman at Edward S. Gordon.
Nonetheless, the influx of conservative companies has not substantially changed the neighborhood's laid-back feeling. That's one reason that 20th Century Fox is opening its new FX Cable Network in 70,000 square feet at 212 Fifth Avenue, at 26th Street. The network intends to do man-in-the-street types of interviews at various times of day.
"They don't want just button-down businessmen who disappear at 5 P.M., and they don't want a backdrop of wedding-cake buildings," said David L. Hoffman, a broker with Colliers ABR who represented Fox.
Actually, to think of midtown south as a unified neighborhood is a bit misleading. Until fairly recently, Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue South were considered the area's only "good" streets. Lower Fifth had become a bustling shopping street, and Park Avenue South had enough tall buildings and restaurants to qualify as a poor man's midtown.
But lately, Avenue of the Americas and points west have taken off, too. Ladies' Mile -- 17th Street to 23d Street -- has turned into a discount retail corridor, with Bed Bath & Beyond, Barnes & Noble and numerous other stores opening in the last two years. And office tenants are following down.
IN a sense, the real estate recession immeasurably helped many of the area's buildings. Unlike midtown, where many buildings are owned by rich real estate families or deep-pocketed institutions, midtown south's commercial buildings have traditionally been in the hands of undercapitalized individuals or partnerships. Many of those owners lost their buildings to their mortgagees. Those institutions -- or companies who bought the buildings from them -- have given the properties new life.
Three years ago, 345 Park Avenue South was about 70 percent empty, "a real white elephant," recalled Mr. Konsker. But then Park Avenue South Armory, a Bankers Trust-dominated partnership, foreclosed on the property and spent more than $3 million to put in new windows, elevators, telecommunications wiring and the like. Since then the New York Law Journal, Bill Communications, Kaleidoscope Companies and others have moved in, to the point where the 12-story building has only two empty floors.
Madison Square -- 15 East 26th Street -- is a 345,000-square-foot building that three years ago was in bankrupcty, in disrepair, and only half full. Schroeder Real Estate took it over, refurbished it and started marketing it to giftware companies and nonprofits.
"We have no space left," said Howard Simson, a Cushman & Wakefield director and the building's leasing agent.
S.L. Green Real Estate, a well-heeled landlord that continuously poured renovation money into its six midtown south buildings throughout the recession, has almost no space left in its buildings either. There's been plenty of turnover, but the space has rarely remained vacant for long.
"We don't necessarily command higher rents, but we rent quicker than our competitors," maintained Stephen Green, the company's chairman. "When you consider that carrying vacant space costs as much as 30 cents a foot a month, that's pretty important."
Because the renovated buildings remain in the minority, there has been a lot of intra-neighborhood movement as local tenants try to trade up their space; 345 Park Avenue South grabbed the Law Journal from 111 Eighth Avenue. And many of Madison Square's recent sign-ons, including Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and Covington Fabrics, are moving from just a few blocks away.
"The building is modern enough to accommodate the computer systems that we want to install," said Abby Gilmore, Covington's president. "But it still has a small building feel, in a neighborhood that is our home."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Rent Limit For the Elderly
 
Q I have lived for more than 10 years in a rent-stabilized building. I am over 62 years old and retired. My rent at the beginning was $1,200 a month; it is now $1,650 a month. Since I am a senior citizen, is there a limit to how much my rent can be raised when I renew my lease every two years? . . . Frank Catani, Manhattan 

A Your rent may be increased with every renewal unless you are eligible for the Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption Program, said Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees rent regulation.
Increases on stabilized apartments are set annually by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board. Current guidelines call for increases of 3 percent on one-year leases and 5 percent for two-year leases on renewal leases signed between Oct. 1, 1993, and Sept. 30, 1994.
In New York City, if a tenant or a tenant's spouse is 62 or older and lives in a rent-regulated apartment; if the combined household disposable income is $16,500 a year or less, and if they are paying at least one-third of their disposable income for rent, the person who is 62 or older may apply for the exemption.
If the tenant qualifies, he or she is exempt from future rent-guidelines increases, maximum base rent increases, fuel-cost adjustments and increases based on the owner's economic hardship and major capital improvements.
The program is administered in the city by the Department for the Aging. Applications should be filed with the Department for the Aging, SCRIE Division, 150 William Street, Fourth Floor, New York N.Y. 10038. Telephone: (212) 240-7000.
In counties outside the city covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act, the program is administered by the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Outside the city, the program is a local option and communities have different income-eligibility limits and regulations.
The Department of Housing and Community Renewal has a Rent Infoline: (718) 739-6400.
 
Designating Proxies At Co-op Elections
 
Q The ballot for my cooperative's annual elections states that any shareholder can choose to have representatives of the board of directors vote his or her shares in any way that the representatives choose. All that needs to be done is for the shareholder to sign the proxy line and not vote for any candidate.
The board's agents in this matter, themselves on and off members of the board, have been the same two people for as far back as anyone can remember. They have never revealed how they voted the proxies. Many shareholders consider this a questionable practice.
Is this the norm for co-op elections? Does it make any sense? What can be done to change the ballot? . . . Jay Maurer, Manhattan
 
A Things can be changed, said Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan lawyer and president of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
"There are two basic types of proxies," Mr. Luxemburg said. "There's a general instruction proxy, which authorizes proxies to vote for directors using their own discretion. That is probably the most common form, with shareholders typically designating proxies who are board members or people chosen by the board. There is no legal requirement that the proxies reveal how they voted."
But there is also a second common form, he said, not as frequently used as the first. "It is a ballot-type proxy that directs the proxies specifically how to vote," he said. "The discretion of the proxies with respect to that issue is eliminated."
And, Mr. Luxemburg said, there is no mandate that a form of proxy promulgated by the board must be used. "Nothing says people can't use their own form of proxy," he said. "An individual shareholder can make up his or her proxy forms, and the forms can be similar to the second one described."
Also, he said, you may designate almost anyone as a proxy. "You are not obligated to designate the board's choices as proxies," he said. "You can pick anyone you want within the confines of the bylaws. The only legal requirement is that the proxies have to be physically present at the meeting."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Landmark East Side Complex;
Long-Running Fight Comes to an End

 BODY:
Since 1984, the City and Suburban York Avenue Estate, a 14-building complex on the Upper East Side, has been the scene of a bitter dispute over tenant rights, development interests and historic preservation.
The final chapter was played out last month when four buildings were bought by 78/79 York Associates of Mount Vernon, N.Y., a development partnership, in a bankruptcy reorganization; it acquired the others last August at a foreclosure auction. 
 The buildings -- which from 1901 to 1913 made up the world's largest low-income housing project -- had previously been owned by the developer Peter Kalikow, who paid about $43 million for them in 1984.
"We paid $18 million for the first phase and $13 million for the second," said Alan Wasserman, a partner with 78/79 York Associates.
Shortly after Mr. Kalikow bought the complex, between 78th and 79th Streets, he announced plans to raze four buildings and put up four apartment towers. Opposed by the tenants, neighborhood groups and city officials, he postponed demolition.
In 1990, the City Landmarks Preservation Commission further blocked his plans by designating the complex a historic landmark. The city's Board of Estimate, however, voted in 1991 to strip four buildings of landmark status, letting the developer proceed with one new apartment tower. That decision, though, was blocked by a New York State appeals court.
Mr. Wasserman said he bought the units because they would give his partnership, which owns and manages several buildings in the Bronx and upper Manhattan, a stronger foothold in Manhattan. He said the partnership planned to renovate and lease the apartments.
About 100 tenants live in the four buildings bought in April; 1,200 to 1,500 live in the 950 apartments in the 10 buildings bought last summer.
Loretta V. Ponticello, a tenant for 39 years, said the new owner was the first "that has shown an interest in the building as a landmark and is willing to listen, to meet with us and discuss our problems."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mustang GT vs. Camaro Z28;
Topless Style With American Muscle

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
LEE A. IACOCCA, who was about to leave the top job at the Chrysler Corporation, was shaking his head. This was a couple of years ago, in his sumptuous office in Chrysler's sumptuous New York headquarters, and he was talking about the electric van I had just driven, which didn't work very well.
The problem, of course, was the battery technology, ancient and not ready for an unpolluted brave new world in which everyone will drink Perrier and will have stubbed out the final cigarette. 
 "Don't you just miss Ford's old flathead V8?" the chairman asked, shaking his head one more time.
Well, yes. A lot of us do miss that simple and wonderfully functional power plant that propelled Fords for more than three decades, until the early 1950's. It was an engine you could actually understand and work on.
It was natural that Mr. Iacocca should feel nostalgic for it, having had a nice career with Ford before he was ousted by Henry Ford 2d. He went on, of course, to create Chrysler's hugely successful mini-van and bring back the American convertible.
Mr. Iacocca knows about V8's, and he stuffed them into another of his better ideas, the original Ford Mustang.
The Mustang's arrival -- amazingly, it was exactly 30 years ago -- stole a march on General Motors, which took two years to respond with a so-called pony car of its own, the Chevrolet Camaro. In the time since, and with a few lapses, the cars have run side by side in the race to put V8 fizz into the blood of sporty-car buyers.
In that time, too, there have been five series of Mustangs and four incarnations of Camaros. They have been coupes and convertibles, hot rods and not-so-hot rods -- which used to be known as "secretary's cars." And now, once again -- for the first time in many years -- both lines are offering all-new convertibles.
The question, of course, is which is better?
For my money, it is the Camaro.
But there is a lot of subjectivity in America's love affair with these cars. As a knowledgeable friend said recently: "Yeah, Camaro beats Mustang in all its specs, but the problem is that it isn't a Mustang."
In terms of those specifications, the Camaro does come out on top. The Z28's V8 engine is a modification of the Corvette's 5.7-liter power plant, and it generates 275 horsepower and 325 foot-pounds of torque. The Mustang GT, with its venerable 4.9-liter V8 (always promoted by the marketing people as 5.0 liters) has considerably less under the hood, producing only 215 horsepower and 285 pounds of torque.
That translates, obviously, into a difference in performance. The Camaro will go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 5.4 seconds, while the Mustang takes 6.7 seconds. The Chevy's top speed is 156 miles an hour, while the Ford can do "only" 141.
Those are hardly serious deficiencies, because none of us are going to be driving at those speeds. So the either-or is subjective in terms of performance as well as image.
Both cars continue with rear-wheel drive, and both engines sound just great, with throbs and burbles to gladden the hearts of cabin-cruiser fans. Both also behave beautifully on twisting back roads, and top-down driving is, well, top-down driving. Which is to say it is wondrous, hair-riffling fun.
The Camaro and Mustang have very different bodies. The Camaro is longer, lower and wider, in the old American tradition. It is sleeker, too, with a sharply raked windshield. The Mustang harks to the past, with styling cues like the chrome horse in the grille, side scoops and triple-tiered taillights.
Both bodies are also stiffer than in the past, and that means less in the way of shake, rattle and roll.
Inside, both are nicely finished and both have equally rotten back seats, the kind you might want to wish on your boss. The carrying capacity of both cars is limited, but you expect that. The Camaro can handle a minuscule 7.6 cubic feet of cargo; the Mustang's capacity is 8.5 cubic feet -- one of the few areas in which its numbers beat the Chevy's.
As noted, the Camaro is considerably bigger than the Mustang, with an overall length of 193.2 inches, compared with the Mustang's 181.5. The Chevy is also a lot wider, at 74.1 inches, compared with the Ford's 71.8. And, as might be expected, the Camaro is heavier, weighing 3,524 pounds, compared with the Mustang's 3,452.
All the same, fuel economy is about even, with a Federal mileage rating of about 17 miles a gallon in the city and 24 to 25 on the highway. But that will probably not matter to most customers; one doesn't buy cars like these to brag about fuel economy over the back fence.
What they are bought for, and what has kept them around and popular through gas shortages, soaring insurance premiums and a general downsizing of delight is that they have been bargains, and they continue to be, considering what you get.
The Mustang GT convertible starts out just a bit less expensive, with a base price of $22,195 and a fully loaded sticker of $27,165, including leather upholstery and an incredible 460-watt stereo system. The Camaro Z28 starts at $22,875, but the price can rise to $25,932 with all the bells and whistles -- but without a leather interior, which won't be available until next year.
For the frugal, both cars can be had with V6 engines, a 160-horse, 3.8-liter in the Mustang and a 145-horse, 3.4-liter in the Camaro. The base Camaro convertible starts at $19,485 and the least expensive soft-top Mustang is $20,635.
The race between the two brands has also led to a competition to see who can most often pace the Indianapolis 500. The new Mustang convertible will lead this year's 33-car field on May 29, as it has twice previously, in 1964 and 1979. Camaro has paced the race four times: in '67, '69, '82 and '93.
The Mustang at this year's race will be a Cobra version, which will have a more potent version of the same engine, producing 240 horsepower. Ford will make 1,000 pace-car replicas and 5,000 Cobras; some have already arrived in showrooms, though they are still scarce.
The company is also considering still more oomph for the Mustang by plugging in a modification of Lincoln's 32-valve V8.
The bottom line on any convertible is its top. Both the Camaro and Mustang have power roofs that are easy to operate and are fully lined, with glass rear windows. The Mustang has a soft cover for its vinyl top, while the Camaro has a three-piece plastic tonneau.
Ford also plans to offer an optional fiberglass hardtop, which will cost about $1,500 when it becomes available on 1995 models.
 
INSIDE TRACK: With pony cars, as with thoroughbreds, a good, big horse will beat a good, small horse every time. Bet on the Camaro.

Lately, There's No Telling Where You'll Find Gold

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IT'S hard to figure gold these days. While the bond market tanked in early April because of inflationary fears, the price of gold was falling, which seems the reverse of what the precious metal should have done. And now, after the Fed seemed to calm these inflationary fears with four short-term interest-rate hikes capped off with its half-point increase last week, the price of gold is moving higher. As of Friday, the price of gold in New York was at $386.30 an ounce, up $4.50 on the day and $4.80 for the week. 
 As the value of the dollar plunged in April, the price of gold also dropped, falling to $372.10 an ounce. That also seemed backward because traders said the dollar was falling, in part, because of a lack of confidence in the Clinton Administration and its economic policies. The dollar drop was so severe that the United States and 16 of its allies intervened in the currency markets at the end of April and early this month to prop up the beleaguered currency. But now the price of gold is rising as the value of the dollar is falling again.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Turmoil Aside, Mexico Offers Bargains

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
EL ECONOMISTA, the salmon-colored financial newspaper here, has started publishing an unusual notice that says a lot about the shaky state of Mexico's financial markets.
"No More Rumors," reads the newspaper's full-page advertisement. El Economista asks its business-oriented readers to fax in rumors before spreading them. It promises to investigate and then to disregard or to publish what it finds, depending on whether the rumors are unfounded. 
 The concern is understandable. Mexico, and its market, have had their share of panic this year. Kidnappings, the assassination of the leading presidential candidate, extensive political turmoil and fears of a peso devaluation have all taken their toll.
The stock exchange has dropped 19 percent in dollar terms. The peso has slipped 8.4 percent against the dollar. Some $10 billion in foreign capital has left the country. And high interest rates needed to protect the peso have all thrown a blanket over expectations for an economic recovery before Mexico's presidential election takes place on Aug. 21.
All that means many analysts and investors have cooled on Mexico.
"We choose to feel that it's a time to be cautious," said one manager of a New York-based fund who specializes in Latin America and asked not to be identified. "Right now we're just watching it. We'll see what happens after the election."
While other analysts share that caution, they believe the Mexican market is worth entering, though on a selective basis.
"The political uncertainty in Mexico is going to continue, which means that growth may be postponed further than many people are thinking," said Timothy C. Davis, a vice president for emerging markets at Lazard Freres & Company. "That being said, we believe there are some excellent opportunities in Mexico, especially in comparison with other Latin American markets."
Telefonos de Mexico is the formerly state-owned company whose privatization was completed this month when the Government sold its last shares. It is one stock that Mr. Davis and other analysts believe is still comparatively cheap, especially compared with phone company shares in Argentina or Chile.
The Mexico City office of Baring Securities is strongly recommending Telmex and other large companies over smaller ones that might not withstand the vacillations in the market. These large companies include Banacci, a diverse financial institution; Grupo Carso, which operates restaurants and manufactures cigarettes; the construction-engineering company ICA and the Monterrey-based glass manufacturer Vitro.
It remains to be seen if El Economista's anti-rumor crusade amounts to anything. In the meantime, many foreign investors have already decided to sit on the sidelines until after the August election.
Their absence can be seen in the dwindling volumes at the stock exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. In January, roughly $500 million a day was traded on the Bolsa. By March that had dropped to $350 million a day. During April, daily volume had declined to $240 million.
So far this year, the Bolsa has zigzagged from an all-time high of 2,881 on Feb. 8 to a low of 1,957 on April 20, the day that the Bank of Mexico demonstrated its commitment to defending the peso by raising the interest rate on 28-day peso-denominated notes, called cetes, to 18 percent.
Interest rates, economic growth and presidential politics have become so intertwined that analysts find themselves hard pressed to come up with clear statements about the market's strength. The bottom line, however, is that it is very difficult for short-term investors to come out ahead because the market is just too volatile.
"With markets like these you have to be willing to be in for more than a year to absorb the volatility," said Richard M. Johnston, director of Latin American investments for Offitbank, a private banking organization in New York.
A look at how Offitbank manages its $6.5 billion portfolio provides an example of how those responsible for spending money in Mexico reacted to events of the last year.
About 10 percent of Offitbank's portfolio is dedicated to emerging markets in Latin America. Last spring, 60 percent of that emerging market share was in Mexican cetes. As the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement neared, Mr. Johnston said, the percentage dropped to 45 percent.
After angry Maya Indians took up arms in the state of Chiapas in January, he cut his Mexican participation to 20 percent. "Risks changed dramatically," Mr. Johnston said.
The Mexican outlook hit bottom on March 23 when the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was assassinated. The Bolsa had to close the following day, and United States Treasury officials announced a $6 billion swap arrangement to provide dollars to defend the peso.
Mr. Johnston said he has brought Mexican investments back up to 30 percent, and could go as high as 45 percent by the end of the year. But that would still be 15 percentage points below last year.
The outlook in Mexico for the rest of 1994 is mixed. First-quarter gross national product figures showed a meager rise of five-tenths of a percent while earnings for many companies were disappointing, partly because the 8.4 percent slide of the peso forced many to take foreign exchange losses. Rumors of a formal devaluation are widespread and real growth may not take place until 1995.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Rates Rise, Stocks Plunge; Rates Rise More, Stocks Soar. Go Figure.
At last we see what the financial markets wanted! It clearly wasn't the water-drip torture of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates a quarter point at a clip, as it did earlier this year, always hinting of more to come. But last week it moved decisively, not only raising the Federal funds rate by half a point, but also lifting the discount rate the same amount after leaving it unchanged for nearly two years, and banks quickly lifted prime rates, too. The markets loved this decisiveness, with the Dow industrials soaring 95 points in four days and long-bond yields falling. Perverse? Not really. If short-term rates reach a level the markets can live with, the thinking goes, then investors won't worry about long-term inflation. "We have gotten the dark cloud of uncertainty from over our heads," said one economist. (If the winds change, of course, economists will be glad to come up with some seemingly opposite rationale.) 

He Who Steals My Trash . . .
Is nothing simple these days? We often hear of towns choking on more garbage than they can handle. But now towns are desperate to keep garbage -- and the courts won't let them. It works like this: a town builds a costly, bond-financed sorting and recycling center, pledging town garbage to keep it humming. But along comes someone who will haul trash away for less, and the equation falls apart. One town went to court to hang onto its old tires, broken toys and junk mail, but last week the Supreme Court turned it down, ruling that towns can't "hoard a local resource." So are fancy trash centers doomed? The Court offered one recourse: subsidize them to keep fees low. What's a civic-minded citizen to do now? Throw out even more stuff?
 
Who Wants to Be No. 2 Anyway?
The winter's incessant ice, apparently, was the last straw: in January, the Census Bureau said last week, Texas edged past New York to become No. 2 in population (California's still safely No. 1; in 1970 it passed New York, which had ranked first since 1810). We knew this was coming, of course, as the nation steadily tilts south and west. But let's put one rumor to rest right now: the Brooklyn Bridge is not being dismantled and shipped to Dallas.
 
Tinkering With Perfection
A good tomato is an elemental joy, a pure and elegant basic of nature. You tinker with it at your peril. But another force is equally basic: the unstoppable march of science. The two collided last week, and science won this round, as the F.D.A. approved the sale of tomatoes genetically altered to keep them firm and fresh. Critics abounded, mainly complaining that no labels are required on these tomatoes. "Consumers have a right to know," one said. But a trade group representative insisted, "It isn't something frightening or mysterious." It is big business: the nation's fresh-tomato market is worth $3 billion or so annually, and Calgene, which developed the altered tomato, stands to get a sizable payoff.
 
Warning Flag on Derivatives
Depending on whom you talk to, financial derivatives are either the greatest thing since take-out coffee or a loaded gun that will end civilization as we know it. For two years the General Accounting Office, which scouts things out for Congress, pondered the matter. And last week it came down squarely on the side of those who see danger, calling for broad new regulation of the companies that create and use these complex financial products. "They identified a regulatory black hole," said Representative Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat, who had asked for the report. But a group of banks and brokerages fired back in a single voice that derivatives are "a critically important risk-management tool."
 
Swindled? Here's the Tax Bill
It's bad enough to lose money in an investment scam, but the final insult would be if, when the smoke cleared, you owed back taxes too. That's what may face investors in something called City-Equity Group. Last week prosecutors charged that Gary Lefkowitz, head of City-Equity, had embezzled up to $130 million that was earmarked for low-income housing projects. Since low-income housing is one of last refuges of those seeking tax shelters, some investors may have claimed tax credits they weren't entitled to. And having just lost your shirt may be no excuse.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Just What Albania Needs?
Albania, where the average monthly wage is less than $30, was in the Stalinist dark ages until recently. By U.N. designation, it is the only "least developed nation" in Europe. So, naturally, what it needs is . . . Coke. And that's what it got last week, as Coca-Cola opened a $10 million bottling plant, adding Albania to the long list of countries where that all-American drink is made. (No, it's not everywhere; a few countries, like Libya, Iraq and Cuba, still ban it.) "It may not be what they need the most," said one observer, but it is still an odd sort of ticket into the family of nations.
 
Trade Gap: It's Mostly Japan
Any talk of this nation's trade deficit quickly zeroes in on Japan, and last week's numbers clearly show why. Yes, the March deficit shrank as exports soared, but of the $7.5 billion deficit that remained, more than three-quarters of it -- $5.8 billion -- was with Japan. That, in fact, is the third-biggest monthly deficit ever with Japan. True, Japan is buying more from the United States, but our economy is so strong that we're buying even more from Japan. So once again America and Japan hit the negotiating table to see if Japan's doors could be pried open a bit wider, and there was talk of "detailed, serious proposals." The tune sounds familiar.
 
COMPANIES
 
The Abortion Pill Is Coming
Given the passions on both sides, no truce is imminent in the abortion war. But at least some battlefields may now change. Last week, under pressure from the Clinton Administration, Roussel Uclaf, the French maker of the abortion pill RU-486, turned over the patent rights and technology to a New York group, the Population Council, which will conduct tests, find a manufacturer and try to get it to American women by 1996. So now abortion clinics, easy protest targets, can be replaced by scattered doctors' offices. The manufacturer will certainly be a small one; no large drug maker would open itself to boycotts. Abortion-rights leaders were elated, seeing an end to the "tyranny of anti-choice extremists," while one abortion foe called the pill a "human pesticide." The war goes on.
 
Is That the TV Ringing?
It's enough to make a technophobe weep. First came the idea of phone companies offering cable programming. Then last week regulators opened the way for a Time Warner cable system to compete for local phone service in Rochester. And don't worry: you can still call all your friends (and telemarketers can still call you). Part of the deal is that rivals can connect to the existing network. What does Rochester Telephone get out of it? More freedom to retain profits earned through efficiency. And the consumer? Lower rates, probably, but perhaps higher confusion.
 
Still Betting on Cable
Bell Atlantic isn't letting the collapse of its linkup with T.C.I. keep it from dreaming of cable television's possibilities. That was clear last week when it chose AT&T and General Instrument to build an advanced video and data network to bring goodies like interactive television and movies on demand to 8.5 million mid-Atlantic homes. So there's old, established AT&T at the center of this high-tech onslaught. It regularly battles local phone companies, but it has made similar deals with such companies to build networks in Connecticut and California. This data highway clearly makes for interesting bedfellows.
 
As the Haft Family Turns
The Haft family has performed a worthy service by bringing a soap-opera tingle to the business pages. Herbert Haft, the patriarch at 73, ousts his son Robert from the Dart Group board and replaces him with his other son, Ronald. Herbert's wife, Gloria, sides with Robert, and she too is history. She seeks a legal separation. The lawsuits fly. But last week the Hafts settled, and while no specifics were disclosed, Mr. Haft and Ronald seem to have bought out Mrs. Haft and Robert. Oh, well, there may be some "Dallas" reruns around.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Unhealthy Prospects for Women

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
MEN and women are affected differently by their access -- or lack of it -- to the American health care system. Women use health care more, spend a greater portion of their income on it and are more likely to come into contact with the health care system than other family members, according to a study released earlier this month by the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington.
The study found that women are "chronically uninsured," because their life-cycle and labor participation patterns often preclude coverage by an employer. Three-quarters of the nation's 12 million uninsured women are employed but do not receive insurance at work, the study found. 
 Indirect coverage through a husband is increasingly hard to come by, as companies cut back on or drop health benefits, according to the study. Between 1988 and 1992, the proportion of men with employer-provided health insurance dropped 5 percentage points, while the proportion of women stayed the same. At the same time, the figure for women with indirect access fell 3 percentage points. Deferred marriage and a rising divorce rate have also had an impact on women's access to health care.
The study also found that women under 30 -- those in their prime childbearing years -- are the least likely to be insured.
In addition, nearly a third of Hispanic women are uninsured, compared with 20 percent of black women, 12 percent of white women and 18 percent of women of other races. In all, four million women of minorities are uninsured.
The study estimated that President Clinton's proposed Health Security Act would help 29 million women, or half of all working women aged 18 to 64, get direct access to health insurance, some for the first time and others by switching from indirect coverage.
It also noted that public policy discussions take as the norm the male pattern of working full-time at careers uninterrupted by family responsibilities -- a pattern that is becoming less dominant.
If policymakers and politicians used female norms instead of male norms to devise health care policies, the report suggested, more people would be covered. "If we assume women are the typical workers and develop policies to cover them, then we will be covering all workers," said Roberta Spalter-Roth, research director at the institute and one of the study's five authors.
"Women's Access to Health Insurance" is available for $15 from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, 1400 20th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.
 
The Wages of Harassment
 The cost of sexual harassment to employers is dear and growing. Aggrieved employees, most of them women, won almost twice as much money from employers in 1993 as they did in the previous year, according to a study of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission records by the Center for Women in Government at the State University of New York in Albany. In 1993, 1,546 employees won $25.2 million from employers; in 1992, 1,340 people won $12.7 million. The rise coincided with a 112 percent increase in complaints from 1988 to 1993, to 11,908 from 5,623.
Researchers attributed the increases to an expanded awareness of sexual harassment in the aftermath of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy; to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which made it possible for harassed employees to seek punitive and compensatory damages, and to recent favorable decisions in Federal Courts.
According to the study, charges filed by blacks are more likely to be resolved with a finding of "no reasonable cause" than those filed by whites. But blacks who received money in 1992 got an average of $11,029, compared with $9,382 for whites.
For those who still don't get it as well as for those who get it all too well, the Labor Institute, a research and education group in New York, has just published a demystification of harassment called, with commendable clarity, "Sexual Harassment at Work." Subtitled "A Training Workbook for Working People," the book mixes exercises and suggestions for starting harassment support or study groups with basic information provided by strong graphics and a readable text. The book is good on the connections between economics and harassment, assumes some workplaces are unionized and covers issues many books on harassment avoid, like the hassling of gay men and lesbians in the workplace. Overall, the emphasis is on taking control of a potential harassment situation, and not feeling victimized by it.
"Sexual Harassment at Work" is available for $12 from the Labor Institute, 853 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10003, 212-674-3322.
 
Taking Account of Life
 Accounting lives up to its conservative reputation in at least one area: It has been slow to recognize that even "quants" -- especially female quants -- want a life. Interested members of the profession will gather next month, on June 13, in New York, to consider the topic "Achieving a Balance in the Accounting Workplace: Gender, Upward Mobility, Work and Family." For information, call the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants at 201-938-3232.
 
 
 
AN INVITATION TO FEMALE WORKERS
 TO add a little soul to the columns of data the Government collects on working women, the Women's Bureau of the Labor Department is asking working women all over the country to respond to its "Working Women Count" questionnaire with demographic factoids and more qualitative information on their relationship to their jobs. The survey asks women how they feel about their work -- with choices ranging from "I love it" to "It's totally miserable" -- and what they would do to make it better. It provides space to write a brief essay to President Clinton on what it is like to be a working woman.
The survey is being sponsored by several "partners" -- corporations, politicians, labor unions, political groups, media organizations and state and local governments -- who are helping distribute the questionnaire from May through August. It is also being printed in several women's magazines.
Results are due to be released in the fall.

HEADLINE: Retooling the 'People Skills' of Corporate America

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE 

 BODY:
IT was the late 1970's and early 80's, and many capital-intensive American industries were in the doldrums. Profits were down, technology was sliding toward obsolescence, international competition was intensifying. A few companies were beginning to realize competitors abroad weren't going to settle for the role of a fly that could be swatted away. The Union Camp Corporation, a maker of paper, packaging and paper-related products, assessed its future and made a critical decision.
"It had been felt that people issues weren't important in a capital-intensive industry," said Russell W. Boekenheide, a senior vice president based at Union Camp's headquarters in Wayne, N.J. "We have a lot of common technology in the paper industry. You get your edge through improved efficiency." Union Camp decided it would -- and could -- compete on its people, a radical departure in an industry not known for innovation. 
 To make the leap, the company forged a partnership between operations and human resources, bringing together the "hard" science of profitability planning and the "soft" science of nurturing talent. An alliance that would ultimately include the workers who run the papermaking machines revitalized an apparently doomed 50-year-old mill in Savannah, Ga., saving thousands of jobs.
The role played by human resources in Union Camp's conversion to a "high performance workplace" is emblematic of change in a field once largely regarded as marginal to the success -- or failure -- of a corporation. Only a few years ago, "human resources" was "personnel," and its practitioners were often either happy on the slow track, in staff jobs that would eventually dead end, or liberal arts majors who wanted to be in business only if they could work with people. Human resources "hired people, got them well fed, made sure they did their job," said David A. Skovron, chief executive of Kwasha Lipton, a Fort Lee, N.J., benefits consulting firm.
Today, human resources employees are much less likely to be bogged down, Bob Crachit-like, in administrative minutiae. The current passion for stripping away middle management has hit human resources departments hard, forcing them to redefine their role in the corporation. Many of the tasks once performed by human resources are being subcontracted to save money. Pressure from a demographically diversifying workforce and an ever-more-complicated body of workplace law has created whole new practice areas, like work-family programs.
And, as companies arrive, as Union Camp did, at the insight that people skills -- almost universally called the "soft stuff" of business -- may be the key to survival, human resources is taking on new significance. Increasingly, its practitioners are being included in strategic decision making, sitting on the powerful committees and reporting directly to the highest executive levels.
"We are becoming proactive partners in the business," said Frank Calamita, a senior human resources executive at Sony Music Entertainment Inc. in New York and chairman of the human resources council of the American Management Association. "The only acknowledgment of the people aspect used to be, 'What is the head count?' Now they say, 'Let's take each one of these strategic issues and look through the lens of human resources.' "
WHETHER because they are polite or cowed, human resources experts do not seem inclined to ask their operational counterparts an obvious question: What took so long? For years, human resources people have been touting the virtues of improving productivity by treating people well. They have also noted quietly that people often need to be trained in nonquantifiable skills like negotiating and communicating to put into place the new management models so many corporations are adopting.
"For a long time, American business focused on 'hard' issues," said Richard Sethi, manager of executive education at the AT&T Corporation. "We thought if we could fix that we'd be O.K. No matter how grand the strategy is, if you don't have people skills, it's not worth the paper it's written on."
Ironically, the new prominence of human resources is probably due less to wisdom than to downsizing or re-engineering, the corporate chainsaw massacre continuing to rage across the company landscape even as the economy seems to gain strength. Human resources departments have often been the company's agent to the workforce, arriving sometimes in an executioner's mask, sometimes in the guise of a priest with good news from the governor. It has often not been a comfortable role.
"One of the frustrations in recent times, during repeated downsizing, is that human resources has not been able to influence positively," said Watt White, vice president at the consulting firm Rath & Strong in Stamford, Conn. "They become the outplacement person."
But taking a hand in the unpleasant side of business has given human resources a profile and credibility it did not have when it was viewed more as an advocate for employees.
"The H.R. job description today is very focused on organizational issues," said Dale Winston, president of Battalia Winston International, an executive search firm based in New York. "They look for someone with re-engineering experience, who can participate in the business. They're relying on H.R. They want to know how to get work done with the fewest number of people."
G.E. Drive Systems in Salem, Va., a unit of the General Electric Company, was pretty much down to its fewest number of people and had become spinoff bait six years ago, when G.E. was unloading employees and any entity unprofitable or not regarded as "core."
"We had problems with quality and with customer service levels," said Tom Brock, a 25-year G.E. veteran who in 1988 became manager of production and technology at G.E. Drive, which makes computerized control systems for industrial machinery. But what especially troubled him was "trying to figure out how to get everyone on board to fix it so there would be a business."
Like many employers these days, Mr. Brock, who has an engineering degree, an M.B.A. and years of psychology and sociology courses, decided he wanted his workers to take more responsibility, to become, in the current jargon, "empowered."
Unlike many employers, he didn't underestimate the complexity of the task or the investment it would take. "I told people they would have to change. I said I knew it would be uncomfortable," Mr. Brock said. The most difficult message was probably also the one that struck the most primal fear: He wanted employees to become so efficient they would work themselves out of their jobs -- but emerge with new skills for new projects.
His right arm in that process, he said, was Roger Farley, head of the human resources department, which helped with training in communications and other skills. The Salem plant now has some 200 teams, to take on any issue employees think is important.
According to a report on G.E. Drive Systems published by the Work in America Institute, a research organization in Scarsdale, N.Y., the plant has made a "quantum leap" in productivity.
UNION CAMP was looking for similar quantum improvements when it cast a cost-cutting eye at its half-century-old Savannah paper mill. In the late 70's and early 80's, when many industrial companies were still flirting haplessly with Japanese-style quality circles, the company had committed itself to training employees and keeping their skills current, at a cost, at one point, of some $25 million annually.
Human resources, especially its training function, became increasingly visible, according to Union Camp's Mr. Boekenheide, contributing to strategic decisions like acquisitions and divestitures. Mr. Boekenheide, who sits on the company's corporate policy committee, credits support from Union Camp's chief executive, Raymond E. Catledge, for the increased influence of human resources.
Discussions of the fate of the Savannah plant started in 1988, two years after the company squeezed out concessions from Local 407 of the United Paperworkers International Union during contract talks. Union Camp let it be known it was willing to make the $700 million investment in a new papermaking machine -- soon to be known as No. 8 -- but only if the union would allow the traditional lines of authority and work responsibility to be reorganized to improve efficiency.
Union Camp had in mind the example of self-directed teams, an approach that had been successful earlier in the 80's in its nonunionized, built-from-scratch mill in South Carolina. The company essentially told the union and the plant managers to figure out how they wanted to run the machine, put them in a room together along with a representative from human resources and let them work it out, with an eye on a March 1991 startup date.
"At first it was really strange," said Cle Lynes, a team leader who was a member of the original planning team. "It was the first time we had a chance to design a concept the way we wanted to run it. It took awhile to convince the people at the union."
LABOR and management reached agreement on a work-reorganization pact, by all accounts in the same manner they had hammered out union contracts: a combination of shouting and sweet reason. "We had some knock-down, drag-out fights," said Bobby Jones, a former union president who served on that team and is now an assistant superintendent at Savannah.
They came up with such startling departures from tradition as jettisoning supervisors on the evening and overnight shifts, integrating members of three previously separate departments into teams and giving each team decision-making authority.
Once Union Camp signed off on the final agreement, human resources moved to the foreground to help make the plan work. Facilitators joined the teams for a six-month training program, observing shift work and attending meetings where they might offer guidance or exercises in communications, leadership and team-building skills.
"They would say, 'You guys are getting off line here, you're straying out of the ballpark,' " Mr. Lynes said. The human resources people became coaches of a sort. "I felt it was a needed part. It was new to me," he said.
The teams now are keeping No. 8, the mill's flagship machine, humming along. It provides 40 percent of the Savannah plant's production. Savings have come from increased output and a reduction in personnel, principally in the number of frontline supervisors. In four years of the team concept, there has not been a grievance on No. 8.
Jerry Carter, a division director at Savannah, who was responsible for human resources during the key period, said the process isn't finished yet. "We're trying to take some of the concepts and transfer them to other parts of the mill," he said. But the teams that run No. 8 have become sophisticated at the people skills that seemed foreign four years ago.
The human resources people did what employees in the workplace of the future are expected to do: work themselves out of a job and move on to new challenges.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Gleam in Closed-End Muni Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
MILLIONS of investors who flocked to closed-end municipal bonds funds last year looking for tax-free income have been sorely disappointed this year. The funds lost an average 8.3 percent of their value in the first four months of the year, compared with a 6.3 percent drop in taxable bond funds.
People looking for a silver lining will find that closed-end municipal funds are now selling at the lowest prices in years. Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares and trade like common stock on major exchanges. They usually trade at prices that represent a discount or a premium to the underlying value of their holdings. 
 Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based trader and analyst of closed-end funds, said the municipal funds, which have almost always sold at hefty premiums, are now trading at discounts averaging 3 percent. Closed-end funds are most attractive when selling at a discount, because if the price rises merely to the level of the underlying securities, it will produce a capital gain for shareholders.
Municipals' low prices are unwarranted, many market professionals say. "Investors have overreacted to the recent backup in interest rates and have driven fund prices lower by indiscriminately selling into market weakness," said Anthony N. Maltese, senior analyst for closed-end funds at Smith Barney Shearson.
Closed-end municipal funds were introduced in 1986. There are now more than 200, with assets of more than $51.6 billion.
Part of the reason for their popularity is that the funds' yields can surpass those of mutual funds, which are priced by their net asset value. Closed-end funds can leverage their portfolios, magnifying both potential gains and losses. The ability to leverage paid off handsomely as interest rates declined over the last three years.
For many years, demand for the funds fueled sales and kept prices high. That began to change in late 1993, when John Nuveen & Company, the most prolific of the closed-end fund sponsors, was forced to withdraw seven new funds for lack of demand. Last year, 77 issues came to market; so far this year, there have been none. As demand dwindled, premiums turned to discounts on the funds.
When the Federal Reserve began pushing up short-term interest rates early this year, it spelled more trouble. Most of the funds own long-term issues, which are particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates. Those that leverage suffered most. Net asset values went the way of trading prices -- down.
Consequently, most investors who bought municipal funds last fall are sitting on large losses. Buyers of newer issues have been hit especially hard because those issues came to market with hefty underwriting costs built into their share prices. Because bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, the funds' yields have risen to more than 7 percent from less than 6 percent last fall.
Although obscured by interest-rate problems, the municipal bond market is technically strong, said Colin Mathews, an analyst of closed-end funds at Morningstar Inc.
Over the last three years, municipalities issued many bonds to refinance older debt that had higher rates. In 1993, refinancing accounted for 60 percent of new issues. But rising interest rates this year have made refinancing less attractive. The number of new bond issues is running 30 percent behind the year-earlier pace, Mr. Mathews said. These factors suggest weak supply.
But demand for the bonds, which generate tax-free income, is expected to be strong because of higher top tax rates.
In addition, the market's long-term fundamentals look good, Mr. Maltese said. Fed tightening should slow economic growth, he said, and investors will gradually move to longer-term bonds for the extra yield.
While closed-end municipal funds are cheap by historical standards, the analysts advise investors to look beyond prices.
Because munis still have room to fall, risk-averse investors should avoid funds that use leverage until interest rates settle down, said Mr. Mathews. He recommends Nuveen Municipal Value, which uses no leverage.
Investors willing to accept slightly more risk can reap higher yields in the leveraged funds. Mr. Maltese says prices of the leveraged funds have been under severe selling pressure because investors mistakenly believe that any drop in short-term rates will severely crimp dividend payments. He maintains that the funds have cash on hand to pay dividends and are less sensitive to interest rates. His picks? Four investment-grade funds sponsored by Nuveen: Insured Municipal Opportunity, Premier Insured, Premier Muni Income and Quality Income.
Mr. Mathews likes the junk municipal funds. Lower-rated issues are less sensitive to interest-rate changes and thus held up relatively well in the first quarter. Also, junk bonds tend to perform well as the economy strengthens. Mr. Mathews recommends MFS Municipal Income, an unleveraged fund with a 12-month yield of 7.7 percent.
Not everyone is a junk fan. Mr. Maltese says junk funds are a bad bet because of the weak economic recovery and big deficits in state budgets.
Investors holding large losses might consider bond fund swaps, said Mr. Herzfeld, the analyst in Miami. By selling shares at a loss and then buying shares in a similar fund, an investor can lock in a tax loss but keep the same market position.

HEADLINE: Who Said Los Angeles Could Be Rebuilt in a Day?

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
TWO years ago this month, with embers from the worst riots in United States history still smoldering, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley appointed Peter Ueberroth, the former Baseball Commissioner and Olympics organizer, to lead the rebuilding effort. The task was formidable, for the days of fire and looting had only compounded the devastation of years of economic neglect.
While some community leaders questioned whether Mr. Ueberroth, a white Republican, could understand the plight of those in the inner city, high hopes surrounded his appointment. A well-connected businessman, Mr. Ueberroth was seen as a valuable asset in persuading corporations to create jobs and economic opportunity. 
 And so began Rebuild L.A., an unparalleled effort to harness the energies of business, government and the community to tackle social problems. In the year that followed, Mr. Ueberroth and his lieutenants barnstormed corporate board rooms, collecting bountiful commitments for jobs, training programs and new enterprises.
At first glance, this visionary alliance appeared to be working. In less than a year, by Mr. Ueberroth's tally, 200 corporations had pledged more than $500 million in aid, including promises to build 32 supermarkets, 24 auto-parts stores, and 8 drugstores and to create 12,000 jobs.
But the bubble soon burst. Today, Rebuild L.A. has virtually disappeared from the Los Angeles landscape, and Mr. Ueberroth and his cochairmen have all stepped aside.
What went wrong? Simply put, it seems that no one really decided what Rebuild L.A.'s precise goals were, so the group was looked to as a knight in glittering armor, one that would magically solve every problem thrown in its path. But the weight of these expectations proved too much.
Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County, saw a "rampant naivete" among city and community leaders who saw Rebuild L.A. as a cure-all. "There were so many competing groups that wanted Rebuild L.A. to wave a magic wand and solve all their problems," he said. "The expectations were too grand for anyone to meet."
Korean-Americans wanted the group to provide immediate assistance for merchants whose shops had been burned. The president of the school board urged Rebuild L.A. to take a position against a possible teachers' strike. Others called on the group to tackle racial harmony, health care and education. When Rebuild L.A. declined or could not deliver, it was lambasted from within and without.
"Our No. 1 obstacle was getting people, including the media, to understand the mission we had laid out for Rebuild L.A.," Mr. Bradley, the former mayor, said in an interview last week. Mr. Bradley, who has joined a Los Angeles law firm, has rarely spoken of Rebuild L.A. since he left office last year. "Rebuild was designed to connect organizations in the inner city with corporations that could help them get on their feet and create jobs and provide employment," he said. "No matter how hard we tried, we could never get that across, and for that we received criticism without proper foundation."
To be sure, almost everyone agrees that poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles are much better off because of Rebuild L.A., which has brought millions of dollars, jobs, stores and services into the inner city that might not otherwise have come. But the reality falls far short of the promise.
Rebuild L.A. quickly became shrouded in controversy over whether it was responsive to the city's various racial groups. Almost weekly, a local politician, community leader -- or even a Rebuild L.A. board member -- publicly assailed the organization for failing to take on issues that were never part of the group's mandate and that it was not remotely equipped to handle. Bitter infighting among its board members, racial discord, unrealistic expectations, and constant criticism from local politicians eventually destroyed Rebuild L.A.'s credibility.
Further, questions were raised about the accuracy of the $500 million in corporate pledges. Most of those commitments came in the form of donated equipment, contracts to minority-owned companies, and training programs but not full-time jobs. And some companies that Rebuild L.A. said had made commitments later denied having made them.
Rebuild L.A. does still exist, but its new leaders, appointed in February, have far more limited goals as they try to rehabilitate the group's tarnished reputation. Instead of focusing on attracting big corporations to invest in neglected neighborhoods, Rebuild L.A. is now dedicated to fostering the development of small businesses through loan and equity funds and networking. The group refuses to become involved in other activities.
One big obstacle that Rebuild L.A. failed to overcome was its unwieldy organization, particularly its 94-member board and five co-chairmen, a management structure that made decision-making cumbersome.
After Mr. Bradley picked Mr. Ueberroth to head Rebuild L.A., community leaders and local politicians complained that the group's leadership did not reflect Los Angeles' various ethnic communities, so Mr. Ueberroth appointed four coleaders -- a black man, a white man, a Hispanic man and an Asian woman -- who shared equally in running the organization. Mr. Ueberroth also came under pressure to expand Rebuild L.A.'s board to include people aligned with various political factions in the city.
Members of Rebuild L.A.'s board, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the organization was often gridlocked because the cochairmen could not agree on important decisions and the board kept expanding the group's focus.
As a result, they said, Rebuild L.A. spent too much time trying to appease various constituency groups that were not necessarily committed to economic development. More often than not the friction centered on how many board members of a particular race had been appointed to a particular committee.
"For the first seven to eight months of our existence, we ran Rebuild L.A. like a business. We had account representatives who had to give progress reports at weekly account meetings," said Bernard Kinsey, one former cochairman.
"We built up enormous good will in the corporate community, but we couldn't capitalize on it because instead of holding account meetings we began fighting over how many board members of what color we had," said Mr. Kinsey, who is black and now heads his own economic development consulting firm. "Black folks and brown folks have to make their peace if organizations like Rebuild L.A. are to be successful."
MR. UEBERROTH is now a partner in the Contrarian Group, an investment and management firm, but remains a member of the Rebuild L.A. board. In a recent interview he said that despite all Rebuild L.A.'s problems, he believes inner-city Los Angeles "is much better off economically today than it was before the riots, and it will continue to get better."
Mr. Ueberroth said that he hopes Rebuild L.A.'s growing pains will not discourage major corporations from investing in the inner city and that he would like to see similar private-sector efforts established in neglected areas across the country.
Rebuild L.A.'s new chief executive is Linda Griego, who served as deputy mayor for economic development in Mr. Bradley's administration. The new chairman is Lodwrick M. Cook, Atlantic Richfield's chairman and chief executive.
"Maybe not enough time was given to the previous strategy," Ms. Griego said, "and I don't know how you measure whether it worked or didn't work, but obviously I wouldn't be here if it had worked."
Efforts to persuade companies to invest in the inner city were severely hampered by California's lingering recession, deepened by broad layoffs in the aerospace and military industries, which are concentrated in Southern California. Against this backdrop, asks Ms. Griego, "how realistic is it to think that they will provide jobs for the inner city."
Still, Rebuild L.A. officials said that corporations have made good on more than half of the $500 million in pledges. Throughout the neglected areas there are new supermarkets, auto-parts stores, drugstores and training centers, and more such enterprises are expected.
Toyota Motor Sales Inc. and the Los Angeles Urban League, for example, have built a center in Los Angeles where 100 people are trained each year as entry-level automotive technicians. The center also assists them in finding employment after graduation.
"I'm not of the view that Rebuild L.A. has been worthless, but they have done far less than anticipated, and that is a function of the challenge being too great and the organization being too new," said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles city councilman, who serves on the Rebuild L.A. board and has been an outspoken critic of the group. "They had to go to work in a seven- or eight-day period after the riots, and that's hardly the planning one needs to be effective."
 
 
 
SOME LESSONS FOR OTHER CITIES
 REBUILD L.A. was the first major undertaking of its kind to marshal the resources of big business, government and the community to improve economic conditions in the inner city, and as such it was widely seen as a blueprint for other efforts across the country.
The fate of this bold experiment thus provides valuable lessons for other cities and businesses that are trying to revitalize neglected areas. Experts in economic development say such groups should define their goals clearly and not allow outsiders to tinker with them. In addition, they say, such groups should build coalitions among minority communities early on and understand the role that local politics plays in the development process.
"The first requirement is to be realistic in your goals and to establish as clearly as possible the function of the organization and what you are planning to do, but especially what you are not planning to do," said Tom Bradley, former mayor of Los Angeles.

The Fear Is Old, The Economy New

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There is something perverse about reading the business news these days. Every month the Labor Department comes out with a new set of statistics about how unemployment is down and thousands of jobs are being created. But these stories always contain the same caveat, like the warning on a pack of cigarettes, that this news is bad for the health of the economy. The stories always go on to say that these great employment statistics triggered panic among Wall Street investors and led to a sell off of stocks and bonds.
Hey, what happened to the good old days, when movies were a quarter, Coke was 5 cents a bottle and people on Wall Street jumped out of windows because the economy was crashing, not booming? 
 Of course there has always been a link between unemployment numbers and inflation expectations. The more people are working, the more they have the money to pay for things; the more consumer demand outstrips factory capacity, the more prices shoot up, and the more prices shoot up the more the value of bonds, with their fixed interest rates, erodes.
But what has been so frustrating about the market reactions in recent months is that despite the surging economy, inflation has not been rising. It has remained flat, at around 3 percent, and yet Wall Street, certain that the shadow it sees is the ghost of higher inflation come to haunt the trading floors, has been clamoring to the Federal Reserve for higher rates. "Hit me again!" is the chant from the bond market, and last week the Fed did just that -- hiking interest rates for the fourth time in four months in an effort to persuade bond holders that growth would not get out of control, inflation would not get out of the box and the value of their fixed-rate bonds would not be eroded.
But what is implicit in such moves is the following assumption: that America has decided that in the tradeoff between job growth and inflation growth, between putting people back to work and putting up prices a little, jobs are less important. Higher mortgage rates and more unemployment be damned. But this has left a lot of people asking: "Who decided that?" "Was there a vote I missed?" "Why should we be held hostage by the bond market?"
Actually, there was a vote. It was last taken in 1946, and jobs won and inflation lost. Just as the nation emerged from World War II, flush with full employment, people realized that the Government, by its own actions, could control the economy through spending to engineer jobs for all. People said if the Government has the power to do that, it should commit itself to doing it, and so the Congress passed The Employment Act of 1946 (reaffirmed in 1978), guaranteeing full employment. But that proved to be the high-water mark for the jobs-over-inflation sentiment, because since the late 1970's the mood has steadily shifted.
Why? Today, it is not only the J. P. Morgans of Wall Street who worry about inflation. So do the record numbers of Main Street Americans who are invested in the bond and stock markets through their pension funds or mutual funds. Whether they wear blue or white collars, their stake in the markets has made them much more sympathetic to the priority of fighting inflation. More people expect that a tight-money policy will safeguard their investments.
Also, debt itself is handled somewhat differently now. A generation ago, inflation was almost always a boon to debtors, since it let them pay off loans in cheaper and cheaper dollars. But lenders increasingly began to link some mortgages and other loans to inflation rates by making them adjustable. Now inflation can make some debts more expensive.
Another factor reinforcing today's inflation-fighting-uber-Alles psychology is the large deficits run up during the 1980's. Those deficits have robbed the Federal Government of any fiscal policy to promote job growth and control inflation and counteract the power of Wall Street to keep interest rates up. Between spending caps and the locked-in programs, there's virtually no discretionary income to play with. And so the full weight of fine-tuning the economy has fallen upon the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. But the Fed is an institution that by charter and instinct is preoccupied with safeguarding the value of the currency; investors come first, job growth comes second.
Most important, there is the experience of the 1970's, when the highest inflation since World War II, coupled with a sharp drop in productivity, combined to seriously erode the wages, job prospects and standards of living for the middle class. The 1970's "stagflation" was a traumatic moment for the postwar baby-boom generation in particular. Many of them realized then that they were not going to live as well as their parents and that conclusion, which coincided with high inflation, has colored the views of this generation ever since.
"Every generation is traumatized by its own particular economic memory," said Ron Chernow, author of "The House of Morgan." "For our parents' generation that memory was the depression and for our generation it was the inflation of the 1970's."
But the intriguing question now is this: Are the Fed and the bond market generals fighting the last war against inflation, ignoring structural changes that have occurred over the past decade, which suggest that the economy and productivity can grow at a faster rate without setting off inflation?
 
Hot Competition
 In the 1950's and 1960's, for instance, the big smokestack industries -- autos, steel -- bought labor peace with big benefit packages because they were certain they could pass along the cost to consumers. At the time, these big American industries had little competition from Germany and Japan, whose war-ravaged factories were rebuilding. But in today's global marketplace, where foreign competitors loom at every price level, blithely passing along cost increases is much more difficult. "Instead of looking for ways to pass on higher costs to the consumers, companies now must emphasize ways to improve productivity, to cut overhead and to lower costs," Mr. Chernow noted.
At the same time, the global economy makes it easier for American companies, when they reach capacity limits at home, to shift production to their own factories abroad. The basic definition of the American economy's productive capacity can no longer be limited to the geographic boundaries of the United States.
Also, Mr. Chernow said, airlines, railroads and telecommunications companies all used to be protected areas of the economy regulated by the Federal Government. No more. Deregulation of the past decade has thrown all of these industries into a competitive pit: MCI scraps for AT&T's customers and Southwest Airlines slashes prices to undercut Delta Air Lines. Today there is price competition in so many more industries that once lived by creating inflation.
Finally, technological advances are faster than ever, bringing down prices: a computer that cost $2,000 one month might cost $1,000 six months later and become a $500 commodity item six months after that.
Still, despite this circumstantial evidence, economists say there are no hard data proving that if the Fed adopted a more relaxed monetary policy, structural changes in the economy would keep inflation from roaring back. One reason there has been no proof, though, is because no one dares let the economy go down this very path.
If the Fed learned one thing from the 1970's, it is that inflation is much harder to douse after it has really gotten going -- when it requires heavy unemployment and much slower growth to cool down. It is easier to prevent inflation from taking off at the first signs of the economy heating up. It is the difference between slamming on the brakes to stop a car speeding out of control and tapping them just as the car starts to pick up speed.
The only thing that can really change the Fed and bond market's instinct for tapping on the brakes at every turn is behavioral therapy -- a prolonged period in which interest rates are kept at a relatively low level and there is sustained growth without inflation. But given the Fed's historical experience, it is unlikely to opt for such an experiment anytime soon.

More Than One Way to Squeeze China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; Nicholas D. Kristof was Beijing bureau chief of The New York Times from 1988 to 1993.

 BODY:
China's best-known political prisoner may not be Ren Wanding, a human rights campaigner with Coke-bottle glasses and a Jeffersonian vision, or even Wei Jingsheng, whom the police last month tossed back in the jails where he had already spent more than 14 years. Instead, it may be Bill Clinton.
A year ago, the President demanded that China improve its human rights situation and warned that otherwise he would cut off the desirable tariff treatment known as "most favored nation" trade status. Now the deadline is less than two weeks away, and China has made only modest concessions. And the secret police have been extending a crackdown on democracy sympathizers and Christian organizers, so it may strain credulity for Mr. Clinton to claim his conditions have been met. 
 Of course, politicians strain credulity all the time, and the alternative in this case looks unattractive: a trade war with the world's fastest-growing economy. Moreover, with a struggle under way to succeed Deng Xiaoping, China's 89-year-old leader, a confrontation between China and the United States could tip the balance to the hard-liners whose campaign platform (within the Politburo) is even more repression. Talk to Chinese peasants, workers and intellectuals and on one subject you get virtual unanimity: Don't curb trade.
So Mr. Clinton is in a corner, searching for ways to pressure China without -- as a Chinese saying goes -- lifting up a rock only to drop it on his feet. One possible pressure point is suggested in China's own internal documents, which reflect the Communists' greatest fears.
"The United States will inevitably try to develop relations with Taiwan to pin us down," warns a recent classified briefing paper. "It is to the United States' benefit -- in political, economic and security terms -- to preserve the present situation in the Taiwan Strait, so that Taiwan is an independent entity for the long term."
The document reflects the one thing that the Politburo evidently fears even more than a loss of trade benefits: a substantial warming of Taiwan-United States relations. China is set to recover Hong Kong in 1997 and Macao in 1999, and its leaders desperately want to regain, willingly or by force, the biggest prize of all: Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province. Chinese leaders worry that they will be condemned by future Chinese patriots if they allow Taiwan to become formally independent during their watch.
This gives the United States some leverage. Mr. Clinton could threaten to open the floodgates of arms sales to Taiwan, helping American exporters instead of harming them. He could allow Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, a Cornell graduate, to attend class reunions (Mr. Lee now is not allowed in the United States for fear of offending China). If Secretary of State Warren Christopher is snubbed again in Beijing, he could arrange to refuel in Taipei.
China's leaders might try to retaliate by punishing American exporters. But if the United States sent strong signals that such actions would lead to an invitation to the White House for Mr. Lee, China probably would back off. China was outraged, for example, when the United States announced in 1992 that it would sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan, but it never took serious retaliatory action.
Similarly, one approach to improve human rights in Tibet would be for Mr. Clinton to make clear that unless the situation improves in Lhasa, he will invite the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, to the White House for a formal discussion and joint press conference.
Of course, it is the threat of sanctions rather than their imposition that generally wins concessions. But while economic threats worked well in past years, they are losing their credibility. The Chinese authorities apparently decided months ago that the Administration is bluffing when it talks about jacking up tariffs across the board, and that is one reason why Beijing has been lackadaisical about offering concessions.
In contrast with most-favored-nation status, sometimes called the nuclear weapon of international trade, improved relations with Taiwan or the Dalai Lama are a tactical weapon, easily calibrated step by step. This makes them a much more realistic threat. If Washington were to make clear that it would react to Chinese abuses of human rights by moving closer to Taiwan and the Dalai Lama, the Communists might ease up a bit on repression -- just as in past years they did so to avoid a cutoff of M.F.N., when the threat seemed more credible. And economic sanctions would give the Communists a scapegoat for inflation and unemployment, while ordinary Chinese care little about Taiwan and Tibet.
There are some intermediate steps that Mr. Clinton is believed to be considering, but with most there is less than meets the eye. One is to extend low tariffs for most Chinese exports, while raising them for products from the Chinese Army or state-owned factories. The problem here is that army-owned companies are involved in all kinds of businesses, from making clocks to selling blood, and it can be difficult to determine whether a company is army-owned or even state-owned.
American officials have also been asking executives whether they would be willing to accept a code of conduct for American companies in China. Such a code would be modeled on the Sullivan Principles once applied to American companies in South Africa, but the situations are not parallel: In South Africa, racial discrimination was a private as well as Governmental affair, while in China repression comes from the Government alone in areas over which foreign companies have little influence.
Mr. Clinton may also call for a bilateral commission on human rights, an idea under consideration for several years. The problem is that while China might be willing to discuss human rights, it is much less willing to improve them. That is a reminder that American efforts, no matter what they are, probably can achieve only marginal improvements in China's human rights.

Foreign Policy: Florida Has One

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
To the dismay of Florida's 14 million residents, the American system of government does not give states a formal role in determining foreign policy. But with Haiti descending deeper into chaos and Cuba's future more in doubt than ever, Gov. Lawton Chiles and other state officials are insisting that they will not sit by and merely watch as another administration in Washington stumbles in the Caribbean and then expects Florida to pay the price of its failure.
So Florida in recent years has tried to have its own foreign policy -- including the sorts of panels and policy wonks usually more characteristic of a sovereign nation. Even before the current Haiti crisis (last night a tighter United Nations embargo was scheduled to take effect in the effort to restore democracy there), Florida's foreign policy objectives were essentially twofold: encourage the flow of foreign trade and investment and limit the flow of illegal immigrants and political refugees. Constitutional impediments notwithstanding, Mr. Chiles has had some success in reminding the Federal Government that it can ill afford to ignore Florida's interests and concerns. Just last month he filed a lawsuit in which he argued that since foreign affairs are a Federal responsibility, so is the care of the immigrants who flock here as a result of Washington's decisions. 
 Florida, of course, is hardly the only state that has been forced to develop a foreign policy. With Texas and California in the lead, the Southwestern states meet regularly with their counterparts on the Mexican side of the border to discuss problems, bypassing both Washington and Mexico City. Out of practical necessity, cities along both the Mexican and Canadian border have also forged ties with their neighbors. And then there is the case of New York City when Edward I. Koch was Mayor and seemed to have an opinion on every issue from the Middle East to China.
But Florida is a singular case, if only because of its location. Miami, for example, lies closer to 16 Latin American and Caribbean capitals than to Washington, D.C. So while some other border states have the luxury of focusing on Mexico or Canada, Florida must cope with the consequences of serving as the main port of entry for some 30 countries. "Today's international problems become Florida's problems tomorrow," said Mark B. Rosenberg, the departing director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University here. "Our geography gives us a proximity and immediacy to foreign affairs that we cannot escape."
At the moment, the most pressing issue for the state is obviously Haiti. Having absorbed successive waves of Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan refugees during the 1980's, each in the amount of 100,000 or more, the state is eager to avoid yet another influx. As a result, both of Florida's senators, Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a Republican, favor military intervention in Haiti.
"It's the only option left that will send the message to the military there," Mark Mills, an aide to Mr. Mack, said. "Tighter sanctions will just increase the number of Haitians who attempt to make it to Florida." In comments sure to please Florida's Congressional delegation, Mr. Clinton last week listed his reasons for considering military force, including preventing another huge exodus to Florida. "It's in our backyard," he said of Haiti.
Mr. Chiles, a Democrat who is running for re-election, says the Clinton Administration over all has been "more sympathetic" to Florida's concerns than were its Republican predecessors. But he also acknowledged that Haiti policy is "based on a number of factors that are competing, and Florida is only one part of them." Though Florida has 25 electoral votes that Mr. Clinton would dearly like to win in a campaign for re-election (having lost them narrowly in 1992), the President is also, as Mr. Chiles pointed out, "under attack by certain members of the Congressional Black Caucus," who also wield considerable clout and are pushing for at least a more humanitarian stance toward Haitian refugees.
The worsening situation in Haiti, however, is by no means the main foreign policy headache of state officials. President Clinton's policy turnabout this month, ending the forced repatriation of Haitian refugees intercepted on the high seas, did not set off alarm bells here, in large part because the move was seen as essentially cosmetic rather than substantive, intended to end the fast of the lobbyist Randall Robinson. Haitian boat people were already landing as far north as Fort Pierce, more than 100 miles north of Miami, and are expected to continue doing so, but in a trickle rather than a flood.
It is instead the prospect of tumultuous change in Cuba that appears to haunt policymakers in the state. "In the long run, the Cubans have much more potential for getting here than Haitians," said Ambler Moss, a former American Ambassador to Panama who is head of the North-South Center at the University of Miami. "We're not talking fragile wooden boats, but 747's" and perhaps even flotillas of Cuban-Americans rushing over to Havana to bring back relatives should the Communist regime of Fidel Castro fall. "What is the Coast Guard going to do, fire on American citizens trying to rescue their families?" Dr. Rosenberg asked.
The anxiety is also fed by the conviction that the White House, already entangled in one unwanted crisis in the Caribbean, has avoided dealing with, or even planning for, the end of the Castro regime. Mr. Chiles has responded by reviving the Florida Commission on a Free Cuba, to examine the impact on the state of a new government in Havana, and revitalizing the Florida International Affairs Commission, which advises him on commercial and political ties with the world. The Dade County Office of Emergency Management and Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce have drawn up their own contingency plans for the arrival of 250,000 or more Cubans, and are working closely with the state government in Tallahassee.
"We know that sooner or later, something is going to happen in Cuba, and we are trying to prepare ourselves as much as we can," Mr. Chiles said. The Governor, who served in the United States Senate for 18 years before being elected to the Statehouse in 1990, added: "I've talked to the President about Cuba, but I have not tried to persuade him of what his policy toward Cuba should be. I'm not in that business anymore."
Politically, Mr. Clinton has little to gain by tinkering with Cuba policy. During the 1992 campaign, he made some inroads in the Cuban-American vote, and picked up many large donations from wealthy Cuban exiles, after pledging his support of a tightened embargo of Cuba. Haitians, in contrast, are not yet a major voting bloc in the state and must rely on purely moral arguments.
Paradoxically, Florida can take some consolation in the knowledge that its links with Latin America offer opportunities even when stability is absent from the region. "Here in Florida, we have been living off capital flight and political exiles for decades," said Diego Asencio, a former senior American diplomat and ex-chairman of the Florida International Affairs Commission. "We have a lot of wealthy migrants, but those are not the type of immigrants that people complain about."
Nevertheless, Florida prefers a state of political calm in which economic growth can flourish. The state lobbied hard to win the hemispheric summit, in which 30 heads of state will gather here late this year, and hopes to use the gathering as a platform to win Washington over to the idea of a Western Hemisphere Free Trade Association. Even if Haiti and Cuba fade as issues, further initiatives in international affairs are likely. "Basically," Dr. Rosenberg said, "we've discovered that foreign policy is too important to be left to the Federal Government."

HEADLINE: U.S. BACKING WORK ON CZECH REACTORS BY WESTINGHOUSE

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
In a plan that is drawing diplomatic protests from abroad and political objections at home, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation intends to use its own technology to complete two Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic with the backing of the Clinton Administration.
In support of the first attempt to graft American technology onto a Soviet reactor, the Administration rebuffed Congressional and environmental opponents to approve $317 million in loan guarantees to finance the work. 
 Administration officials said the Westinghouse technology would increase safety at the plant near the Czech town of Temelin, and was a step toward the broader goal of improving safety at other Soviet-designed reactors. There are 16 uncompleted reactors in Eastern Europe, as well as more than 50 operating or under construction in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria.
"Nobody is saying we love the project," said Kathleen McGinty, director of environmental policy at the White House. "We like a project that has a chance of being safe rather than a ticking time bomb. We are not going to be a party to looking the other way while another Chernobyl occurs."
But some critics say the United States Government could end up paying for an accident at the Czech plant, and environmentalists and the Austrian Government warn that the Russian design may be too flawed to be safe, even with Western technology. An estimated 10 million people live within a 100-mile radius of the Temelin site and Prague, the Czech capital, is 60 miles away. The Austrian capital of Vienna is 120 miles southeast -- and downwind -- of Temelin.
"An accident at Temelin could result in devastating health, environmental, economic and social consequences for all of Austria's eight million citizens," a panel of Austrian scientists warned earlier this year.
The Temelin reactors, called the VVER-1000, are the most advanced Soviet design. They are not the type that exploded at the Chernobyl plant near Kiev in 1986, causing billions of dollars in damages in the worst accident in the history of nuclear power.
"These are excellent machines and, with the investments, they should have a very long and productive life," said Nathaniel D. Woodson, president of the Westinghouse energy systems business unit in Pittsburgh. "This work is in our own enlightened self-interest as well as good business."
For Westinghouse, which faces a moribund domestic nuclear market, the project represents a chance to get a jump on European competitors in the fight for repair contracts that the World Bank estimates could reach $24 billion.
But the Czech project and the Administration's broader goals have touched off a high-stakes, behind-the-scenes debate in Congress and the commercial nuclear industry that will help shape the future of nuclear power in Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine.
Several influential legislators are concerned that the United States Government could end up paying for damages in the case of an accident at the Czech plant, because the Westinghouse work is being financed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
"Any possibility that American taxpayers could be liable for a nuclear accident in the Czech Republic as a result of Ex-Im Bank guarantees would be unacceptable," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
 
Reviews Challenged
 In approving the guarantee, the Export-Import Bank said it had relied on its own safety review and assessments of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Environmentalists and congressional investigators have challenged the adequacy of those reviews.
The bank, which promotes exports of American products, has only one nuclear engineer on its staff and no formal procedure for evaluating environmental concerns, according to Carol F. Lee, the bank's general counsel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has trained Czech workers but has not performed its own evaluation of the Russian reactor design.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, in studies of the VVER-1000 reactors at Temelin and elsewhere, found design problems, and the agency has not thoroughly evaluated whether Westinghouse's technology can remedy all the flaws, said David R. Kyd, director of information at the agency's headquarters in Vienna.
Vice President Al Gore, widely regarded as a strong environmentalist, and his national security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, were among the leading proponents of the project, according to Administration officials.
"If Leon and the Vice President had not wanted this to happen, I'm sure it would have sunk beneath the waves," said a White House official who worked on the National Security Council report.
 
An Environmental Press
 The issue of Temelin arose at a reception at Mr. Gore's residence on Feb. 24 for environmental leaders and Administration officials involved in environmental policy. The environmentalists were pressing the officials to give a fuller hearing to their concerns about Temelin before the approval of the project by the Export-Import Bank, according to several people who were at the reception.
"Some of the Administration people pulled the Vice President off to the side and as we were leaving a White House staffer said there would be a review," said James N. Barnes, director of the international department at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group.
But Mr. Barnes and other environmental representatives said they did not get another chance to object. Ms. McGinty of the White House said Temelin was discussed at the reception, but she said it was an informal gathering and the issue was not broached with Mr. Gore.
Last year, Greenpeace and Czech environmental groups staged a protest at Temelin, but opposition came later in the United States. Not until early this year did the Austrian Government express its concerns to the Administration and members of Congress.
 
Austrian Concern
 So great is the Austrian anxiety that Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told President Clinton last month, during a meeting about Bosnia, that his Government was extremely concerned about the potential for an accident at Temelin and similar reactors in other neighboring countries, Austrian diplomats say.
The diplomats said they were not optimistic that the Administration would reverse its stand on Temelin, but they said they hoped that work on other plants would be reconsidered.
Westinghouse is a finalist in the bidding for work on four Russian-designed reactors in Hungary, and the company's officials said part of the contract would involve obtaining Export-Import Bank financing.
Temelin is viewed as a breakthrough by Westinghouse, which beat European powerhouses like Siemens A. G. of Germany and Framatome S. A. of France to win the $400 million contract.
Business is bad at home for Westinghouse and others in the industry. Part of the reason is the good supply of electricity and part is the effective opposition by environmental groups. The last license that led to the completion of a nuclear plant in the United States was issued in 1974.
Despite the concerns in Congress and elsewhere, the Clinton Administration has pushed ahead with the Temelin project and its broader program. Last fall, the National Security Council produced a report for the Export-Import Bank that supported the project. On March 10, the bank's board agreed to guarantee $317 million in commercial loans for the Westinghouse contract.
 
Executives Shaken
 For Temelin, Westinghouse is performing extensive tests and computer modeling to adapt its technology to the nearly completed reactor vessels. From the company's perspective, the profitability will come from replicating the work on other Soviet-designed reactors.
As a result, the simmering controversy over Temelin has shaken Westinghouse executives and sent them hurrying to enlist lobbyists, people familiar with the company's strategy said.
Several Congressional committees are examining issues related to Temelin, but the primary investigation is being conducted by the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
The subcommittee has demanded all documents relied on by the Export-Import Bank to approve the Temelin loan guarantee. The subcommittee also plans to ask the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to conduct an extensive study at the Temelin site to determine the condition of work already completed there on the construction and mechanical systems.
To deal with the inquiry, Westinghouse has hired former Representative Dennis E. Eckart, Democrat of Ohio, a one-time protege of Representative Dingell, and Michael F. Barrett Jr., a former staff director of the oversight subcommittee.
 
Who Would Pay?
 Mr. Dingell said he was concerned about the safety of the Soviet reactors and the potential liability for United States taxpayers in the event of an accident at a plant with American financing.
American companies also are worried about who would pay for an accident. Although the Czech Republic has promised to sign international accords that protect contractors from financial liability before the Westinghouse work on Temelin begins, Russia and Ukraine have refused.
An ad hoc group of nine big United States nuclear companies, including the Bechtel Power Corporation and Combustion Engineering, has told the Clinton Administration that its members will not make safety improvements on Russian-designed reactors until the Government protects them from financial liability. Large European contractors have taken a similar position.
"Anybody dealing in those countries is dealing in a vacuum as far as liability goes," said Leland F. Willis, vice president of Associated Universities Inc., a consortium of universities that operates Brookhaven National Laboratory and leads the United States contractors' group.
Westinghouse and some other American companies are negotiating with the State Department and the Department of Energy to gain coverage under a law that allows the Government to provide relief to companies in a national emergency or for national security purposes. The law was invoked in the $250 million bailout of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in 1971.
"They haven't been willing to do it so far," Mr. Willis said.

HEADLINE: Pequot Indians' Casino Wealth Extends the Reach of Tribal Law

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn., May 18

 BODY:
A customer of the Foxwoods Casino slipped, fell and gashed his head recently, leaving a scar near his eyebrow. At the Mirage, or Caesars, or Circus Circus, that could have been bad news for the casino, with lawyers seeking large damages for the victim's pain and suffering.
But the forum for the Foxwoods case was Tribal Court, created by the sovereign Indian nation of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and operated under rules that severely restrict how much an accident victim can collect. In this instance, even tribal officials admit that the man got next to nothing because the rules link compensation to the cost of treatment, and his was cheap. The case is now under appeal before an appellate panel, which like the Tribal Court is composed of judges hired by the tribe. 
 In much the same way as it built its gambling empire in this landscape of cows and cornfields, the Pequot tribe is now enacting and enforcing its own laws on a scale that tribal officials say has never before been tried because no tribe before the Pequots has had the financial clout to do so.
Many tribes around the country have exercised legal authority on their reservations, but now, perhaps for the first time, large numbers of non-Indians will find themselves subject to Indian judicial processes. Among those people are 8,350 Foxwoods employees -- most of them not Indians, and none of them covered by Federal or state labor laws -- and the roughly 140,000 people who visit the casino each week.
The Pequots are the owners of the nation's largest and most successful Indian-owned business, and with tens of millions of dollars a month in gambling profits, they are building their own court system, their own police force and their own jail. In addition to an Indian judge from the Passamaquoddy tribe in Maine, they have appointed four local lawyers as judges in the lower court. And they have hired two retired judges -- including a retired senior judge from the Federal bench, Robert C. Zampano -- to hear appeals, plus three prosecutors.
An 18-member police force cruises the reservation in new Ford Explorers. The tribe's lawyers stalk state and Federal courts. A case now before the State Appellate Court, for example, is testing whether the Pequots or the state have first rights to prosecute an Indian who committed a crime on the reservation. In another case, the Pequots have challenged a company's right to sue the tribe in state court over a commercial contract dispute.
The point of all this, tribal officials say, is not the law for its own sake, but rather what the ability to make and enforce laws implies: authority, independence and sovereignty. Many tribes have the powers being exercised here, the Pequots say, but most are just too poor to make it stick.
"Tribes have always asserted their sovereign status and their ability to govern themselves," said Henry J. Sockbeson, a lawyer for the tribe. "You're limited, however, by your financial ability to exercise sovereignty." What's happening for the Pequots, Mr. Sockbeson said, is that monetary muscle is finally coinciding with the powers and rights that have long existed for Indians mainly as theory.
"If we want a police force, we just go out and buy one," he said. "That's true sovereignty, and that's something that not many tribes have had an opportunity to really exercise nationally."
The story has echoes in many corners of Indian country, from the Seminoles of Florida to the Oneidas in upstate New York, who voted this month to establish their own judiciary system. But in Connecticut, in particular, the stakes are enormous: Foxwoods draws about 140,000 gamblers in a typical week, and the roughly 310-member tribe is now one of the biggest private employers in the state, earning profits that are projected to reach $600 million this year.
 
Economic Muscle
 Those staggering numbers, and the tribe's use of its economic muscle in land purchases and more recently on the legal front, have troubled many state officials, who invariably preface their remarks by praising the tribe and the general notion of American Indian economic empowerment, before quietly wringing their hands over the potential of an unfettered extralegal super-corporation rising in their midst. On the other hand, there is hardly anything the officials could do if they wanted, beyond honing the skills of diplomacy as they would in dealing with any foreign power.
"The state really has very little leverage," said the Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, who approved a compact this week for a second casino to be opened near here, in Montville, by the Mohegan tribe. The bottom line, Mr. Blumenthal said, is that employees of the tribe and casino patrons should know that an Indian reservation is essentially sovereign soil with its own rules. "The legal rights of someone on the reservation, a non-Indian, are drastically different," he said.
For one thing, there are no jury trials in the Pequots' Tribal Court, which has authority over all civil disputes, accidents and injuries occurring on the reservation. And employees can pretty much forget about a union. The system of labor statutes enacted by the seven-member Tribal Council gives workers plush benefits, including free prescriptions at the tribal pharmacy and all the free food they can eat at work, but no rights whatsoever to organize for collective bargaining.
Critics, including some frustrated local lawyers who are unable to earn fat contingency fees in Tribal Court because of the damage limitations, and labor union organizers who are prohibited from recruiting in the casino, say the Pequots are using their broad claims of tribal sovereignty to protect profits, not ancestral heritage.
 
Every Executive's Dream
 "The tribe is in fact the employee's judge and jury, and the last time I looked that's not what we in the United States consider fair," said Debra Jordan, state organizer for Local 217 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, which is trying to unionize Foxwoods by meeting with employees in their homes.
"It's the dream of every chief executive officer," said State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a Democrat from East Haven who is chairman of the Legislature's Labor and Public Employees Committee. "Complete power, and more money than you can spend."
Mr. Sockbeson and other tribal officials readily admit that what they are doing is evolving, and that the process will have its bumps. The rules about damages for disfigurement cases, for example, like the one involving the man with the scarred eyebrow, are specifically being reviewed in light of that case because some awards may be inadequate. Rules are also being formulated that will allow the Tribal Court to hear employee grievances.
And some things are simply yet to be figured out. If a crime is committed in the casino, for example, it is clear enough that the state police have authority to investigate and make arrests. The tribe agreed to that under the compact it signed with the state authorizing the casino.
But outside the confines of the casino -- in the hotel, say, or the parking lot -- things are much more complicated. Depending on where a crime occurs on the reservation, whether it involves an Indian, and the seriousness of the crime, any of three police agencies could be in charge.
"There's no agreement as to whether it is state jurisdiction that criminally applies, or Federal, and the tribe's position may well be that neither does," said Mr. Blumenthal, the Attorney General.
Tribal officials say their criminal court has limited authority under Federal law to impose criminal punishment in the cases it does handle -- a maximum of $5,000 in fines, for example. On the other hand, it could order banishment from the tribe, a potentially devastating economic sanction for an errant tribal member.
 
The Indian Way
 In any case, trials and punishments are not their goal, they say. The aim is rather to search for nonconfrontational solutions and common ground -- an approach that is closer to the Indian way. Resources are being deployed for counseling, rehabilitation and mediation. So far, however, there have been only two criminal cases on which to lavish this attention, said the Chief of Police, William V. Hickey Sr., both minor offenses.
Some local lawyers who have practiced in the Tribal Court questioned whether judges employed by the tribe can, over the long run, be truly objective in judging their employer's culpability day after day in accident cases.
"If you're hired by somebody and you have a decision that can go either way, it's more than likely you're going to make the decision in favor of the party who's paying your way," said Jeffrey N. Low, a lawyer in Norwich who tried and lost the inaugural Tribal Court case this year. "They've got to reconsider their system."
Mr. Low's client, a 64-year-old woman who broke her hip after she and another patron bumped into each other, lost when the judge said that the collision could have occurred anywhere, and that therefore the casino was not responsible. The decision has been appealed.
Tribal officials say they believe their judges can be objective, because, like state judges, they are hired on contracts that cannot be broken except for violations of a judicial code of conduct patterned after the state judiciary's. In any case, no one expected the local bar association to be happy.

Chart: "THE LAW: Who Has Jurisdiction on Indian Reservations"
 The Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Connecticut has jurisdiction over many legal matters on its reservation and in its casino.
 
LAWS THAT DO NOT APPLY ON THE RESERVATION
 Federal and state labor regulations, including the Nation Labor Relations Act of 1935 that gives workers off the reservation the right to vote for a union.
 State environmental laws
 Zoning
 Fire and building codes
 
PEQUOT LAWS IN EFFECT ON THE RESERVATIONCivil suit damages against the tribe, for things like an injury from a fall in the casino, are capped. In the category called "pain and suffering," for example, which can typically total two or three times a victim's medical expenses in state court, Tribal Court will award no more than 50 percent. A person with a $1,000 medical bill could thus collect no more than $1500 total.
 Employees, while denied the right to hold a union vote, are guaranteed in writing a grievance system that leads up to the casino's chief executive, and from there to tribal court for a final appeal. A labor dispute cannot be taken to state or Federal court.
 
AREAS WHERE JURISDICTION IS UNCLEAR
 For crimes committed on the casino floor, the state police have primary authority to investigate.
 For crimes committed in the hotel or parking lot, the tribal police claim jurisdiction.
 Crimes committed by non-Indians fall under state jurisdiction, no matter who has first authority.
 Crimes committed by Indians fall under tribal authority, unless the crime is one of certain enumerated major felonies, like assault or kidnapping, in which case Federal prosecutors are summoned. (pg. 32)

HEADLINE: Barry Runs Again to Lead Washington

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Less than four years after a cocaine-possession conviction forced him out of City Hall and into prison, Marion S. Barry Jr. is again running for mayor of Washington.
He finished a six-month sentence in April 1992, but immediately tried to regain the political stage, winning a two-year term on the District Council as representative of the city's poorest ward. Now, he says, pointing to the city's problems of unrelenting violence, poverty and urban flight, Washington needs the kind of strong leadership he provided in his three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1990.
More to the point, he says, the city needs to be rescued from his successor, Sharon Pratt Kelly. 
 "Washington, D.C., needs strong, compassionate and visionary leadership to restore hope, energize its people and guide the city to recovery," Mr. Barry said today as he announced his candidacy in a speech to about 250 supporters at a District of Columbia high school.
Sounding what promises to be his campaign theme, he added: "I am that leader. Our city needs healing. It needs recovery. Who can better help our city recover than someone who has gone through recovery?"
 
Videotape of Drug Use
 In 1990, Mrs. Kelly was elected by more than 80 percent of the vote on a promise to revive the city from the legacy of Mr. Barry, who had been arrested in a downtown hotel. He was caught by Federal agents smoking crack with a woman, and the episode became a national embarrassment for Washington. Videotapes made by the authorities were played repeatedly on network newscasts. After his conviction, Mr. Barry underwent rehabilitation for drugs and alcohol.
Against that background, Mrs. Kelly, a lawyer who emphasized her inexperience with politics, became an easy choice for voters. She set out to trim the bureaucracy that had swelled under Mr. Barry, control the budget, increase revenue, reduce crime, slow the population decline, restore integrity to the Mayor's Office and change the District's onerous relationship with Congress.
As the capital of the United States, Washington operates as no other city, with a quasi-independent status providing Congress the right to approve budgets, set taxes and override any legislative decisions. Only since 1974 have residents elected their mayor; before then the mayor was appointed by the President.
By Mr. Barry's third term, the city was suffering with a budget deficit approaching $300 million and city employment rolls bloated with people who had won jobs through political patronage. Further, in the five years through 1991, the homicide rate increased in six of the city's seven police districts, and crimes against people rose by nearly 47 percent.
 
Return to Early Themes
 But even though Mrs. Kelly eliminated 6,000 jobs, sold bonds to reduce the deficit and persuaded the Federal Government to contribute more to the District budget, she drew increasing criticism for the rising rates of crime, homelessness and unemployment. She also alienated some supporters with her blunt style and with certain expenditures, like $40,000 for a granite fireplace in her office.
At the same time, Mr. Barry's star was rising again. Fueled by feelings among some residents that white Federal authorities had set him up for the cocaine arrest because he was a strong black leader, he returned to the themes of his early days as a civil rights leader, taking up the cause of the poor and unemployed, and crushed a longtime incumbent to win the council seat for Ward 8, which is 90 percent black.
Mr. Barry's message was a far cry from that of the boom times of the 1980's, when he reached out to middle-class blacks, business leaders and other members of the city's Democratic mainstream.
But experts in local politics say that only with that kind of support does Mr. Barry have any chance to unseat Mrs. Kelly. And those groups, the experts say, will be the hardest for Mr. Barry to win over. Councilman John Ray, who announced today he would oppose Mr. Barry and Mrs. Kelly in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, has characterized Mr. Barry's candidacy as a "hustle on this city."
"He had a terrible record for 12 years," Mr. Ray said of the former mayor. "He left the city bankrupt."
James L. Hudson, a former legal adviser to the city's first elected mayor since 1871, Walter E. Washington, and a former Barry supporter, said Mr. Barry "has to prove himself to voters."
"Even putting aside his drug issue, the city missed some great opportunities," Mr. Hudson added. "By his second and third terms, there was a deterioration of the public infrastructure, and the city became a less inhabitable place to live."
In his 45-minute speech, Mr. Barry stressed two basic themes: that the Kelly administration had betrayed the city by inadequate leadership and that crime and safety would be his top priorities. He proposed that a "gun court" be established for speedy trials in crimes involving guns, that three-year prison sentences be imposed on anyone selling guns illegally, and that schools and churches set up "gun boxes," in which people could leave anonymous information about gun owners.
While he has the certain support of many low-income residents throughout Washington, it remains unclear whether he can convince others that the city would be well served by a man whose social habits once brought it embarrassment.
"There are definitely people who have forgiven him and groups who will never vote for him, black and white, but more white than black," said Mark Plotkin, a political commentator for WAMU, a local public radio station. "Then there are those who want to see how he acts during the campaign, and Barry is savvy enough to know that how he conducts himself may have a bearing. He's now considered a responsible legislator, a low-profile legislator. The city has not really see him since he left. So this is like an audition."

HEADLINE: Move in California to Bar Service to Aliens

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 21

 BODY:
A ballot initiative that would deny public education and non-emergency medical care to illegal aliens in California is the latest and one of the most drastic attempts to curb illegal immigration and its costs.
Backers of the petition drive, "Save Our State," say they have gathered 600,000 signatures, with those of 384,974 registered voters required to place the proposal on the ballot. Voter registrars have until Tuesday to verify signatures, and if the requirement is met, voters will consider the measure in November. 
 In addition to cutting off free social services, the proposal would require teachers, health care workers and the police to report the presence of any "apparent illegal immigrants" they deal with.
Without these services, argued Harold Ezell, one of the initiative's authors and a former Western regional chief of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, illegal aliens would "go back to where they came from."
 
Hurdles Even if Approved
 Opponents of the proposal acknowledge that they will have a difficult time defeating it.
Even if it is adopted, hurdles await. Civil rights groups say the authorities will find it difficult to demand documents of "apparent illegal immigrants" without engaging in racial discrimination.
In addition, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that public schools must educate children regardless of their immigration status. The chairman of the petition drive, Ron Prince, said the proposed measure would offer a promising vehicle for the Court to reverse its position.
Mr. Prince said that the composition of the Court had changed since its ruling on the issue in 1982 and that the ruling had been based on immigration conditions that had changed.
Illegal aliens are already ineligible for welfare and most other public assistance in California. The measure would not deny emergency care, including that for childbirth.
 
Clash of Philosophies
 Already, arguments over the Save Our State initiative have crystallized a clash of philosophies over immigration that has been growing in the nation's border states.
"It's obvious we cannot assimilate all of the illegals in the world," Mr. Ezell said. "How many can we educate, medicate, incarcerate and compensate? Just because they are here illegally doesn't mean they have a right to stay here and a right to our tax dollars."
Mr. Prince placed the proposal in a purely economic context, saying, "The initiative is needed because the state is going bankrupt."
But Arturo Vargas, a lawyer with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the measure would require doctors, teachers and police officers to be "agents of a Big Brother state" by making them verify the immigration status of people they serve.
Despite the backers' assurances that the proposal is racially and ethnically colorblind, Mr. Vargas said it would target Hispanic immigrants, who make up the vast majority of illegal aliens in California.
Mr. Vargas also questioned the assertion that people would stop coming to the United States illegally if the benefits were cut. "That's not why they come," he said. "It would create an underground situation with people living in the shadows of our society."
 
'Too Willing to Pander'
 The political tide seems to be running against opponents of the measure. As the state's economy recovers sluggishly from recession, the state's politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, remind Californians that the state has already absorbed more than one-third of the country's legal immigrants and more than half its international refugees.
California is also home to a huge proportion of the country's estimated 3.5 million illegal aliens. In San Diego County, which borders Mexico, an estimated 200,000 people, or 9 percent of the population, are in this country illegally.
"I blame the political leadership that has been all too willing to pander on this issue and allow people to believe that if we would just deny education and emergency health care to illegal aliens, all these lost aerospace and manufacturing jobs would return," said Robert Rubin, a spokesman for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, based in San Francisco.
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who faces a difficult re-election campaign this fall, turned up the heat on this issue last August with a proposal to withhold health care and schooling from illegal aliens and to deny citizenship to any children who might be born to them in the United States. The citizenship proposal would require a constitutional amendment.
A Los Angeles Times poll last September found that 86 percent of Californians considered illegal immigration to be a problem of moderate-to-major proportion. Seventy-six percent said they believed that illegal aliens cost more in social services and health care than they contributed in taxes and productivity. Two months ago, another Los Angeles Times poll found that 62 percent of respondents favored the Save Our State initiative.
The state Republican Party helped to finance the petition drive, but neither it nor Governor Wilson has taken an official position on the measure.
Most Democrats in the latest poll joined most Republicans in supporting the initiative. But the State Democratic Party has not taken a position on it. Opponents of the measure said the party was more likely to emphasize border controls and sanctions on employers who hire undocumented workers.
The state's two United States Senators, both Democrats from the San Francisco Bay area, have contributed strong language on the issue, but more modest proposals. Senator Barbara Boxer urged the use of the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, and Senator Dianne Feinstein called for a $1 border-crossing fee to pay for tougher policing of the border.
 
A Crucial Question
 A crucial issue at the heart of the ballot initiative is how educators, health care workers and the police would determine "apparent illegal immigrants" without engaging in racial discrimination.
Mr. Vargas, the defense fund lawyer, said, "I could easily foresee a situation where I myself -- I'm very Mexican-looking, yet I'm a second-generation United States citizen -- where I myself could be subject to demonstrating that I am a citizen of this country merely because I am brown-skinned, black-haired and have a mustache."
But Mr. Ezell brushed aside such concerns. "All we're saying is, 'Ask,' " he said. "It's O.K. to ask. We're not after any color skin. Just ask. It seems like it ought to be O.K. to ask. So what's the big deal?"

HEADLINE: Pooling Risks and Sharing Costs in Effort to Gain Stable Insurance Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Few parts of President Clinton's health plan sound so simple as the idea of charging the same insurance premiums to all people in a geographic area, whether they are young or old, sick or healthy.
The goal is to return health insurance to "what it was meant to be: a fair deal at a fair price," Mr. Clinton said last week. 
 But in health insurance, nothing is simple. While many Republicans agree that the Government should limit the variation in premiums, the idea of such "community rating" raises a host of political, philosophical and technical questions, like these:
*How much will rates go up for young, healthy people, whose premiums are now below the average? Are these people prepared to pay higher premiums in return for greater security?
*Is it fair to raise premiums for young people while lowering premiums for their parents, who often have higher incomes and greater assets?
*Is it right to charge the same premiums to smokers and nonsmokers? Should insurers be allowed to give a discount to people who take responsibility for their health, watch their diet and exercise regularly?
*How should the Federal Government and the states divide responsibility for regulating the price of health insurance, a field long dominated by state officials?
 
Spreading the Risk
 The move toward community rating is a reaction to the experience of the last decade, in which health insurance became prohibitively expensive for many people. Some of these people had a history of illness. Some were healthy, but were considered likely to incur high medical costs. Some were healthy, but obtained their insurance through small groups in which other people ran up high medical bills.
Insurers today charge much higher premiums to people who are old or sick. A 64-year-old may pay four to six times as much as a 20-year-old.
Community rating is an attempt to stabilize health insurance premiums by pooling risks and sharing costs. "The principle of risk spreading is essential to equitable insurance," said Salvatore R. Curiale, the Superintendent of Insurance for New York State, which has gone further toward community rating than most states.
In July 1992, Governor Cuomo signed a bill to establish community rating of health insurance policies for individuals and small businesses in New York. Mr. Curiale said that the law, which took effect in April 1993, had been successful.
"The community-rating mandate did cause premiums to increase for younger people," he said. "But about 60 percent of the people affected by the change received rate decreases or increases no greater than 20 percent. Individual and small-group health insurance is more available, and it appears that premium rates are more stable."
Marilyn W. Ogden, an owner of Fritz Helmbold Inc., a meat-processing company in Troy, N.Y., said the change probably helped level off her company's rates. "For a small business like us, community rating is very helpful," she said. Eight of the 18 employees are over 55, and the company would have to pay higher premiums without community rating.
Gail E. Shearer, manager of policy analysis at Consumers Union, described community rating as "the fairest way to share health care costs" short of a single-payer program financed by the Government with broad-based taxes.
Arthur V. Ferrara, chairman of the Life Insurance Council of New York, a trade association for insurers, gave the experiment a mixed review. "I have to agree with the superintendent to a certain degree," he said. "Thus far, community rating appears to have worked reasonably well in the Insurance Department's view.
"But from the public's point of view, this law has caused tremendous strain on the younger insurance-buying population," said Mr. Ferrara, who is also chairman of the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. "If senior members of our society pay less, someone else has to pay more. That's the younger members. Many young people have opted to drop their coverage rather than pay the high costs associated with health insurance."
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, all people would be required to carry health insurance, including the unemployed. Insurers could not reject people because of their medical problems. Employers would pay most of the cost for their workers. The Government would help buy insurance for low-income people, including many of the unemployed.
In a recent monograph, the American Academy of Actuaries, a professional organization of insurance experts, assessed the likely effects of community rating. The academy takes no position for or against community rating, but says policy makers and the public should understand the consequences.
In general, it said, "the young would subsidize the old, males would subsidize females at most ages, the healthy would subsidize the sick and the poor may subsidize the wealthy, since younger people generally earn less income than older people."
President Clinton would not allow variation in premiums because of age. But many members of Congress have concluded that some adjustment for age is needed. Many insurers say they can accept a modified form of community rating and see it as inevitable.
 
On Fairness
Incentives Needed To Insure the Ill

Simplifying one part of the premium formula immediately creates complexity in other areas.
The idea of pure community rating is that all people with the same coverage should pay the same premiums, regardless of age, sex, medical history or occupation. But obviously it costs more to care for sick people. So most proponents of community rating, including Mr. Clinton, acknowledge that health plans enrolling sicker people should receive more money.
Thus, many experts say that if the Government requires community rating of premiums, it must also have some way of redistributing money from plans with healthy customers to plans with a less healthy clientele.
"Otherwise," said Alice F. Rosenblatt, an actuary at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, "there would be a strong financial incentive for health plans to avoid costly high-risk individuals. In general, 4 percent of claimants generate 50 percent of claim costs."
Or, as Mr. Curiale said: "We don't want to penalize a company because it takes older, sicker patients. It's inappropriate to have some companies benefit because they have younger, healthier people as customers."
 
Taking a Regional Average
 The device for redistributing money among insurance companies is called a "risk adjustment mechanism." Payments to insurers and health plans are adjusted to reflect the relative risk of their customers, the likelihood that they will incur medical costs in the future.
Under the pooling arrangement in New York, the demographic characteristics of each insurer's customers are compared with a regional average. An insurer receives money from the pool if, for example, it has a disproportionately large number of people who are old or have AIDS. An insurer must contribute to the pool if its customers are younger and healthier than the average.
Ms. Rosenblatt, the actuary, said, "If you require community rating, you must have a risk adjustment mechanism at the same time." In theory, if there were a perfect method of risk adjustment, insurers would have no incentive to seek out low-cost patients. But there is currently no such perfect method.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, a new Federal agency, the National Health Board, would have to develop a risk adjustment method by April 1995. The bill does not say how this should be done.
 
About Age
Should the Young Subsidize the Old?
 Older people generally use more health care than young people, but whether they should pay higher premiums is an explosive question.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said insurers must be allowed to consider age as a factor in setting premiums. "Young working people already support the retirement benefits of people over 65," she said. "It would be most unfortunate if those people were also asked to subsidize health insurance premiums of their parents, who have better-paying jobs."
Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, said pure community rating could provoke "a generational war." Another Republican, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, said, "A 27-year-old with three kids shouldn't subsidize a 57-year-old in his peak earning years."
But John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, strongly defended Mr. Clinton's proposal to ban the use of age as a factor in setting premiums.
"The notion that older people are better off doesn't hold when you look at individual cases," he said. "Given the layoffs of the last few years, many people in their late 50's and early 60's make less than earlier in their careers."
Moreover, Mr. Rother said: "There is pervasive age discrimination in the workplace. Many employers try to avoid hiring older workers because of the higher health costs. Community rating should encourage employers to hire older people."
While insisting that age must be a factor, many insurers are willing to limit the variation in premiums. Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said the Government might stipulate that the maximum premium for older people would be two or three times the premium for young people. Older people now pay as much as five or six times as much as young people.
Community rating redistributes money in other ways, too. For example, it evens out the costs of health insurance for workers and nonworkers. Nonworkers are believed to have higher medical costs; some are out of work because of health problems.
One result of community rating is that employers would pay higher premiums to subsidize health insurance for nonworkers, said John F. Sheils, a vice president of Lewin-VHI, a consulting concern that specializes in medical economics.
Mr. Sheils said that employers, taken together, would pay $44 billion a year in subsidies for nonworkers. Federal aid for small low-wage businesses would offset $11 billion of this cost under Mr. Clinton's proposal. "The net result is that employers would provide $33 billion a year in subsidies for nonworkers," said Mr. Sheils.
 
In New York
Confident Of Coverage
 New York provides the largest demonstration of how a community rating system might work, though its law is less sweeping than what Mr. Clinton proposed. States do not regulate large companies that serve as their own insurers; the New York law applies only to small groups with 3 to 50 workers. If a company sells insurance to such groups, it must take all applicants and set premiums through community rating.
Data compiled by Mr. Curiale's office show that, after the law took effect, premiums increased for nearly two-thirds of all people with individual or small-group coverage from commercial insurers. Premiums doubled for 5 percent of them.
Despite the increases, Mr. Curiale said that coverage was now more secure. "What you had before was an illusion," he said. "If you were young and healthy, the insurance company would accept you. As soon as something went wrong, the rate for you or your group would go sky high. With open enrollment and community rating, you may pay more, but you have stability. You have coverage that can't be taken away."
 
Company Perspective
 But Cecil D. Bykerk, chief actuary for the Mutual of Omaha Companies, said: "The first year is not working very well. Since the imposition of pure community rating in New York, the average age of our policyholders has gone up 3.5 years, from 41.5 to 45. That's a very significant rise. Younger people are bailing out. If you're going to have universal access to insurance, which we support, then you need some kind of mandate for people to buy."
One lesson from New York is that the shift to community rating probably ought to be gradual.
In New York, the community rating requirement was applied to all small-group contracts on April 1, 1993. "There was some panic and a lot of uncertainty as April 1 approached," Mr. Curiale said. "Insurers sent out letters telling people, 'Your contract is terminated April 1, and we can't tell you what the cost of new coverage will be.'
"If we did it over again," he said, "we'd make it effective as the old contracts expired."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "FOR AND AGAINST: Community Rating of Health Insurance"
 
WHAT IT IS -- The concept requires insurers to charge the same premiums to all people in a geographic area, regardless of factors like age, sex, medical history or occupation.
 
HOW IT WOULD WORK -- Premiums would be set by averaging the expected cost of insuring everyone in the area. Money would be redistributed among insurance companies to reflect the relative risk of their customers, the likelihood that they will incur medical costs in the future. A health plan with a large share of elderly or sick patients would receive extra money from other companies through a pooling arrangement, not by charging higher premiums.
 
ARGUMENTS FOR -- Community rating restores insurance to its original purpose, spreading risks among diverse groups of people. In recent years, insurers have tried to insure only the healthiest people while shunning high-risk customers who most need protection. Insurers should not be allowed to charge higher rates to sick people and older people.
 
ARGUMENTS AGAINST -- Pure community rating is unworkable and inequitable. It will raise premiums for young people while lowering premiums for older people, who often have higher incomes. Insurers also ought to be free to offer discounts to nonsmokers and others with healthy habits.
 
WHO SUPPORTS IT -- Labor unions, consumer advocates and lobbyists for the elderly favor community rating. They say the market should not be sliced up into different demographic groups.
 
WHO OPPOSES IT -- Big businesses, which generally run their own health plans, do not want to be included in the community-rated pool. If their health insurance is community rated, businesses say, they will not get the benefit of savings they achieve through efficient management of their health plans and through programs promoting healthy behavior by employees.
 
LEGISLATIVE OUTLOOK -- Congress appears likely to limit the variation in premiums as part of any comprehensive legislation. There is wide support for a modified form of community rating, with some modest variation in premiums on account of age.
 
Graph: "CASEBOOK: How Policyholders Fared"
 As part of a 1992 law regulating health insurance, New York requires community rating of premiums, so that people with the same coverage pay the same amounts without regard to age, sex, health status or occupation. Graph shows the percentage of small group and individual insurance policyholders in New York State whose rates decreased and increased according to certain percentages.

HEADLINE: Proposal for Welfare Cutoff Is Dividing Clinton Officials

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
As he completes his welfare plan, President Clinton must resolve a fight that has divided aides for months and has led one faction to accuse another of trying to rip holes in the social safety net.
The fight is over whether families who follow all the rules can eventually be dropped from both welfare and a work program that Mr. Clinton is proposing. While the Administration wants to enroll recipients in the work program after they have received aid for two years, the question is what happens to those who spend several years in it and still do not find jobs on their own. 
 Can they re-enroll indefinitely, as long as they are willing to work? Or can states cut off some families, leaving them with neither welfare nor their subsidized minimum-wage jobs?
The issue is being contested with unusual fervor because it cuts to the program's philosophical core. While states already reduce payments to women who flout certain rules, this may be the first Federal law that cuts off entire families whether they follow the rules or not.
There are no reliable estimates of how many of the 15 million indigent women and children who rely on Federal assistance may be left without jobs or aid. While Mr. Clinton's welfare advisers sent him a confidential memorandum in March referring to "what we hope will be a small number," outside economists have said hundreds of thousands of families may eventually be affected.
 
Weighing Good Intensions
 The possible move is strenuously opposed by advocates for the poor, who say it may punish well-intentioned families and start the nation down the slippery slope of abolishing welfare. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also told the Administration he considers the move unacceptable.
But at the same time, it is being advocated in Congress not only by Republicans but also by some moderate and conservative House Democrats. They argue that the nation cannot afford an unlimited jobs program and that without the threat of being cut off, some participants will never find jobs on their own.
"This is like crossing the Rubicon," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group that opposes cutting off families. "There's no more fundamental issue."
Administration officials were sufficiently sensitive about the debate that none would publicly comment. The Department of Health and Human Services has drafted a memorandum this week asking Mr. Clinton him to resolve the issue. Officials are also asking him to decide another issue: whether states should be allowed to deny additional payments to mothers who had additional children while on welfare.
Mr. Clinton plans to send Congress a bill next month to expand training available to welfare mothers during the first two years they receive aid. But Mr. Clinton plans to require those who are still unemployed at that point to join his proposed work program, which will subsidize their wages in public or private jobs.
 
Clinton Silent So Far
 But he has said nothing about whether the work program itself should be limited, and the internal debate shows the difficulty of translating work slogans into work programs.
The faction that wants to limit the program is being led by Bruce Reed, a White House aide. This group argues that Government aid was never meant to be inexhaustible and that a cutoff is needed to change a system universally regarded as a failure.
Unless there is the prospect that all aid will truly end, they say, recipients will lack incentives to find jobs on their own. Without limits, they fear the jobs program may even entice people to leave unattractive jobs and go on welfare.
In closed meetings, Mr. Reed, a former campaign aide, has also raised political concerns. He has said that Mr. Clinton's opponents will accuse him of failing to keep his pledge to "end welfare as we know it" unless the work program, too, has an end.
The faction that objects to cutting off families from the work program is led by David T. Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane, both assistant secretaries of Health and Human Services. They have argued that there are plenty of incentives for people to find jobs.
Families that find private jobs, they note, will be eligible for tax credits that can raise their incomes by as much as $3,400 a year. People in the work program will be barred from receiving the credits.
In addition to that economic incentive, recipients will also be forced to search for work on their own at least once a year. And they can be dropped from the work program if they receive an offer but fail to accept it.
Allowing states to drop people from both work and welfare, even if they received no job offers, Mr. Ellwood has said, would throw people deeper into poverty and would violate the idea that people who played by the rules should not be cut adrift.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said the majority of the nation's five million welfare families could find some sort of job.
 
A Big Minority
 "But there's a sizable minority whose problems are so severe and whose lives are in such disorder," he said. "I'm very skeptical they could hold jobs outside a sheltered workshop."
Resorting to ball park estimates, Mr. Burtless said the number of such cases could eventually range anywhere from 300,000 to 800,000.
A House Republican bill with 163 co-sponsors would give states the option of dropping families from the work program and welfare after three years in the work program. A bill by Representative Dave McCurdy, Democrat of Oklahoma, would go even further, requiring states to do so. The bill, which has 29 Democratic co-sponsors, would allow states to exempt 10 percent of the participants from the limit.
"There has to be some end to this," Mr. McCurdy said in an interview last week. "If there's not a deadline out there, there's a tendency to procrastinate."
The Administration seems committed to giving recipients at least two years in a work program.
The question is whether states will then be allowed to drop families who are still willing to work. The decision has already been made about families who are unwilling to work: if they do not show up, they do not get paid.
Among those predicting this week that the Administration would not cut off willing workers was Governor Cuomo.
Saying it could only happen in "a moment of madness," Mr. Cuomo said it would dump a new poverty problem on state governments. And he added: "It would be bad for our soul as a people."

HEADLINE: Children in Rural South Are Least Likely to Be Left Home Alone

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The children most likely to spend time without adult supervision live in Midwestern suburbs, while rural Southerners are the least likely to leave their children at home alone, the Census Bureau has found.
In a report on the child-care arrangements of working mothers, the bureau found that 1.6 million youngsters spent time unsupervised after school. That finding accounts for about 7.6 percent of children of grade school age whose mothers work. 
 The report, "Who's Minding the Kids," said Midwestern children were the most likely to be left without adult supervision, with 12.1 percent falling in that category. In the West, 7.5 percent were left unsupervised, while the figures were 5.7 percent in the Northeast and 4.8 percent in the South.
The children most likely to be left unsupervised lived in suburbs, where the rate was 9.3 percent, as opposed to 6.8 percent in cities and 5.3 percent in rural areas.
Martin O'Connell, a population expert at the bureau, said suburban parents might be more comfortable leaving their children alone because they felt able to rely on nearby neighbors to provide help in emergencies.
The percentage of children left alone increased with age. Aside from the age of the child, the working time of the mother was the prime factor in determining whether a youngster spent time alone.
The work schedule is usually set by the employer and the school schedule by the school board, Mr. O'Connell said, adding that "often the twain do not meet."
The Census Bureau also found these other characteristics of child care:
*Of the 21.1 million children from the ages of 5 to 14 whose mothers work, about 76 percent spent most of their time in school when their mothers were working.
*Fathers cared for the children of 8.4 percent of married working mothers and less than 1 percent of working mothers who were not married.
*Grandparents and other relatives cared for 10.2 percent of the children of single mothers, while the rate was 3.8 percent for married working mothers.
*Among children too young for school, 23 percent were in organized child-care centers when the mother worked, 20 percent were cared for by the father, and 18 percent were with other family members. Others were cared for by nonrelatives or taken to work with their mothers.
*Paid child-care cost an average of $2.15 an hour in organized centers, $1.93 an hour for care in the homes of nonrelatives and $2.73 an hour for a nonrelative to come to the child's home.
Mr. O'Connell said he did not know whether a recent increase in the number of fathers caring for children represented a real trend, because the study was conducted in late 1991, when the economy was slow and many fathers may have been home because they were out of work. He said he wanted to reserve a conclusion until new studies could look at what would occur when more fathers were working again.
Whites were the most likely to leave children unattended, with 8.3 percent doing so, while 3.6 percent of blacks and 4.8 percent of Hispanics left children alone.
High-income individuals and those with some college education were more likely than others to leave children unattended.
Some 8.8 percent of the children of parents with one to three years of college were left at home alone, while the rates were 8.1 percent for children whose parents had finished college, 6.8 percent for children whose parents had finished high school and 6.6 percent for children whose parents had less than a high school education.
Nine percent of children in families with incomes of $4,500 a month or more were left unattended. The figures were 7.4 percent at incomes of $3,000 to $4,499, 7.2 percent at incomes under $1,500 a month and 6.6 percent for incomes of $1,500 to $2,999 a month.

HEADLINE: Coliseum: Its Worth Depends on Whom You Ask

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
One hundred million dollars is what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority says it must have for a portion of the New York Coliseum site it is negotiating to sell to developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman. For his part, Mr. Zuckerman says he will not budge from his $80 million offer. And an appraiser hired by the city put a preliminary price of $57.5 million on the property.
What gives? 
 The huge disparity in values underscores the subjective nature of appraising real estate, a process appraisers themselves acknowledge is an inexact science at best.
"There is a saying in real estate," said Paul N. Fox, director of valuation services for Jones Lang Wootton, an international real estate brokerage and consulting company. "Your property is worth what someone will pay for it."
 
Continuing Tug-of-War
 The disagreement over the value of the transaction is just one of the complications that has thrown the developer, the M.T.A. and the Giuliani administration into a three-way tug of war over the fate of the Coliseum.
On Friday John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, told a City Council subcommittee that an appraiser hired by the city put a tentative price of $57.5 million on the Coliseum site, 40 percent less than the $80 million Mr. Zuckerman has agreed to pay.
But later in the hearings, Susan Fine, director of real estate for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the property, testified that the real-estate professionals the M.T.A. had consulted said the $100 million the agency was asking for the site was a reasonable price.
Appraisers take certain steps in determining a property's value, Mr. Fox said, including uses for a property, size and cost of potential development and the projected return on the investment from rents or resale.
Appraisers also look to the sale prices of recent transactions of the same kind. But the dearth of commercial development projects in Manhattan in recent years has given professionals very few comparisons. The uncertainty of the city's real-estate market, which has shown encouraging signs of recovery recently, also has made appraisals in New York City less dependable than usual, experts say.
Moreover, any attempt to put a value on the current development potential of the Coliseum site is muddied by the complex nine-year history of the transaction, the political overtones of the recent effort by Mr. Zuckerman to renegotiate his deal and the looming court battle over the existing contract. Mr. Zuckerman has filed a suit against the city and the M.T.A. asserting that certain terms of the contract are not enforceable. The trial is to start June 1 in State Supreme Court.
The site in question, 3.4 acres at 59th Street and Columbus Circle on the southwest corner of Central Park, holds an exhibition hall and an office building. In 1985 the M.T.A., in partnership with the city, put property up for sale so the office building and hall would be replaced with a large mixed-use development. Mr. Zuckerman, in partnership with others, won the right to redevelop the complete Coliseum for $455 million. He planned to build 2.7 million square feet.
But court challenges against the city and the M.T.A. kept the project in limbo. During that time, commercial property values fell. Because the court suits did not involve Mr. Zuckerman, the city and the M.T.A. were willing to renegotiate the transaction.
In 1989 Mr. Zuckerman signed a contract to build a 2.1 million square-foot complex on the entire site. It calls for Mr. Zuckerman to pay $338 million for the property. Mr. Zuckerman could lose a $33.8 million down payment if he does not close.
Citing the real estate market's decline, Mr. Zuckerman has been negotiating a reduced price. A tentative deal calls for the M.T.A. to get $100 million for about half the site. That transaction would include about $20 million in city subsidies.
Under this plan, the M.T.A. would keep the office building and perhaps find an interim tenant.
Some public officials, including Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes the Coliseum area, are calling for a settlement of the existing contract that would clear the way for an interim use of the site, and a fresh start on development in the future.
The Giuliani administration has pressed for some sort of new project in the short term, saying the city needs the construction jobs and the taxes a Coliseum project would generate. It would also be a sign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said, that the city's economy is rebounding.
Some critics, including Ms. Eldridge, have suggested that the Giuliani administration's support of Mr. Zuckerman is influenced by the fact that Mr. Zuckerman owns The Daily News, which endorsed Mr. Giuliani's mayoral campaign.
To justify its position on the matter, the city earlier this month hired James Felt Appraisal and Consulting Service to appraise the parcel now being negotiated. Starting at a base value of $100 million for a vacant, unencumbered parcel, the appraiser deducted from that value $20 million for the cost of demolishing the Coliseum and for asbestos abatement, $6 million for garage repairs, $2.5 million for subway improvements, $2.5 million for the cost of separating the office building from the exhibition hall, $11.4 million for the M.T.A.'s potential share of cash flow and $100,000 for legal fees.
 
Another 60 Days?
 Mr. Dyson is pressing for a second step in the valuation process. If a deal is struck, he has said, the city will give any other potential developer 60 days to top Mr. Zuckerman's offer.
The M.T.A. declined to join the city in having an appraisal made, saying that the process was counterproductive because a tentative price has been established and because the real estate market is in a state of flux.
But Mr. Dyson told the Economic Development Subcommittee of the City Council that the appraisal assured the public that Mr. Zuckerman was not paying a low price.
The appraisal company is to make its final report before the end of May. Its preliminary report puts fair market value of $57.50 per square foot for approximately 1 million square feet of development and 850 parking spaces in an underground lot.
Mr. Zuckerman has said his goal is to build an office building of about 900,000 square feet with a small retail component.
In the opinion of some real estate professionals the Columbus Circle location would not necessarily be a plus for potential office tenants.
"In judging the value of Columbus Circle for office use, I might take off points for that location," said Stephen B. Siegel, president of Edward S. Gordon, a brokerage company. "It is not in an area that caught on as an office district. No matter what the views are from top floors, some office tenants might not want to be there."
Yet Donald Trump, in partnership with General Electric Pension Trust, has plans to turn the office building across the street -- formerly occupied by Gulf & Western and now by Paramount Communications -- into an apartment building. Mr. Trump has said he expects to get $1,000 a square foot for apartments there.

HEADLINE: A Big Drop in Flower Sales May Prompt an Industry Recount

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 21

 BODY:
At a time when homeowners everywhere are planting flowers, a statistical mystery about a phantom $106 million loss in sales is growing in the field of floriculture, a thriving industry in New York that produces flowering plants in greenhouses.
If Federal statistics are correct, the wholesale value of floriculture crops in the state dropped from $250 million in 1992 to $144 million in 1993. Agricultural economists said the figures were obviously wrong. 
 "It makes no sense," said Marvin Miller, an economist for the George W. Ball Company in Chicago, a major supplier of seeds for greenhouse operations around the country. "The figures do not fit with anything we are seeing in the field, and our competitors are saying the same thing."
In Suffolk County, which accounts for more than half of all the plant production in the state, Ralph Freeman, the floriculture expert of Cornell University's Cooperative Extension Service, said, "It's impossible."
"It's the only phase of agriculture in New York that is expanding and growing," Mr. Freeman said. "It can't drop $100 million. There has been a significant expansion that takes place every year."
The mystery arose early this month when the National Agricultural Statistics Service in Washington issued its 88-page "Floriculture Crops 1993 Summary."
California was the leading state, with $658 million in sales, Florida second with $543 million, Texas third with $181 million, Ohio fourth with $149 million and Michigan fifth with $146 million. Some of these states were up slightly and some down slightly from the year before.
But the New York figures showed a substantial decrease that dropped the state from third place in 1992 to sixth in 1993. The drop, reflecting the loss of $106 million in sales, came as everybody in the field was convinced floriculture was expanding.
New York's fall in the rankings has no effect other than on pride. The figures have no economic impact, nor are they used to allocate money.
The disputed figures for New York were supplied by the Agricultural Statistics Service in Albany, based on a census of growers. Robert Schooley, the chief statistician in Albany, said he raised questions about the apparent discrepancy as soon as reports came in from enumerators.
Jim Brewster of the Agriculture Statistics Service in Washington compiled the national report. He said that the missing $106 million posed a problem but no formal investigation was under way, although it was being "gently looked into."
Mr. Brewster and the economists agreed that the roots of the apparent discrepancy date to 1990, when floriculture sales figures for the state jumped to $208 million from $125 million the year before. The figure rose to $230 million in 1991 and then to $250 million in 1992.
"The numbers have been heavily inflated in recent years," said Thomas C. Weiler, a professor of floriculture at Cornell University in Ithaca.
Mr. Miller said, "Nobody in the industry has believed those figures for the last three years." He offered a possible explanation for the phantom $106 million: it never existed. "We think a statistical aberration has now been corrected," he said. "We feel that there has been a correction, but we can't get anybody to admit it."

HEADLINE: Political Notes;
An Interested Guardian Of Utility-Tax Revenue

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

 BODY:
To many New Jersey mayors, one of the best political equivalents of the fox guarding the henhouse is the way Trenton watches over tax revenue meant for the cities.
Public utility companies pay the state millions of dollars each year in lieu of local taxes on certain properties. The state forecasts the revenue, collects the tax and then distributes the nest egg to the municipalities to help them balance their budgets and relieve property taxes. 
 But in recent years, a succession of governors have used the surplus from the utility tax to feather their own budgets.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had expected to raid the same henhouse to help balance her proposed $15.4 billion budget. But last week she found an unlikely watchdog guarding the door: her fellow Republican and chief booster, Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian.
Adopting a stance that puts him at odds with Mrs. Whitman but perhaps in good favor with voters as he seeks a United States Senate seat, Mr. Haytaian said he would support legislation to return any surplus utility-tax revenue to local governments.
"This money belongs to the municipalities, and that's where it should go," Mr. Haytaian said. "The state has no legitimate claim to it, and its loss will not doom this budget. We can deal with it."
And how much money might that be? Mr. Haytaian took another swipe at the Whitman administration by writing to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, asking for "advice on the proper amount" of excess revenue.
"Estimates given by State Treasurer Brian Clymer range from zero dollars to $63 million," Mr. Haytaian said in his letter.
 
Promoting the Truth, To a Certain Extent
 The New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission has suggested that the Legislature enact a truth-in-political-advertising law. The real task may be where to draw the factual line.
Frederick M. Herrmann, the executive director of the commission, said candidates had sometimes gone overboard in describing the extent of their education, their work history and their literary accomplishments.
The commission has proposed simply that the Legislature come up with a law that would prohibit false political advertising. Mr. Herrmann said few states had such legislation, but the commission patterned its proposal after a law in Washington State.
"It's not unheard of from time to time for candidates to falsify their records or their opponents'," Mr. Herrmann said. "The recommendation is really to get at outright falsifications. One of the real problems is with resume inflation."
 
More Like a Prison, Less Like a Home
 John Rowland, a Republican candidate for Governor in Connecticut, wants to send more criminals to prison, and he wants to do so more quicker and less comfortably than he thinks is now the case.
For example, Mr. Rowland's law-and-order platform calls for two-strikes-and-you're-out sentencing, one fewer chance for the repeat felon than most politicians are advocating.
To drive home another of his views on how criminals are handled, Mr. Rowland paid an unannounced visit last week to the state's newest prison, the $72 million York Correctional Institution under construction in Niantic. He liked little of what he saw, including an electronic scoreboard in the gymnasium marked Home and Visitors.
Mr. Rowland said that in the last 10 years the state could have doubled the number of prison beds to 18,000 if officials had been less intent on "coddling" criminals by building "palaces" like York where "extremely expensive" architectural features and "lavish" details put any high school or senior center in the state to shame.
The Correction Commissioner, Larry R. Meachum, said later that Mr. Rowland had selected a women's prison designed for rehabilitating its inmates. For women from poor, abusive backgrounds, he said, York might indeed be the nicest place they have spent time. But that also makes it a place where they might be able to change their behavior, he said.
Mr. Rowland was unappeased. "I do not believe criminals should be coddled and pampered," he said. "A prison should not be a place people enjoy going to. It should be a place they want to avoid."
 
Another Generation With Those Cuomo Genes
 Andrew Cuomo demonstrated some of his father's political reflexes the other day when he was asked about New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to deny shelter to homeless families who refuse to join treatment or training programs.
The younger Mr. Cuomo, now an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was in New York on Friday, barnstorming for the Clinton Administration's own plan to combat homelessness.
With Mr. Cuomo by his side and advocates for the homeless eager for Federal money, Mr. Giuliani extolled the virtues of the Federal plan, saying it "reflects the philosophy and many of the same principles found in the city's new plan." Both plans stress reliance on nonprofit groups to provide shelter and on an array of social programs to help the homeless eventually find permanent housing.
But Mr. Cuomo's father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, refused to endorse Mr. Giuliani's city plan because of its tough medicine for uncooperative homeless families. The lack of support from the Governor was surprising, since in many respects the Mayor's plan reflected the major recommendations the younger Mr. Cuomo had made last year when he headed a commission on homelessness convened by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
When Andrew Cuomo was asked if he supported Mr. Giuliani's tough-love policies, he demonstrated his father's gift for sidestepping an uncomfortable question.
"I haven't had a chance to review in detail the Mayor's plan, but what I would say is, on the Federal Government's side, we are not in the business of doing the job of local government for local government," Mr. Cuomo said. "So if the local government has an intelligent reasoned approach, this Federal government will not be second-guessing a local government."

HEADLINE: Meyer Parodneck, 89, Advocate For the Poor of New York, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
Meyer Parodneck, who promoted self-help programs for New York's poor ranging from a milk cooperative to community housing, died on Friday at his winter home in West Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Parodneck, who lived in Brooklyn, was 89.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Parodneck was the founder and president of the Parodneck Foundation for Self-Help Housing and Community Development, and president of the board of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board.
Born in Poland, Mr. Parodneck came to Manhattan at the age of 10 and grew up in poverty on the Lower East Side. He graduated from New York Law School in 1924 and practiced as a trial lawyer and corporate counsel.
During the Depression he was drawn to social issues. Appalled by the eviction of homeowners unable to meet their mortgage payments, Mr. Parodneck held rallies at courthouses to prevent evictions, and lobbied Congress for mortgage payment relief legislation.
 
Helped Form Cooperative
 Heeding warnings from social workers and consumer groups that milk was not getting to poor children in New York City and hearing pleas from upstate farmers that they were not earning enough to survive, he helped form the Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative in 1938.
It was the first consumer-farmer cooperative of its kind in the nation. In the beginning, the cooperative sold 10,000 quarts of milk a day at prices as low as 7 cents a bottle, slightly below the going price. It eventually grew into a $6 million-a-year operation with milk processing plants in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Over the years the cooperative and Mr. Parodneck waged a series of battles with commercial dairies, trucking groups and labor unions to hold down the price of milk.
 
Housing Projects
 By the 1970's, however, the leaders of the cooperative found that while their organization was financially successful, it had departed from its original purpose, since milk was easily available. To that end, with the guidance of Mr. Parodneck the cooperative sold its milk business and put the proceeds into housing projects of the new Consumer-Farmer Foundation.
Using a network of settlement houses and community groups, which included its former milk customers, the foundation offered low-interest and no-interest loans to tenants on the Lower East Side and Clinton in Manhattan, and the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
The loans helped tenants rehabilitate their own buildings and abandoned structures, in what came to be known as urban homesteading.
Last year the Consumer-Farmer Foundation changed its name to the Parodneck Foundation for Self-Help Housing and Community Development.
Mr. Parodneck is survived by his wife, Pauline, of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Carol Stern of Gaithersburg, Md.

For Yanks, Everyone's Getting In the Act

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
Be ready. The message extends to the farthest end of the Yankee dugout and the most distant seat in the bullpen. The execution of the message from Manager Buck Showalter throughout his clubhouse can separate good teams from better and better from best.
The length of the Yankee bench produced a 5-4 victory over Baltimore yesterday, the 28th in 40 games, the most successful start to a Yankee season since Casey Stengel was pushing buttons 36 springs ago. 
 Modern-day button pushing is made more complex by an era of diluted talent and incentive clauses. Yesterday, as Paul O'Neill's major league-leading .465 average stayed on the bench for a day, as Wade Boggs was held out again because of a rib problem and the nagging injuries of starting pitcher Melido Perez created complications, depth became a decisive factor.
Scott Kamieniecki, for now a part-time starting pitcher, held the Orioles to one run in three and one-third innings of relief after Perez was limited to five innings by a strained lower back and painful big toe on his right foot.
"The good thing is Buck's using everyone," Kamieniecki said, "and when you use everyone you stay strong."
Gerald Williams, a backup outfielder in his seventh start of the season, produced a two-run, game-tying single in the first inning. "I can't dwell on wanting to be an everyday player," Williams said. "And I'm not."
 
Melvin Homer Keys 5-Run First
 And Bob Melvin, who at this time last month was an unemployed catcher, hit the three-run homer that completed a five-run first inning that wound up being enough to win. Melvin became the fifth designated hitter Showalter has used this season. He understood the value of a seat on the Yankee bench before he was signed to a minor-league contract April 26 and promoted May 14.
"I follow box scores," Melvin said. "I like to watch managers and see how they manage games. Buck keeps everybody involved. He's pretty flexible with his lineup. He gives everybody a chance."
Kamieniecki's chance, so far, has consisted of six relief appearances in his nine outings. He did not improve upon his 3-0 record yesterday, and he did not earn his first save. Kamieniecki just rescued the Yankees on a bright afternoon after Perez (3-2) struggled just long enough to earn a victory.
The Yankees won for the ninth consecutive time at home, their longest winning streak at Yankee Stadium since 1987, because Kamieniecki and Steve Howe, in his first appearance since returning from the disabled list Friday, combined to hold the Orioles to one run and two hits in the last four innings.
 
Injured Perez Needs Relief
 Showalter tried to discourage Perez from starting because of the injuries, and Kamieniecki was sent to the bullpen before the game in case of a sudden problem. Perez will not start again until next Saturday at Kansas City.
"The team is playing so well," Perez said. "I'm excited to play right now. I said, 'I don't want to wait so long to play.' "
In the first of Perez's five innings, his shortest outing of the season, he allowed a run-scoring single by Rafael Palmeiro, who extended his hitting streak to a club-record 23 games, the longest in the major leagues this season. Cal Ripken's double, inside third base and down the left-field line, scored a second run.
The lead did not last long because of the Baltimore starter Arthur Rhodes's problems. Making his first start since he was on the disabled list with tendinitis in his left knee, Rhodes (1-5) did not retire a hitter in the second inning. After the game, he was sent to the Rochester farm club.
"He didn't miss any bats when he was in the strike zone," said Oriole Manager Johnny Oates.
Rhodes allowed five earned runs in the first on Gerald Williams's two-run single to the left of third baseman Leo Gomez, and Melvin's three-run homer over the left-center field fence.
Perez allowed a fifth-inning double by Palmeiro that scored Mark McLemore, who had tripled. Kamieniecki gave up a run-scoring double to Harold Baines in the seventh. In the ninth, pinch-hitter Chris Hoiles sent a fly ball to the right-center warning track.
That was as close as the Yankees came to a scare, before Howe produced two groundouts to earn his third save. Another button pushed. Another Yankee victory. Another day in first place.
 
 
 
INSIDE PITCH
 Baltimore recalled CHRIS SABO, who had been sent to an extended spring-training program to rehabilitate a strained back, to take the roster spot created by the demotion of pitcher ARTHUR RHODES to Rochester. . . . WADE BOGGS, who suffered a rib injury May 7, took 11 practice swings yesterday.

HEADLINE: Defending Federal Aid for Small Companies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Washington Growing as a Financial Angel to Industry" (May 1) expresses concern about possible pork barrel projects and says that accusations of special-interest awards have already surfaced in the case of a $50 million award by the Advanced Research Projects Agency to OIS Optical Imaging Systems Inc., makers of active-matrix flat panel displays. 
 As the inventor and pioneer of this technology -- the focus of the new $1 billion initiative and one in which Japan Inc. has so far invested at least $4 billion -- let me say emphatically that these accusations have no basis and are simply expressions of sour grapes by large companies like I.B.M. and AT&T. Such giants have so far refused to make any investment themselves beyond some R & D work but were holding out their hands for the $50 million.
The language written into the Federal appropriations bill, reportedly to suit OIS, involved an obvious requirement for qualification for the award -- namely that the company should already be in the business of making active-matrix displays and should have made substantial investments of its own before the award. Neither I.B.M. nor AT&T (nor any of the other complainers ) has so far made such a commitment in the United States (I.B.M. has a joint venture with Toshiba in Japan; AT&T is still sitting on the fence). OIS is the only American company presently manufacturing, albeit in small quantities, these key components. It seems eminently fair that OIS should receive this comparatively small award, which is significant to it but would make little difference to a company like I.B.M.T.

HEADLINE: Time to Widen the Tony's Scope

 BODY:
Broadway theater is about to honor itself with Tony awards for this year's "best." Millions watching on television three weeks from tonight, or reading the winners' publicity blurbs thereafter, will be given the impression that these are the best there are. That may be -- or may not.
Tony awards go only to shows in 35 big houses in or near the midtown theater district of New York City. That is a mistake. The Tony was established almost 50 years ago, when "Broadway" meant American theater. Times have changed. It is time the Tony changed, too -- to include Off Broadway stages which, along with regional theater, have become consistently lively and creative. 
 Indeed, this year's Pulitzer Prize for drama went to Off Broadway's "Three Tall Women." So did the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. But it will not get a Tony. "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Oleanna" were not eligible either.
This year's Tony nominations for musicals expose another flaw. The rules say four shows will be put to the 700 eligible voters. The nominating committee felt only two had Tony quality, but the committee that sponsors and administers the awards insisted on four. So there are four now, including two previously rejected.
The case for confining Tony awards to 35 designated theaters is basically economic. Broadway shows cost more to produce; their Tony ballyhoo yields higher profits. Off Broadway operates in smaller theaters, at lower ticket prices, with wage concessions from the theatrical unions and actors.
The economic discrepancy is obvious, but not insurmountable. The loser, meanwhile, is the credibility of the awards. While there are usually excellent productions on Broadway, that is not always the case, and there are often better productions that get less acclaim and television exposure off Broadway.
New York City thrives on its magnetism as America's theatrical center, on Broadway and off. The Tony's focus is too narrow.

HEADLINE: Don't Fudge on China

 BODY:
By the end of next week, President Clinton must decide whether China has met the modest human rights conditions he set last year for renewal of its favorable access to American markets. He should face up to the reality that these conditions have not been met and propose targeted economic sanctions to Congress. These should be designed to send a strong political message while limiting the economic damage to both sides. Some damage is inevitable, but it is a cost worth paying for principle and consistency.
Chinese leaders plead that this has been a difficult year -- uncertainty over who will succeed Deng Xiaoping, problems with economic reform, inflation, new pressures for democracy, peasant and labor unrest. They ask the U.S. to suspend its human rights concerns and accept repression for the sake of stability and growth. 
 To indulge this request would betray American principles and credibility and encourage Chinese leaders to ignore the political and social problems that now threaten economic reform.
China's future course will be determined in Beijing, not Washington. But as China's top trading partner and most important diplomatic interlocutor, the U.S. has unmatched potential to influence Chinese decisions. Annual fights over trade privileges are a messy way to exercise this influence. But they were the only levers available to Congress when the Bush Administration responded inadequately to the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989.
The Clinton Administration tried to offer China a reasonable way out in a May 1993 executive order. But China, lulled perhaps by past American toothlessness and publicly aired divisions between U.S. economic and diplomatic officials, chose confrontation instead.
The executive order set seven conditions China had to fulfill to have its trade privileges renewed this summer. Two were absolute: stop exporting goods made by prison labor and allow free emigration for otherwise eligible dissidents. It also needed to show progress in five other areas: accounting for political prisoners, allowing Red Cross visits to prisons, easing repression in Tibet, adhering to the International Declaration of Human Rights and ending jamming of the Voice of America.
China has released prominent dissidents, allowed others to emigrate and accepted the principle of Red Cross visits. But it has only made promises concerning prison labor and the Voice of America. And it has intensified repression in Beijing, Shanghai and Tibet and failed to demonstrate significant progress in several of the specified areas. That mixed record might have narrowly justified renewal had China not gone out of its way to show contempt for American human rights concerns. Beijing has, in effect, called the President's bluff.
Mr. Clinton now needs to retaliate by proposing selective sanctions that send the strongest political message at the lowest economic cost. Rather than revoking trade privileges across the board, he should propose higher duties on specific categories of goods -- for example, those produced by companies run by China's army. Sorting out the origin of Chinese imports presents technical problems. But U.S. trade negotiators have managed to come up with selective lists before.
Whatever Mr. Clinton decides to do on China, the consequences will be huge. If he backs off in the face of Beijing's bullying, China's democrats, intellectuals and minorities will pay a high price and American credibility on issues from human rights to nuclear proliferation will be nil. If his choice of sanctions touches off a trade war, China will be unable to sustain its present rapid growth rate, while profits and jobs in a number of American export industries, notably aerospace, will be lost.
But the real significance of Mr. Clinton's choice transcends even these weighty specifics. Balanced and respectful relations between the U.S. and China are the key to future peace, prosperity and democracy throughout the dynamic East Asia region. For the last five years, at least, those relations have been anything but balanced and respectful.
The way to repair the relationship is not by fudging real differences over basic issues like prison labor, torture and religious persecution. It is by consistently following through on the reasonable policies Mr. Clinton announced a year ago.

Disney's Bull Run

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Mickey Mouse didn't make his fame and fortune by mocking all that Americans hold dear. But his adoptive parent, the Walt Disney Company, is increasingly finding itself cast as the bad guy as it tries to build a historical theme park, Disney's America, near hallowed Civil War ground in Virginia.
A controversy that began last fall as a standard debate about the perils of development -- Disney's America would radically transform a pastoral county 35 miles west of Washington -- is now escalating into a cultural civil war. It's getting bloody, and far more than a single business enterprise is at stake. The battle over Disney's America is part of a much larger struggle between theme-park America and authentic America: Will this country preserve its real history, which requires education and reflection to be understood, or simply turn it over to the Imagineers of Disney, to be repackaged as socko virtual reality? 
 Last week more than 30 intellectual big guns calling themselves Project Historic America attacked Disney's America. Noting that the park was adjacent to 13 historic towns, 16 Civil War battle sites and 17 historic districts, David McCullough, author of "Truman," accused Disney of creating "synthetic history by destroying real history." His fellow critics include Arthur Schlesinger Jr., William Styron and, fittingly, Shelby Foote, the historian who became a star on the PBS documentary "The Civil War." They were belatedly joined by Ken Burns, the producer of "The Civil War," who lent qualified support to the protest even though he is developing a movie with the Disney studio.
The unbuilt Disney's America has outstripped even Euro Disney as a public-relations headache. Last fall Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, had to disavow an executive's announcement that a park attraction would "make you feel what it was like to be a slave." Since then, Disney's America has been challenged by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and the Wilderness Society. Once Disney revealed that Mr. Eisner's compensation for 1993 was $203 million, Virginia taxpayers took a harsher look at why their Governor, George Allen, pushed them so hard to subsidize $163 million in road construction on Disney's behalf.
Still, the issues of money, urban sprawl and environmental disruption that attend the park are between the Virginia voters and their consciences. The esthetic issues dramatized by Disney's America concern everyone. As The Economist recently reported, theme parks are growing so rapidly that their revenues have passed those of movie box offices in the United States. New virtual-reality technology -- as championed by Iwerks, a company formed by Disney alumni -- will spread "downsized" theme parks in suburban malls. At what point do these simulations of experience cease being mere escapist fun, like old-fashioned amusement parks, and replace authentic experience of our own environment and heritage?
This question has always been inherent in the Disney parks. Frontierland and Main Street in Disneyland, or "France" and "Italy" in Epcot Center, are ideologically loaded fantasies of the real things. But Disney's America raises the ante, not only by simulating history on a larger scale but by doing so in such close proximity to our bona fide historic trusts.
Disney's America will not merely affect its neighboring battlefields but the nation's capital and beyond. Will the Smithsonian, or the Lincoln Memorial, or Mount Vernon soon have to add new electronic gimmickry to compete for kids' attention with Disney's oxymoronic promise of "an authentic re-enactment" of a Civil War battle? Will Colonial Williamsburg, itself a doctored imitation of history and a precursor of Disneyland, add Audio-Animatronic colonials to its cast of actors?
When Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic, sounded the alarm about the new "unreal America" in a remarkably prescient 1992 essay in The New York Review of Books, Disney's plan for a historical theme park had yet to be revealed. But even then Mrs. Huxtable saw an America in which "themed entertainment" was driving out not just "the actual deposits of history and humanity" but "our sense of reality or interest in it." With the advent of Disney's America, the big bad wolf is standing right outside the door, poised to devour our past.

HEADLINE: Shouldn't the Fed Act in the Public Interest?;
Inflation Signs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lester Thurow's "Fed Goes Ghostbusting" (Op-Ed, May 6) states that "Sophisticated investors including George Soros, Citicorp and Bankers Trust took huge losses because of the Fed's action" to support his criticism of Fed tightening. 
 Our well-publicized losses this year have nothing to do with the Fed's action. If anything, our investment strategy was geared toward the Fed's acting earlier and more dramatically. Mr. Thurow cites one lagging indicator after another to support his case that there is no inflation. Unfortunately, the majority of the leading indicators of inflation turned up many months ago. Since the effects of monetary policy have a long lead time, those are more relevant.
Moreover, Mr. Thurow ignores the fact that a 3 percent funds rate was an accommodative measure put in place to fight the "50-mile-an-hour headwinds" that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has cited.
With the banking system's balance sheet vastly improved and the economy expanding well above its long-run potential, the notion that monetary policy should be accommodative is absurd. The real question is whether it should be neutral or restrictive.

HEADLINE: Shouldn't the Fed Act in the Public Interest?;
No Time for Stalling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a mutual fund investor, I was pleased with "The Fed Goes Ghostbusting" by Lester Thurow (Op-Ed, May 6). He points out the lack of any inflation signs and recommends that the Federal Reserve Board should stop raising interest rates. But his arguments seem to have little effect. 
 A May 10 Business Day headline reads "Stocks Fall Over Fears of Inflation." The Dow Jones did indeed fall 40.46 points, but "Stocks Fall Over Fear of Another Fed Rate Hike" would be more accurate.
The main reason I closed a number of 2.38 percent money market accounts and certificates of deposit last summer and went into a mutual fund was my feeling that the new Administration's policies, like reducing the national debt and working for better and less costly health care, should insure a sounder national economy. It looked as if this was indeed happening, and by early February I was running ahead by 7 percent, not bad for seven months.
At this point the Fed leaked a rumor that it was thinking of jacking up the interest rate. This started a slide in the Dow Jones and soon afterward the Fed did raise the rate, which further depressed the market. This was followed by two more leaks and raises until my account is now so low that I am 1 1/2 percent below my original investment.
As for looming inflation, I'm buying gasoline for 99.8 cents, the lowest in years. If I need a new second car I have a choice of several under 10K with major technical and esthetic improvements over past models. Medicare insurance checks, which used to take months to process, are coming back almost by return mail, and my American Association of Retired Persons supplemental insurance carrier is passing a small dividend.
Supermarkets are competing with one another to offer bargain food specials. Several new ethnic restaurants have opened in our vicinity, with excellent dishes at affordable prices.
Future foreign competition alone should stifle any tendency to inflation. Aside from making some Republicans happy, deliberate stalling of the economy doesn't make sense at this time. Thank you, Professor Thurow.

HEADLINE: Shouldn't the Fed Act in the Public Interest?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Fed Goes Ghostbusting" (Op-Ed, May 6), Lester Thurow makes a formidable critique of the Federal Reserve and the premature fear of inflation that led it to a threefold raise of interest rates. Real wages have declined, productivity has risen, prices are competitively geared against an inflation spiral, United States companies are running nowhere close to their production limits, the economy is not overheating. 
 Yet, he notes, "the Fed is intent on killing a very weak recovery that has yet to include most Americans" by hiking credit costs. Bond traders and investors sold off in haste, seeking protection against a Fed policy that aims for zero inflation, when there is no sign of price escalation in sight.
On the day of the market selloff, unemployment in New York mounted to 8.2 percent for March, oil prices fell to a healthy low, and purchasing power (in real terms) continued its historic downward trend. The immediate cause of the flight of the traders was the new unemployment figures: the rate went from 6.5 to 6.4 percent, largely because low rates of hiring in a long, hard winter were at last corrected. In short, there were 100,000 jobs more than expected. But this was in a labor force of 120 million, which excluded nearly 12 percent of black and Hispanic job seekers.
Is it not a function of government, even in a business-minded society, to protect underprivileged citizens against market excesses? We look to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Food and Drug Administration to protect us, to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts to curb abuses of market power.
Should the Federal Reserve not put the defense of national interests ahead of its concerns for the speculative anxieties of bank funds and bond traders?

Trying to Keep the U.N. United, Within City Borders

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Although the United Nations has been wedded to New York for nearly 50 years, intense competition erupted in the 1990's to lure prized agencies like Unicef and the United Nations Development Program to the suburbs and even overseas. City officials, fearing the diplomatic equivalent of losing the Brooklyn Dodgers, redoubled efforts to keep the agencies firmly rooted on the banks of the East River.
Now those efforts are starting to pay off, local officials say. The city has found a new home for Unicef, which wanted to relocate, and is pursuing other footloose agencies. City officials are also encouraged by renewed real estate activity around the United Nations complex. 
 And as the world body redefines its role in the post-cold-war era, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is seeking more unified agency operations, which bodes well for New York.
"The U.N. is a franchise industry for New York, and it enhances our reputation as an international city," said Lance Ruiz Carlile, vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The exploration of new sites originated because of space needs as well as cost pressures in the early 1990's, when the United Nations was strained by delays in aid from the United States and the collapsing Soviet Union.
Unicef, which decided to stay in Manhattan last fall after reviewing 75 proposals for other locations, has recently chosen 633 Third Avenue for its expansion site. The United Nations Development Corporation, a city and state agency, is buying the building from the Travelers Companies for Unicef for an undisclosed price. The children's aid agency will occupy 18 of the 41 floors as a condominium.
Unicef will continue in its main building, the nearby 3 United Nations Plaza, also owned by the U.N. Development Corporation. As an additional incentive to stay, Unicef will get the deed when the bonds are paid off in the year 2026. Community Board 6 approved the plans last week. Unicef has 900 jobs in its headquarters; that is expected to grow to 1,500 in coming years.
Several other agencies hunting for sites may follow to 633 Third Avenue. "Unicef's decision gives us a much better chance to keep the others," Mr. Carlile said. "Its lead makes the case for efficiency and consolidation."
New plans for a 23-floor diplomatic office building at 871 First Avenue, opposite the United Nations, signal private confidence in U.N. growth, despite the slumping real estate and construction market. Albanese Development Corporation, a private company, plans to start the project this fall and says it is negotiating with several countries about occupying the building.
In addition, Mayor Giuliani announced this month plans to sell the 427-room, government-owned U.N. Plaza-Park Hyatt Hotel. "We've already gotten lots of calls," Mr. Carlile said.
But the rivalry for agencies is not over. Germany made a lucrative offer, including free rent and $184 million for relocation, to entice several agencies to Bonn. A plum is the United Nations Development Program, which aids overseas development. "It's not a household name like Unicef, but it has even more jobs, about 1,200," said Mr. Carlile. No action has been taken, and officials say that the longer the offer lingers, the more likely the agency will stay put.
"We have a very good relationship with the city of New York," said Juan Carlos Brandt, a spokesman for the Secretary General. "The Mayor's office is dedicated to easing our problems, and we're very happy to be here." BRUCE LAMBERT

Board Defies Mayor Over Fulton Fish Market

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
No one was surprised last week when Community Board 1 endorsed plans for a new business improvement district for lower Manhattan. But the board also defied the Giuliani administration by recommending that the B.I.D.'s boundaries include the Fulton Fish Market.
Tom Cusick, the project manager for the proposed district and president of the Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District, told the board that the Mayor's office had requested the market be left out of the B.I.D. discussions because of what he called "investigations." 
 In March, Randy M. Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff, said that "new procedures and initiatives" were being planned for oversight issues at the market, which for decades has been considered a haven for organized crime.
"Ever since I was a kid," said Anne Compoccia, the chairwoman of the community board, "some agency has been periodically investigating the market. They can't defame hundreds of working men and women."
But Jill Minelli, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Business Services, said that because the market was city owned, it would not contribute financially to the B.I.D. "Since the city is already handling services there," she said, "we recommend that the fish market not be included in the B.I.D."
The B.I.D. proposal now goes to the City Planning Commission. If approved, it moves on to the City Council. M.H.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
Caldor's Success May Lure More Big Stores to Downtown

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
When the Caldor Corporation opened a branch in the old Alexander's department store on Roosevelt Avenue eight months ago, its executives were uncertain. "We weren't 100 percent sure this was the right market for us," said Marc Balmuth, Caldor's president. He's no longer uncertain.
"It's one of our highest-volume stores," Mr. Balmuth said. "We believe it's successful because the area is densely populated and it's continuing to grow." Caldor, a discount chain based in Norwalk, Conn., acquired a long-term lease on the site in Federal Bankruptcy Court in 1992. 
 Caldor's arrival is just one sign of change in an area that has recently grown in population, investment and economic activity. Since 1986, the number of retailers in downtown Flushing has increased 7.6 percent to 874, and it is now one of the city's largest retail districts. City planners have proposed a huge expansion of the retail area, and a major street improvement project is under way.
Business and community leaders say that the presence of Caldor's could attract other chains like Mandee, Strawberry's and Benetton. And City Councilwoman Julia Harrison and some business leaders are seeking to create a business improvement district to help market the area.
"It's nice to have a store of that magnitude come in because then we can go out and get things we lack, like women's department stores," said John Watts, chief of staff for Councilwoman Harrison. Additional businesses would complement Caldor as well as Stern's department store, a Roosevelt Avenue mainstay, and other big newcomers like E. Land Shop, which opened in December.
But some business leaders are concerned that large retailers could hurt the mom-and-pop establishments that account for most of Flushing's stores. "We need to make sure our present businesses are protected," said Jeff Chen, head of the Flushing Chinese Business Association, which has about 300 members.
But Mr. Watts says that given the proposals for expanding the downtown area, there will be more than enough business to go around without damaging the smaller stores. Last October, city planners called for rezoning a manufacturing district on either side of Prince Street, which would more than triple the allowable commercial density and also permit residential development.
Thousands of immigrants, mostly Chinese and Koreans, have settled in downtown Flushing in the last decade, and many banks came on their heels, competing for the Asians' savings. The banks were also attracted by the influx of hundreds of restaurants, Asian grocery stores and fashionable boutiques. Some 50,000 people pass through downtown Flushing daily. Shoppers can ride 19 bus lines and one subway line to get there.
The City Economic Development Corporation is completing a $10.5 million street improvement project. Its first phase, rebuilding Prince Street, was completed about five years ago.
The second phase, along Main Street, is scheduled to be finished in August. Roadways have been repaired, traffic lights and lighting fixtures installed and trees planted. Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the development agency, said that a third phase, along Union Street, was still being planned.
The street improvements have created traffic jams for months. But Joe Chen, who owns Tsui Garden, a Chinese restaurant at 136-11 38th Avenue, praises the project. "The street repairs needed to be done," he said. "Without them, I don't think so many people would be moving in."
Asked about the effort to bring in large retailers, Mr. Chen said: "I'm in the restaurant business and I worry whenever I see a new restaurant opening up. This is a very competitive area and if I were in the retail business, I wouldn't look on it favorably." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
New York Jewelers Unite To Be More Competitive
 The streets of New York may not be paved with gold, but 47th Street and the surrounding jewelry district come close -- and, in the face of growing domestic and global competition, the jewelers want to keep it that way. Last week, merchants joined forces with Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Gemological Institute of America to form the Diamond and Jewelry Industries Development Corporation. 
 "If the city is to remain a significant force in the industry," said Ralph Destino, chairman of Cartier Inc. and a member of the corporation's board, "it's going to have to battle for it."
The development corporation will provide technical assistance to manufacturers and sponsor forums on the export trade as well as worker training programs. The Borough President's office has pledged $780,000 for capital improvements to 47th Street and the surrounding area, which will include outdoor video cameras to improve security for merchants carrying precious cargo. The jewelry industry employs 26,000 people.
 
Nordictrack Is Opening Two Stores in Manhattan
 Nordictrack, the company that brought cross-country skiing into the American home, is starting up two stores in Manhattan.
The first site opened last week in Union Square, which is also home to Paragon and Herman's. "It's turning into a sporting goods mecca," said Tom Knierim, associate director of the 14th Street/Union Square Local Development Corporation. The second Nordictrack shop, at 650 Madison Avenue at 60th Street, is scheduled to open in late June.
The store in Union Square, at 202 Park Avenue South at 17th Street, will carry the company's full line of products, including apparel and sports books as well as aerobic and strength-training equipment. Chris Werle, a spokesman for Nordictrack, which is based in Chaska, Minn., said the 4,000-square-foot store would offer discounted and close-out goods. The Madison Avenue store, he said, will be smaller and "more upscale and trendy."
 
Red Hook Group Helps Merchants Deal With City
Four years after it was founded, the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation in Red Hook now finds itself with a membership of more than 200 businesses, an annual budget of $400,000 and plans to make the area cleaner, safer and more convenient for businesses and residents.
"Basically we're trying to set up a business improvement district," said Michael Butler, who was named economic development director of the group last month. "We help local businesses deal with city services -- like the Sanitation Department -- or help them utilize existing programs for tax credits and lower energy costs."
With financing from the state and city, the nonprofit group is planning security patrols, clean-up crews and a free shuttle bus to the subway so residents can avoid paying two fares. This month the group began running a Saturday bus tour of Red Hook for residents and visitors in Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights.

HEADLINE: The Kids Managing America's Money

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
THE stock market's skidding, the bond market's bombing and if you had to invest all by yourself, you might be in a panic. But fortunately, like millions of Americans, you've hired a pro to take care of all that: a mutual fund manager, or two or three. Wise old hands, these silver-haired money managers have seen it all before and know what to do when times get tough. Right?
Guess again. These days, more than a third of all mutual funds, including some of the biggest, are run by people in their 20's and 30's, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund-tracking service. Many of these managers were born in the 1960's and were in grade school during the last terrible bear market, which began in 1973. Some had not even started managing other people's money in 1987, when the markets collapsed. 
 While hard numbers are difficult to come by, everyone agrees that there are more youngsters running funds now than 5 or 10 years ago.
Why? For one thing, the number of mutual funds has boomed, to 3,800 (excluding money-market funds), from 1,800 in 1987, as Americans dismayed by falling returns on other investments have rushed into this kind. That's a lot of new funds in need of managers.
So much money has come the funds' way -- assets are now $1.5 trillion, up from $114 billion a decade ago -- that some of the most experienced managers have stopped accepting new money. As a result, "More and more, we're being forced to look at funds and managers that haven't been around as long as we'd like," said Ken Gregory, a principal in Litman/Gregory & Company, a financial advisory firm in Orinda, Calif.
The young'uns can be found in all parts of the business, from plain vanilla American stocks to obscure bonds from exotic countries, at conservative insurance companies and aggressive hot-growth "boutiques," managing funds sold by brokers and funds you can buy directly.
Some, like Robert K. Citrone, 29, of Fidelity Investments, specialize in investments new to mutual funds, including emerging-markets debt. Others, like a group of Texans led by 32-year-old Jonathan C. Schoolar, are traditionalists, following a stock-picking system laid down by their forebears.
Some, like James P. Goff, 30, and Warren B. Lammert, 32, of Janus Capital, started buying stocks when they were sprouts and read The Wall Street Journal when other college kids read Rolling Stone. Others, like Patricia Bannan, 32, and Catherine Dudley, 34, of the Phoenix Funds, got into the business more serendipitously.
Some, like Jennifer L. E. Leichter, 33, of Putnam Management, work in close-knit teams under an experienced supervisor at firms in the business a long time. Others, like David Herro, 33, are building businesses almost from scratch; they are the supervisors. And others, like Michael Gordon, 29, of Fidelity, work for long-established firms that treat managers as autonomous entrepreneurs.
For all the agreement that younger people are managing bigger amounts, there is no consensus on whether this matters.
Peter Lynch, the 50-year-old who propelled Fidelity's Magellan Fund to tremendous returns in the 1980's, scoffs at "the age issue." Fidelity is famous for allowing young people to invest customers' money early in their careers, and Mr. Lynch, who started running Magellan when he was 33, thinks that's as it should be. Noting that Newton and Einstein made their most significant discoveries in their 20's, he said of managing money, "You can be good at this business in three years."
Other astute money managers disagree, and vehemently. One is William H. Gross, 50, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company and sometimes called the Peter Lynch of the bond business. "It takes years of seasoning, developing not only your instincts but also a knowledge of yourself and other people," Mr. Gross said. "You can't become a good money manager in three years. You haven't proven yourself in bull and bear markets, you haven't experienced all the emotion of the market over time."
Some of the young fund managers have done better than average, some worse. But so far, no young manager has driven a fund off a cliff. Of course, most haven't had driver's licenses very long. And with the bull market in recent years, it has been hard to lose money. Now, with the markets slowing, the road may be rougher.
There have always been young money managers; hot-shots like Mario Gabelli had to start somewhere. But it was usually not by managing billions of other people's dollars. "When I was 28, I thought I was pretty good, and I was," said Mr. Gabelli, now 52. "I did very well then, but it was with family assets, which was not a lot of money."
In fact, until recently, nobody in the fund business was managing a lot of money. Ten years ago, only 20 funds had assets of $1 billion or more; today, almost 300 do, and Fidelity Magellan alone has $33 billion (and is run by a 35-year-old, Jeff Vinik). Mr. Gabelli said he will entrust neophytes with small sums, but he prefers fund managers who've been clawed by the bear. "We have a saying that we don't want to age our clients' greenbacks with our green staff," he said.
But experienced managers are increasingly hard to come by, fund companies complain, particularly in hot areas like international investing.
Because money managers tend to stick with what they know, new kinds of investing tend to attract new -- almost always young -- managers. Lately, lots of new investment techniques have sprung up, including some that use complex computer models to pick stocks or bonds.
MEANWHILE, some managers have left their funds to join private investment partnerships, where they can make a lot more money. (Virtually all fund managers have total compensation in six figures, with those running the largest and most successful funds making more than a million.) And many old hands have retired, sometimes selling their firms for big bucks.
But for every veteran who leaves, there are many rookies clamoring to get in. Next month, more than 22,000 people will take an exam to receive the degree of chartered financial analyst, a step toward becoming a money manager. That's more people, by several thousand, than have received C.F.A. degrees in 30 years.
And many funds are happy to see the fresh faces. Elizabeth Katsivelos, director of career services at Columbia Business School, said more funds are hiring M.B.A.'s right out of school.
How can you tell whether a newcomer is managing your money? It isn't easy. Legally, funds don't have to disclose managers' ages; until last year, they didn't even have to give out the managers' names. Now that funds must identify the people running them, they try to fudge by claiming they are run by a team, or by listing a senior executive along with the whippersnapper who's really in charge, complained John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds.
The following look at a dozen managers who were all born in the 1960's and manage more than a billion dollars for six very different kinds of mutual-fund companies shows a bright and energetic group whose self-confidence can strike one as either heartening or terrifying.
 
 
 
THEIR ELDER STATESMAN IS 32
 YOUTH does not always mean innovation. Some of the youngest fund managers are, rather, disciples, dedicated to carrying on the work of their founding fathers.
Take the young Texans who manage about $10 billion in stock funds for AIM Capital in Houston. When AIM got into this business in 1986, it hired two of the oldest managers around, Harry Hutzler and Julian Lerner. Both men, devotees of the stocks of fast-growing companies, known as growth stocks, began working with the bright youngsters who came off AIM's trading desk.
Mr. Hutzler retired last year, leaving Jonathan C. Schoolar, 32, in charge of continuing "the discipline," as they call their stock-picking system, which focuses on companies' earnings growth.
Though the largest fund, AIM Weingarten, had bad years in 1992 and 1993, the boys have faith in Mr. Hutzler's method. "The discipline has worked fantastically," said Robert M. Kippes, 28. "All we have to do is be willing to work hard, follow the discipline, and the rest is history."
Mr. Lerner, now 69, still manages one of the funds with Lanny H. Sachnowitz, 29. He said he admires the young men, who are full of energy and computer know-how but not full of themselves.
"It's pretty heady stuff, when you're a young person and they're throwing millions of dollars at you," he said. "You've kind of got to keep your feet on the ground."
All four are competitive and passionate sports fans. Three of the four are Texans born and bred. The fourth, Joel E. Dobberpuhl, 27, is a Minnesotan with no desire to go back North. They display a bit of impatience with people who ask how such young guys can manage money. "A lot of it just gets back to common sense and stupidity," Mr. Dobberpuhl said. "You can be stupid when you're 60, too."
 
 
 
YOUNG AND FREE AT FIDELITY
 NO fund company has more young managers, with more responsibility, than Fidelity Investments.
As the country's largest mutual-fund company, Fidelity often comes across as the Boston Behemoth, a monolithic investment machine. But in truth, "our equity fund managers are essentially autonomous," said William Hayes, who heads the stock-fund group.
Which gives a lot of freedom to managers like Michael Gordon, 29, who joined Fidelity in 1987, right out of Harvard. He was interested in stocks, he said, "but it wasn't like I was reading The Wall Street Journal daily from the time I was 11." He became an analyst, ultimately specializing in biotechnology stocks.
In 1990 he became manager of the Fidelity fund that focuses on biotech issues. That year and the next, such stocks soared, and the fund boomed, growing from $70 million at the end of 1989 to more than $1 billion by the end of 1991. But in 1992 the rocket burned out; the fund suffered double-digit losses and investors fled. Mr. Gordon was not blamed for the losses, which hit the entire biotech market, and he moved on, serving as an assistant on Magellan and then last year taking over the $1.5 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund, which unlike most of its competitors is in the black this year. But the scars remain. "I do have a healthy respect for the market," he said, "a good amount of fear."
Robert Citrone, 29, doesn't seem to have that fear -- at least not yet. He joined Fidelity in 1990 with an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia, and started as an analyst of corporate bonds. But a stint in research on foreign-government bonds had given him an interest in emerging-markets debt, and Fidelity encouraged him to pursue it.
Three and a half years ago, Fidelity's funds had no investments in emerging-market debt; now Mr. Citrone manages $7 billion, spread across many kinds of funds.
But after some superb performances, these bonds have plunged this year; the New Markets Income Fund he runs has dropped more than 20 percent. Undaunted, Mr. Citrone thinks these markets still offer "huge upside potential."
 
 
 
DIFFERENT PATHS TO THE TOP
 LOTS of young fund managers are freshly minted M.B.A.'s who probably carried their sandwiches to school in briefcases and traded bonds instead of baseball cards. But there are exceptions.
Neither Catherine Dudley, 34, nor Patricia Bannan, 32, intended to be a money manager. A year after graduating from the University of Connecticut, Ms. Dudley tired of running a restaurant. As for Ms. Bannan, fresh out of the University of New Hampshire, "I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to eat."
Both ended up at Phoenix Life Insurance in administrative jobs; both jumped at the chance to work as junior analysts for Robert Chesek, the firm's growth-stock manager, who retired last year. Within three years both were managing portfolios.
Today, Ms. Dudley manages, among other things, the $2.2 billion Phoenix Growth Fund, which hasn't been a barn-burner (it has averaged a 6 percent annual gain over the last three years, while the S.& P. 500 has made 9 percent a year). This year, however, Ms. Dudley's strategy looks better; the fund's losses are more modest than those of the index or the average growth fund.
Ms. Bannan serves as president of Phoenix Investment Counsel and runs the $2.8 billion Phoenix Balanced Fund, which like the growth fund has tended to lag its peers in good years but beat them in bad ones.
Experience is more important than age, Ms. Bannan said, "but there are benefits to being younger. You have a more open mind, fewer biases, and a fresher outlook."
 
 
 
BORN TO BE FUND MANAGERS
IN earlier decades, they would have had to spend more time as analysts before running other people's money. Nevertheless, some of today's young guns seem to have been born to be fund managers.
That seems the case for James Goff, 30, and Warren Lammert, 32, comanagers of the $1.5 billion Janus Venture Fund. The two have a lot in common. Both bought stocks as kids, both went to Yale, and both went to interviews with Fred Alger Management without being sure just what it was the firm managed. The answer was growth stocks; both joined the firm as analysts. And both moved to Janus Capital in Denver, following Thomas Marsico, who at 38 runs the big Janus 20 Fund.
Mr. Lammert did once make a break for it, deciding to get degrees from the London School of Economics and Harvard so he could go into teaching. But he changed his mind and was soon back in Denver, skiing, playing hockey -- and investing.
Both started managing private accounts for Janus in 1991, and soon started separate mutual funds. But they didn't take over the enormous Venture fund until the end of last year, when James Craig decided he needed to devote his full attention to the firm's flagship Janus Fund, which had soared to $9.1 billion in assets. Their first few months haven't been easy; the fund is down almost 5 percent this year. But that's no worse than the average fund investing in small companies.
The young managers get a lot of feedback from above. For example, Mr. Lammert said, Thomas Bailey, the founder, "will remind you how many of his friends became ski instructors in the 70's -- of how things can get worse."
 
 
 
A 'GRAND OLD MAN' AT 33
 SELF-CONFIDENCE is a hallmark of young mutual-fund managers, but some stand out for it -- and for other people's willingness to take a risk with them.
When David G. Herro, 33, who manages the $1.4 billion Oakmark International Fund, started managing overseas investments, he was 26, and the sum of his international travel was a fishing trip to Canada. He also had a master's degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin, a year's work experience selling meat for Hormel, and a longtime love of stocks, which he picked up working as a golf caddy for stockbrokers in his hometown, Fond du Lac, Wis.
So he confidently accepted an invitation to start an international fund for Principal Mutual Life, and three years later to move to the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, where he ended up managing $800 million in pension funds. In 1992 he moved to Harris Associates in Chicago to start the Oakmark fund. Last year the fund gained 54 percent; this year it's about even, as are most international funds.
Since January Mr. Herro has traveled to China, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and twice to Europe and is going back to Asia next month. He would like to marry and have a family, he said; for now he shares an apartment with his brother.
As the fund has grown, Mr. Herro has hired two younger assistants, and two more researchers are on the way. "I'm the grand old man at 33," he joked. He added: "What I may lack in experience, I have in discipline and the ability to be a good learner."
 
 
 
THRIVING IN JUNK BONDS
 IN some areas of investing, young people predominate because there simply aren't many old hands around. That's particularly true in the booming bond business, which in recent years has seen many new kinds of investments that might not attract older managers.
"It's an old-dog, new-tricks kind of thing," said Jennifer L. E. Leichter, 33, who runs more than $2 billion in junk-bond portfolios for Putnam Investments in Boston. Some of the people on her investing team are in their 20's, she said; her boss is 40.
After graduating from Swarthmore in 1983, Ms. Leichter (pronounced LIKE-ter) became a research assistant at Kidder, Peabody; in 1987, she and her husband, Fred, moved to Boston and she joined Putnam, which has been running funds since 1937 and uses tightly knit teams headed by senior people.
She started managing money in late 1988, and soon became responsible for Putnam Diversified Income.
The fund has soared an average of 12.4 percent a year in each of the last three years, outpacing rivals; this year, it has fallen about 4 percent, average for such funds.
Ms. Leichter has two young children and hobbies that include gardening and curling -- akin to shuffleboard on ice. She expects to continue managing funds "unless I make some killing or inherit a tremendous amount of money. It's a tremendously enjoyable way to make a living."

A brief report about Fidelity Investments last Sunday, with a front-page article in this section about mutual funds that are run by managers in their 20's and 30's, misidentified the college attended by Michael Gordon, manager of Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund. It was Tufts, not Harvard.

HEADLINE: Can They Deliver?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Maybe it's the sugared walnuts, chocolate syrup and ice cream. Perhaps it's pride of place, or plain old enlightened self-interest. But on the last Thursday of each month, in Room EF-100 of the Capitol, a ground-floor hideaway a few steps from the gift shop, a group of instinctively fractious politicians comes together for lunch and a make-your-own-sundae sit-down.
They represent constituencies almost as diverse as America, yet 14 of them are crammed together in just over 300 square miles, a land mass one twenty-fourth the average size of a single Congressional district. Most of them toil in comparative anonymity, 200 miles from home, where City Council members are just as likely to get local ink or air time. 
 "They might as well be on Mars as far as the public is concerned," said Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group.
They are New York City's Congressional delegation, and after years of famous feuds, retirements, redistricting and rebirth, they stand at a crossroads: facing a chance, and a challenge. They have a Democratic White House for the first time in more than a decade and clout on important committees, and are part of the second-biggest state contingent, with 31 members to California's 52. But they have to stick together.
What they do will make a difference in everything from how the city gets the Federal aid that amounts to 10 percent of its budget, to whether subways are rebuilt to how the poor and homeless -- and the world's premier private hospitals -- are treated in the brave new health care world.
Led by the unlikely duo of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the fourth-ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and sped by the overdrive energy of Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, New Yorkers again hold pivotal posts in the Capitol Hill baronage from which they largely fell in the era of 70's reform.
What is more, they are trying to develop a unity that has eluded New York Democrats since the days of the machines, and that was less an issue when the Republican 1980's relegated them to the status of loyal opposition. It has long been tricky to get this choir to sing from the same page.
"It was very difficult," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who as a Congressman from Greenwich Village two decades ago instituted the bipartisan sundae lunches. "I used to con them into coming by providing ice cream. I think we got a lot done within this limitation, which was: 'Don't push me around.' "
In fact, members and their staffs say, much has changed since Mr. Koch's days, when strong egos like his and Bella Abzug's and Elizabeth Holtzman's tugged and tussled. Now, a more collegial spirit rules. Even Mr. Rangel and Mr. Moynihan have set aside mutual differences to lead the delegation into refusing to support President Clinton's health care package unless it makes the Medicaid reimbursement formula more favorable to New York.
"The problem is that states and localities have had 12 years of deprivation across the country and it's 435 tiny bird beaks opening and saying, 'Give us food,' " said Sandra Cuneo, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Washington counsel. "And the Federal Government doesn't have a lot of money, and it's a very difficult time."
But with President Clinton in the White House, Mr. Schumer said, blaming Washington won't wash. "Now we've got to produce, we've got to deliver," he said.
 
KINGS OF THE HILL
 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Democrat, elected 1976
Alfonse M. D'Amato
Republican, elected 1980
No New Yorker stands taller in Washington than Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the philosopher king of the Finance Committee, whose merest word can now move the White House to action on issues from a Whitewater special prosecutor to human rights violations in Tibet. He says and does pretty much what he
wants, and this year, that is to take his time on a health care bill in the Finance Committee, and press the Administration to reform welfare.
Student of history, lover of architecture, master of demography, Mr. Moynihan extends his energies from reorganizing the Social Security Administration to rebuilding the General Post Office adjoining Penn Station as a new Amtrak terminal. The jury is still out on his biggest task, health care, but he faces only a pesky Democratic primary challenge from the Rev. Al Sharpton.
There could be no starker Frick to Mr. Moynihan's Frack than Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Long Island Republican who barely won a third term in 1992 after repeated inquiries into his ethical conduct in office.
In fact, the two have often worked cooperatively, offsetting each other's strengths and weaknesses, and Mr. D'Amato does a friendly but devastating impression of Mr. Moynihan's distinctive, spluttering speech.
He has raised constituent service and attention to parochial concerns to a high art, but his pull has diminished under a Democratic White House. As the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, Mr. D'Amato did not let his own past ethical problems dull his ardor for criticizing President Clinton over Whitewater. His colleagues in the Republican leadership seem to have reined him in a bit lately. But he has announced his intention to seek the chairmanship of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the clearinghouse that raises money for Republican campaigns around the country.
 
A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN
 
Charles B. Rangel
Democrat, 15th District, Harlem, elected 1970
Charles E. Schumer
Democrat, 9th District, Brooklyn and Queens (Park Slope, Sheepshead Bay, Forest Hills, Far Rockaway), elected 1980
The undisputed leaders of the city's House delegation are Mr. Rangel, the wily 12-term veteran and expert on drugs, poverty and urban affairs, and Mr. Schumer, the hotshot Harvard lawyer who has made himself a major force on crime and gun control, most recently with his upset victory on the Federal assault weapons ban. Both are voluble, inveterate schmoozers, capable of working a crowd or navigating a back room, but Mr. Rangel's rambling style hides an iron fist and Mr. Schumer's smile can't mask a steel-trap mind.
Just two senior colleagues and an indictment stand between Mr. Rangel and the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, the gate of all taxing power. But even if Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois is forced to resign due to the investigation into his dealings with the House Post Office, Mr. Rangel's friends say he would not challenge the ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, because Mr. Rangel and other veteran black members are finally coming to the point where the seniority system works in their favor and would not want to upset it.
"He will one day be the most powerful black man America has ever known," Mr. Schumer says.
Still, Mr. Rangel's seniority has not brought him all the rewards he might have hoped. Last year, in a cost-saving move, House Democrats abolished four nonlegislative committees, including Mr. Rangel's panel on narcotics, and he took it hard. He has sometimes been persona not so grata at the White House for his stiff criticism of Mr. Clinton during the 1992 campaign.
The criticism of Mr. Range: He is sometimes disorganized. But he gets high marks for collegiality and acuity.
"If it gets any better, I'd be afraid," Mr. Rangel said of cooperation among the state delegation. "I don't ever want to see the line between Democrats and Republicans wiped out, but we are so hellbent on bringing money back to the city and state that I've yet to remember a controversy that caused us to go into a Democratic caucus."
The fault found with Mr. Schumer: He is too ambitious, and just too ubiquitous for his own good. But while his colleagues may envy him, most admire him even more. Mr. Schumer can segue from being the President's point man on the omnibus crime bill in the House to attacking plans of other states to gain a share of unclaimed stock dividends from New York. He is a prodigious fund raiser, with a war chest of more than $2 million.
For the moment, Mr. Schumer's ambitions for higher office are stymied. Mr. Moynihan's ascension to chairmanship of the Finance Committee impelled him to run again this year instead of retiring, and Mr. Cuomo's decision to seek a fourth term blocks a shot at the governorship.
 
WHEELERS AND DEALERS
 
Thomas J. Manton
Democrat, 7th District, Queens and Bronx (Long Island City, Astoria, Whitestone), elected 1984
Edolphus Towns
Democrat, 10th District, Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill), elected 1982
No vote is easier for most members of Congress than one that bashes New York, so city officials prefer to have provisions benefiting the Big Apple embedded in legislation before it ever comes out of committee.
"The worst of all possible worlds is to have a floor vote on an issue that affects New York, because if you're standing there all by yourself, chances are, you'll lose," said Judy Chesser, who was the city's chief lobbyist in the Koch and Dinkins administrations.
For tasks like this, New York sometimes relies on vote-traders like Mr. Manton and Mr. Towns.
Mr. Manton, the Queens County Democratic leader, is an old-fashioned Irish pol who sits on the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which makes committee assignments. A former police officer, he is an unabashed believer in patronage, and has been critical of the Clinton White House -- which he supported early and often -- over the lack of same. He is a friend of Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee. City officials give him credit for helping a few years ago to slow down the Federal requirement that the city end sludge-dumping at sea.
Mr. Towns, who grew up in North Carolina, where black sharecroppers depended on tobacco for a living, is one of the cigarette industry's most reliable supporters in the House. A one-time social worker and former chairman of the Congressional black caucus, he is generally liberal, but his votes lack a consistent ideological pattern. (He has opposed stricter auto emissions standards, for example, earning the enmity of New York environmentalists but earning points with Chairman Dingell.)
 
GETTERS AND SPENDERS
 
Jose E. Serrano
Democrat, 16th District, South Bronx, elected 1990
Nita M. Lowey
Democrat, 18th District, Bronx, Queens and Westchester, elected 1988
Floyd H. Flake
Democrat, 6th District, Jamaica, St. Albans, Queens, elected 1986
Mr. Serrano and Ms. Lowey represent the city on the Appropriations Committee, the panel that determines spending for a panoply of Federal programs. Mr. Flake is a demon advocate for Federal housing and community projects for his eastern Queens district.
Mr. Serrano, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic caucus, is likely to take a prominent role in coming debates over whether spending on immigrants should be cut to help finance other programs. In local politics, he often strikes an independent course, remaining conspicuously loyal to Mayor Dinkins when other Hispanic politicians are critical, and has established a good working relationship with Mayor Giuliani, in contrast to the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer.
Ms. Lowey, a one-time neighbor and former aide to Mario M. Cuomo, represents parts of the city as a result of 1992 redistricting. She is an outspoken advocate of abortion rights, but procedural ignorance left her outmaneuvered last year on a vote to retain curbs on Federal funds for abortion for poor women. An ebullient sort, she takes scrupulous credit for programs for her district.
Mr. Flake, a prominent African Methodist Episcopal minister, travels the country on church business and has built a housing and social services empire for his Queens congregation. In 1991, he survived charges of evading taxes and diverting Federal funds from his church when the case was dismissed.
 
THE HEIRESS
 
Susan Molinari
Republican, 13th District, Staten Island and Brooklyn, elected 1990
The lone Republican in the city delegation and heiress to a Staten Island political dynasty, succeeding her father, Guy. As a young woman and supporter of abortion rights, she is a darling of the media and national Republicans, and she flirted briefly with the idea of running for Governor this year. But she is reflexively conservative on most other issues, consistently winning awards from national conservative groups for her pro-business, anti-tax stands.
 
COLORFUL CHARACTERS
 
Gary L. Ackerman
Democrat, 5th District, Queens and Long Island, elected 1983
Major R. Owens
Democrat, 11th District, central Brooklyn, elected 1982
Former Representative James H. Scheuer once lamented that the only way to get noticed as a member of Congress from New York was to stand naked in a Macy's window.
Two members of the current delegation stand out in different ways.
Mr. Ackerman, a genial glad-hander, famous for his white carnation boutonnieres and annual importation of an entire New York deli groaning board to Washington for a fund raiser, chooses the food for the monthly delegation meetings. As a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, he has sometimes blocked removal of Federal offices from New York, and on the Foreign Affairs committee has picked up the interest of his old friend, former Representative Stephen J. Solarz, in Asian issues.
Mr. Owens, a former librarian and a community development chief in the Lindsay administration, is an old-fashioned bedrock liberal. Shy and not a press-seeker, he has taken in recent years to performing rap speeches on the House floor, including this mordant commentary on the 1990 Congressional budget accord with the Bush Administration:
At the big white D.C. mansion
There's a meeting of the mob
And the question on the table
Is which beggars they will rob.
 
THE FRESHMEN
 
Jerrold Nadler
Democrat, 8th District, Upper West Side to Coney Island, elected 1992
Nydia M. Velazquez
Democrat, 12th District in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, elected 1992
Carolyn B. Maloney
Democrat, 14th District, Upper East Side and Queens, elected 1992
The newest kids on the block, these members owe their election to the 1992 redistricting and various flukes.
Mr. Nadler was chosen by party officials as the Democratic nominee after the longtime incumbent, Ted Weiss, died on the eve of the primary; Ms. Velazquez won in a crowded field in a newly drawn district intended to favor a Hispanic candidate, and Ms. Maloney, pulled along on President Clinton's 69 percent margin in her district, squeaked to a sliver victory over the veteran Republican, Bill Green.
Of the three, Ms. Velazquez has emerged in the eyes of her colleagues as a comer. A former liaison for the Puerto Rican Government on the mainland, she is a member of the Banking and Urban Affairs Committees, and a fierce fighter for her poor constituents on the Lower East Side and Williamsburg.
Mr. Nadler, a brainy former yeshiva boy, has put off some of his new colleagues with his untiring loquacity, but most expect him to rise to influence with seniority, just as he did in the State Assembly. Ms. Maloney, who drew the wrath of fellow Democrats by voting against Mr. Clinton's economic stimulus package last year, is generally a liberal stalwart. But she battles a reputation as a lightweight, as she did in the City Council, and in a recent hearing of a banking subcommittee, repeatedly had to be fed questions by an aide.
In a sign of their efforts to become known back home, Ms. Maloney and Mr. Nadler were the third- and fourth-biggest frankers in the House last year, spending $212,000 and $190,000 on taxpayer financed mailings.
 
THE EARLY BIRD
 
Eliot L. Engel
Democrat, 17th District, the Bronx and Westchester, elected 1988
As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Engel last year helped win a waiver from Federal insurance law that saved the city's public hospitals $500 million. But he may be best known for his annual arrival on the aisle of the House in time to be first in line to shake the President's hand at the State of the Union Message. He learned the tactic as a freshman from the Mississippi veteran, Representative Sonny Montgomery, who advised him it was a good way to get noticed.
"You have to get there a couple of hours early," Mr. Engel said. "Sonny brings cookies. Some of the elitists don't like it, and people poke fun at it, but my constituents love it, and every year we get a flood of calls afterward."

HEADLINE: Canada Acts To Cut Fishing By Foreigners

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 21

 BODY:
Canada has given itself the legal authority to seize foreign fishing boats outside its 200-mile limit in the North Atlantic in an attempt to stem the depletion of cod, flounder and redfish.
The law, enacted by both houses of Parliament this month, focuses on an area about half the size of New York State, known as the Nose and the Tail of the Grand Banks, fish-breeding grounds on Canada's continental shelf, southeast of Newfoundland. 
 "We're going to very clearly tell the vessels that we sight or target that they either move or be moved," Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said at a news conference in St. John's, Newfoundland on Tuesday. He said he expected Canada to start enforcing the law within 30 days, the time it takes to get the final regulations written and approved.
While the law is politically popular here, it has drawn fire from domestic critics and foreign governments. Some say that if Canada is able to extend its maritime jurisdiction to international waters, other nations might do the same and unravel years of negotiations on the Law of the Sea.
"This is knee-jerk nationalism," said Armand de Mestral, professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal. "It's unfortunate that a country like Canada that needs international law and has a reputation for respecting international law takes matters in its own hands like this."
 
U.S. Envoy Objects
 The United States Ambassador, James J. Blanchard, said that while Washington "shares Canada's concerns" about the depletion of the fish stocks, "we think they should have worked within multilateral institutions to deal with this problem."
Roy Christensen, spokesman for the European Union in Ottawa, said, "there is the principle involved. We would have liked Canada to act multilaterally."
Canadian officials, however, said both the new law and the Government's stated rejection of international challenges to it were temporary measures in response to an emergency situation.
"Canada is acting purely because it is driven to act," said Mr. Tobin, chief architect of the law. "We have conducted diplomacy down to the last few pounds of fish. We either continue to talk about it, or we try to save those last few pounds and use them as a basis for restoring the stock."
In trying to rebuild the stocks, Canada has also imposed stringent measures on its own fishermen. A two-year-old ban has left 33,000 fishermen and fish plant workers unemployed, three-quarters of them in Newfoundland.
Under the new law, any ship found taking endangered species will be towed into port, and its captain will be arrested and put on trial. If convicted, he could be fined as much as $360,000 and lose his catch.
 
'Pirate' Vessels the Targets
 Bonnie Mewdell, press secretary in Mr. Tobin's office, said the crackdown was aimed at neither the United States nor Europe. The targets, she said, are "pirate" vessels, which she defined as those either without international registry or flying "flags of convenience" and fishing just beyond Canada's 200-mile limit.
To avoid international conservation agreements, some foreign fishermen flag their vessels in countries like Panama, Honduras and Belize. These flags of convenience require little or no compliance with international rules.
About a dozen of the so-called pirate vessels were sighted last week just beyond the 200-mile limit early last week in the Grand Banks, a relatively shallow area east of Newfoundland that is the spawning ground of cod and other threatened species.

HEADLINE: New Haven Prepares for 6,500 Athletes and 500,000 Spectators

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE 1995 Special Olympics World Games are more than a year away, but at the games headquarters in New Haven activity is already heating up.
Every night several committees meet at the headquarters on the 17th floor of the New Haven Savings Bank building off Chapel Street. One might be working out transportation between the different game locations, another developing a marketing campaign and still another coordinating with town governments planning receptions for foreign athletes. With 6,500 athletes from 120 countries, 2,500 coaches, 45,000 volunteers and as many as 500,000 spectators, there is a lot of planning to do. 
 Consider the problems facing the kitchen committees, said Arthur R. Henick, a spokesman for the games. Not only do the cooks have to worry about varying ethnic tastes among the thousands of athletes, but many of the participants have dietary restrictions because of some physical condition.
"You walk in through one door and there's three more doors facing you, and then nine when you get those doors open, and so on and on," Mr. Henick said.
Timothy P. Shriver, the chairman of the Games Organizing Committee and son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who organized the first Special Olympics games in 1968, said he was encouraged that more than 12,000 volunteers and $16 million in cash, goods and services had already been pledged.
"On the one hand, things are going unbelievably well," Mr. Shriver said. "So many people have responded to the challenge, and are working so hard. On the other hand, even when you have that much excitement and energy there's always a feeling that you're behind. One minute I'm euphoric and the next I have to sit down and quell the panic."
"An event of this magnitude, you can't sit down three months beforehand and say, 'What do we need to do to make this great?' " Mr. Shriver said. "A lot of what we're trying to do, we've got to get in the pipeline quickly. If it's going to happen it's got to happen now."
John F. Gontero, chairman of the New Haven Chamber of Commerce, said local businesses were being urged to offer discounts for meals, lodging and anything else people will need when they come to New Haven for the games. The city was chosen to be host for the games last year because it has sports centers, access to the water for sailing, and because the state was strongly committed to bringing the games to Connecticut. (Strong contenders were Boston and Miami.)
"We really want to let these people know that we care about them, and we want to make them comfortable while they're here," Mr. Gontero said. "These athletes are very special people, and the people who volunteer with them are special people. This is more than a chance to make money. We're looking for a chance to show everyone the best side of New Haven."
Edward J. Kavanagh, dean of graduate and continuing education at Quinnipiac College, said: "This is one of the rare times when the entire New Haven area community, the schools and businesses and the governments in New Haven and the suburbs, everybody has gotten together and sat down at the table to accomplish something. I can't think of anything else that would have triggered this kind of cooperation."
 
250 Events, 19 Sports
 The games are scheduled for July 1 to 9 next year. In all, there will be 250 events in 19 sports at more than a dozen venues.
Though all the athletes are mentally retarded, the competitions impress everyone who comes to watch, Mr. Henick said. One weight lifter who is expected to compete, for instance, routinely lifts three to four times his own body weight.
Loretta L. Claiborne from York, Pa., epitomizes the Special Olympian. Ms. Claiborne, who is 40 years old, recalls that when she was a young girl her teachers wanted to send her to an institution; her mother fought to keep her in school, and prevailed. Today, she has run in 256 marathons (her best time in Boston was three hours, three minutes) and expects to run in 1995, in the first full Special Olympics marathon.
Ms. Claiborne recently spoke to two civic groups in New Haven, attracting more than 250 people, to ask for their help with the games. "Now I can only hope we get two volunteers for every person who heard me," she said with a laugh.
The Connecticut games already have their own mascot, Spencer the whale, who wears sunglasses and a Special Olympics medal. They also have their own license plate, which says "Connecticut" above the registration number and "Sport Spirit Splendor" below it, and carries the Special Olympics symbol on the right-hand side. (For each plate, $35 goes to the games.)
Models have been built showing what the games committee hopes to do with the New Haven waterfront, erecting tents that will cover 9.1 acres off Frontage Road for a strip of booths offering art, food, information and theater and recreation areas.
Each of the state's 169 towns is planning some type of ceremony to recognize Special Olympians from around the world.
"The town can decide whether it's a picnic on the green or a potluck supper at the town hall or a reception at the local public library," Mr. Henick said. "The point, to make the athletes feel welcome."
The games committee will also be producing local and regional games for the Connecticut Special Olympics through November as a trial run of the sites and the organization.
Several major donors have already stepped forward. The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which operates the Foxwoods Resort and Casino in Ledyard, will donate $2 million, the largest contribution in the history of the games. Southern New England Telephone Company, U.S. Healthcare, United Technologies Corporation and I.G.A. Food Stores will each donate $1 million.
The Knights of Columbus, which has its world headquarters in Connecticut, will donate $1 million and provide 6,000 volunteers. "We have 30,000 Knights in Connecticut, plus their wives and children, so we have a huge pool to draw from," said Harvey G. Bacque, assistant to the Supreme Knight.
 
A Cause to Rally Around
 Last year $15 million of the $93 million the organization gave to charity went to benefit people with mental retardation, as did a significant part of the 43 million hours of volunteer time its 1.5 million members logged worldwide, Mr. Bacque said. Recruiting volunteers for the Special Olympics, he said, is generally fairly easy.
"It's one of those causes that people easily rally around," he said. "And it's not difficult getting people for the Connecticut games because it's probably not going to happen in Connecticut again in our lifetime. Everybody wants to be a part of it."
For the first time the games are being held in a waterfront community and for the first time they will include sailing. But its proximity to the sea was not the only factor in the choice of New Haven as host for the games.
Mr. Henick said the concentration of colleges and universities in New Haven put about 90 percent of the sports installations needed within a three-mile radius. Also, Connecticut has the third largest state Special Olympics competition in the country, demonstrating a strong commitment to the program.
There was also evidence that the state was backing the games, Mr. Henick said. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was the first Governor ever to appear before the site selection committee, and the state offered a $20 million loan guarantee toward the games' $28 million budget.
Mr. Henick said the games should do much more for Connecticut, pumping $50 million to $100 million into the local economy. The Special Olympics games will be the largest sporting event in the world in 1995, and will make Connecticut the center of widespread attention. For the first time, the opening ceremonies are expected to be broadcast live on prime-time television.
"It could have an enormous effect on a number of factors," Mr. Henick said. "Connecticut, and New Haven specifically, could get a boost as a destination for tourism, for instance. Or it could show that Connecticut and New Haven can put on a world-class sporting event, which could attract more events of this sort."
 
Federal Aid Sought
 Robert N. Laemel, director of games operations for the city of New Haven, said he was coordinating with the United States Commerce Department to get financial aid to make the city look its best by the time of the games.
"We want the city to sparkle and shine, not just in the world games but into the future," Mr. Laemel said. "We don't want everything to drop and go back to normal when the games are done."
For instance, he said, suggestions have been made that New Haven could develop a world-class softball complex or a museum of the world Special Olympics. Also, he said, there are the 45,000 volunteers being recruited for the games.
"We want that system to remain in place so this kind of people power can be put to work for New Haven as we move forward after the games," Mr. Laemel said. "As a committee, we want to keep the street festival going, we want to keep the harbor celebration as a permanent event."
Mr. Gontero said businesses, too, hoped to build pride in New Haven that could be sustained long after the games. A recent round table organized by the chamber attracted more than 100 people who wanted to help organize the games.
"There's no arm twisting," Mr. Gontero said. "People are just coming out to do the work because they believe in what's happening, and that's really good to see."
 
Still a Long Way to Climb
 Five local schools -- Yale University, Southern Connecticut State University, Quinnipiac College, the University of New Haven and Albertus Magnus College -- will offer dormitories and dining halls for the athletes.
Mr. Kavanagh said he estimated the staff at Quinnipiac would put in a total of 18,000 hours preparing the school between now and the lighting of the torch.
Summer school classes will halt for a few weeks in 1995. A football clinic and wrestling camp that has been held at Quinnipiac every summer for years will also have to be relocated.
"We're going to turn over the gym and the infirmary, the student union and computer center and the theater, even the alumni hall meeting room," Mr. Kavanagh said. "About the only thing they won't be using will be our classrooms. They're using about all of our ancillary and support services."
Mr. Shriver said it was heartwarming to see so many people offer so much to the Special Olympics. But, he said, the games committee must still find thousands of other volunteers and raise millions more in cash and services.
"We're still looking at the mountain, with a long ways to climb," Mr. Shriver said. "We'll get there, though. Somehow we will. It's a big challenge, but we have to remember that that's the nature of the games, and follow the example of the athletes."

SEX! Without it, we wouldn't exist; there would be nothing more complex than blue-green algae in some scummy pond. Love makes the world go round? No, sex does, providing the endless variety of types from which evolution selects and making the choosing of breeding partners the main event in the evolutionary drama.
At least, this is the latest version of Darwinism shared by three new books -- "The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature," "The Sex Imperative: An Evolutionary Tale of Sexual Survival" and "The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating." All of them proclaim that sex -- not the survival of the fittest -- is the force behind everything from the evolution of peacocks' tails to the ballooning of human brains. And all three reflect more than a revision of evolutionary theory, for they concern the shaping of human nature itself. Two decades ago Edward O. Wilson, in his monumental book "Sociobiology," prophesied (or, some would say, threatened) that "having cannibalized psychology, the new neurobiology will yield an enduring set of first principles for sociology." These books try to fulfill that prophecy by showing that biology can provide deeper and more far-reaching explanations of human nature than studies of culture can.
The authors bring a diverse set of qualifications to this task. David M. Buss, the author of "The Evolution of Desire" and a psychology professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, seems to be a trifle edgy about how his colleagues will take his allegiance to sociobiology. The other two seem more at ease. Kenneth Maxwell, the author of "The Sex Imperative," is an emeritus professor of biology at California State University in Long Beach, and Matt Ridley, the author of "The Red Queen," though he has been primarily a science editor at The Economist, has also published ethological papers on the mating habits of birds.
Although the books differ in focus, they inevitably overlap in content: Mr. Ridley and Mr. Maxwell both discuss the enormous size of whales' testicles (100 pounds for the blue whale, according to Mr. Maxwell; up to a ton for the right whale, claims Mr. Ridley). And all three authors tell the same story about President Coolidge, his wife and the rooster. (In Mr. Maxwell's telling, when the Coolidges "were touring a poultry farm accompanied by separate guides, Mrs. Coolidge asked how often the rooster performed his duty and was told, 'Several times a day.' She said, 'Tell that to Mr. Coolidge.' When the message was relayed to the President, he asked whether the rooster did it all with the same hen, and was told, 'No, each time with a different hen.' The President replied, 'Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.' ")
Mr. Maxwell's book is the least polemical of the three. Where Mr. Buss and Mr. Ridley are interested in making a case against the prevailing view of humans as primarily cultural animals, Mr. Maxwell simply presents life's stunning array of sexual tools and tactics in order to illustrate the adaptability of life forms to their environments. Between Mr. Maxwell's first two chapters, on life's origins and evolutionary theory, and his last three, on the heady future of sperm banks, in vitro fertilization and genetic engineering, he sandwiches 14 detailed chapters about the nuts-and-bolts aspects of sex in our own and other species. Did you know that some lizards have two penises, and that most birds don't have any and must resort to what the author coyly calls "cloacal kissing"? Did you know that when a dog and a bitch get stuck, it's no accident, just the male dog's way of making sure no other dog inseminates "his" female? Have you heard of the Kansas con man "Dr." John R. Brinkley, who became a millionaire in the 1920's and early 30's by transplanting goats' testicles into aging roues? (The men got to pick their own goats.) If you find such things fascinating, this is your book.
For "The Evolution of Desire," Mr. Buss and his colleagues interviewed 10,000 people from 37 different cultures about their courtship and sexual practices; oddly enough, though, the full results of this survey are never presented, even in summary form. Drawing impressionistically on this survey, Mr. Buss marches, sometimes ploddingly, through the human mating cycle, providing animal analogies along the way, to show that every quirk of the mating game in every culture can be attributed to the gene's single-minded agenda: reproduce yourself and zap your competitors whenever possible. Thus, Mr. Buss analyzes how we select partners for long-term and short-term relationships (for long-term relationships, we tend to go for secure mates who will be good parents; for short-term relationships, we choose mates who will be vigorous and energetic), and he describes how men and women differ in their strategies for choosing mates (women choose more stable relationships because they must carry their young for nine months and then nurture them for years; men tend to be more promiscuous because they can scatter their seed with impunity).
Mr. Ridley's book, "The Red Queen," is the most thoughtful (and he's by far the best writer). The "Red Queen" in his book is the "Alice in Wonderland" character who had to run as fast as she could just to stay in the same place. The term was first used, as Mr. Ridley mentions in passing and belatedly, by Leigh Van Valen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, to describe "arms races" between prey and predator species in which each side improves its equipment but neither gains an advantage. In other words, each runs in place not to win the struggle for survival, but merely to avoid losing it.
Mr. Ridley tailors the Red Queen analogy -- not without occasionally stretching and tearing it -- to fit competition between the sexes. He makes a convincing case that sex itself originated in an arms race between parasites and their hosts. Asexual organisms, whose DNA never changes, make sitting ducks for parasites, who quickly learn their hosts' weaknesses. But sexual species, whose DNA varies with each generation, can always keep one jump ahead of the parasites.
Mr. Ridley argues that once sex was established, it began to drive evolution. In choosing their mates, organisms -- usually the females of the species -- determine to some extent what the next generation will be like. Although females try to make good reproductive choices by picking out males whose outward appearance indicates health and vigor, whatever attributes they do choose spread through entire species, even when those choices seem quirky. For instance, female birds may choose mates with gaudy plumage and long tails, even though these attributes attract predators and make flight difficult; maybe, if they could explain their choice, they would say that male birds who have survived with such handicaps must be extra tough and smart!
Perhaps Mr. Ridley's most daring claim involves the explosive growth of hominid brains, and hence the vastly enhanced intelligence of human beings. According to him, intelligence could have evolved only if humans had persistently selected smarter and smarter mates. Although he neatly demolishes some alternative theories of brain growth, he fails to explain why only hominids found intelligence sexy, or why, in Mr. Buss's cross-cultural survey, women ranked intelligence only fifth out of 18 desirable attributes. (The first four seem to be love, dependability, emotional stability and ambition.)
The arguments advanced by Mr. Buss and Mr. Ridley may arouse hostility in two types of readers: those who believe that culture has a bigger hand than biology in ruling human behavior, and those who deny fundamental differences between the mentalities of the two sexes. Mr. Buss partly defends himself against the first group by showing that the results of his survey of mating habits were surprisingly uniform. And Mr. Ridley defends himself against the second group by insisting that sexual equality doesn't depend on sexual sameness (although his choice of Camille Paglia as his authority on feminism won't help him here).
For the most part, though, the authors are antipathetic to those who oppose sociobiology. They observe, correctly I think, that the social sciences have spent too much effort cataloguing relatively superficial differences between humans and too little effort studying the deeper bonds that unite humans with one another and with other species. Yet doubts remain about the authors' sociobiological leanings: are we really getting to the truth of human nature, or are we simply replacing one bias with another?
One's suspicion is especially aroused by remarks like this by Mr. Buss: "Fast food chains are popular precisely because they serve [fat, sugar, protein and salt]. . . . They reveal the food preferences that evolved in a past environment of scarcity." Really? The desire for cheapness and quickness in our ever-faster and more regimented societies couldn't have anything to do with it? Mr. Buss sounds this kind of deterministic note more often than Mr. Ridley.
WHEN Mr. Buss makes analogies between humans and other creatures, he picks any species he pleases, from shrike to sunfish, provided that one feature of its behavior seems to match one in the human repertory. Mr. Ridley is more careful. He draws his analogies either from species that are closely related to humans or from those that seem to share behavior similar to ours -- for example, from ibises and swallows, which, like us, form monogamous unions but live in large groups.
Still, no matter how careful one is, it is unclear just how helpful interspecies analogies are, anyway. When a bird practices what zoologists call "extra-pair copulation," can we really call this adultery? "That is what it is," Mr. Ridley declares flatly. While "adultery" sounds sexier than "extra-pair copulation," confusing the two terms amounts to ignoring the vast body of law, custom and religious doctrine (wholly unknown to swallows) that defines adultery among humans. Moreover, the intent of the two activities is completely different. Those who engage in extra-pair copulation usually aim to make babies; adulterers usually try to avoid making them.
Mr. Ridley is a also shaky in handling the subject of homosexuality. On the one hand, he sees the promiscuity of male homosexuals as typically masculine behavior; on the other hand, he attributes homosexuality to a lack of testosterone at a crucial prenatal stage, which, he says, causes male homosexuals to act more like women than like men. Maybe there's an answer to this apparent contradiction, but Mr. Ridley doesn't supply it.
Behind these particular concerns with Mr. Ridley's and Mr. Buss's books lies a more general one: Isn't it a bit odd that the latest pronouncements of science should so often echo the cynical, age-old "wisdom" of locker rooms and bars? If this criticism seems harsh, consider Mr. Ridley's contention that "the best [that men] can hope for" in a civilized society "is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so." If sex is war, can we learn the whole truth about it when all three reports come from the same trench, from a man's point of view? Mightn't a woman give a different perspective, especially since her view, according to sociobiology, is genetically bound to be completely different?
And there is a final paradoxical question that needs to be raised: Isn't it possible that the belief that biology plays a bigger role than culture in shaping human nature is itself determined by culture, by the shift from the Great Society to the post-Reagan ethos of everyone for himself?
Both Mr. Ridley and Mr. Buss insist that they are describing not what humans should be like, but what they are like. Fair enough -- but is it all that they're like? Sociobiology explains things we share with other species, not those that make us different. I'm not saying we should defend the blinkered, culture-is-all orthodoxy. Yet a biology-is-all orthodoxy is equally blinkered and confining. Maybe the swinging of the intellectual pendulum makes as good an object lesson as any about the ever-elusive mystery of human nature.
 
 
 
THE CHARMS OF A GAUDY MALE
 The question Darwin failed to answer was why. Why on earth should females prefer gaudiness in males? Even if the "preference" was entirely unconscious and was merely an instinctive response to the superior seduction technique of gaudy males, it was the evolution of the female preference, not the male trait, that was hard to explain.
Sometime during the 1970's it began to dawn on people that a perfectly good answer to the question had been available since 1930. Sir Ronald Fisher had suggested then that females need no better reason for preferring long tails than that other females also prefer long tails. At first such logic sounds suspiciously circular, but that is its beauty. Once most females are choosing to mate with some males rather than others and are using tail length as the criterion -- a big once, granted . . . -- then any female who bucks the trend and chooses a short-tailed male will have short-tailed sons. . . . All the other females are looking for long-tailed males, so those short-tailed sons will not have much success. At this point, choosing long-tailed males need be no more than an arbitrary fashion; it is still despotic. Each peahen is on a treadmill and dare not jump off lest she condemn her sons to celibacy. The result is that the females' arbitrary preferences have saddled the males of their species with ever more grotesque encumbrances. Even when those encumbrances themselves threaten the life of the male, the process can continue -- as long as the threat to his life is smaller than the enhancement of his breeding success.

LEAN AND MEAN
The Changing Landscape of Corporate Power
in the Age of Flexibility.
By Bennett Harrison.
324 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $25. 
 IN "Microcosm," George Gilder evoked a vision of entrepreneurial triumph and emergent smallness in the American 80's: "Small business starts nearly tripled, from 270,000 in 1978 to some 750,000 in 1988. The result, contrary to predictions of rising unemployment, was a total of some 15 million new jobs."
Those seeking perspective on this vision should turn to Bennett Harrison's "Lean and Mean." There you will find that "among the 245,000 new companies that were started up in the United States in 1985 . . . 75 percent of the employment gains by 1988 occurred in those firms that, at birth, had already employed more than 100 workers when they were first launched. Moreover, this group of businesses constituted only three-tenths of one percent of the 1985 cohort."
"Lean and Mean" gives us the new world economy as it really is -- an economy that is still dominated by big business, in which the life of the small remains nasty, brutish and short. Compared with the big companies, Mr. Harrison tells us, small businesses pay lower wages and fewer benefits, lag in technology and are far, far more likely to fail. Oh, and one other thing: they are often not really independent. Rather, they exist in their millions only as the vulnerable dependencies of the large corporations, which they serve as contractors or suppliers.
This is a serious book. Mr. Harrison, a professor of political economy at the H. J. Heinz 3d School of Public Policy and Management at Carnegie-Mellon University, and the author, with Barry Bluestone, of "The Deindustrialization of America," gives due space to debunking Mr. Gilder and also David Birch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher whose career rests on the small-business job-creation myth. But he has harder targets than conservative popularizers. In particular, he takes aim at a large body of recent socioeconomics, which has offered the phenomenon of "industrial districts," based on small and midsized businesses, as a model for social organization in an age of rapid technological change.
The two central exhibits in the literature on industrial districts are the manufacturing centers of northern Italy and, of course, Silicon Valley. In "The Second Industrial Divide" (1984), Michael J. Piore and Charles F. Sabel of M.I.T. argued that small enterprises in Emilia-Romagna, Prato and elsewhere had developed, more or less by historical accident, into independent networks of manufacturers, using numerical control and other flexible technologies to adapt to changing markets, free of domination by large multinational corporations. Mr. Harrison, himself a recent emigrant from M.I.T., takes a second look at these "success" stories and finds that they have not withstood the test of a decade's time.
In Emilia-Romagna (Bologna and environs) the metalworking districts have fallen to the takeover prowess of the big-business Sasib group, itself an outpost of Carlo De Benedetti, the rescuer of Olivetti. In Veneto, near Venice, independent garment shops have fallen under the corporate sway of Benetton. And in Prato, Italy's most famous independent woolen-textile district has, according to Mr. Harrison, "fallen prey to the unequal power of the middlemen," even as the local infrastructure has proved unable to cope with the demands on it from the previous patterns of decentralized growth.
As for Silicon Valley, Mr. Harrison maintains that there is another reality behind the popular perceptions. In his view, the California valley is no melting pot of laissez-faire turned small-firm mecca, but the progeny of the Defense Department and Stanford University, fueled by military and aerospace demand, "a construct of a small number of powerful institutions."
Small businesses there are, he says, but often not for the reasons we imagine: "In what Business Week . . . first named the 'casino society,' small firm start-ups themselves became commodities, to be bought and sold in order to generate capital gains."
Moreover, while boosters paint a picture of painless production and good jobs at high wages for all, Mr. Harrison believes the reality is dual: high wages, golf courses and tennis courts for some; low wages and poor conditions for many others, especially migrants, notably in the southern part of the valley around San Jose.
The future that Mr. Harrison offers us resembles Japan. But in Japan he sees what is there: linked networks of large multinational corporations, conquering world markets on the backs of their dependent suppliers and pliant unions even as they scour the poor countries for reservoirs of cheap labor to which the least complex of their operations can be farmed out. American workers lose twice as our companies join this game: low-wage import competition depresses manufacturing wages, and the increasingly powerless position of service providers depresses wages even in jobs not directly subject to competition from trade.
IT is an unpleasant picture, and one made more so by the principal weakness of this book, namely its inchoate policy prescriptions. At times Mr. Harrison seems to be cheering on the American companies (like General Motors, in its joint venture with Toyota, Nummi Motors, and in the innovative assembly lines of its Saturn subsidiary) that are evolving from traditional mass production to global linked networks. At times he reiterates a more conventional critique of American corporate culture -- "short-termism" linked to quarterly performance statistics, for example -- but it is not clear how this fits into his central thesis. And at the end he embraces the fashionable but vacuous idea that "technology, training and technical assistance" can put us on a "high road" toward higher wages and a more decent society.
Sadly, nothing in this bleak portrait of our new world suggests it will be nearly so easy.

HEADLINE: MAYOR ON A ROLL;
Ed Rendell

BYLINE: By Ben Yagoda; Ben Yagoda is the author of "Will Rogers: A Biography." He teaches journalism at the University of Delaware.

 BODY:
A HUSKY MAN IN A DARK BLUE suit steps up to the podium, fixes his audience with a purposeful stare and says, "My name is Edward G. Rendell, and I am the Mayor of Philadelphia."
Ed Rendell proceeds to deliver a short version of the speech he has given to mayors' conferences and neighborhood groups and at black-tie dinners around the country, the speech that, no less than his accomplishments, has made his reputation as (in Al Gore's words) "America's mayor." He talks about how, in January 1992, he took the reins of a city with a $250 million deficit, whose bonds were rated below junk, that was ranked by Financial World magazine as the worst-managed of America's 30 largest cities and that was on the verge of bankruptcy. He talks about how he succeeded in balancing the city's budget in 18 months -- without raising taxes, without begging for handouts from Harrisburg, Pa., or Washington and (Rendell maintains) without lowering the quality of city services, but rather by instituting cost-cutting and efficiency procedures, privatizing many city functions and taking a hard line with municipal unions. 
 By this point in The Speech, the crowd is usually ready to follow Rendell wherever he wants to go. A former Philadelphia District Attorney, he is a natural, even a brilliant, extemporaneous speaker, able to communicate conviction and energy and a sense of mission, all with a common touch. But on this April day in Washington, The Speech is not going over too well.
In a Capraesque move, Rendell has hired a room at the National Press Club, invited the news media at large and journeyed from Philadelphia to present some ideas he thinks are worthwhile. The trouble is, the dozen or so reporters present already know Rendell's Philadelphia story; some of them have probably already written it. They need something new.
The second half of The Speech is Rendell's attempt to give it to them. After listing his administration's accomplishments, he pauses and says: "But it's not enough. The best management in the world isn't going to save Philadelphia." In the last 25 years, he says, the city has lost 263,000 jobs, 30 percent of its tax base and more than 20 percent of its population. Its poverty rate is 20 percent. It is plagued by violence, drugs, AIDS and unemployment. And a balanced budget isn't going to do anything to halt these trends.
But all is not lost, Rendell says. He has a plan: "If we got every single thing in this plan, there's no guarantee that cities will succeed. But if we do nothing -- if the United States of America sits by and does nothing -- there is a guarantee that cities will fail."
At least he's gotten them to start taking notes.
"A LITTLE GIRL ONCE ASKED JOHN KENNEDY, 'HOW did you become a war hero?' He said, 'Simple -- they sank my boat.' "
It's a few weeks before the Washington address, and the 50-year-old Rendell (the accent is on the second syllable) is sitting in his office in Philadelphia's Second Empire City Hall, sipping one of 10 Diet Cokes he will consume in the course of the day and talking about his reputation as Philadelphia's savior. "I became captain of a boat that was three-fifths underwater and listing," he says. "I had no choice. I had to right the ship."
The analogy is true as far as it goes, but doesn't seem quite a sufficient explanation for the acclaim Rendell has received. As far as the national press is concerned, he's like the goody-goody of the neighborhood: the mayor with whom every city's newspaper unfavorably compares its own chief executive. Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles flew to Philadelphia last year for an audience with Rendell. Rudolph Giuliani, also an admirer, had Rendell address top New York City officials at a daylong Gracie Mansion meeting in March.
The outgoing Rendell clearly relishes the national attention, but he's sincere when he says that it wasn't solicited. "Frankly, it makes me a little sheepish," he says. "We're not doing anything that, say, Rich Daley hasn't done in Chicago, but he's just a self-effacing guy, and we did it all at once."
Rendell's near apotheosis is all the more striking in view of the depths to which he had fallen a few short years ago. In 1986, after completing two terms as District Attorney, he was defeated in the Democratic primary for Governor of Pennsylvania. The next year, he challenged Mayor W. Wilson Goode in the primary and lost again. "I wasn't sure whether or not I was done," he says of his political career.
But he couldn't let go of the idea of making one more run. Something of a policy wonk before the term was coined, and convinced that many of Philadelphia's problems stemmed from gross mismanagement, he spent three years studying the solutions of other mayors and governors, many of them from the nonideological "Reinventing Government" school of cost-cutting and efficiency. (A copy of David Osborne and Ted Gaebler's opus "Reinventing Government" is one of three books in Rendell's office, but he says he hasn't read it.)
As the 1991 mayoral election neared, it became apparent that there would be more than one black candidate running for the Democratic nomination -- extremely significant in a city where the race card is always on the table. "I'd never rest if I didn't try it one more time," Rendell says.
As it turned out, there were three black candidates (as well as one other white), and Rendell was 15 points ahead in the polls. He used the breathing room, which continued through the general election, to conduct what amounted to a yearlong civics-seminar-cum-reality-check for Philadelphia's citizens, preparing them for the bitter medicine he had in mind.
"I was determined to tell people what I planned to do," he says. "If they didn't want it, I was reconciled to not winning. But we did some focus groups, and people felt things were so bad that they were ready to accept almost anything that sounded rational."
Rendell got 68 percent of the vote. He hit the ground sprinting, concentrating all his formidable energy, inventiveness and persuasiveness on ways to get the city back on its fiscal feet. He instituted "competitive contracting," in which private contractors bid against city agencies, for many city services. So far, 19 services have been privatized, including custodial services at City Hall, food service in Philadelphia jails and horseshoeing for police horses; 26 more are on the drawing board.
Most dramatically, some nine months into office, Rendell offered unionized city workers a contract that froze wages for 33 months, cut paid holidays and sick days and shifted control of health plans from the unions to the city. The unions struck, hoping for public support. They did not get it. Sixteen hours later, they accepted the city's offer.
Savings would total an estimated $374 million over four years. And Rendell had the perfect sound bite, should he need one, for his 1995 campaign: "I stared down the unions."
AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT he did for the city's balance sheet is what he did for its mood. When Rendell was inaugurated, Philadelphia had not yet healed the psychic wounds suffered on a May day in 1985 when, with the consent of the Police Commissioner, the Fire Commissioner and Mayor Goode, a police helicopter dropped a bomb on a West Philadelphia row house occupied by the radical group Move and set in motion a chain of events that ended in the deaths of six adults and five children.
"People forget that in Wilson's first year and a half he did some great things," Rendell says. "But after Move, he was never the same." The city's first black mayor, Goode always had the guardedness of many pioneers. But the Move tragedy turned him into, in the words of a political associate, "the man who couldn't laugh."
By contrast, Rendell has a high-energy, kibitzing, informal but sometimes inspirational style. And he seems to be constantly in motion, barreling into a room like a runaway bowling ball or tooling through the city in his Ford Crown Victoria. His first year in office, he was everywhere -- doing cannonball dives into city swimming pools, stopping in at three, four or five events during a single lunch hour (Rendell will appear before virtually any group that asks him, with the stipulation that he never stays for lunch), even being (famously) photographed scrubbing a City Hall toilet. The director Jonathan Demme was so impressed that, while filming "Philadelphia," he turned the camera on Rendell, explained the situation of the scene and told him to be mayoral. Rendell's first-take improvisation is in the finished film.
He's like Frank Rizzo (but without the bluster) or Ed Koch (without the sneer) -- a Mayor who in some ineffable way defines a city at a certain point in its history. In Rendell's case, a significant component is his Upper West Side directness and verve, exotically appealing traits to the notoriously insular Philadelphians. (His father, who died when Rendell was 14, was a middleman in the garment trade; his mother, still a Manhattanite, was born a Sloat, a family famous for its line of women's skirts.)
Rendell is almost as popular in Philadelphia as he is in the nation's newsrooms, but, after a two-year honeymoon, he has taken some political hits in the city lately. A Federal judge recently ruled that a Democratic candidate for State Senator won an election last year because of fraudulent absentee ballots; Rendell, who had repeatedly dismissed the allegations as no big deal, came out tarnished. Early this month, a ballot proposition to significantly alter the city's charter -- strongly supported by the Mayor -- was defeated 6 to 1. The roster of constituencies that are upset with him has grown to include many residents of the city's outlying neighborhoods (who tend to feel that he's more concerned with Center City) and preservationists, who have criticized his commitment to protecting historic buildings.
"Nothing gets me madder than preservationists," Rendell says. "Arts groups are almost as bad, but at least they produce some income. Preservationists don't produce anything."
Rendell has described himself as "the ultimate fraternity guy," and it was his sense of the world as a keg party that led to the closest thing to a scandal his administration has known: an article in the April issue of Philadelphia magazine describing the (married) Mayor's "humorous" propositioning of the writer, a 33-year-old woman. The local press had a good time with it all, the Philadelphia Daily News headlining one of its many reports "Fresh Prince of the City."
By being rather eloquently apologetic at a news conference the day after the story broke, the Mayor managed to minimize (for the time being) the fallout from the incident. "I'm not perfect," he said. "I'm not a saint. I have foibles and failings like everyone else. People who expect their elected officials or their business leaders or their sports figures to be perfect human beings, they're in for a rude surprise."
Rendell has been mentioned as a possible candidate for national office. Even if he's re-elected, his term as Mayor will be up just in time for the New Hampshire primary in 2000. He himself downplays the possibility: "My guess is Jews may be the last substantial minority represented on a national ticket. And when was the last time there was a mayor who was a viable candidate?" But if he ever does run, he doesn't think the Philadelphia magazine flap will be a problem: "Bill Clinton got elected with stuff that was 20 times worse."
ED RENDELL'S FATHER'S IDEA OF a great politician was Adlai Stevenson, which helps explain why Rendell says he takes no satisfaction from being known as the Mayor Who Balanced the Budget and Broke the Unions, why the analogy to Republicans like Giuliani and Riordan goes only so far. When he's not using the sinking ship metaphor, he likes this one: He took office as the doctor of a patient with cancer and a bullet wound to the chest. He took care of the bullet wound. Now comes the hard part.
And so, with the city's fiscal house in order, Rendell has turned his attention to trying to cure the malignant trends, or at least arrest their advance. One facet of his treatment is economic development: convincing existing businesses not to leave the city and prospective ones to set up shop there. Rendell estimates that he spends 75 percent of his time on this effort, a figure borne out by a day spent in the Mayor's company.
One of a half-dozen development meetings starts late in the morning, when Bill Batoff, longtime Democratic fund-raiser and power broker, ushers into the Mayor's office the youthful owner of a 65-employee photo-processing and computer-imaging plant and introduces him to the Mayor. After everyone is seated, the owner, who has a deep tan, starts his pitch: "We've outgrown our present location, but there are certain inherent problems with the city. We've got operations in Miami, and we have to ask ourselves, 'Do we move south to Miami?' Miami's a stepping stone for us."
Meanwhile, Rendell is holding his tongue -- no mean feat for someone as turbocharged as he is. But his fingers are drumming furiously on the round conference table, and his leg is pumping up and down so hard that the table appears to be in jeopardy of tumbling over.
"I grew up in Philadelphia," the fellow goes on. "I want to stay here. But I'm a businessman. I want to do what's responsible for the company. Ed, I'll be blunt. The thought of moving to another location in the city scares me."
When he's done, Rendell gives his pitch. It turns out that the plant is in an area close to one the city hopes will become a Federal empowerment zone, a designation that, among other things, will allow a business to get a $3 million loan at 2 percent interest. Close, but just outside its borders.
Rendell punches up some buttons on his phone. "Can somebody redraw a map maybe?" he asks the staffer at the other end of the line. "See if you can get his block in."
When he hangs up, Rendell tells the guy he should put together a wish list of tax and regulatory breaks, and go through a copy of the empowerment zone legislation. "If there's anything you like, give me a call."
BUT A FEW JOBS HERE AND THERE can get you only so far. Rendell is adamant about not going to Washington or Harrisburg for "handouts" (he almost spits out the word), but he also knows that without outside help, cities like Philadelphia are doomed. He says that when President Clinton's economic stimulus plan was voted down last year, he knew with crushing finality that Philadelphia and other cities could not expect much help from the Federal Government. "There's no money for revenue sharing," he says. "There's no $40 billion available. We might as well ask for $400 billion as 40."
And so he started thinking up ways to "level the playing field, maybe tilt it slightly in our direction, but without a negative budgetary impact on the Federal Government."
"Here's an example: The Defense Department currently has something called the D.F.A.S. -- the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. It's in locations scattered around the country, and the Defense Department has wisely decided to consolidate. I would have the President say that in these types of relocation decisions, the preference should always go to available sites in distressed urban areas."
Rendell also wants Washington to institute "urban impact statements," modeled after environmental impact statements, which would scrutinize Federal moves for possibly harmful effects on cities. And, convinced that regionalization -- that is, fiscal cooperation between a city and its suburbs -- in some form is the only hope for cities in the 21st century, he wants the Government to offer incentives to areas that get with the program.
"That kind of favoritism is a dangerous path," cautions David Osborne. "Soon there'll be rural impact statements and suburban impact statements and minority impact statements, and another kind of minority impact statement."
In March, Rendell packaged his ideas into a 13-point plan he calls the New Urban Agenda and presented it during a private meeting at the White House with the President and the Vice President. After 40 minutes of vintage Rendell salesmanship, the two leaders offered no commitments, but their general seal of approval. In parting, Gore cracked, "Too bad you didn't have any ideas today, Ed."
At the National Press Club, Rendell isn't getting the response he wants. The capital is a place where things are done in traditional ways, and the New Urban Agenda is too different -- it's not about a candidate, or pending legislation, or (obvious) political advancement. It's just ideas.
Rendell himself seems a little subdued, as if cowed by the singularity of the forum. Fortunately, he knows that his vision won't live or die with the coverage of today's speech. This morning he met with H.U.D. Secretary Henry Cisneros, a longtime ally, and with Robert Rubin, a top White House economic policy adviser, who told him, Rendell reported afterward, that he liked a lot of his ideas and wanted to help get them through.
After the news conference breaks up, Rendell latches on to one reporter, a bespectacled fellow in a tan suit who's asked what happens to be the $64,000 question: in essence, Why does Rendell think Congress and the Administration will commit to showing this kind of favoritism toward the cities?
"I can show you study after study that if cities slide down the tubes, suburban areas go right down with them," Rendell says. "So it does make a difference."
He is gesticulating strenuously, jabbing his finger at the reporter, who looks as if he just wants to go back to his cubicle. But Rendell is finally on a roll, and he doesn't want to stop.
"See, what you just said is the problem in this country today. I mean, isn't it a little embarrassing when a foreign correspondent comes to America and you have to take them to maybe a few designated areas and try to keep them away from the rest of the city? You can walk 10 minutes from the Capitol and see disgraces. And see disgraces. So it is a matter of national policy, and -- I'm not blaming you -- what you've expressed is one of the reasons we're here, because people don't understand."
At this point the reporter manages to say thanks and sidle away. Rendell looks around, searching for someone else to convince. But the room is empty. There's nowhere else to go but home.

HEADLINE: Slashing Youth Programs Will Only Feed the Crime Problem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a crime-preoccupied city, which has not made a dent in violent crime by juveniles (up 80 percent since 1988), where a 1992 New York City-Federal survey found 20 percent of high school students admitting they carried a weapon, and where homicide is the leading cause of death for those younger than 25, any proposal to eliminate youth recreational, job training and summer employment programs is irresponsible. The Giuliani administration's plans to slash Safe Streets, Safe City youth programs would be a costly mistake socially, politically and economically. 
 When doors to adaptive pathways are shut in the faces of kids while allocations for police and prisons swell unimpeded, conditions are created for more minority youth to join the nearly 25 percent of young African-American men whose lives are entwined with the criminal justice system. Most commonly, they have participated as consumers or peddlers in epidemic self-mismedication with misery-numbing psychoactive substances. Just as large pharmaceutical companies profit handsomely from the 9 million Americans who use such a middle-class euphoriant as Prozac, so too do impoverished, undereducated, and undersupervised young inner-city entrepreneurs enjoy big, easy sales in anti-despondents.
Tragically, inner-city drugs contribute directly and indirectly to the approximately 8,000 murders of African-Americans annually in the United States, fully 90 percent committed by African-Americans. For impoverished communities, the drug-war-created black market is far more lethal than drugs themselves.
Beyond restoring to the budget the money designated for elimination, we need more investment in counseling, recreational, educational and vocational training services for our most vulnerable of children and teen-agers
Open public school facilities during the evenings and summers, build more extensive links with the private sector for internship and mentoring programs, and make certain every at-risk adolescent is known to, and seen at least weekly by, a school guidance counselor. Without such steps, New York is perilously close to becoming a city that, as Richard Murphy, former Youth Services commissioner, put it, "can guarantee a child a jail cell, but not an after-school program."

HEADLINE: Vietnam Revisited: A periodic report.;
Security Tactics in Vietnam Still Inspire Widespread Fear

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
The terror of arbitrary arrests, secret trials and penal servitude that gripped Vietnam in the decade after "liberation" has begun to fade against the glare of the nation's economic dawn. But fear still casts a subtle shadow over this long-suffering country.
By 1988 Vietnam's Communist leaders began a struggle to improve their nation's image and attract desperately needed foreign investment. It is believed that by then, all but a few hundred of the tens of thousands of political prisoners held in the country's network of prison camps had been freed. 
 But although overt opposition to the Government is quiescent, the police still make midnight calls on sleeping families, and an unlucky suspect can expect to spend up to a year in jail before being tried. Political trials, which are closed to foreign observers, still result in long prison sentences for such vaguely defined crimes as "counterrevolutionary propaganda." Prudent citizens choose their words carefully, even in casual conversation.
For some, the stress of uncertainty has proved insuperable.
The proprietor of a leather-goods store in this city, which many people still refer to as Saigon, told a visitor that two of his brothers had recently committed suicide, fearing that they were about to be re-arrested and sent for another term in a "re-education camp" or one of the "new economic zones" set up immediately after the war -- Vietnam's equivalent of Siberian gulags. The family was friendly with many American customers before the fall of Saigon in 1975, and like many Vietnamese with American contacts, they were subjected by the Communists to severe hardships.
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, PEN American Center, the Catholic and Buddhist churches and the State Department, among other organizations, are sharply critical of Vietnam's disregard of Western perspectives on human rights. But criticism makes Hanoi bristle.
Le Mai, Deputy Foreign Minister for American affairs, said in an interview that "foreigners who come here to press their ideas about human rights on Vietnam are not welcome." Another Government representative was asked for an interview with Doan Thanh Liem, a lawyer serving a 12-year sentence for associating with a privately sponsored American relief project known as the Shoeshine Boys that helped street urchins. He replied, "Human rights questions are very delicate, and your request is unwelcome."
The Communists overturned society in South Vietnam when they conquered the country in 1975, and deep scars remain.
Most of the hundreds of thousands who had served in South Vietnam's armed forces were sentenced to terms of up to 13 years in the re-education camps, where duties included breaking rocks and clearing mine fields.
Owners of shops or land were thrown into the streets, and their belongings were confiscated. In some cases they were shipped to the "new economic zones" -- drought-stricken wilderness in the scrub jungles of Song Be Province and similar regions -- where they were expected to farm and to feed themselves.
Foreign critics of the Government acknowledge that some of those arrested have been terrorists, who are not considered "prisoners of conscience."
Early last year the police arrested 18 overseas Vietnamese who returned to Vietnam and were accused of plotting to set off bombs in the country. The defendants, who included several United States citizens, were sentenced to terms ranging from 15 to 20 years. The State Department, hoping to protect the prisoners' legal rights, has asked for access to all United States citizens arrested in Vietnam.
 
Buddhist Monks Seen as Challenge
 Vietnam's Communist Party sees a much greater potential challenge to its authority from some of the nation's Buddhist monks, and the Government has responded vigorously. Hanoi is aware that most Vietnamese are at least nominal Buddhists, and even under Communism, Buddhist monks have immense influence.
One year ago, exactly 30 years after Buddhist monks began a campaign that ended in the overthrow and death of President Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, a new generation of monks threw a scare into the Hanoi Government. The episode began in May 1993, when a man entered the Linh Mu pagoda in Hue, set himself on fire and burned to death.
The incident recalled the fiery 1963 protest suicide of the monk Thich Quang Duc in Saigon, an incident that ignited a nationwide wave of unrest.
After last year's immolation, the Hue police tried to arrest the pagoda's chief monk, Thich Tri Tuu, but the arrival of the police at the pagoda prompted a large anti-Government demonstration.
Thich Tri Tuu and three other monks were charged with inciting the demonstration, and all were convicted. Thich Tri Tuu and Thich Hai Tang received four-year sentences, and Thich Hai Chanh and Thich Hai Thinh were each sentenced to three years.
[A chain of informants that reaches into the prison camps has kept track of the imprisoned monks, and on May 14, the International Buddhist Information Bureau in Gennevilliers, France, reported that all four were "dangerously ill" as a result of a hunger strike, and were being fed intravenously. The Government said that the monks were not being mistreated and that their hunger strike was unjustified.]
 
Many Monks Feel Intimidated
 A visit to several Buddhist monks who were active in the 1963 insurrection against the Saigon Government found them intimidated and fearful of arrest.
"Because I have known you for three decades," one of them said, "I couldn't turn you away, but please don't mention that you have seen me. The police watch this pagoda all the time. Monks from Hue and Vung Tau are in prison now, and many others could be arrested tomorrow, even though we have done nothing. You can't help any of us, except by remaining silent."
Rolando Medina, the Vietnam specialist on the staff of the London-based human rights organization Amnesty International, said Vietnam's monks have little freedom of action.
"The leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich Huyen Quang, has been under house arrest since 1982, and we regard him as a prisoner of conscience, even though he is not formally imprisoned," Mr. Medina said. The Government banned the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam in 1981, and has tried to replace it with a Government creation, the Vietnam Buddhist Church.
Last December, despite his house arrest, Thich Huyen Quang issued a statement in which he asked the Government to abandon the one-party system and hold elections. But the national leader of Vietnam's Buddhists remains confined and isolated in his pagoda.
The Government also exercises control over the Catholic priesthood here, and has asserted a right to veto Vatican appointments of archbishops in Vietnam.
 
Attention Demanded By Rights Group
 Some of the human rights cases taken up by Human Rights Watch/ Asia, an organization based in Washington, demand urgent attention, officials of the group say.
On March 7, Nguyen Van Ho, a former Communist Party cadre and founder of a Vietcong veterans' group, was arrested at his home here. According to Dinah PoKempner, a spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch, Mr. Ho is believed to have been arrested for writing and distributing an article urging party leaders to permit greater freedom of expression and to restore human rights in Vietnam. Family members have not heard from him since his arrest, she said.
Two other political prisoners championed by international human rights organizations are Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, an endocrinologist sentenced to 20 years for calling publicly for democratic reforms, and Doan Viet Hoat, an English professor who published an underground newsletter, who drew a 15-year sentence. According to his wife, Mr. Hoat began a hunger strike in early April, and although he is in poor health, he is compelled to work on a punitive hard-labor gang.
During a visit to Vietnam in August, Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia tried to bring medicine needed by Dr. Que to the prison camp where he was held, but he was rebuffed by Vietnamese officials.
Human rights groups also fear that the forcible repatriation of some 60,000 Vietnamese emigres now in prison camps in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan will bring further misery to many thousands.
 
Pervasive Control Not Always Harsh
 Although the hand of Hanoi's Communist authority presses heavily on some Vietnamese, many others find Government influence ubiquitous but not necessarily harsh.
"We haven't had any real trouble with the police or the District People's Committee," said a shopkeeper in a Mekong River delta town, "but sometimes we get called in by the police, which is always frightening. Lately the police have been encouraging some of us to write to relatives who are living abroad, to invite them to visit Vietnam. Naturally, the police know very well which of us have Viet Kieu relatives."
Viet Kieu, or overseas Vietnamese, of whom there are about one million, are regarded by Hanoi as Vietnamese citizens, regardless of what other citizenship they hold.
Many Vietnamese say that the 19 years that have elapsed since the end of the Vietnam war have softened the harsh Marxist-Leninist cast of government, and that even a certain degree of criticism is tolerated. One public figure who is permitted some freedom of expression is Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a Harvard-educated economist and one-time Deputy Prime Minister of the South Vietnamese Government, who remained in Vietnam when Saigon fell in 1975.
Dr. Oanh, now an adviser to the Hanoi Government on economics and trade, is no respecter of ideology, and he believes that Communism for many party leaders is a doctrine of faith rather than a political system.
"When any religious group challenges the Government, the Government naturally reacts," he said. "What would you expect? For some party members, Communism is a kind of religion. When they are challenged by leaders of another religion, they feel threatened on their own terms."
Another southern Vietnamese believes that time will heal Vietnam's wounds. "The old guard, both persecutors and their victims, are dying off or growing senile," he said. "Little by little, Vietnam is rejoining the world, and our children or grandchildren will know better times."

HEADLINE: Haiti's Generals Remain Defiant As a Strict Embargo Takes Effect

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 22

 BODY:
As a sweeping international embargo took effect here today, Haiti's military leaders appeared to be resolved to ride out the sanctions, convinced that the United States would not mount an armed intervention to unseat them.
The broadened embargo, pushed by a Clinton Administration that has been increasingly exasperated by the Haitian military, covers all trade with the country except for medicines and certain foods. A United Nations ban on shipments of fuel and arms has been in place since October. 
 The action is aimed at forcing the military to surrender power and make way for the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Five American naval vessels and a number of Coast Guard cutters are patrolling the waters around Haiti to enforce the embargo, but the smuggling of fuel from the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has remained active.
Even in backing the wider embargo, which was enacted by the Security Council to go into effect at midnight Saturday, the Administration acknowledged that the measure might not be enough to bring about Father Aristide's return. In recent weeks, Administration officials, including Mr. Clinton, have said the use of force in Haiti should not be ruled out.
Haiti's military leaders have defiantly used the two-week grace period between the Security Council's unanimous vote on May 6 and the application of the sanctions to put together a new civilian government, naming an 81-year-old Supreme Court Justice, Emil Jonassaint, as provisional president.
People close to the military junta say that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army commander who presided over the coup that ousted Father Aristide in September 1991, has been busy working on plans for new elections to be held in the fall.
The new sanctions took effect when a midnight deadline passed and the military leaders did not step down. Rather than resign to defuse the crisis, associates of General Cedras say, he is contemplating a run for the presidency himself, and would be replaced in the army command by his closest aide, Gen. Philippe Biamby.
The United States and the United Nations have insisted that both men, along with the Port-au-Prince police chief, Col. Joseph Michel Francois, relinquish their commands.
"The military leadership has been meeting quite a bit, and they have decided that all of this noise out of Washington is just bull," said one Haitian businessman with extensive army contacts. "If Cedras decides to resign, it won't be because he is bowing in the face of all of the heat, but because he wants to become president."
In the last days before the deadline, workers at the army-controlled port here labored furiously to unload cargo ships carrying essential goods aimed at enabling the country's leadership to hang on to power .
At the same time, the army took the precaution of stockpiling large amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel smuggled in from the Dominican Republic.
 
Help From Next Door
 Haitian political analysts say that a potentially explosive dispute in the Dominican Republic over the results of the presidential election held there last week has further strengthened the Haitian Army in its resolve not to surrender power.
These analysts believe that the United States would be reluctant to have both countries on this island plunged into crisis, and therefore would soft-pedal demands that the Dominican Republic enforce the embargo against Haiti, at least until a controversy over who won the Dominican election blows over.
It took nearly two months to end a similar election controversy in the Dominican Republic in 1990. Haitian political analysts said a delay like that in settling the current dispute would be of vital help to the army, because few believe that the international community can allow total economic sanctions on Haiti, already the poorest country in the hemisphere, to remain in place for long.
 
The Hard Line
 Asked if the military would consider any negotiated return of Father Aristide to power, bringing an end to the sanctions, Bernard Sansaricq, a conservative politician who is closely allied to the Haitian Army, said:
"This is something in your mind, not in ours. We don't discuss how to lift the embargo, we discuss how to manage it.
"Do whatever you want, and we will do whatever we have to to survive. Eventually we will win."
For some here, convinced that the army leadership is eager to find a face-saving way out, talk like this is reminiscent of the bluster of the former dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier. Just days before he fled into exile on a special American plane, Mr. Duvalier scoffed at reports that he would surrender power, boasting that he was "strong as a monkey's tail."
A former Haitian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the top army leaders, "There is a lot of tough talk, but I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys leaving just like Jean-Claude."
But others say another historical parallel, this one involving the originator of the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, is more apt. "In 1963 we were confronted with a very similar situation," said Kern Delince, an exiled former Haitian colonel who has written extensively on the country's army. "All of the diplomacy in the world failed to impress Francois Duvalier, and the United States decided to intervene. The island was surrounded with ships and the plans were all drawn up, but at the last minute the decision was canceled."
After 32 months of success in measuring Washington's resolve, Mr. Delince said, Haiti's army leadership is convinced that no intervention will take place, and nothing short of military action will change their minds. "They feel that the United States is still ambivalent toward Aristide, and as long as that is the case, no embargo is going to get them to leave," he said.

SMUGGLERS ENJOY BRISK TRADE
 MALPASSE, Haiti, May 22 (AP) -- Smugglers made a mockery of a toughened embargo on Haiti today, shipping in hundreds of gallons of gasoline and diesel oil from the Dominican Republic. Armed Haitian soldiers stood by and watched.
Eight hours after new United Nations sanctions took effect, boats loaded down with fuel crossed Saumatre Lake from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Boats docked every five minutes, with the four or five people aboard unloading the fuel in 5- and 10-gallon jugs to black marketeers on the Haitian side.
Haitian border guards and armed civilian auxiliaries allowed the fuel to be loaded onto vehicles headed to the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Gasoline that sells for $1.60 a gallon in the Dominican Republic goes for $8 a gallon in Port-au-Prince, with the Dominican and Haitian militaries pocketing much of the difference.

New Flavors for Readers of Food Magazines

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Saveur, a lush new magazine for people with sophisticated tastes in food, enters the burgeoning field of epicurean food magazines this week. A creme de la creme publication in every sense, it not only aims at the top end of the market but also tosses away concerns about calories and fat.
"Enjoy food. Stop worrying about it. Trust your palate and your heart," writes Dorothy Kalins in the editor in chief's letter in the first issue. 
 Saveur, which loosely translates from French as "savor" and is pronounced sah-VERR, is published by Meigher Communications under a licensing agreement with Bonnier, the Swedish media conglomerate that publishes Saveurs in France. Virtually all the editorial content in the American edition (which drops the final "s" because the name was thought to be confusing enough without it) will be original.
 
New Territory
 Saveur and Fine Cooking, a magazine introduced by the Taunton Press earlier this year and aimed at a similar audience, are staking out new ground. The two are deliberately taking the opposite circulation strategy from the hugely successful seven-year-old Cooking Light, a Time Inc. magazine that is aimed at a more general readership.
Cooking Light, with its healthy approach to food, broke through the one million mark in circulation two years ago and is rising to the top of the category. Bon Appetit is still the official leader, according to the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, but probably not for long. Cooking Light has said it will raise the circulation it guarantees to advertisers to 1.2 million in September from the current one million, while Bon Appetit has cut back its guarantee to one million from 1.2 million.
While the category leaders, which also include Gourmet and Food & Wine, go for big numbers, Saveur and Fine Cooking have decided that less is more -- in circulation if not in calories. They are going after affluent baby boomers who have a real interest in food and are ready to devote time and energy to its preparation. Both magazines have starting circulations of 100,000.
"If people who make specialty food products are looking for upscale customers, there is a growing interest in baby boomers as they grow up," said Martin Landey, chairman of Cox-Landey & Partners, an advertising agency. "Saveur is beautifully done."
Saveur has been able to attract nonfood advertisers including Mercedes-Benz and Sotheby's.
 
Food Advertising Only
 Fine Cooking, however, accepts only advertising related to cooking.
"We feel that we have a specialty audience and that they are buying us for cooking and food," Jan Wahlin, its publisher and editor, said.
Fine Cooking is very much in the spirit of other Taunton Press publications, which include specialty magazines for woodworkers, home builders and people who enjoy sewing and gardening. The new magazine, Mr. Wahlin said, is about the how and the why of cooking. While Saveur has features on the regional cooking of Oaxaca and Provence, Fine Cooking is more likely to examine how a master chef prepares a certain dish.
Both magazines are relatively expensive: Saveur has a cover price of $5 and Fine Cooking is $4.95. Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, Gourmet and Cooking Light are all priced at $2.95.
After its first issue, Saveur will be published every two months beginning in September. Fine Cooking is also published six times a year.
 
 
Kitchens and Flower Gardens
 The traditional Big Three of the field -- Bon Appetit, Food & Wine and Gourmet -- are monthlies that have tried to be more than food magazines. All three offer handsome photographs of beautifully prepared food and gleaming kitchens, but their pages may also include scenes of sunlit fields, church spires and brilliant flower gardens in faraway lands. Travel is an important topic for each magazine.
Indeed, Food & Wine's cover article for May is "The Best of Paris," while Bon Appetit features "The French Countryside."
 These three magazines, along with Cooking Light and Eating Well, are all down in advertising so far this year, an indication that despite the hopeful talk from publishers, the industry has not quite recovered from its recession.
 
Bon Appetit's Ad Woes
 The advertising drop is most noticeable at Bon Appetit, where ad pages are off 51.7 percent for the year through April. Much of the decline, however, can be attributed to its new rate policies. When Conde Nast acquired the magazine from Knapp Communications last year, it revised the ad rules to conform with its corporate policy of only selling ad pages at stated rates and not making special deals off the rate card. Some mass-market food advertisers defected.
Food & Wine, published by a partnership of American Express and Time Inc., was down 2.5 percent in ad pages through April, while Gourmet, also published by Conde Nast, was down 11.1 percent.
While the Big Three include some mentions of healthy cooking, they are more likely to feature praline pecan tarts and apricot jalousie with amaretto cream. But low-fat approaches to cooking are found throughout the pages of two other magazines -- Cooking Light and Eating Well.
 
Accent on Health
 Eating Well, published six times a year by Telemedia Communications Inc., offers healthy recipes for chocolate chip cookies and low-calorie but creamy cheesecakes.
"We're targeting the baby-boom generation and a lot of our readers are moving into prime heart-attack time," Deborah DuCharme, the associate publisher, said.
Cooking Light, in the words of its publisher, Jeffrey C. Ward, is "more mainstream, more middle America -- that's where we want to be." It publishes eight issues a year.
Another relative newcomer to the field is Cook's Illustrated, which differs from the others in that it does not carry advertising. It is like a Consumer Reports for cooks in that it tests cookware, kitchen equipment and -- most of all -- recipes.
"Instead of hiring food experts to do their versions of recipes, we will take a category and go into the kitchen for two to five days and cook as many versions as we can," said Christopher Kimball, the magazine's editor and publisher and one of its four owners.
For a recent article, Cook's Illustrated roasted 32 turkeys, then described what techniques worked best. In a coming issue, it will report on test results of 44 pie pastry recipes. It will also discuss how to boil an egg.
"We are a magazine about the process of cooking," Mr. Kimball said. "We are about American home cooking and how people cook at home."
The four partners began the magazine in mid-1993 with an investment of $500,000, which Mr. Kimball said was returned by the end of the year. The magazine, which carries mostly black-and-white photography and many diagrams, gets its revenue from circulation. Its cover price is $4.95 and a one-year subscription, for six issues, costs $24.95.
Asked if there was a downside to not carrying advertising, Mr. Kimball replied, "There may be, but I haven't found it."

HEADLINE: Alec Nove,78, Dies; British Economist and Critic of Soviets

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Alec Nove, a Russian-born British economist and longtime critic of the Soviet system, died on May 15 in a hospital in Voss, Norway. He was 78 and lived in Glasgow.
The cause was a heart attack he suffered while vacationing in Norway, his son David said. 
 Professor Nove taught at the University of Glasgow from 1963 until he retired in 1982, and also headed its Institute for Soviet and East European Studies. He taught at the London School of Economics from 1958 to 1963.
Summing up his career on Friday in the British newspaper The Independent, Tam Dalyell, a British author and Labor Party figure, wrote, "Nove tutored informed opinion about the Soviet Union for 30 years."
Professor Nove's books included "An Economic History of the U.S.S.R." (Viking Penguin, 1969) and "The Soviet Economic System" (Unwin Hyman, 1977).
His 1989 book, "Glasnost in Action: Cultural Renaissance in Russia" (Unwin Hyman), was praised in the United States as a helpful and compassionate Baedeker for the bumpy road of glasnost and perestroika, no matter what unpredictable turn they might take.
In a 1976 article, Professor Nove wrote that the prospects for Soviet agriculture were bleak unless the peasants were "again made to feel a direct interest in the result of their work." He added, "In five years' time there will still be shortages, and Soviet leaders will still be worrying about how to improve the performance of this, the weakest sector of the Soviet economy."
He was a fellow of the British Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
Professor Nove was born Aleksandr Novakovsky in Petrograd, Russia, now St. Petersburg. He was the son of Jacob Novakovsky, a social democratic Menshevik who moved to London with his family in 1924.
He is survived by his wife and three sons.

Garbage haulers are attracting new followers on Wall Street.

BYLINE: By John Holusha 

 BODY:
TRASH is making a comeback, and that is good news for companies like WMX Technologies Inc., the nation's biggest collector, hauler and disposer of refuse, with revenues of $9.1 billion last year.
Trash, after all, is cyclical. During a recession, households and business buy less and throw out less. That was bad news until recently for WMX, formerly known as Waste Management Inc., because there was less material to be handled and because it was forced to trim prices to keep business from being diverted to competitors. 
 As a result, income per share fell to 93 cents in 1993 from $1.72 the previous year and the stock price slid from a high of $36.375 last June to around $23 in April. It has recovered a bit since, closing at $25.875 on Friday, but there has been little to inspire investors, particularly when first-quarter earnings came in at 34 cents a share, down 17 percent from 41 cents a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
But trash, it seems, is something of a lagging indicator, with volume starting to increase six to nine months after the economy begins to expand.
As a result, some analysts see a turnaround for the company because, while it has diversified internationally and into other technologies, it still derives the bulk of its revenues and earnings from the trash business in the United States.
Some analysts, including Andrew M. Barish of Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, have issued buy recommendations on WMX. Mr. Barish said his recommendation was based on a turn in the fundamental business and some internal changes. He said the stock had the potential to trade at $35 a share in the next 12 to 18 months.
 "The business is the best that it has been in three years," he said. The volume of trash handled by the company increased 6 percent in the first quarter, and WMX was able to hold the line on pricing or increase it slightly. That compares with a price decline of 1 percent toward the end of last year.
"They also did some internal things, dealing with some underperforming divisions and closing some recycling facilities," Mr. Barish said. As a result of the changes and the likelihood of improving earnings, he said the market's expectations for WMX might be too low.
Selling or closing operations is new for WMX, which grew by acquiring small trash-hauling operations and using them as feeders for its large, regional landfills. These big, lined landfills are rapidly replacing town dumps, which are being closed because of environmental regulations.
Browning-Ferris Industries, a company usually mentioned in the same breath as WMX, will also benefit from larger volumes of trash. But at a price of $28.125 a share, its stock is near the 52-week high of $30.25 set in February, so it does not appear to have as much potential to appreciate.
A less-known company, Sanifill Inc., a Houston-based operator of landfills that has recently moved into collection as well, may prove more interesting to investors.
In a recent report, Alex. Brown & Sons noted that the company had been following a strategy of building and acquiring landfills to accept municipal solid waste, construction and demolition debris and nonhazardous oilfield waste. Growth has been rapid, with revenues increasing to $121 million last year from $39 million in 1990. Earnings increased to $13 million from $7.7 million.
The analysts at Alex. Brown say Sanifill can probably increase earnings 20 percent a year for two years, reaching $1.35 a share from 87 cents in 1993. At that level, the analysts said, the stock should trade in a range of $24 to $27 a share. Sanifill shares closed Friday at $22.75 each, down 75 cents.

HEADLINE: Republicans Open Convention Today

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
New York's Republican State Committee gathers at a Manhattan hotel today for an old-fashioned convention where back-room deals and last-minute lobbying may have much to do with the party's chances of defeating Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in November.
It is widely assumed that the 394-member committee will give State Senator George E. Pataki a majority of its votes, making him the designated gubernatorial candidate of the party apparatus. But the size of Mr. Pataki's victory may determine whether he must survive a tough primary before turning his attention to Mr. Cuomo and whether he will be the consensus choice of both the Republican and Conservative Parties. 
 The convention will also sort out the rest of the Republican ticket. Bernadette Castro, a political novice who appeared in advertisements for her father's convertible sofa-beds as a child, is the leading candidate to challenge Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But decisions on lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller all remain open, and are likely to depend on the outcome of today's gubernatorial balloting.
Aides to Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he would prefer to balance his ticket with a woman as lieutenant governor, and top campaign officials were said to be considering a list of three or four potential candidates, some of them women. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's leading supporter, said he thought the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea of Chenango County, would be "the kind of person we should be considering."
But the aides said Mr. Pataki was unlikely to make a choice until after today's vote, when he could judge whether he needs support in a particular region or an appeal to Conservative Party leaders.
Two candidates, Joseph Holland, a Harlem lawyer and businessman, and Dennis C. Vacco, a former United States Attorney from Buffalo, are running for attorney general. Assemblyman John J. Faso of Columbia County, who has campaigned diligently for close to a year, is favored to win the Republican Party's endorsement for state comptroller.
But party leaders could quickly change the structure of any of those races if they feel it is important to help balance Mr. Pataki's ticket.
It is uncommon in the television age for such decisions to actually be made at political conventions, which usually showcase previously anointed candidates. The uncertainty reflects both the divisiveness within the State Republican Party and its 20-year exile from the governor's office. But party officials believe the unscripted quality of the convention will generate badly needed exposure for a field of little-known candidates.
"I think it's unusual, but I also think it's healthy and good that there will be attention focused on this process," said John Sweeney, the executive director of the Republican State Committee.
The convention's critical moment is scheduled for this afternoon, when delegates meet in a ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers to vote for governor.
After Mr. Pataki, 48, won endorsements last week from the Suffolk and Nassau Republican leaders, who control the two largest delegations to the convention, all sides agreed that the Senator, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature and former Mayor of Peekskill, would take at least 51 percent of the vote. That would make him the party's designee, giving him an automatic spot on the Sept. 13 primary ballot.
But there is great suspense about whether Mr. Pataki is strong enough to keep his main rival, Herbert London, a New York University professor, from receiving 25 percent of the vote. Any candidate that gains that much support will also be placed on the ballot, insuring a primary.
"We're going to get over 50 percent," Mr. Pataki said. "It's just a question of how much we get over 50 percent."
Those who do not reach the ballot at the convention can still join a primary if they collect 15,000 valid signatures on nominating petitions in a five-week period this summer. That can be expensive and complicated, and New York has a cottage industry of election lawyers trained to challenge the validity of petitions by opposing campaigns.
Shutting out Mr. London at the convention is critical for Mr. Pataki for several less obvious reasons.
After running competing gubernatorial candidates and splitting the anti-Cuomo vote in the 1990 general election, the Republican and Conservative parties badly want to unite around a single candidate this year. Although the recession was already taking a toll on Mr. Cuomo's popularity in 1990, he won with 53 percent of the vote, while the Republican candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, won 21 percent, edging out the Conservative nominee, Mr. London, by a single percentage point.
Mr. London has broad grass-roots support within the Conservative Party this year. Although the Conservative chairman, Michael Long, said Mr. Pataki was acceptable to the party, he predicted that the Conservatives would endorse Mr. London at its convention on June 4 if he gets 25 percent of the Republican vote.
"There's no ifs, ands or buts that he's the favorite for the Conservative endorsement," Mr. Long said of Mr. London. "If he breaks 25 percent he'll probably get that endorsement. If he doesn't get the 25, I'll sit down and talk to him and see where he's at."
An overwhelming majority vote would also help Mr. Pataki to create an impression of party unity after months of infighting. A battle between the state's two most influential Republicans -- Senator D'Amato, who supports Mr. Pataki, and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who backs Mr. London, has left the party deeply divided.
Both men have pressed their allies to support their candidates. The Bronx Republican leader, Senator Guy J. Velella, who owes his position as chairman of the Insurance Committee to Mr. Marino, announced yesterday that his county would support Mr. London.
Two other Republicans -- Bill Green, a former Congressman from the Upper East Side, and Evan G. Galbraith, a former Ambassador to France -- plan to compete for the gubernatorial endorsement at the convention. Neither is given much chance of breaking the 25 percent threshold, but both say they will try to get on the ballot by petitioning.
A fifth candidate, Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former state party chairman from Rochester, is bypassing the convention to run an outsider campaign aimed at depicting the selection process as corrupt.
During the convention, Mr. Rosenbaum will broadcast advertisements that ridicule the party. "The bosses pick their man; the convention falls in line," intones a narrator as black-and-white film clips show soldiers marching in lock step. To drive home the point, the Rosenbaum campaign has scheduled a conference today that will feature a puppet show.

HEADLINE: A Wrinkle in the Jet Age: Propeller Planes

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
More than 35 years after jet aircraft first carried passengers and 25 years after the test of the first supersonic Concorde, propeller planes are making a comeback, flying more and more passengers on routes long served by jets.
While the smaller airplanes are considerably less expensive for airlines to operate, many communities fret over the sound of whirring propellers on their runways. Many passengers board propeller planes reluctantly or refuse to fly them at all, unhappy about the relative safety, greater turbulence or lack of amenities. 
 Some cities that have recently lost all their jet service say they have become less attractive to outside businesses.
"It is hard to present ourselves as a state-of-the-art, high-tech company when you have to get on a 19-seat turboprop to get here," said Harry Keairns, vice president of planning and finance for Computer Support of Sioux City, a company in Sioux City, Iowa.
City officials say contracts for conventions planned in the city were canceled or put on hold after United Airlines ended jet service last year. And Mr. Keairns said his company occasionally sent drivers to Omaha, 90 miles away, which has jet service, to pick up clients who did not want to take a propeller flight to Sioux City.
Last year, more than 50 million passengers in the United States flew on propeller aircraft, mostly on regional airlines, on flights of less than 500 miles or two hours. Propeller planes are now widely used in virtually every area of the country, and are common at every major airport from which such short routes are flown.
In the last five years, airlines have replaced jets with propeller planes on at least 375 routes, according to research by Kidder, Peabody & Company. Another 202 routes gained jet service, for a net loss of jet service on 173 routes.
"It's a simple matter of economics," said David A. Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Association, a trade group in Washington. "Carriers are matching the size of the plane to the number of passengers in a particular market."
 
 
Driving to Other Airports
 Airport officials and travel agents in cities that have recently lost jet service, like Sioux City; Springfield, Ill., and Worcester, Mass., say many residents drive to neighboring cities to board jetliners.
"A lot of people don't like the smaller planes because they are slightly less safe," said Michael Berger, an owner of Premier Travel, a travel agency in Sioux City.
Direct comparisons of the safety records of jet aircraft and propeller planes are not compiled by any agency or group, but industry executives generally agree that the rate of accidents resulting in deaths on propeller planes has been two to three times that of jets. Generally, smaller propeller planes have a higher accident rate than the larger ones.
The International Airline Passengers Association, a group in Washington that monitors air safety in foreign countries and provides travel-related services, advises its members to fly on propeller planes only in good weather and daylight hours to minimize the chance of accidents.
Yet Walter S. Coleman, president of the Regional Airline Association in Washington, said the accident rate for propeller aircraft had dropped by two-thirds in the last decade from the previous 10-year period.
The shift toward propeller planes is a result of the airline industry's continuing effort to turn a consistent profit since the industry was deregulated in 1978. In the mid-1980's, airlines started building big hub airports to which they funneled passengers from nearby cities. The airlines assigned jet aircraft to serve many of these feeder routes, thinking they would be needed as demand grew.
 
 
Savings of 20% to 40%
 But after long and steady growth in passenger traffic, demand leveled off, leaving the airlines with too much capacity and years of billion-dollar losses. Over the last four years, the world's major airlines have lost $15.6 billion.
Because jet aircraft are more expensive to operate on shorter flights than propeller planes, airlines in the United States and in countries throughout the world are switching to propeller-driven planes, finding they can reduce operating costs by 20 to 40 percent on a typical route.
How big a difference does a propeller aircraft mean to passengers? Fares generally do not change with a switch to propeller planes, and the travel time is not enormously different. On a flight from LaCrosse, Wis., to Minneapolis, for example, a deHavilland Dash 8 propeller aircraft operated by Mesaba Airlines makes the 120-mile trip in 50 minutes; a DC-9 jet operated by Northwest Airlines takes 42 minutes. Even though jet aircraft have far higher top speeds, short routes often consist of a long takeoff and long landing with just a modest sprint in between.
In some ways, the smaller turboprop planes provide better service, because an airline usually replaces a single jet flight with more frequent service on turboprops, saving passengers considerable waiting time.
The nation's fleet of passenger-carrying turboprops is also somewhat younger than the airlines' jet fleet, with an average age of 9.4 years in 1993, compared with 10.8 years for jetliners.
Manufacturers of propeller planes are trying to narrow the gap between the experience of flying on a jet and traveling on one of their planes. While many commuter planes have 19 seats or fewer, no cabin service and no bathroom, some propeller planes have up to 65 seats or so, and flight attendants who serve food.
To reduce noise -- which is generally greater on turboprops because the planes have less sound-deadening insulation than jets -- manufacturers have added more blades to the propellers or changed their design so that they turn more slowly and are quieter. Most manufacturers of propeller aircraft are based outside the United States, but 40 to 70 percent of the parts for the planes, including the engines and cockpits, are made by American companies like General Electric and Honeywell.
And the differences among pilots are minimal, industry executives say, with comparable experience among jet and propeller pilots, especially those who were recently hired. Minor differences in training requirements for the different planes are expected to be eliminated soon by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But behind the passenger discontent are differences that cannot be erased. Propeller aircraft generally fly at lower altitudes, where turbulence is greater, and passengers feel it more because of the planes' smaller size, much as a speedboat's ride is affected more by waves than a yacht's.
 
As Time, and Rain, Goes By
 And boarding a propeller craft is usually a vivid reminder of what is ahead. Rather than walking down a covered ramp, impervious to wind or precipitation, passengers on a propeller plane may walk outside, past spinning propellers, buffeted by noise and sometimes by inclement weather. Remember Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid walking out to board the Lockheed Electra in "Casablanca"?
The issue of small-aircraft safety was raised anew in December when a plane operated by Northwest Airlink, an affiliate of Northwest Airlines, crashed in icy weather in Hibbing, Minn., killing all 18 passengers. The final results of the investigation into that crash are expected shortly.
Some communities are so fearful that the loss of jet service will curtail economic development that they have guaranteed profits to airlines that continue to provide jets. Amarillo, Tex., for example, decided in March to insure a profit for American Airlines if the airline continued to provide jet service to Dallas, 356 miles away. American had announced that it would switch to propeller planes on that route.
Trans World Airlines and the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority in Allentown, Pa., forged a similar agreement last year. To stem the loss of passengers to airports in Newark and Philadelphia, Allentown's airport had been searching for ways to add to the roughly 25 daily jet departures it offered last year. So, it promised T.W.A. minimum revenues of $5,000 for each round trip between Allentown and Baltimore.
More hope for the fans of jet services comes from aircraft manufacturers like Canadair, based in Montreal, which have started building jet aircraft with as few as 50 seats, enabling airlines to operate jet service at a lower cost.
 
 
Trend Likely to Continue
 Despite the various efforts to retain or restore jet service, the shift to propeller planes is likely to continue, industry analysts say.
"Economics demand that airlines bring their costs down," said Michael J. Boyd, president of the Aviation Systems Research Corporation, a consulting firm in Golden, Colo. "The wave of the future in many markets is going to be turboprops."
That prospect is unsettling to Dennis Gann, executive director of the Sioux City Convention Center and Tourism Bureau. He is in charge of the $16.5 million center built five years ago, which he said had already lost one convention, and might lose others, because his city no longer had jet service. Mr. Gann added that some convention planners said his city would be attractive only if jet service was restored.
"I don't like bouncing around like a cork," said Don Pevsner, a lawyer in Miami who flies more than 100,000 miles annually. He said he avoided flying on propeller-driven planes at all cost and would drive hundreds of miles out of his way to board a jetliner instead.
"Everybody has a certain amount of fear of flying," he said. "Why exacerbate it?"

Hofstra Graduates Hear an Appeal for Love

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., May 22

 BODY:
Before 650 graduates of Hofstra University's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and alumni from the Class of 1944, the newspaper columnist Murray Kempton received an honorary doctorate today for his achievements in a 50-year career in journalism.
Under a cloudless sky, Mr. Kempton, 76, called upon the graduates, who sat in rows of chairs on the college's well-manicured football field, to "love one another or wither." He repeatedly spoke of "family values," which by his definition meant protecting society's weakest members, particularly the elderly and women and children on welfare. 
 Mr. Kempton, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his commentary in Newsday, has also been editor of The New Republic, a commentator for CBS-TV and a columnist for The New York Post.
The afternoon commencement was the largest of seven to be held today and Monday for the university's 1,800 graduates, said James M. Shuart, Hofstra's president. The Class of 1994 is one of the largest in the university's history, he said.
Earlier today, at the commencement for the undergraduate School of Business, the university presented Presidential Medals to Paul B. Townsend, editor and publisher of Long Island Business News, and Frank G. Zarb, a former Hofstra board chairman and vice chairman and group chief executive of Travelers, the insurance company.
The United States Attorney for the Eastern District, Zachary W. Carter, a graduate of Cornell University and the New York University School of Law, is to receive the Presidential Medal, which honors career achievements and leadership, at the evening commencement for the Hofstra Law School on Monday.
At the evening commencement of graduate students of the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the School of Business, the United States Ambassador to Haiti, William L. Swing, received an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Mr. Swing's 30 years of diplomatic service has covered the terms of eight presidents.
Last year's New York State Teacher of the Year, Patricia James-Jordan, is to receive an honorary doctorate on Monday from the Hofstra School of Education.
Dr. Herbert Stein, the economist and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Richard M. Nixon, is to receive an honorary degree from Hofstra's New College.

HEADLINE: Clinton and California: An Economic Policy Clash

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
In 1992, the motto of the Clinton campaign was: "It's the economy, stupid." For the White House aides counting electoral votes for 1996, the theme is: "It's California, stupid."
Those two goals collided on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year, seeking to brake the national economy before its recovery gets too strong and leads to inflation. 
 The problem is that California's recovery has hardly gotten rolling. In California, inflation "would probably be the last thing on your list of things to worry about," said Fred T. Furlong, a vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
California officials are concerned that higher interest rates are likely to hurt the state's economy, especially its huge housing industry. "It is our concern that these increased rates may dampen or depress the beginnings of a modest housing recovery in the state," said Harold D. Palmer, an assistant director of the California Department of Finance.
Administration officials have said they regarded higher interest rates as a necessary evil to fight inflation, something they must accept despite the likely harm to California.
 
White House Is Powerless
 The White House, of course, has little to do with the setting of interest rates, and President Clinton gave the latest round of increases his blessing.
In addition, the Government's current budget policies -- austerity in general, with many cuts in military spending -- hold little to shake California's lingering doldrums. In another sign of that, the Defense Department on Wednesday quietly made available new figures on state-by-state military spending that showed California was shouldering more than its share of the military cuts.
Military spending in California fell 2.5 percent in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, even without adjusting for inflation, while nationwide spending rose 1.5 percent, according to the Pentagon's figures. The comparison did not include contracts worth less than $25,000, which are not tracked by state.
The result is a frustrating situation for the Administration, and one fraught with political peril. California is so important to President Clinton's re-election prospects in 1996 that the number of his visits there dwarf the rest of his travel. He flew to the state again on Friday to rally support in Los Angeles for his Administration and the Democratic Party with speeches and political fund-raising events.
But however crucial Mr. Clinton considers the state, there is a limit to how much he can do to help its economy separately from the rest of the nation's. Interest rates are the preserve of the Fed, and the Administration is determined not to be seen as interfering with its decisions. And the deficit-cutting package the President pushed through last year leaves little room for extra spending to give California a shot in the arm.
 
Safety in Numbers
 The best reason for thinking that the state will not be left to founder is its political importance, one senior Administration official said. "California has one important thing that won't be lost on you: 54 electoral votes," he said.
The White House has made an effort to find something good for President Clinton to announce on each of his trips, even if the aid is small, like the $6.8 million grant for road work at the Norton Air Force Base, which Mr. Clinton visited on Friday. More generally, to help California cope with shrinking military spending, the Administration has already eliminated many controls on exports of computers, which tend to be made in California, and had steered extra Federal education, health care and immigration services money to the state.
Some Administration officials were privately gloomy last week about what recent interest rate increases would mean for California, but all declined to comment because of the Administration's policy of not criticizing the Federal Reserve, which is the nation's central bank.
The only official willing to respond publicly to California's travail over higher interest rates was Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who heads the Administration's California Task Force. He played down the effect of increases in a single-sentence response issued through a spokeswoman.
"California is in the early stages of recovery and the kinds of investment activity that go on during the early stage of a recovery are historically -- and in this case -- not sensitive to interest rate changes, as compared to the types of investment activity that would occur later in a recovery," Mr. Brown said.
Some economists took issue with that optimistic assessment. "I think that's a stretch myself," said William Poole, an economist at Brown University who specializes in monetary policy.
Of all the policy instruments that the Federal Government holds to poke and prod the nation's economy, interest rate increases are the bluntest of all, bludgeoning prosperous and depressed states alike.
 
One National Rate
 "There's really nothing the Federal Reserve can do for regional issues -- nothing," Mr. Poole said. "There's a national money market and the interest rate in San Francisco is the same as in New York."
Larry J. Kimbell, the director of the business forecasting project at the University of California at Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview today: "If we were a separate country, we'd be doing something like Germany, lowering rates out here. Higher interest rates always have some cooling effect on an economy."
When Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913, lawmakers hoped it would be able to help economically depressed regions. The nation's central bank was intended as a federation of 12 regional central banks, each of which had the authority to charge a different interest rate to banks in its region for short-term loans. But after years in which bankers tried to find and take advantage of the lowest interest rate in the country, the Federal Reserve switched in the 1920's to a policy of charging the same rate in each district.
The result is that Federal and state Government budgets must now accommodate Federal Reserve policy, with lower taxes or less regulation, if struggling states are not to suffer from higher interest rates, Mr. Poole said.
 
In the Long Run
 The Federal Reserve's latest increase of short-term rates may hold one small benefit for California. The increase had the effect of bringing down long-term interest rates slightly, including mortgage rates, although the dip has not come close to matching the large increases in short-term rates since February.
The dip could help the California housing market, an important part of the state's economy. "There is a benefit on the other side, as far as allowing the housing industry to continue to recover," said P. Kenneth Ackbarali, a senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
Political analysts say they think that the effect of the interest rate increases might not become apparent for at least six months. If California remains in the doldrums, the question will then become who is to be blamed, the Federal Reserve or the White House or both?
So far, the criticism in California has fallen on the Federal Reserve. Mixing up its "Alice in Wonderland" characters, The Los Angeles Times ran an editorial cartoon on Wednesday depicting Mr. Greenspan as the Mad Hatter exclaiming: "I'm late! I'm late! To raise the interest rate!"

HEADLINE: Treasury Selling Bills and Notes This Week

 BODY:
The Treasury's schedule of financing this week includes today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills and auctions of two-year notes on Tuesday and five-year notes on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Government will sell a new one-year bill.
Traders said that at the close of the New York cash market on Friday the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 4.13 percent, and the rate on the six-month issue was 4.53 percent. In when-issued trading, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.81 percent, the five-year note at a price to yield 6.59 percent and the one-year bill at a price to yield 4.84 percent. 
 In other transactions, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation plans to sell 2.54 billion of consolidated systemwide bonds on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Smoothing Out the Shore's Building Regulations;
New Jersey Officials Reassure Coastline Property Owners About Environmental Rules

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOMS RIVER, N.J., May 20

 BODY:
A spring storm that raged on the Jersey Shore over new environmental laws subsided in the last few days with assurances that the plant police would not be let loose.
Homeowners will not be kept from planting vegetable gardens or rose bushes, the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy said. Nor will they need a special permit in the future to rebuild if lightning or hurricanes strike their homes. And contrary to some interpretations, officials said, people who sweep windblown sand off the street will not face fines of $25,000 a day. 
 So much public heat had been generated that the state felt it was best to put the promises in writing.
Critics of the new rules portrayed the episode as proof of what they had been saying all along: that revisions in the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act, intended to protect the shore from further development, had led to poorly written regulations that gave the state a stranglehold over single-family property owners, especially those with houses within 150 feet of beach dunes, bays and rivers.
 
Law's Enforcers See a Smokescreen
 Individual houses and any commercial real-estate developments with 24 units or fewer were not covered until the 1973 law, widely known as Cafra, was amended last year.
State officials said the uproar over whether a vegetable patch in someone's backyard would lead to Orwellian measures was a smokescreen by developers trying to block the law and keep chewing up the coastal environment. At the least, developers are arguing that the law should not go into effect until next January, instead of July 19 as planned.
State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., Republican of Monmouth, chief architect of last year's overhaul of the law, said the Republican leadership would block attempts to debate a bill that would postpone its effective date until until next year. A similar bill has already passed the Assembly.
"The Cafra reform law was difficult enough to get passed and it's a good law," said Mr. Kyrillos, chairman of the Senate Natural Resources, Trade and Economic Development Committee. "We don't think untrue horror stories and disinformation used by opponents should keep it from taking effect on schedule."
Senator Kyrillos and others who voted for the changes last year concede that Department of Environmental Protection and Energy managers went beyond the intent of the Legislature on several important points when they wrote the rules that will be used to enforce it. The regulations are to be enforced within the coastal zone, a 20-mile wide corridor along the 127-mile coast between Sandy Hook and Cape May, with heavy restrictions on property within 150 feet of beaches, bays and rivers.
"Were the drafters overly aggressive by putting in a number of things they have wanted for a number of years?" he asked. "The answer is yes. But I believe the problem regulations are now being ironed out and will not become law."
 
'Never the Intention'
 In recent days, for example, department officials backtracked on a provision that would have discouraged the landscaping of new single-family homes with nonindigenous plant species. Strictly interpreted, the rule could keep rose bushes, lawns and many varieties of vegetables from being planted.
"It was never the intention of the rule to create plant police," said Mark Mauriello, supervisor in the department's bureau of coastal regulation. To clear the air, and to take some of the heat off, the revised regulation now will state that all single-family homes and duplexes are exempt from the native plant requirement.
Another revised rule will also stipulate that owners of existing beach properties can add patios and decks without a Cafra permit, even when driving pilings into sand dunes, a taboo in the regulations published in February.
In both instances, Mr. Mauriello argued, there were sound environmental reasons behind the original regulations.
Nonindigenous plants often require excessive watering and fertilizers containing nutrients harmful to surrounding waterways, he said. And homes extended into sand dunes weaken natural defenses against flood damage, he added.
 
Increase in Fees Is Predicted
 Assurances like these have not blunted the tone of those who say the regulations represent a heavy-handed power grab by environmentalists and their bureaucratic allies in Trenton who are intent on trampling the rights of waterfront property owners.
"If this deal goes through, the Cafra rules will cost $3,000 on average, probably more, for permits and professional fees each time a house is bought or sold at the shore," said Bradley W. Henson, a Long Beach Island lawyer.
"Like no other state bureaucracy, the D.E.P. gets to keep their permit fees and fines. That's like the state police pocketing the fines from speeding tickets. And they can levy fines up to $25,000 a day."
Mr. Henson, a 32-year-old former football lineman from Georgia, thumped his office desk for emphasis. "I'm not making this up!" he declared. "The bureaucrats want to run us off the barrier islands. The threat of a storm is not enough incentive to get people to pick up and leave, so they're coming at us with legal controls and disincentives that lower the value of private property."
Mr. Henson is also municipal attorney for Surf City, one of a string of resort towns on the bony 18-mile arm of Long Beach Island in southern Ocean County. The Mayor of Surf City is Leonard T. Connors Jr., who is also a powerful Republican voice in the State Senate. Senator Connors, joined by real-estate and development interests, fought unsuccessfully last year to retain provisions of the 1973 law that spared developments with fewer than 25 units near tidal waters from state environmental reviews and restrictions.
 
'For the Public Benefit'
 D. W. Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a Sandy Hook-based coastal conservation group, said the changes were long overdue on a coast that has experienced heavy development for most of its length.
"It's a law designed to help protect public and private property for everyone in the state and not just people at the shore," he said. "Sure, you can pick on a couple of regulations and make the whole thing sound silly, but the overall result is for the public benefit."
Much of the public, it seems, is torn between a general desire for environmental protection and a resentment against overregulation, needless paperwork and mounting permit fees.
Edward Maceiko, an architect from Short Hills who is remodeling his summer home in Normandy Beach, said getting a building permit "is already a difficult task even without new regulations."
"Builders have made great strides in dealing with existing laws like the Wetlands Act and now will have to deal with Cafra," he said, adding that it took him six months to acquire a permit to work on his house.
 
'Trying to Beat the Deadline'
 The approach of the July deadline, and uncertainty over whether it will be pushed into next year, has confused homeowners who are thinking about starting a house or putting up an addition, said Judy Howard, Municipal Clerk for the resort of Beach Haven. "People call us, but we don't know what to tell them. A lot of people who were waiting to build are now trying to beat the deadline."
Perhaps the difficulty of writing new regulations is summed up in the case of John R. Spodofora.
Mr. Spodofora is an environmental engineer who is also on the council in Stafford Township, on the mainland where a causeway leads to Long Beach Island. He and Mayor Carl Block had developed a system to recharge storm water back into the ground instead of letting it run off into Barnegat Bay and other waterways, thus preventing saltwater intrusion.
For his work he was presented with the Theodore Roosevelt Award for conservation in 1990 and nominated by the State Department of Environmental Protection for another national award for excellence, he said. William K. Reilly, then head of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, flew to New Jersey to observe the project, Mr. Spodofora said.
"But when Cafra regulations came out, they discouraged the very kind of system we had set up," he said. Not only that, nonindigenous trees used in the planning of a new shopping center, considered superior to native ones in drawing contaminants out of the ground, would have been barred by the new rules, he said.
When he explained this conflict to Mr. Mauriello, who drafts regulations for the Department of Environmental Protection, changes were made that not only allowed for Mr. Spodofora's system in the coastal zone but also encouraged other municipalities to copy it.
"The bill had good intentions, but some of the regulations went too far," Mr. Spodofora said he has concluded. "If you make the rules too difficult, you end up losing the people. They stop listening to you, and the environment becomes a dirty word."

HEADLINE: Defenders by Default: A special report.;
Option to Legal Aid for Poor Leaves New Yorkers at Risk

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH with MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Of all the things that went wrong during Amine Baba-Ali's journey through New York City's criminal courts, perhaps the most jarring was the performance of his court-appointed lawyer.
The lawyer, J. Edward Cardoso, neglected to subpoena a crucial witness who could have refuted the charge that Mr. Baba-Ali raped his 4-year-old daughter. Mr. Baba-Ali said Mr. Cardoso rarely returned his calls. And the lawyer made little effort to recruit medical experts for the defense. He made a few telephone calls, court records show, but gave up after getting busy signals. 
 Mr. Baba-Ali was convicted of the charge and spent two years in prison before the judicial system decided it had no case against him and set him free. An appeals court in 1992 called Mr. Cardoso's work so poor "as to doom the case to failure."
The episode occurred under a loosely organized city program that provides private lawyers to criminal defendants who cannot afford them. The program has grown so rapidly in recent years that officials have little ability to monitor the work of lawyers like Mr. Cardoso and more than 2,000 others who are assigned to defend suspects each year.
Originally intended to provide lawyers in just a sliver of cases, the program, called the Assigned Counsel Plan, now provides private lawyers for 40 percent of the indigent defendants in New York City.
The Legal Aid Society of New York, a private organization that functions like a law firm, is supposed to handle nearly all the indigent cases in New York City for a fixed sum each year. Its lawyers are paid salaries and are closely monitored by layers of supervisors.
Lawyers for the Assigned Counsel Plan, in contrast, work on their own -- at $40 an hour in court and $25 an hour out of court -- and their performance is virtually unmonitored.
The use of the assigned lawyers has grown by happenstance, not design. The city's system of indigent representation has been patched together in the 30 years since the United States Supreme Court guaranteed the right to counsel in the case of Gideon v. Wainwright. The courts have repeatedly turned to the Assigned Counsel Plan over the years to solve immediate problems, like a 1982 Legal Aid strike and a 1986 slowdown over caseloads.
Although Legal Aid says it now has enough lawyers to handle indigent cases, some judges say they are uncomfortable with the courts' dependence on Legal Aid lawyers. And as they seek to clear their crowded calendars, judges often find private lawyers already in court and willing to take a case at a moment's notice. As a result, far from its original design, the program has become a permanent -- if unwieldy -- institution.
"Suddenly, you've created, without legislation, without discussion, without authorization, a second legal aid society, untrained and unsupervised, for private attorneys," said Melvin Schubert, a Legal Aid supervisor in the Bronx.
In the last decade, spending for the private lawyers has quadrupled and next year the city is expected to spend $55.8 million on the program, up 12 percent from this year. The Legal Aid Society will get an increase of less than 1 percent next year, for a total of $79.4 million.
With the explosion in the use of private lawyers have come questions not only about the quality of their work, but also about the accuracy of their bills and the city's ability to monitor them.
From interviews, records and decisions of appeals courts, a picture has emerged of a system whose flaws have led to a range of problems. One assigned lawyer slept through large portions of a trial, snoring audibly, according to participants. Some simply fail to show up in court, some do not interview their clients and some do little preparation. And one, according to his bills, managed to represent 533 clients through the program in one year.
Although New York City's courts are run by the state, the state requires the city to pay the lawyer's bills, and the city has done so for decades virtually without question.
"It's essentially an open spigot," said Frederick H. Cohn, the chairman of the committee that admits lawyers to the program in Manhattan and the Bronx. "Whatever gets put in and approved by a judge gets paid."
While the city has begun to examine lawyers' bills more closely, the responsibility for monitoring the performance of assigned lawyers remains with the judges before whom the lawyers appear.
Acting Justice Harold J. Rothwax, of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the quality of court-appointed lawyers varies from poor to very good, but added that he has removed some lawyers from cases because he found them incompetent.
"I'll notice that motions papers are very poorly drafted," he said. "Sometimes a defendant will say, 'I haven't seen my lawyer in months,' so I'll relieve him."
Some appointed lawyers are "clearly incompetent," said Steven Zeidman, a professor at the New York University Law School who is on a committee to review the quality of appointed lawyers. "If you're poor and you're arrested," he said, "you've got to keep your fingers crossed."
 
Mistakes
When the Defense Has No Defense
 Mr. Baba-Ali was a defendant who was not lucky. In 1992, an appeals court ruled that his appointed lawyer, Mr. Cardoso, was largely to blame for his conviction on charges that he raped his four-year-old daughter. Mr. Cardoso had presented virtually no defense to the prosecution's medical evidence.
Mr. Baba-Ali, now 38, was a book editor from Queens when his estranged wife first raised suspicions about the abuse of their daughter in 1988. He said he was unable to afford a lawyer because of the cost of his divorce proceedings.
From the beginning, he said, he felt uneasy about Mr. Cardoso because he never returned phone calls and missed several court dates. "I was naive," Mr. Baba-Ali said in an interview. "I didn't know anything about the law. I trusted him because I didn't have any other choice."
The crux of the prosecution's case was testimony from a city health department doctor who said there was evidence of abuse, including the absence of a hymen. But Mr. Cardoso neglected to subpoena a doctor in Philadelphia who had examined the girl and had found no signs of abuse, the appeals court decision said, and the lawyer never had the girl examined by any other doctor. If he had, the outcome might have been different. A third doctor examined the girl in 1992, after the appeals court ordered a new trial, and found the hymen intact.
Within days of that finding, the case was dropped and Mr. Baba-Ali was freed.
Prosecutors also bore some of the blame, the appeals court said. They delayed disclosing to Mr. Cardoso the existence of the report from the Philadelphia doctor until the eve of trial. Such circumstances underscore the importance of diligent work by the defense.
In an affidavit, Mr. Cardoso explained his handling of the case. He said he had contacted the doctor, but he refused to travel to New York for the $500 witness fee offered by the Assigned Counsel Plan. Mr. Cardoso said he did not know he had the authority to issue a subpoena to force him to testify. In an attempt to find a local doctor, he called a service that provides expert witnesses, but "always got a busy signal."
A year after Mr. Baba-Ali's trial Mr. Cardoso was barred from handling any more cases through the Assigned Counsel Plan. Officials declined to say why he was barred.
Mr. Baba-Ali, whose case received press attention while he was in prison, is now suing the city for malicious prosecution.
 
Recourse
First Defense May Be Only One
 Mr. Baba-Ali's case aside, appeals courts in New York are extremely reluctant to overturn a conviction because of complaints that a lawyer did a bad job.
"It is one of the toughest issues to prevail on," said William Hellerstein, a professor of constitutional and criminal law at the Brooklyn Law School. "A lot of judges view it as a last-gasp attempt by defendants." He said it is crucial to have a competent lawyer from the beginning.
In a series of cases over two decades, New York courts have held that some mistakes by lawyers can be tolerated.
In the case of Dale Tippins, an appeals court ruled that his appointed lawyer had represented him adequately even though he had slept through portions of a trial and had attempted to extort money from Mr. Tippins's mother.
The lawyer, Louis Tirelli, was appointed to represent Mr. Tippins on a drug charge in Rockland County. Several times during Mr. Tippins's six-week trial, Mr. Tirelli's head fell forward and he dropped his pen as he slept, a court stenographer testified at a hearing in 1988. "He was snoring," she said. "We heard it."
The judge, William K. Nelson, said that he had admonished Mr. Tirelli "to please stay awake and represent his client." Mr. Tirelli "slept every day of the trial," the judge said. "How many times during the day, I didn't keep track."
Mr. Tippins was convicted of a drug charge and sentenced to 18 years to life in prison. Mr. Tirelli was convicted of attempted grand larceny for requesting $5,000 from his client's mother, who said she paid him because he said "it would make him work harder on the case."
In a 1991 ruling, the appellate division of the Second Judicial Department in Brooklyn said that despite Mr. Tirelli's criminal conduct and "reprehensible" sleeping during the trial, Mr. Tippins had received "meaningful representation."
 
Volume
From an Exception To a Practice
 New York's Assigned Counsel Plan was organized to handle two types of matters: cases with two or more defendants where Legal Aid would be in conflict if it represented more than one, and death penalty cases, which it was believed might overtax the newly hired Legal Aid Society 30 years ago as it was preparing to handle a vastly increased caseload.
The Assigned Counsel Plan was never intended to be a full-time job for any lawyer, but in recent years some have made it their entire practice. Some lawyers do such high-volume business that it raises questions about how much attention they can give to individual cases.
Last year, 2,609 lawyers, investigators and expert witnesses were paid by the program. While the majority got less than $10,000, about 300 earned more than $50,000 each and 15 earned more than $100,000.
 
1 Lawyer, 1 Year, 533 Cases
 One lawyer, Leslie D. Ching of Manhattan, submitted bills totaling $134,248 for 533 cases, most of them parole matters, more than any other lawyer in the city. Mr. Ching is among about 20 lawyers who specialize in parole cases, said Donald O. Weinberger, administrator of the assigned counsel plan for Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. He said that last fall he began restricting Mr. Ching's cases because he had so many.
"I'm up at 7:30 in the morning and I'm home at 9 o'clock at night," Mr. Ching said. "You review your files on off days and holidays."
Anthony Mascolo, a Queens lawyer who was paid $127,429 to handle 252 cases last year, said the high volume "was very difficult to handle." But he said he took most cases because judges asked him to. "If you're in a courtroom where an attorney doesn't appear, a judge will look out in the courtroom and say 'How about if you take this one?' " Mr. Mascolo said.
 
Guilty Pleas Encouraged?
 Lawyers are able to handle a high volume of cases because most defendants agree to plead guilty. In fact, some experts say that the assigned counsel system encourages the excessive use of guilty pleas. Lawyers can make more money if their clients plead quickly than if they are forced to do the low-paying, out-of-court work necessary to prepare for a trial.
Chester Mirsky, a law professor at New York University who has studied the Assigned Counsel Plan, said that because the assigned lawyers rely on judges to get cases and approve their bills, they are more likely than other lawyers to do what judges want.
The pressure to move cases puts a premium on plea bargains, he said. "That means no investigations, no motions, no hearings, no trials."
Investigators and expert witnesses are hired in a only a tiny percentage of cases. For example, of the 38,741 bills submitted in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island last year, only 678 were from investigators and expert witnesses.
As part of a new support program for assigned lawyers, the city has compiled a list of experts who are available for assigned counsel work, but it can be unreliable, as one Brooklyn lawyer learned during a trial last month.
Alan B. Stutman, who was appointed to defend a man charged with vehicular homicide, called as an expert witness a private investigator whose background the lawyer had not checked. Prosecutors, who had done their homework, surprised Mr. Stutman during cross-examination by revealing that the investigator had been granted immunity from prosecution in a Federal case and had admitted in Federal Court that he had committed perjury. The investigator, Frank E. Laine, had been recommended by the Assigned Counsel Plan.
 
Supervision
Little Oversight After Approval
 The ability to get work through the court-appointment program has become increasingly important to lawyers as hard economic times have hit the legal profession. To qualify for the cases, lawyers must first be approved by panels of Bar Association lawyers, who investigate their backgrounds. But once they are approved, there is little oversight of their work.
The lawyers get cases generally by signing up for arraignment sessions, where defendants enter the court system after their arrests. What happens after that is almost completely between lawyer and client.
In an effort to evaluate the quality of the lawyers' work, administrators of the program have begun a re-certification process. Lawyers are being required to complete lengthy questionnaires on their experience, and to submit samples of their court filings.
Some lawyers have bristled at the process and have organized to oppose some elements of it. They say they have been told by officials that lawyers may be removed from the program with no explanation and no right to appeal. They complain that they are being judged by academic standards rather than by the practical needs a high-volume court system where most motions are made verbally.
"We're being treated like people who don't deserve any rights," said Eric Greenbush, the president of the Lawyers Due Process Defense Committee. But he added, "We certainly agree that a re-certification process is needed."
 
Deceptive Billing
 The inadequacy of financial controls within the system has long been documented. In 1987, Mr. Mirsky and another New York University Law School professor, Michael McConville, examined the bills in 124 cases and found that in 27 percent of them lawyers billed for appearing in court even though records showed they were not there.
In 1989, the New York City Comptroller's Office found that lawyers regularly billed the city for more than 16 hours of work on a single day without explanation. The office recommended that more documentation be required.
In 1991, the Comptroller's Office found instances of double-billing and billing for court appearances that had not been made. Again, the office called for tightened controls.
The bills of assigned lawyers normally are approved by the judges who hear the cases. But judges are overburdened and ill-equipped to keep track of the activities of hundreds of lawyers who appear before them, said Katherine N. Lapp, the New York City Criminal Justice Coordinator. "It is an unreasonable expectation that a judge has the time and the resources and the capacity to check all these vouchers," she said.
 
Remedies
Trying to Change A 'Lousy Solution'
 Because of the vastness of the system, its recent growth, and the lack of computerized records, city officials say it is difficult to determine some basic facts about the Assigned Counsel Plan, including precisely how many cases it handles. The city has begun to use a computer scanning process to record information about the bills of individual lawyers, Ms. Lapp said.
The information will be used by the city to assess what changes should be made.
One of the issues facing the city is whether to require Legal Aid to take a greater share of the cases. Ms. Lapp said an argument can be made that Legal Aid is better equipped to handle the cases. "It's an institutional situation where you have investigators and social services," she said.
But some judges interviewed recently said they fear that if the system were more dependent on Legal Aid, a strike by the lawyers could shut down the courts.
Archibald Murray, the executive director of Legal Aid, said some judges are overly concerned about the possibility of a strike, and as a result have encouraged the growth of the Assigned Counsel Plan. "Perhaps it is a desire for a lot of assurance that there will always be someone there when they need someone to take a case," he said.
Mr. Murray said Legal Aid is ready and willing to take on a much greater share of the indigent cases. For both defendants and lawyers, the current program is a "lousy solution" to the problem of providing for the defense of the poor, said Mr. Cohn, who is stepping down next month after three years as the head of the screening panel for Manhattan and the Bronx. "It's a horse-and-buggy system that hasn't translated well to the jet age."

HEADLINE: Price Rise For Movies Engenders No Protest

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
It is often said that New Yorkers complain about almost everything, from potholes to panhandlers. But there was barely a whisper of protest this weekend when the two largest movie chains in the metropolitan area raised ticket prices at many of their theaters, increasing the price of a movie in Manhattan to $8 for adults, from $7.50.
"I guess the prices have to go up sometime," said Anna Holtzman, a student at the Horace Mann School, who was waiting to see "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" Saturday night. "It's not going to keep me from going." 
 The increase to a top ticket price of $8 was made without announcement Friday by the Cineplex Odeon chain, which owns 44 Manhattan movie screens at 21 locations, and the Sony Theatres-Loews chain, which runs 36 screens in Manhattan at 11 locations under the Loews banner.
 
No Don Quixote
 Cineplex, which appears to have made few price increases outside Manhattan, operates more than 140 screens in the New York metropolitan area. Loews, which raised prices in several theaters in the city and the suburbs, runs more than 100. Company officials were not available for comment yesterday.
Ticket prices at other theaters, including those run by the United Artists chain, were not changed.
Edward I. Koch, who as Mayor mounted a brief protest when Cineplex and Loews increased Manhattan movie ticket prices by $1 to $7 in late 1987, was uncharacteristically subdued about the latest increase.
"It's fruitless," Mr. Koch said yesterday. "The last time I led picketing over movie prices, I looked behind me and there was no army following. I don't engage in hopeless causes. I'm not Don Quixote."
Coming just as the summer movie season is getting under way, the price increases suggest that theater owners in New York are confident that higher ticket costs will not deter most moviegoers, perhaps because of the improving economy.
First-run movie ticket prices in Manhattan, which rose to $7.50 in 1989, generally set the pace for those around the country. The most popular theaters in a handful of other major cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, have also had a top price of $7.50 for the last couple of years. Elsewhere, ticket prices typically range from $5 to $7 for adults.
Across the nation, movie tickets sold last year for an average price of $4.14, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. That was actually down slightly from the previous year, and well below the $4.44 average in 1989, when an economic recession began.
Manhattan ticket prices have always been higher than elsewhere, in part because of higher theater rents and land costs and also because it is one of the most popular places to see the latest movies. And people have traditionally been willing to pay.
But prices for all types of entertainment, from sporting events and video rentals to the Broadway theater, actually fell in the New York-New Jersey region last month by 0.9 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and were just 1.9 percent higher than a year earlier.
 
Different Market Pressures
 "This has been a period of low inflation in the New York region, as low as we've had in a quarter century," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's New York regional commissioner. "But specific markets respond to different pressures. I don't think you can cite this as a sign that higher prices are likely across the board."
In addition to the Manhattan price increases, the movie chains also raised ticket prices at other locations in the metropolitan area, although not at all theaters. Ticket prices for adults and children at the Loews Theater in Greenwich, Conn., for example, rose 25 cents to $7.25 and $4.25, while top prices at the Loews Bay Terrace Sixplex in Queens rose 50 cents to $7.50.
But the Cineplex Odeon Flatlands in Brooklyn kept its ticket prices unchanged at $7.50 and $4.25, as did the Loews Wayne Eight in New Jersey, which charges $7.25 for adults and $4 for children and the elderly. Both theaters raised their prices last year.

HEADLINE: Strong Yen Aids Japan's Asian Rivals

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
When Mitsubishi Motors of Japan said recently that it might buy steel from the Pohang Iron and Steel Company in South Korea, it created headlines on both sides of the Sea of Japan. Japanese auto companies, as a rule, have never bought Korean steel.
But with the rise of the Japanese yen, Korean steel is now about 20 percent cheaper than Japanese steel, Mitsubishi said, a difference too great to ignore. 
 Even as it squeezes Japan's famous steel, auto and electronics companies, the strong yen has given new life to their competitors in South Korea and elsewhere in Asia, pushing growth throughout what is already the world's fastest growing region.
"It's a tail wind for us," said Kim Sun Hong, the chairman of Kia Motors, Korea's second-largest auto maker. The company is doubling capacity at its main factory in anticipation of greater exports and is trying to break into the American market by advertising the price advantage its $8,500 Sephia has over Japanese cars.
The impact of the strong Japanese currency varies from country to country and company to company, and there are harmful effects as well as beneficial ones. But by and large, executives and analysts say, the effect on Asia has been positive.
Owing in part to the yen's rise, South Korea's economy is booming again after two years of sluggishness. Economists expect 7 to 8 percent growth this year, compared with 5.6 percent last year and 5 percent the year before that. New factories are going up everywhere and the Government has decided to allow 20,000 foreign workers into the country to help fill job vacancies.
"The most important factor is the yen," said Lim Dong Sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute. "The economic recovery is led by heavy industry -- cars, shipbuilding, electronics. Most of these industries compete with Japan."
The yen is now worth about 7.7 Korean won, a gain of 22 percent from 6.3 won at the end of 1992. That has given Korean products a price advantage of 10 to 25 percent over Japanese ones, Korean executives say.
With such an advantage, South Korea's shipbuilding industry surpassed Japan's in 1993 to become the world's largest in terms of orders received. Korean auto exports soared 40 percent in 1993, to 640,000 vehicles, and another strong gain is expected this year.
The South Korean consumer electronics industry has benefited as well. "The export business is really booming," said Bae Soon Hoon, president of Daewoo Electronics. Daewoo's exports in the first quarter were up 48 percent, to $511 million.
Some of these exports are products that are sold by Japanese companies under their own names. "In the U.S. market if you buy a Sanyo, Toshiba or some other product and look at it carefully, you'll see the 'Made in Korea' label on the back," Mr. Bae said.
In most cases, Korean products are displacing Japanese ones in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, not in Japan itself. But even the Japanese market, which has been tough for Korean companies to penetrate, is opening somewhat. In the first quarter, South Korea's exports to Japan rose 12.4 percent after having fallen for three straight years.
The rise of the yen has also produced benefits for other Asian nations, most of which have currencies that are loosely pegged to the dollar.
"We are on the verge of an endaka boom," said C. H. Kwan, head of Asian economic research at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, using a Japanese word for the rise of the yen.
The mechanism works differently in different countries. As does South Korea, other relatively advanced countries like Taiwan and Singapore benefit from having their products gain a price advantage against Japanese ones. But the effect is somewhat smaller than in South Korea, some economists say, because these countries have fewer heavy industries that compete directly against Japan.
For the less advanced nations of Southeast Asia and China, the benefit of the high yen comes from Japanese companies themselves, which are shifting their manufacturing to these countries to escape the high costs in Japan.
 
Other Factors Cited
 Still, some economists say the importance of the yen's rise should not be exaggerated. "Certainly it has had some positive impact, but I don't think that it's a major factor," said Nam Sang Woo, senior fellow at the Korea Development Institute, a Government-sponsored research organization.
Mr. Nam said the strong yen helped only exports, which account for just 25 to 30 percent of South Korea's economy. And some of the rise in exports results from the recovery of the United States economy and the fast growth in Asia. He said the main reason for South Korea's recovery was cyclical resurgence in investment by companies in new plants and equipment.
Others note that the yen's rise is not an unmixed blessing. Industry in South Korea is highly dependent on advanced components and production machinery from Japan -- robots and machine tools, wafer steppers for making computer chips, optical pickups for compact disk players. With a stronger yen, those Japanese products, for which there is often no substitute, become more expensive.
Because of this, as South Korea's overall exports grow, its imports from Japan also grow. In the first quarter of this year imports from Japan rose 21.6 percent, almost twice as much as South Korea's exports to Japan.
In the rest of Asia as well, the expansion of manufacturing by Japanese companies means greater imports of Japanese components and production machinery, providing what Mr. Kwan of Nomura Research called a "built-in stabilizer" for Japan's exports.
 
Japan's Exports Climb
 Even though the strong yen hurt the competitiveness of Japanese products, the volume of Japan's exports to East Asia climbed last year, while the volume of exports to Europe and the United States declined. Japan's trade surplus with East Asia exceeded Japan's surplus with the United States last year for the first time.
Another drawback of the higher yen is that many companies in Asia, as well as Asian governments, have debts denominated in yen. As the yen has gained strength, payments of interest and principal have become more onerous in terms of the local currency.
Kia Motors, for instance, obtains technology from the Mazda Motor Company of Japan and borrows in yen to pay for it. Last year, Kia had a foreign exchange loss of about $33 million, curtailing otherwise strong profits.
Korean officials say that problems still remain in their economy. Encouraged by the shift toward democracy in the late 1980's, which gave new voice to workers, wages are two and a half times their level of five years ago, Mr. Lim of the Samsung economic institute said.
Even though South Korea's wages are at about half the level of those in Japan, they are high compared with other Asian nations. While heavy industries that compete with Japan are growing, light industries like footwear, clothing and toy manufacturing are migrating out of South Korea to lower-wage countries, as they have done in Japan.
 
Behind in Many Areas
 Moreover, manufacturers here realize they are still behind Japan in productivity, technology, product quality and brand image. An average Korean auto worker produces only 20 to 25 cars a year, while a Japanese worker produces 45, according to an analysis by Weekly Chosun, a Korean magazine. Were it not for lower wages and cheaper raw materials, Korea would not be able to compete with Japan.
And executives here fear that the price advantage may be only temporary. Either the yen will fall again or Japanese companies will gradually adjust by improving productivity or shifting manufacturing offshore.
Japanese shipbuilding companies have already been cutting prices and battling back. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan recently won an order for five supertankers from Saudi Arabia. "I'm still very suspicious about how they cut their prices," grumbled a sales manager for Hyundai Heavy Industries, Korea's largest shipbuilder.
Despite the company's current export boom, Daewoo Electronics is cutting costs by slowly reducing production capacity in South Korea and adding it in China, Myanmar and Vietnam.
"The Japanese will come back sooner or later," Mr. Bae, Daewoo's president, said. "If they come back, we're in trouble, so we have to prepare."

Knicks March On After Bulls Fall Down and Break Their Crown

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN 

 BODY:
After years of frustration, and a seven-game series that tested the limits of their will, the Knicks finally exorcised the opponent that haunted them like no other.
The Knicks eliminated the Chicago Bulls, the three-time National Basketball Association champions, 87-77, yesterday in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series before a jubilant Madison Square Garden crowd. 
 The Knicks advanced to the conference finals for the second consecutive season. They will face the Indiana Pacers in a four-of-seven-game series starting tomorrow night at the Garden.
It was New York's first playoff victory ever over the Bulls, who had eliminated the Knicks the previous three years, and four of the past five.
 
A Moment Worth the Wait
 The Knicks had waited and suffered for this moment, and when it came, they savored it. Patrick Ewing, on a mission to win the first championship of his nine-year career, waved his arms at the crowd with just over a minute left, beckoning them to cheer even louder. The towel-waving throng obliged, and when Charles Oakley dunked with 32.5 seconds left, the crowd roared even louder and remained standing until the buzzer.
With five seconds to play, Ewing walked off the court and hugged his wife, Rita, who was sitting near courtside. And when the buzzer sounded, Anthony Mason spiked the ball near midcourt in celebration.
Most of the players from both teams gathered at midcourt and exchanged hugs and handshakes, a classy way for a physical, hard-fought and sometimes even violent series to end.
Before now, it was always the Knicks who had been forced to congratulate the Bulls. This time, the tables had turned.
"Somewhere, some team had to put them away, and for us, I think it was fitting," said Knicks Coach Pat Riley, who shook hands with the Bulls' Phil Jackson, his longtime adversary, in the press room afterward. "If we really aspire to what they have worked so hard to achieve, then it is fitting that we should beat them. "
 
Home Is Where the Victories Are
 The home-court advantage was critical. The hosts won all seven games of the series, and the Knicks' victory marked the 18th straight time that the home team had won Game 7 of an N.B.A. playoff series. Collectively, the Knicks stepped forward in the most pressure-filled game of their careers.
Ewing, scoreless and frustrated in the first half, was dominant in the second half and turned in a splendid all-around game -- 18 points, 17 rebounds and 6 assists. Charles Oakley, who criticized his teammates' effort after their loss in Game 6, backed up his words with an inspirational effort, finishing with 20 rebounds and 17 points. Charles Smith, who took much of the blame when the Knicks lost Game 5 en route to losing last season, scored 7 of his 11 points in the first quarter during a critical juncture when Ewing was on the bench in foul trouble.
And Greg Anthony, the backup point guard, saved his best performance of the playoffs for the most important time. Anthony played the final 15 minutes 21 seconds, directing New York's offense with so much confidence and poise that Riley stayed with him in a game the Knicks had to have. Anthony sparked the 8-0 run at the end of the third quarter that put New York ahead for good, including a 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds left in the third quarter that gave New York a 67-63 lead heading into the final period.
Anthony made his jumper in front of Chicago's bench as the 24-second clock was about to expire. When the shot went through the net, he accidentally bumped into Jackson, pushed the coach away, then pumped his fist in his face. Jackson looked away.
The crowd went wild and continued to roar throughout the intermission between the third and fourth quarters. For Anthony, the shot, the fourth quarter and the victory were sweet redemption after a series during which he was much maligned.
"That's one of the great moments I've had, from the standpoint of what it meant, the magnitude of it, to defeat the three-time defending world champs," Anthony said. "It was a hard-fought series and a long time coming, as far as we're concerned, to defeat them. You couldn't ask for a greater opponent than the Bulls. They've got tremendous talent, great coaching, a great work ethic. It wasn't easy, and in all honesty, we knew it wouldn't be."
But the Knicks prevailed with a trademark fourth-quarter defensive stand, holding the Bulls to 14 points in the final period. In another key statistic, the Knicks outrebounded Chicago, 64-50, grabbing 18 offensive rebounds, 11 by Oakley.
 
Pippen Sparkles in Defeat
 Scottie Pippen, who had a superb series -- although his refusal to enter the waning moments of Game 3 will not be forgotten -- led the Bulls with 20 points and 16 rebounds.
It was a good sign for the Knicks when they led, 38-37, at halftime. Ewing was scoreless, and John Starks only had 1 point at intermission. And the Knicks knew that would change.
"I got the two quick fouls and I had to sit out," Ewing said of his first half. "But even though I didn't score, I felt I did other things. I knew the offense would come."
Anthony's 3-point basket capped the 8-point spree by the Knicks at the end of the third quarter. When the Bulls closed within 70-67 with nine and a half minutes to play, the Knicks went on a critical 10-3 run to put the game out of reach. Anthony made a driving layup, Mason made another one, and then Anthony added a free throw to put the Knicks ahead by 8.
 
Ewing's 3-Point Bank Shot
 After Armstrong made a 22-footer, Hubert Davis made an 18-footer. Horace Grant made one of two free throws, then Ewing made another decisive basket -- a 3-point bank shot from behind the key that gave New York an 80-70 lead with 6:01 left. Any time Ewing makes a 3-pointer, it is usually a good sign for the Knicks.
"When I saw that, that's when I figured it was our day," Harper said. Asked if Ewing meant to bank the shot in, Harper said, "I'm sure he didn't. But I'm sure he's not taking it back."
And the Knicks were not giving back this victory, after all the disappointments and heartbreaks of their previous series against Chicago.
Jackson was gracious in defeat. In describing the emotion in the Bulls' locker room when the game was over, he said: "I told the players that we haven't been unemployed at this time in a long time. And it's the first time in a long time we've been able to end the season alone. There have always been TV, cameras and media people around. We had to absorb that. Not only is winning part of the game, losing is too. If you win, you have to win like champions. When you lose, you have to do it that same way. For that reason, I was proud of this team."
But the Knicks were proud, too. And more important, their season was still alive.
 
REBOUNDS
 DAVE CHECKETTS, the Knicks' president, admitted that there was more pressure on the Knicks to win yesterday than any game he could remember. "It's a real breakthrough, a monkey off our backs," Checketts said. "For the last three years, we've been trying to get over the hump, thinking about this very moment, working all during the summers. We had been vilified here in New York in some of the articles and in some of the radio talk during the past three days. To come through says a lot about this team. The expectations were that this was a series that we should win. But champions do not go down easy." . . . The Knicks were 4-0 against Indiana this season, but, as PATRICK EWING said, "That goes out the window. They have a great club and they work hard. We have to stay focused." . . . Chicago Coach PHIL JACKSON and forward SCOTTIE PIPPEN received first-quarter technical fouls. Pippen felt he was fouled on a dunk shot. Jackson protested when a foul was not called on Knick backup center HERB WILLIAMS. The Bulls' HORACE GRANT was knocked to the floor while dunking over Williams.

Let's Make a Deal on Health

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What's the difference between the Clinton health plan and Elvis Presley? According to Senator Phil Gramm: Elvis is the one that might be alive.
Nobody here doubts that the President's grandiose scheme to place one-seventh of America's economy under government domination is dead. That's because Americans have come to realize that permanent price controls (euphemized as "premium caps") require rationing, or denial -- and most of us do not want the health care we already have taken away. 
 Equally obnoxious is the notion of statewide collectives (euphemized as "alliances") that would end the patient's freedom to choose a particular doctor. And forcing employers (the euphemism is "mandate") to bear the cost of insurance will hurt small business and cause workers to get fired or be treated as part-timers.
To top off the rising resistance, the proposal to finance coverage of the unemployed with a cigarette tax -- while we move to ban smoking -- is widely seen as the selling of unsaturated snake oil. The real bill, with taxes on the middle class, would hit home hard soon.
Does all that sober second thinking mean that "health care reform" is a dead duck? No. It means only that we have come to the time for improving health care's free market without undermining it.
First, forget "mandates"; forced coverage won't fly. That includes the misbegotten Republican alternative of "individual mandates," forcing each of us to buy our own insurance. Envision a TV spot this fall: "We Democrats want your employer to pay for your insurance, but the Republicans want to make you pay for it. Which do you prefer?" Sure answer: Force my boss, not me.
That's why Republicans will have to stop fiddling with compromises on coercion: insurance must be voluntary. Plain economic sense, not legislation, will drive small businesses to form purchasing pools to get better deals from insurers.
Concentrate instead on an idea whose time has come: Everybody should be able to buy some health insurance. Clinton is right: Pre-existing conditions should no longer be a bar to getting coverage. The insurance industry will have to be forced to accept people who are poor risks.
These "community ratings," or risk-spreading among large pools of people, should not go to the extreme of human homogenization. Smokers and drinkers and gluttons should pay more than non-smokers and teetotalers and dieters; it's a free country, but if you choose to run a risk, you have no right to demand your neighbor share the cost of your risk.
The health insurance reform bill should include the ability to keep the insurance you have when you change jobs, provided you or your next employer pays for it. Portability of insurance (and of pensions) fits in the new social and business fabric of our time.
To encourage more insuring, our tax system should give individuals, including the self-employed, the same tax breaks on insurance premium payments now given to other employees. Medical I.R.A.'s are another way to help people pay for better coverage.
But won't this result in some people getting better health coverage than others? Yes. You work for money so that you can buy better food, better clothes, better housing and better health care than the next guy. Our system calls it "incentive."
That does not mean we let the poor starve, or lack for clothes or shelter, or deny them basic treatment for illness. But after providing a floor for those in poverty -- subsidizing premiums for the lowest-cost plans -- the better-off should not be prevented from providing better for themselves and their families.
The coming bipartisan health care bill ought to provide more money for university medical research than does the abandoned Clinton plan, and should reject its odious imposition of racial quotas for medical schools. It should encourage rather than disparage pharmaceutical research. It should stay miles away from a "National Health Board" -- which would come under political pressure to grant ever-greater benefits, at taxpayer cost, that individual Americans should remain able to choose or reject.
If Mr. Clinton is re-elected with a larger majority in Congress, liberals could extend these sensible insurance reforms into the revolutionary health-care leveling they have in mind. If not, not.

HEADLINE: Fed Disclosure Is Sought

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
In another move to force the Federal Reserve to become more open about its policies, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, with the support of the panel's ranking Republican, is seeking more information about efforts to raise or lower the value of the dollar in international markets.
A bill introduced today would require the Fed's chairman to explain the central bank's views on the dollar in his semiannual appearances before the House and Senate Banking committees to discuss monetary policy. The bill would also require the Treasury Secretary to provide a semiannual report on the Administration's policies on the dollar and on any lines of credit or other deals to prop up another country's currency. 
 Officials of the Treasury and the Fed declined to comment.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the committee, has assailed the decision by the Clinton Administration and the Fed to set up a $6 billion line of credit for the Mexican Government. The ranking Republican who endorsed Mr. Gonzalez's bill, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, has said efforts to prop up the dollar were doomed to failure unless accompanied by more Federal budget cuts.

HEADLINE: Chinese Military's Business Empire Puts Profits Into Commerce, Not Arms

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 23

 BODY:
Ever since the People's Liberation Army went into business more than a decade ago, Western intelligence agencies have been concerned that profits from its vast commercial enterprises would go toward the purchase of tanks, missiles and fighter aircraft.
But over the last two years, the agencies have come to a new conclusion: China's military enterprises are pyramiding their successes, plowing profits into new and bigger commercial enterprises, hotels, truck and shipping companies -- even discos. 
 As a result of this new analysis, assumptions about the pace of China's military modernization, its ambitions as a regional military power and the true size of its overall military spending are being scaled back, a number of Western analysts say.
While this assessment may provide a measure of comfort to neighbors who fear China's growing military power, its military goals may not be totally non-threatening, especially when it comes to disputed areas in the South China Sea, where a number of other Asian governments are vying for oil exploration rights.
 
Profits Not Going to Arms
 The new analysis is significant in assessing China's overall military strength, Western analysts say, because profits from the ventures are either being invested in new commercial activity or are being spent on the welfare of the military units that control businesses that sprang up in the era of economic reforms after decades of "starvation" military budgets.
"The answer to whether they are plowing back these profits into more bombs, rockets, ships and guns is no," said David Shambaugh, a China scholar at the University of London who has recently completed a study of Chinese military spending.
Even the rapidly declining revenues from overseas sales of Silkworm anti-ship missiles, F-7 fighters and ballistic missiles appear to be financing science and technology research academies, not military procurement, the analysts say.
In China's booming coastal provinces, military commercialism has produced a generation of top military officers who are more likely to have driven a newly purchased Mercedes-Benz in the last year than a tank or armored personnel carrier.
 
Source of Corruption
 At the same time, Western officials say, big military businesses have also led to corruption, the dimensions of which have not been reported by China's leadership even as they give wide publicity to an anti-corruption campaign in civilian businesses.
"From China's standpoint," a Western diplomat here said, "one of the problems is that the military is too busy making money to think about national defense."
The explosion of growth in China's military industries has also raised the profile of its exports to the United States, including everything from assault rifles to toys to toilet seats. Some members of Congress now advocate imposing penalties on China's military industries to punish China for its record on human rights, an idea that some China specialists warn would be counterproductive. Specialists argue that because the military is expected to be the key institution for stability in China after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader, punishing military industries is fraught with problems of definition and practicality.
 
Trying to Bring Order
 In response to this shift toward commercialism in the armed forces, President Jiang Zemin and his top military adviser, Adm. Liu Huaqing, have since last fall tried to bring order to the military's corporate structure, and they have been joined by a number of other top Chinese military leaders. Still, it remains to be seen whether a new emphasis on training and readiness will reimpose sufficient discipline so Communist Party leaders can maintain stability in the ranks.
"The commercialization of the P.L.A. has had a very deleterious effect on readiness and training," Mr. Shambaugh asserts.
But prosperity is well received among the troops, most of the analysts agree. For the first time in decades, there is meat on the table for soldiers, who were forced like other Chinese to scrounge for rice husks and eat grass soup during the deprivation years of the 1950's and during the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976.
"I have actually overheard an officer criticizing a superior for being too interested in taking money from commercial activity and turning it over to the central Government," a Western diplomat said. "He told him he should be more concerned about the living standards of his comrades."
 
Making Many Products
 Today, China's military runs a pharmaceutical empire with earnings of $1 billion a year; it produces satellite television dishes and cellular phones as well as food, clothing, trucks, boats, motorcycles and contact lenses. In Shanghai, the city's hottest disco, JJ's, is a joint venture between the military, which owns the building, and a Hong Kong investor. The cavernous warehouse throbs each night under a constellation of strobe lights while a prostitution trade takes place outside.
"Companies are putting more profit into dual-use civilian production: motorcycles instead of fighter aircraft and commercial space launches instead of military rockets," a Western diplomat said. "Chinese weapons are not in high demand."
At the Chengdu Aircraft Company in south-central Sichuan Province, for instance, the production line for F-7 fighter aircraft scarcely has customers for the dozen or so units it produces each year.
"The production line is still producing fighters, but they are just lining them up out there on the ramp with no one to sell them to, except for the few that go to Pakistan or Bangladesh," said a recent visitor to the plant. "The majority of the work force is involved with making three different varieties of motorcycles, and this is just to make money."
 
Making Airliner Nose Cones
 The factory's military managers tell visitors that 70 percent of their income comes from the motorcycle business and most of the rest from a joint venture with McDonnell Douglas to produce nose sections for the MD-80 commercial airliner.
"They have been making those nose sections for the MD-80 for five years," a Western diplomat said. "They float them down the Yangtze River and ship them back to Long Beach, where they are fitted onto the MD-80's that are sold around the world."
But the profits from these commercial ventures are not going into the operations, maintenance or procurement budgets of the military, Western analysts say.
"It is not benefiting the military in the direct sense a lot of people used to think and some who still do," the diplomat said.
In testimony to Congress, the Central Intelligence Agency estimated last year that the proceeds of China's military enterprises had reached $5 billion annually.
Mr. Shambaugh, the China scholar, estimated that the figure could be as high as $10 billion, but added, "I don't think anyone, including the military, knows how much they make on commercial activities."
 
Official Figure Not Believed
 China's military spending level has long been a mystery. After two decades in which spending actually declined and forces atrophied, China's officially acknowledged military budget has increased by more than 10 percent a year since 1989, to about $7 billion.
But a Western diplomat said of Beijing's officially announced budget: "Nobody believes the figures they give on defense."
Many analysts agree that a more realistic estimate is $20 billion to $40 billion. That is less than one-tenth of the United States military budget and on a par with Japanese military spending, but with three million people under arms, China's greatest costs are supporting them.
"Even after the increases, we are just able to maintain the minimum standards of living for the forces," Xu Xin, former deputy chief of staff of the military, said in a recent interview.
In November, as get-rich fever seemed to be getting out of control in the military, President Jiang summoned the military leadership to set some rules, including a decree that said military enterprises at the lower command levels should be turned over to the civilian authorities. So far, it is uncertain how many such business have been transferred.
 
In Business to Stay
 Mr. Jiang in his decree may have been trying to bring order out of the chaos, but he also enshrined the principle that the Chinese military, at the highest levels, was in business to stay. There now are "scores" of power centers in the military that are consolidating their business empires, Western analysts say.
Even Mr. Jiang's admonition to the assembled military brass sounded a contradictory note when he said the army should "stick to the principle of building up its combat strength while engaging in production and business activities."
The President, who exercises his role as commander in chief as chairman of the Central Military Commission, told military leaders that they should rationalize their business investments in a way that reduced China's overall financial burdens and improved the living standards of troops.
"Ever since then, there has been a strong increase in training and conducting military exercises," a Western diplomat said.
And in recent months, the civilian leadership has begun to enforce more strictly the retirement age for top military officers, a decision that Western analysts say will make the military more professional. A diplomat said it would also remove incentives for corruption typified by the attitude that "if I am not going to get promoted, then I am going to get mine while I can."
 
Concern Abroad Remains
 If the new analysis of Chinese military financing means that Beijing is spending less on the military, it will probably reduce the concerns of regional powers like Japan.
But concern remains nonetheless. China has embarked on building up well-equipped, rapid deployment forces that could be thrown into any number of territorial disputes on China's periphery, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and over a disputed group of islands in the South China Sea called the Spratlys. There, China is forging ahead with oil exploration despite rival claims from Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
At the same time, China continues to search for relatively inexpensive weapon systems that can deliver firepower decisively in the opening stage of a conflict. To that end, its aviation design bureaus are working on a boxy prototype of a Stealth bomber, similar to the American F-117 that was so decisive against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
"They have a program," a Western diplomat said. The question, he added, is what they will do with it.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A FIRST LADY: THE FUNERAL;
Farewell to a Woman Of Strength and Grace

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The family and friends of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis gathered yesterday morning in a Manhattan church, and many hundreds of others thronged outside, to bid farewell to the woman they remembered with love and admiration for restoring their pride and hope at one of the country's bleakest moments.
As housekeepers watched from the windows of Park Avenue apartments and helicopters hovered against a bright blue sky, inside the church those closest to the former First Lady remembered her for her love of words, "her spirit of adventure" and her devotion to her family. 
 "During those four endless days in 1963, she held us together as a family and a country," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, her former brother-in-law, said in his eulogy. "In large part because of her, we could grieve and then go on. She lifted us up, and in the doubt and darkness, she gave her fellow citizens back their pride as Americans."
"Afterward, as the eternal flame she lit flickered in the autumn of Arlington Cemetery," Senator Kennedy said, "Jackie went on to do what she most wanted -- to raise Caroline and John, and warm her family's life and that of all the Kennedys."
 
By Invitation Only
 The funeral -- by invitation only, hand-delivered or telephoned over the weekend -- attracted women and men from the many corners of Mrs. Onassis' life. They included dozens of relatives of President Kennedy and many of his White House advisers, Hillary Rodham Clinton, members of Congress, writers, artists and performers, socialites, members of news organizations and her children's closest friends.
Among those who came were Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John Kerry and Claiborne Pell; the former Kennedy aides Dave Powers, Richard Goodwin and Pierre Salinger; the television personalities Mike Wallace, Phil Donahue and Diane Sawyer; the architects Philip Johnson and I. M. Pei; Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist and author who was Ambassador to India during the Kennedy Administration; Roosevelt Grier, the former football player and aide to Robert F. Kennedy who was with him in Los Angeles when he was shot and killed in 1968 while running for President; and Kenneth Battelle, better known as simply Kenneth, the hairdresser who created the First Lady's bouffant in the 1960's.
There were many lesser-known guests at the funeral Mass, held at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue and East 84th Street, where Mrs. Onassis had been baptized and confirmed. By one guest's account, one of the saddest moments of the 80-minute service was when Mrs. Onassis' longtime butler helped carry the communion wafers up the center aisle to the priest to be consecrated, then turned back toward the congregation weeping.
 
Her Children Trail Behind
 Later, Mrs. Onassis' children, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr., walked down the aisle beneath the 70-foot-high vaulted ceiling, holding each other tightly and trailing their mother's mahogany coffin. Some of those who looked on from the pews said the sight filled them with terrible sadness -- that the children's lives, already touched by so much pain, should now have to encompass this.
The entire event was a remarkable logistical feat -- from the 700 personal invitations to the maze of police barricades holding traffic and the public at bay, to the police officers on nearby rooftops and the fleet of royal-blue minibuses that arrived to ferry guests to La Guardia Airport for the flight to Washington and the burial.
Guests began arriving at 8:30 A.M. for the 10 A.M. service, passing through one security check after another. Hundreds of reporters, photographers and members of camera crews were stationed halfway across the street, behind the grassy median. One television network had paid $10,000 to place a camera on the roof of a small building housing a portrait studio across from the church.
At exactly 10 A.M., eight gray-gloved, professional pallbearers emerged from Mrs. Onassis' apartment house at 1040 Fifth Avenue, three blocks away, and lifted her coffin into a waiting hearse. As neighbors peered from their windows, Mrs. Onassis' children and her companion in recent years, Maurice Tempelsman, climbed into a stretch limousine and, with a police escort, followed the hearse to the church.
There, the coffin was met by eight honorary pallbearers: Jack Walsh, a Secret Service agent who had been assigned to Mrs. Onassis' children after their father's assassination, and seven nephews of Mrs. Onassis -- Edward Kennedy Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Christopher Lawford, Anthony Radziwill, Lewis Rutherford Jr., Timothy Shriver and Dr. William Kennedy Smith.
The service began with a passage from the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 25, read by John F. Kennedy Jr. It says, in part: "On this mountain, the Lord of hosts will provide for all peoples, on this mountain He will destroy the veil that veils all peoples, the web that is woven over all nations; He will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces."
Mr. Kennedy said that in choosing the readings for the service "we struggled to find ones that captured my mother's essence." Three attributes came to mind over and over, he said, "the love of words, the bonds of home and family and her spirit of adventure."
 
'A Lesson to the World'
 In his eulogy, Senator Kennedy called Mrs. Onassis "a lesson to the world on how to do things right, how to be a mother, how to appreciate history, how to be courageous."
"No one else looked like her, spoke like her, wrote like her or was so original in the way she did things," he said. "No one we knew ever had a better sense of self."
"She made a rare and noble contribution to the American spirit," he continued, and later added, "She graced our history. And for those of us who knew and loved her, she graced our lives."
Senator Kennedy told a story intended to illustrate the way Mrs. Onassis was "always there" for her family. It was about the day last summer when the Kennedys and Mrs. Onassis took President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton sailing off Martha's Vineyard. Before the Clintons arrived, Mrs. Onassis urged Senator Kennedy to greet the Clintons on the lower deck.
"But I said, 'Maurice is already there,' " Senator Kennedy recalled in his eulogy. "And Jackie answered: 'Teddy, you do it. Maurice isn't running for re-election.' " Senator Kennedy is seeking election this year to his sixth full term.
Mrs. Schlossberg read a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay, "Memory of Cape Cod." The Kennedys have long spent their summers there.
The service also included a Scriptural reading by the director Mike Nichols and singing by the soprano Jessye Norman. The Mass was said by the Rev. Walter F. Modrys, the pastor of the church. No camera coverage was allowed, but the audio portion of it was broadcast on several radio and television stations.
Mr. Tempelsman read, "Ithaka," by the Greek poet C. P. Cavafy, in which a traveler sets out on a journey. He appended his own epilogue:
"And now the journey is over. Too short, alas, too short. It was filled with adventure and wisdom, laughter and love, gallantry and grace. So farewell, farewell."

HEADLINE: The Puzzle of New Jobs: How Many, How Fast?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Faced with nervousness in the credit markets, the Clinton Administration is growing concerned that the robust job growth in recent months might become a victim of further interest rate increases. But there seems to be little the Administration can do about it.
So far, job growth has continued despite rising interest rates, and is running well above the rate needed for the President to deliver on his campaign pledge of eight million new jobs during his four-year term. The economy has added an average 245,000 net new jobs a month this year to the national employment rolls. 
 It is that healthy pace that has the credit markets worried, and, if it continues, could cause them to seek higher interest rates to slow the economy.
 
The Market Mind-Set
 "The market is going to do whatever it thinks it should do, regardless of what the Administration says," said Robert Giordano, director of research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Administration officials do not dispute that statement. But as job growth accelerates, they are trying to calm the markets, and about the only tool they have is jawboning. The Administration's top economic officials believe they have a strong case to make that the current job growth will not result in inflationary labor shortages. In the past, such shortages have prompted employers to push up wages to hire or keep qualified workers. Price increases have followed to pay for the higher wage costs.
"Of course, you should always be watchful with respect to inflation, but you should think about it in the circumstances of the present economy," said Robert E. Rubin, the President's chief economic adviser, who left as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs to join the Administration.
Mr. Rubin ticks off several reasons why the relationship between employment and inflation is not the same today as in the past. When labor at home seems in short supply, he says, American businesses can fall back, more than in the past, on foreign production capacity and foreign workers to supply their domestic customers with goods that are in short supply at American factories.
"You have an international supply rather than a national supply, so that when the economy hits bottlenecks, there is then access to international supply to relieve those bottlenecks, rather than simply having to increase prices dramatically," he said. "And even when you are at full capacity in an industry, there is now a constraint that did not used to exist with respect to raising prices, and that restraint is international competition."
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich also argues that the current levels of economic growth and job creation are not inflationary. "It is very difficult for the Administration to say to Wall Street that we will do everything we can not to push growth beyond the current pace," Mr. Reich said, "and then turn around to Main Street and say we will do everything we can to bring about more jobs. But as long as we stay on the present path, we don't have to engage in the debate."
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Reich and other Administration officials also argue that the Administration's labor program will help to hold down inflation by making the labor force more flexible. They point specifically to programs like subsidized worker retraining, subsidies to help unemployed workers become self-employed and Government help in finding new jobs for the unemployed. The Administration's Re-Employment Act, introduced in March, embodies some of these goals. The jawboning of the credit markets seems to include an appeal to Congress to pass the bill.
"I don't think that anybody can say with scientific precision what is the exact rate of unemployment that starts to lead to an acceleration in inflation," said Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy. "But I think our view is that whatever that rate is, our goal should be to lower it, through increasing the productivity of workers and the efficiency with which they move from job to job. I believe that over the long run, financial markets will come to recognize this."
Maybe. But right now there appears to be a gap. While many Administration officials say the unemployment rate -- now at 6.4 percent -- can fall below 6 percent without becoming inflationary, the credit markets say the danger point is above that level.
"Let's say that in August, the unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent; would we get another rate hike?" asked Mr. Giordano of Goldman, Sachs. "Probably. The inflation watch would begin. If the Federal Reserve did not raise rates, then the credit market would come under pressure to push up rates on its own."
Similarly, the credit markets seem to accept as noninflationary President Clinton's original goal of creating eight million new jobs in four years, or nearly 170,000 a month. But it is not so sanguine about the present, much higher level of job creation.
"Job growth beyond 200,000 a month is a trajectory that will blow us through full employment," said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "Bondholders ask, 'What is your job growth forecast; how do you see it for the next few months?' If you tell them 250,000 a month, they walk away saying there is going to be trouble with inflation. They are not thinking of it as jobs, but as more income, more spending, more demand for scarce resources, more overheating."
The credit markets represent the nation's most important lenders, the people and institutions who have lent trillions of dollars through the purchase of bonds. They view inflation as dangerous because it can erode the purchasing power of their money while it is still out on loan. So they demand higher rates to offset this loss.
 
The Rise in Rates
 That began to happen last fall, as the national economy, and job growth, entered a period of greater strength than at any time since 1989. Although interest rates on loans of two years or more were creeping up, the Federal Reserve delayed action until early February. But the Fed's quarter-point increases in short-term interest rates in February, March and April were rejected as too small by bondholders. They pushed up long-term interest rates, until the Fed last week put through a half-point rate increase that seemed at least temporarily to calm the markets.
Now, there is concern that long-term rates could rise further, if job growth and the economy strike the credit markets as too strong, and the unemployment rate continues to fall.
"We can't control the short-term fluctuations in the credit market," Mr. Sperling said. "What we can do is focus on the long-term steps that pave the way for an economy that can handle increased job growth, while still keeping inflation low."

HEADLINE: Business Objects to a Code in China

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration approaches a June 3 deadline for renewing China's favored trade status, American companies with operations in China are being asked by human rights campaigners to embrace a code of conduct that many of them do not like.
A prominent rights group, Human Rights Watch, is urging such companies to adopt a voluntary code that includes proposals that American companies not use products made by prison labor, discourage political indoctrination in the workplace, and encourage their senior executives to discuss rights abuses with Chinese officials. 
 The proposal, a form of which has also circulated as proposed legislation in Congress for several years, has drawn a swift and negative reaction from big American companies.
Many of these companies -- which include Motorola, General Electric, International Business Machines and Xerox -- have significant investments in China, or they regard China as a major market. They have lobbied strenuously in Congress and at the White House to preserve China's trade benefits as a way of retaining and expanding American companies' share of expanding Chinese markets.
 
No Moral Responsibility
 They say that embracing such codes of behavior would undermine their competitiveness and raise suspicions in the Chinese Government.
"The impetus of laying on the American business community a corporate code of conduct simply gives credence to the idea that business is morally responsible for the human rights situation in China," said Robert A. Kapp, president of the United States-China Business Council, a group that promotes commercial links between the two countries. "We don't accept that."
While there is some sentiment in Congress for a voluntary code, China's stiffest critics, like Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, think that Congressional efforts should now focus on whether to revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status, and on other potential sanctions.
Ms. Pelosi said she supported a voluntary code of conduct, but did not see that as a substitute for canceling Chinese trade privileges. She said she found corporate opposition to voluntary standards of conduct difficult to understand.
"The business community resisted this in the past, as now," Ms. Pelosi said. "I think it's ironic that the business community opposes a voluntary code of conduct. How do you oppose something that's voluntary."
Richard Dicker, an associate counsel for Human Rights Watch in New York, said American companies would signal their support for American policies in support of human rights by adopting a code of minimum conduct.
"The objective here on our part is to insure that U.S. business operations in China do not encourage or contribute to oppressive practices, and in a positive way contribute to the human rights climate by taking a positive approach," he said.
The question of voluntary codes for American business abroad was first raised in 1977 by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan of Philadelphia. who outlined principles for how companies should operate under apartheid in South Africa, in ways that were sensitive to black aspirations.
 
Inapt Comparison Seen
 Human Rights Watch tries to draw parallels between the Sullivan Principles for South Africa and its proposed code of conduct in China. But American companies reject both the analogy and the proposal.
"In China, it would be particularly inappropriate because of the nature of the Chinese economy -- the economy being state-directed while moving toward some market freedom," said Robert McNeill, executive vice chairman of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, which represents leading American businesses. "In China, companies would be seen as agents of the U.S. Government," Mr. McNeill said. "And the danger with codes of conduct that are initially voluntary is that they can become statutory."
Mr. Kapp said American companies would not accept efforts to impose rules of conduct on their China operations.
"There is a great uneasiness about notions of codes of conduct," he said. "First, it becomes a process of public shaming. It is very easy to say things that sound good. No. 2, the advocates of heavy economic pressure against China, to compel China to change its domestic political behavior, believe they are dealing with universal values. That is one of the explanations for what I believe is a cavalier approach to national sovereignty."
The five voluntary measures proposed by Human Rights Watch would prohibit the use of prison products by American companies, discourage compulsory political indoctrination in the workplace, embrace nondiscriminatory employment practices -- which means not discharging people for their political beliefs, allow workers to discuss work-related issues freely, and have American executives discuss human rights issues in their localities with Chinese officials.
Timothy Kellogg, director of corporate communications for Motorola, said the company felt comfortable with its rules.
"We have a very strict internal code of conduct that has been translated into Chinese," Mr. Kellogg said of the code used in Motorola's $120 million semiconductor and pager manufacturing plant in Tianjin. "What we have in place is more than adequate. Any effort that goes beyond that appears to make us a Government agent."
George Jamison, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, said G.E. had not made any public statement on corporate guidelines.
Mr. Jamison said China was an important market for the company, adding, "Over the next decade we have $13.5 billion in potential export opportunities."
 
Pride in Chinese Employees
 Several business groups, including the Emergency Committee for American Trade, have been distributing details of American business activity in China to legislators and Administration officials. In one such packet, I.B.M. called China its fastest-growing market, and said that its 385 Chinese employees "leave the security of the socialist system that provides subsidized housing, education, and medical care to experience risk and reward in the Chinese marketplace." I.B.M. said it contributed more than $1 million last year to a hospital, a model-classrooms project and the state-run Beijing Film Academy.
Similarly, Xerox said it backed "human resource development" through financial support of a management institute in Dalian and a training center in Shenzhen. The company said it "supported cultural activities primarily in Shanghai and contributed to the overall well-being of its Chinese employees by offering thoroughly modern working conditions and facilities in China."
But Representative Pelosi, who has led Congressional efforts to revoke China's preferred trade status because of its rights abuses, described such corporate drum-beating as off the mark. "We're talking about fundamental rights," she said. "They support cultural activities. Isn't that nice. I find it disingenuous."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Human Right Guidelines"
 
Human Rights Watch wants American companies doing business in China voluntarily abide by these five principles:
 
Companies will try not to use prison labor or purchase products made by prisoners, because conditions in Chinese forced-labor plants violate international human rights standards.
 
Companies will not permit compulsory political indoctrination in the workplace, a practice common in state-owned enterprises.
 
Companies will embrace non-discriminatory employment practices, which in this context primarily means keeping workers' political beliefs out of hiring and firing decisions.
 
Companies will encourage freedom of association and expression concerning work-related issues in their plants.
 
Compaies will have senior American executives discuss human rights issues with Chinese officials in their localities and reinforce the idea that human rights abuses cause problems with business relationships.

HEADLINE: Villalba Journal;
How Don Calo (and Patton) Won the War in Sicily

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VILLALBA, Sicily

 BODY:
Biagio Plumeri sits at the desk of the man a lot of people around here regard as a key to the Allies' speedy occupation of Sicily in World War II.
Mr. Plumeri, a 55-year-old tomato farmer who has been part-time mayor on and off since 1967, is not much troubled that President Clinton will not stop at Villalba in June when he visits Italy to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Rome by Allied forces. 
 Mr. Clinton, who will attend the D-Day commemorations in France, plans to visit Anzio and Nettuno, the beaches between Rome and Naples where Allied forces went ashore on the Italian mainland in January 1944. But the Allies actually stepped into Europe six months earlier, on July 9-10, 1943, when American soldiers of Gen. George Patton's Seventh Army and British troops of Gen. Sir Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army made amphibious landings at Licata and Gela and along the beaches of Sicily's southern coast. A month later, the island was in Allied control.
"We don't really mark the day," Mayor Plumeri admitted.
Villalba's moment of glory came in 1943 because of one of Mr. Plumeri's predecessors, a prosperous local farmer named Calogero Vizzini, known locally as Don Calo. Mussolini's Fascists hated him; the American invaders named him Mayor, and most people around here say he was considerably more than just a footnote in the history of the invasion.
"They came up Route 121 from Caltanissetta, armored vehicles, jeeps," Mr. Plumeri recounted, mixing childhood memories with what older folks had told him about that sunny day. "One tank was hit near the turnoff when the Germans took them under fire, and a soldier died.
"One guy took a white sheet and fixed it to a pole, and we all walked out, even us little kids, like a parade. They only stayed 24 hours, and then pushed on to Palermo. But they named Don Calo mayor."
Don Calo, he said, had established his fortune in the town in 1922, before the Fascists came to power, when he led disgruntled peasants who grabbed land from the aristocratic absentee landlords. Every peasant got a plot, he said, but Don Calo, with characteristic forethought, kept more than 12,000 acres, for himself.
Among those who remember, sitting like lizards in the sun on benches around the town's main piazza, dressed in the customary black cardigans and soft peaked caps, oral history is at best an inexact science. But Don Calo is recalled as a kind of St. Francis in baggy high-rise trousers and suspenders.
"Don Calo was a magnanimous person, a good man, not vindictive, despite the many outrages committed," said Giuseppe Selvaggio, 72, who deserted his Italian Army unit in Rome at the twilight of the war and walked 40 days home to Sicily.
Sitting in the Catholic Men's Social Club, he described Don Calo as an indulgent man. "When the Fascist mayor and political secretary were supposed to be arrested," Mr. Selvaggio said, "Don Calo told the Americans: 'Let them go. They're good people. They aren't molesting anyone.' "
"The Vizzini family was anti-Fascist," he recalled. "They struggled against Mussolini, especially Calo Vizzini. He was under house arrest on his own property."
For decades after the war Vill alba's politics were rock-solid Christian Democratic, though in the last elections the majority voted for Silvio Berlusconi, the tycoon-turned-politician who is Prime Minister of a right-wing coalition. But no one ever much liked the Fascists around Villalba.
When Don Calo died in 1947, a death notice read: "He received from friends and foes alike, that most beautiful of all tributes: He was a gentleman."
Indeed, dozens of anti-Fascists like Don Calo were named mayors when the Americans arrived in Sicily, including Don Calo's friend Giuseppe Genco Russo, who was appointed mayor over in Mussomeli, a nearby farming village.
But in 1974, an Italian parliamentary commission investigating the resurgence of organized crime concluded that at the time of his appointment during the American Seventh Army's one-day visit to Villalba, Don Calo had probably been the boss of all bosses of the Mafia. Mr. Genco Russo, who later succeeded him, was at the time his No. 2.
When the black market sprouted in postwar economic confusion, the commission said, Don Calo's men ran it. When the Communists held a rally in Villalba in September 1944 that ended in a shootout, it said Don Calo probably sent in the gunmen.
In his book, "Crime in America," Senator Estes Kefauver wrote how in the course of investigating organized crime in the United States, he found indications that American intelligence agencies used Mafiosi to contact anti-Fascist figures in Sicily before the invasion. That could explain why Sicily fell rather quickly.
Senator Kefauver said that Moses Polakoff, the lawyer for Meyer Lansky, had told him about being a go-between for Naval Intelligence with Lucky Luciano, who was born the next big town up from Villalba.
After the war, stories sprouted and became legend. One had it that when the American tanks arrived in Villalba, Luciano himself jumped from one of them to embrace Don Calo.
Most historians caution against such reports. But Nicola Cattedra, a former editor of l'Ora, a Palermo paper, and author of the book "The Black Line," has revived the debate.
"I don't want to criminalize the United States," Mr. Cattedra said. "But they met formidable resistance, and then after only a very few days, they arrived in Palermo. The Americans wanted to win the war, and they found a group within the country that counted."

Index Reaches 3 1/2-Year High In Broad Commodities Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Led by gains in cocoa, coffee and soybeans, commodity prices rallied broadly yesterday, pushing up an important market index.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a widely watched gauge of inflation, climbed to a three-and-a-half year high. The index rose as high as 238.54, its highest since October 1990, before receding to 238.36, up 4.67, its fourth consecutive gain. Of its 21 components, all but petroleum and orange juice were higher.
 
Cocoa at 4-Year High
 Cocoa prices surged to a four-year high, with July cocoa rising $130 to $1,397 a ton on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, helped by the recent rise in coffee prices. Almost one-third of the world's cocoa is produced in the Ivory Coast, where reduced shipments of coffee contributed to a 56 percent rise in coffee prices this month. Coffee for July delivery gained 8.15 cents, to $1.3905 a pound, its highest price in five years. 
 Dry weather drove soybeans to their highest prices in 10 months on concerns that dry weather in the Midwest could damage the 1994-95 crop. A mass of high pressure could move over the Midwest next week, Mike Palmerino, a senior agricultural meteorologist with the Weather Services Corporation, said.
The soybean contract for delivery in July rose as high as $7.3250 a bushel, its daily limit, before retreating to settle 29.75 cents higher at $7.3225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The July wheat contract gained 10 cents, to $3.3675 a bushel, while July corn gained 6.5 cents to $2.7525 a bushel.
"The idea of no rain over the Memorial Day weekend has the market nervous," Doug Jackson, an analyst with the Farmers Commodities Corporation in Des Moines, said. "Everyone's worried about a longer-term dry weather pattern."
 
Demand Rising for Copper
 Copper prices rose to 16-month highs yesterday. Traders said that European copper use could rise by 4 percent this year and that consumption by Korea, Taiwan and China would offset the decline from Japan, where recession has cooled demand.
Copper for July delivery rose 3.90 cent, to $1.0635 a pound, its highest since January 1993, on the Commodity Exchange of New York.
Gold prices also rose. Gold for delivery in June, the most active contract, rose $3.60, to $389.90 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange.
Crude oil, meanwhile, fell on the perception that a seasonal surge in demand for gasoline had not yet materialized. Crude for July delivery settled down 15 cents at $18.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline fell 0.39 cent, to 52.21 cents a gallon, and heating oil ended 0.41 cent lower, at 47.91 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Zaire Drifting Into Anarchy As Authority Disintegrates

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
After four years of political turmoil, Government authority here is simply dissolving away, leaving the cities and the countryside to pillaging soldiers and roaming gangs of thugs and bandits.
Zaire is coming to represent a new specter in Africa -- the stateless country. 
 Where once there was the "big-man rule" of President Mobutu Sese Seko, there is now what some Zairians are calling "no-man rule."
The President is still nominally in charge, but he is rarely seen or felt. The rapacious central authority that he personified for nearly three decades has so disintegrated that vast stretches of the interior are without any government and the congested capital is largely lawless.
The same phenomenon has been seen in Somalia, where the "technicals" -- carloads of gun-toting youths -- are now back in the streets of Mogadishu. It can also be seen in parts of West Africa, where fighting in Liberia and Sierra Leone has given way in places to more or less permanent anarchy. And Rwanda, one of Zaire's eastern neighbors, is slipping deeper into a chaotic civil war.
But Zaire, the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, could turn into "Somalia and Liberia rolled into one," a State Department memorandum warned last year.
Zaire's 40 million people have seen their living standards drop every year for more than a decade. The economy is in a shambles, with external debt at over $10 billion. Prices rise a hundredfold a year. There is virtually no investment.
The infrastructure is crumbling. About 85 percent of the 85,000 miles of roads that existed at independence in 1960 have reverted to bush. A satellite earth station has broken down, so national radio and television now has trouble reaching Kisangani, Lubumbashi and other cities.
Shaba Province, the mineral-rich area to the south that was the scene of turmoil in the 1960's and of invasions by Katangan rebels in 1977 and 1978, has declared autonomy. Many regard that as the first step toward secession.
AIDS is rife. A prevention program has been largely abandoned, so by all accounts the epidemic is soaring.
In March the international relief organization Doctors Without Borders undertook a survey of children up to 5 years of age in Kinshasa. It found that 1 out of every 10 was malnourished and 1 out of 40 was starving.
The Cite, Kinshasa's sprawling slum, which houses more than a million people, is so depressed that even the nightclubs are quiet. Most people there eat one meal a day.
 
Government Services Are Breaking Down
 It is difficult to find any services that the Government provides. Schools and health clinics are closing. The sweltering streets of Kinshasa, with potholes the size of bomb craters, are crammed with pedestrians. There are no buses or other organized transportation except private open-air trucks.
Recently, the bridge to the port at Matadi needed $250,000 worth of repairs. The sum exceeded what was in the Government's coffers, and so it was raised by private companies.
Presiding over Zaire's descent into chaos is President Mobutu. Now 63, he took office in a coup in 1965 with the backing of the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared that instability could lead to Communism in the old Belgian Congo, and he has been Washington's point man in Central Africa more or less ever since.
Washington has made it clear that Mr. Mobutu is currently in disfavor because he is blocking democratic development. And he is something of an international pariah because he has looted Zaire, accumulating, one former minister testified, about $5 billion. The United States and Western European nations have refused him visas. Still, he survives.
And as conditions go from bad to worse, that old refrain that helped to preserve Western backing for him throughout the 1970's and 1980's -- when all is said and done, who else can hold the country together? -- is becoming fashionable again in some Western capitals.
 
Opposition Duels With Dictator
 Now Mr. Mobutu has embarked on a long and complicated political game with the opposition. In response to the growing discontent, he convened a National Conference four years ago to chart the country's future. It soon turned against him and came out with a new Constitution and even a new Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, an implacable opponent of Mr. Mobutu.
Eventually, Mr. Mobutu dismissed Mr. Tshisekedi and appointed a Prime Minister of his own, Faustin Birindwa. In March 1993, Mr. Tshisekedi was ejected from his office by soldiers, and the country ended up with two prime ministers, two Cabinets, even two Constitutions.
Now, there is an agreement on a new, single constitution, but the opposition is divided between hard-liners, who want nothing to do with Mr. Mobutu, and moderates, who believe they can work with him. And there is a suspicion that the President is back in effective control.
There is a sense of stalemate to it all. Frederic Kibassa Maliba, head of the overall opposition coalition called the Sacred Union, sat in the shade of a tree in his backyard and put it this way: "On the one side, there's Mobutu. He has no popularity, only his army and his printing press to make money. On the other is the people. We have no army, we have no money. We can't overthrow him and he can't overcome us."
Mr. Tshisekedi, a husky man of 61 with gold-framed glasses and a round face, will not relinquish his claim to the premiership or agree to work with his archenemy. "I'm not a rebel," he insisted, ensconced in an office behind his well-guarded yellow house on the outskirts of town. "It's Mobutu who is the rebel."
In the middle of all this, Mr. Mobutu has withdrawn into a peculiar semiretirement. He rarely ventures out of his pink-marble palace in Equator Province, 700 miles to the north. His grip, exerted through half a dozen intelligence and police agencies, is perhaps less suffocating than it was.
The last time the President came to the capital, he spent the night not at one of his luxurious mansions but at the headquarters of the Special Presidential Police, apparently out of concern for his safety.
 
Mobutu's Image Now More Muted
 A decade or two ago, the President, sometimes called "The Guide" or even "The Messiah," seemed omnipresent. His image and his totems of office -- a leopard-skin cap and an elaborate hand-carved ebony cane -- were everywhere: on the currency, in the newspaper, framed over the desk of every major bureaucrat.
Now his image is fading somewhat. The evening television no longer begins with a montage that depicts him floating down from the clouds. "Mobutuism," a hodgepodge of aphorisms and Chinese Communist-style exhortations that once was official doctrine, is no longer taught in the schools.
Perhaps more surprising are the number of opposition newspapers, dozens of them, with names like Storm of the Tropics and The Beacon. They appear irregularly and, since few can buy them, they are draped over lengths of string on the roadsides, where they attract crowds.
One such paper, Umoja, recently printed a cartoon depicting the President strangling a poor Zairian. That would have been cause enough for execution some years back.
There are also half a dozen human rights organizations. "We are not accepted by the regime, we are tolerated," said Bruno Lokuta Lyengo, vice president of one group, Voice of the Voiceless.
He said vast rights violations continued, with people kidnapped from their homes or stopped at gunpoint and taken to secret detention centers. "In a way it's gone from bad to worse," he said. "What's unsettling is that the state is only in quasi-existence. If the state ceases to exist, it's the law of the jungle out there and only the strong will survive. The strong are the ones with the guns."
 
Security Forces Remain Menacing
 The army, with 40,000 troops, and the police, with 30,000 officers, are perennial sources of danger, underpaid and continuously on the prowl. They station themselves on the roads to levy fines for imaginary traffic offenses, and rent themselves out to provide security for hotels and businesses and even visitors. They have even taken to begging for soap.
Twice in recent years they went on rampages, pillaging homes and shops and killing scores of people: in September 1991, when they were owed back pay, and in February 1993, when they found that the newly minted currency they were being paid in was not accepted by shopkeepers.
To try to head off further unrest, in April the military raised the soldiers' salaries to 2,000 New Zaires a month, or the equivalent of about $4. But a recent study found that a family of six needs $80 a month to get by.
The staggering inflation comes largely because the Central Bank simply prints money whenever more is needed. Huge stacks of currency are sometimes required to buy a round of beer. To make larger purchases, visitors took to carrying backpacks. At one point, $1 fetched 4.5 million Zaires, then 7.2 million, then 9 million.
Three times in recent years the bank has issued totally new currency to try to solve the liquidity problem. During a much ballyhooed monetary reform in October, the New Zaire was set at 3 to the dollar. By February it had fallen to 115. Now it is at 460 and sliding rapidly.
In stores the goods are coded by numbers, and customers have to check a giant blackboard up front to find out the prices. The true rate of exchange is set many times a day by illegal money traders who congregate in a park nicknamed Wall Street, close to the United States Embassy.
 
Economic Outlook Is Still Gloomy
 There is little prospect that Zaire will solve its economic troubles any time soon. The main exports, cobalt and copper from Shaba, have effectively halted. The machinery has broken down, the foreign workers fled and many mines were destroyed and flooded during fighting. Last year the main company, Gecamines, produced only 10 percent of what it did in 1990.
Western aid donors have turned away. The United States Agency for International Development, which pumped some $900 million into Zaire beginning in 1965, has closed down its operations. The World Bank, citing the country's arrears, also pulled up stakes. Last year Zaire paid just $5 million to all debtors, out of roughly $500 million due in interest alone.
Almost without being noticed, the country is breaking apart. The most remote province, Kivu, a prime food-growing area, cannot move its goods westward. So it trades almost exclusively with Tanzania and Kenya. Kasai refuses to recognize the new currency and so still uses the old one. Shaba, in addition to declaring autonomy, has been the scene of ethnic violence as Katangans turned against Kasais and expelled them, displacing about 400,000 people.
Throughout much of the country, travel is hazardous. The only artery connecting the capital with the vast interior is the churning Congo River, choked with waterlilies, much as it was the only artery in 1877 when Henry Morton Stanley stood on its banks and described it for readers of The New York Herald.

HEADLINE: U.S., Japan Back Talks On Trade

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
After four days of talks, American and Japanese trade experts reached broad agreement today on a new format to revive their stalled negotiations intended to open Japan's closed markets to more imports from abroad, American officials said.
Barring any last-minute hitches, the two sides will announce the new negotiating format Tuesday. 
 [Early on Tuesday, Reuters reported that the talks had ended, with both sides saying an announcement would be made later in the day.]
The framework is meant to rescue the trade negotiations the United States and Japan established last July, but which collapsed in acrimony in February when the White House accused the Japanese of resisting any serious measures to open their markets. The Japanese, in turn, accused Washington of trying to set quotas for American exports to Japan.
The tentative deal clearly involves concessions by both sides. Essentially, the Japanese agreed to drop their opposition to quantitative and qualitative indicators that would measure if they are indeed opening their closed markets, the officials said.
 
Specific Targets Dropped
 The United States agreed to forgo demanding that Japan meet any specific numerical targets for imports -- from either the United States or the world at large -- in any of the five areas covered by the accord. Those are Japanese automobiles, auto parts, insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications equipment.
The United States also agreed that it would not deem Japan in noncompliance with any future accord if Tokyo did not show progress on every numerical indicator. For example, the two sides agreed that one way to measure if Japan's auto market was opening was by counting the number of Japanese car dealers displaying American cars in their showrooms.
Another indicator would be to measure not only the number of showrooms with American cars, but also their geographic spread around Japan, and whether they are just in Tokyo, or in other cities as well.
Each sector has seven or eight such indicators to measure progress, and as long as Japan shows progress on some indicators in any given sector -- even if it is not necessarily showing progress in all of them -- the United States will not threaten trade sanctions, officials said.
"What we wanted is a framework that gives us the ability to measure results," said the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, who along with two trade experts, W. Bowman Cutter and Charlene Barshevsky, worked out the new arrange ment. "What the Japanese side wanted was assurance that they would not be held to numerical quotas for imports in any one sector. Both sides are moving toward accommodation of their respective concerns."
The United States also agreed to qualitative indicators on its part to show whether it was making an earnest effort to enter the Japanese markets. For instance, the Japanese said they would want to measure the number of American companies teaching Japanese to sales personnel working the Japanese market, and also the number of American companies conducting seminars and other educational programs on how to do business in Japan.
American officials said what was striking about the negotiations was that the Japanese originally came to Washington saying that they were here only for "exploratory talks" and could not make any agreements.
 
Desires of Japanese
 Twice when the Japanese bureaucrats who were involved in the negotiations appeared to be dragging their heels or stonewalling the American side, Mr. Kantor telephoned Japan's Foreign Minister, Koji Kakazawa, and a few hours later the Japanese negotiators adopted a more flexible approach.
American officials said this underscored to them the degree to which the new Japanese Government wanted a breakthrough with the Americans on the trade dispute, possibly to demonstrate to the Japanese public that the new Cabinet of Prime Minister Tutsomo Hata can manage that country's most important bilateral relationship.
But some American trade analysts wondered aloud if the American side, also eager to get these talks back on track, might have given away too much.
"We still don't know the details, but what bothers me is the idea that if the Japanese don't meet all their goals, we will not do too much about it," said Lawrence Chimerine, economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, which tends to take a hard line on Japan-American trade issues. "To make this work, there has to be some kind of penalty or sanction for non-compliance, otherwise what is the purpose."
 
A Deal Before July
 All that was agreed to at this stage is a framework for the negotiations. Now the hard bargaining on the details begins. The two countries are aiming to make a deal final before the annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial democracies scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples.
The mere resumption of the United States-Japan trade talks, though, has both economic and political ramifications for both Governments. In economic terms, it help strengthen the dollar in world currency markets, which will also take some of the pressure off the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.
Ever since Japan and the United States broke off the trade talks with Tokyo last Feb. 11, currency traders have driven up the value of the yen and driven down the value of the dollar on the assumption that the United States wanted a weaker dollar in order to squeeze Japan into making trade concessions. When the yen rises in value it makes all of Japan's exports more expensive and harder to sell abroad.
Politically speaking, the resumption of trade talks removes an important thorn in ties between Washington and Tokyo in advance of the visit to the United States next month of the Emperor of Japan and in advance of the Group of Seven summit meeting. Neither the American nor Japanese side wanted to go into the Group of Seven meeting with a simmering trade war between them.
 
A Surplus for Japan
 The lastest trade figures out of Tokyo underscore the fact that Japan continues to export a lot more than it imports. Japan's worldwide trade surplus in April rose 8.1 percent, to $11.12 billion, from $10.29 billion a year earlier. Tokyo's surplus with the United States jumped 8.9 percent in April, to $4.38 billion, from $4.02 billion a year earlier.
But just as the Clinton Administration appeared to be putting one major trade headache behind it, another new one emerged. Last Friday in Geneva a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruled illegal an American boycott against tuna that is caught in huge nets that also kill dolphins.
The GATT tribunal ruled that a longstanding American law intended to protect dolphins, who often swim with tuna, is an illegal trade barrier. The complaint was brought against the United States by European Union on behalf of some European tuna processors who buy tuna from Mexico and other countries that use the purse seine nets that trap tuna and dolphins together.
The GATT ruling is politically very sensitive because it goes to the heart of a major complaint in Congress about the GATT agreement: that it allows international bureaucrats in Geneva to override American laws and values. This debate is known in the trade world as "GATTzilla versus Flipper," and it has strong resonance on Capitol Hill -- not only among environmentalists opposed to the new world trade agreement, but others who worry that it will limit American sovereignty generally.
"This decision is proof positive that environmental laws are undermined by GATT," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citzen's Trade Program. "Many laws will be found illegal by GATT and then Congress must eliminate the laws or face perpetual tuna sanctions."

Rising Commodity Prices Cause a Sharp Bond Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive trading day rising commodity prices were behind the sharp selloff in bonds, as investors focused on inflation and its potential to erode the value of their investments in the future.
Also contributing to yesterday's tumbling bond prices was the selling that often precedes a Treasury auction as dealers get rid of old bond notes to make room for the new ones and, possibly, bring down the price they have to pay for them. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 112/32 , to 8531/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 7.43 percent, from 7.30 percent on Friday and the highest since May 16. The bond price dropped Friday as the yield rose to 7.30 percent, from 7.23 percent Thursday.
Despite the surge in the yield, however, it is still comfortably within the the trading range of the last two months, with a low of 7.10 percent and a high of 7.63 percent.
David Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said that with the Federal Reserve unlikely to move interest rates higher again soon, the market's focus shifted to commodity prices, this week's Treasury auctions and the dollar.
The Commodity Research Bureau Index, a basket of commodities considered by many as a gauge of future inflation, rose 4.67, to 238.36, its highest daily close since October 1990, when it reached 242.81. It still has a long way to go to get back to its level of 272 in 1988.
While a lot of the surge in the index is due to weather, Mr. Jones said there were signals that were worrying investors.
"While there has been a sharp increase in the C.R.B. index, the strength has mostly been in grains, which are more sensitive to the bad weather," Mr. Jones said. "But investors are beginning to see early indications of price pressures in the industrial commodities area of the index, like oil, lumber, and copper."
These components he noted, surged to push the index higher earlier in the day. "And while grains are volitile , the underlying pressures in the industrial commodities point to an expanding economy and that is the attention getter," he said.
"Oil, for instance, which has shown a significant increase this month, will be seen in the May Consumer Price Index next month. "
Mr. Jones said at the Treasury auctions this week, the five-year note auction tomorrow is that one that seems to be worrying traders and dealers.
"In general, short-maturity auctions have gone well, and the two-year note auction is not expected to do poorly," he said. "But there is some concern about the five-year issue and that is why you saw some positioning in the street for the auctions."
And finally there is the question of the dollar, which was not expected to weaken with the economy growing fast enough to draw five Fed increases in short-term rates since February. "A weaker dollar is a reinforcing element in inflation," Mr. Jones said, noting that a falling dollar makes imports more expensive. "Some wonder if this weakness in fact is a vote against the Clinton foreign policy, or its domestic effectiveness. I sense an element of uneasiness on foreign policy, but you can't prove that." He said that a recent hint of economic recovery in Germany had helped the German mark and pushed the dollar lower.
With no economic news yesterday and the first report of the week, April durable goods orders, not scheduled until tomorrow, investors were easily distracted.
Trading in two and five-year note issues saw yields rise ahead of the auctions, as prices dropped in order to clear dealer inventories faster. In when-issued trading the yield on a two-year note, to be auctioned today, rose 15 basis points, to 5.96 percent, while the five-year note, to be auctioned tomorrow, rose 17 basis points, to 6.76 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Traders said the higher yields also meant that it will be easier for the dealers to move the paper coming to market this week.
Some analysts believe the market may also be looking ahead to this week's real gross domestic product data for the first quarter. In the first revision of the first quarter's growth rate, the Commerce Department is expected to report a growth rate of 2.3 percentm on Friday, according to a survey by the Reuters news service. The original growth estimate released last month put the growth at 2.6 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.931	97.646	Discounted Rate	4.23%	4.63%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.81%	High Price	98.933	97.652	Discounted Rate	4.22%	4.62%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.80%	Low Price	98.928	97.646	Discounted Rate	4.24%	4.63%	Coupon Yield	4.35%	4.81%	Accepted at low price	9%	66%	Total applied for	$53,690,902	$53,822,995	Accepted	$12,782,621	$12,639,955	Noncompetitive	$1,414,556	$1,204,039	
 
Both issues are dated May 26,1994. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 25, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 24, 1994.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
After the fall of his airline magazines, an executive aims for a smoother ride with sports yearbooks.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A MEDIA advertising executive whose network of in-flight magazines prospered mightily, only to collapse when the airline industry retrenched, is seeking to replicate his earlier success in a more earthbound arena.
Jeffrey S. Butler founded the East/ West Network in 1968 and built it into a company that at its peak published and sold the advertisements in 19 magazines available to passengers of airlines like Continental, Eastern, Pan Am, Trans World and United. By offering marketers one-stop access to affluent fliers through a network of regional and national publications with controlled circulations, East/ West's advertising revenues reached $50 million to $60 million a year in the 1980's. 
 But by 1992, as many airlines combined, filed for bankruptcy or stopped flying, Mr. Butler's empire had shrunk to three titles -- then, one by one, to none. East/West closed, making it one of the largest, and most notable, media company casualties of the recent industry recession.
"I spent 23 years of my life on that," Mr. Butler recalled ruefully in a telephone interview.
"The first 20 years were fantastic," he added. "The last three, it was like watching the world go away. Every day when I picked up the paper, there was more bad news."
Looking to start over, Mr. Butler explored fields that he said "would offer big growth potential." Sports came to mind, because, as he put it, "I don't think the Knicks and the Bulls are going to merge."
Through a serendipitous encounter with a next-door neighbor, Mr. Butler said, he learned that the Loeb Partners Corporation had invested in a small, money-losing company called Sports Media Inc., which published the yearbooks that eight sports teams distributed to season ticket holders and sold in arena and stadium souvenir shops.
"The idea was that if a national sports network could be created, " he said, "it would open up an advertising opportunity."
Sports Media, which is based in New York, hired Mr. Butler as chairman and chief executive in July 1992. Since then, he has been assiduously seeking to make lightning strike twice, albeit at a lower elevation the second time.
Sports Media now has licensing agreements with 47 professional teams to publish their yearbooks, with a goal of 60 by the summer. It also distributes yearbooks that seven baseball teams publish on their own.
The company is also expanding the sales territories of the yearbooks to tap into the growing interest in teams outside their local markets. For instance, coverage of the games of the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs and New York Mets by so-called cable television superstations has gained those teams fans across the country. So the yearbooks, which usually cost $6.95 a copy, are being sold through sporting goods chains like Herman's and Oshman's, bookstores like Barnes & Noble and B. Dalton, and newsstands, as well as at traditional venues like game sites.
And Sports Media has established an advertising sales network that enables marketers like American Express, Pepsi-Cola and Sony to buy, if they choose, an ad in every yearbook at an average cost estimated at $180,000 a year. Mr. Butler said ad pages had averaged around eight per yearbook, adding that Sports Media would break even at 15 pages per yearbook.
Yearbook advertising sales revenues for Sports Media, in the fiscal years ending July 31, were $176,589 in 1992; $359,694 in 1993, and a projected $943,000 in 1994. In the 1995 fiscal year, revenues from football advertising are estimated by John Peasley, vice president for advertising, at $1 million to $1.5 million, with revenues from basketball advertising at similar or higher levels.
Yearbooks are clearly "a niche business," said Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing Report, a newsletter in Chicago that covers the sports marketing industry.
"They're probably bought more by the hard-core fans with intense interests," he added, partly because their partisan editorial content made them "more like fan magazines."
And while yearbooks are "a marketing tool for a team," Mr. Friedman said, they face competition from many sources, including newspapers and newsletters, both authorized and unauthorized, aimed at a team's fans; game programs, and publications like Sports Illustrated and USA Today Baseball Weekly.
Still, Mr. Butler is sanguine about the prospects for Sports Media.
"There's a passion for sports," he said, adding that in his East/West days, he attracted potential advertisers to luncheons by presenting colorful airline industry executives like Herbert D. Kelleher, the chairman, president and chief executive of Southwest Airlines.
"But it's not the same thing as meeting a team," Mr. Butler said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Signs of a Rise in Inflation Send Dollar Falling Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday as signs of surging inflation in the United States prompted traders to dump American assets.
But the dollar eked out a gain against the yen amid optimism that the United States and Japan would break an impasse in trade relations during talks in Washington. 
 "People are still very bearish about the dollar," said Tom Hoge, vice president of corporate currency trading at the Bank of New York. "Nobody is comfortable holding American assets."
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 futures contracts, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose as high as 238.54 yesterday, its highest level in three and a half years, driven by gains in cocoa, coffee, soybeans and copper.
"Higher commodities prices are scaring away dollar buyers," said David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Inflation is the worst thing for a currency."
Currency trading was less active than usual yesterday because many European markets were closed for the Whitsun holiday. London, the world's largest foreign exchange center, was open.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6433 marks, down from 1.6470 marks yesterday.
Optimism about trade talks between the United States and Japan kept the dollar from falling against the yen yesterday, traders said. The dollar rose to 104.40 yen in New York, from 104.25 yen on Friday.
American and Japanese negotiators met for a fourth day today to try to restart formal negotiations, which broke down in February. Progress in trade talks would help the dollar because the Clinton Administration is considered less likely to call for a strong yen if the Japanese make concessions aimed at curbing their trade surplus with the United States. The dollar fell against the yen last year after President Clinton and his aides said a strong yen would trim the surplus by making Japan's exports more costly.
In other trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.5075, down from $1.5065 in New York late Friday. The dollar fell to 5.6255 French francs from 5.6315 francs and to 1.4045 Swiss francs from 1.4060 francs. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.64 United States cents, from 72.48 United States cents on Friday.

HEADLINE: Greek Telecom Offering Set

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATHENS, May 23

 BODY:
Greece announced today that it would sell up to 25 percent of the state telecommunications company on the stock market this year, in a move intended to energize the Athens stock exchange, which has been reeling from a currency crisis.
The profitable Greek Telecommunications Organization, scheduled for sale since 1990, will be offered on the stock market, and an unspecifed stake will be for sale in the United States and Japan, the National Economy Minister, Yannos Papandoniou, said. 
 The move to sell shares in the company, which shows annual operating profits of more than $600 million, was eagerly awaited as a way of injecting life into the Athens stock exchange and attracting fresh capital, analysts said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Seen at 3.6%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The United States economy is set to grow at a 3.6 percent pace this year despite aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve to restrain the pace of business activity, a leading group of economists said today.
In an annual survey, the National Association of Business Economists forecast that growth would not ease until 1995, when it will still rise 2.8 percent. 
 The economy grew 3 percent last year. In the first quarter of 1994, the growth rate slipped to 2.6 percent, but the association expects it to rebound to 3.4 percent before the middle of the year.
Last week, the Fed raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. It was the fourth time the Fed has tightened credit this year.
The survey found that so far this year inflation is scarcely a problem. It predicted that the Consumer Price Index would rise 2.8 percent for the year, up slightly from the 2.7 percent of last year.

Owners Propose Givebacks by Players

 BODY:
Major league owners proposed a series of givebacks on non-economic issues yesterday, prompting DONALD FEHR, the head of the players' union, to say management doesn't want an agreement.
"There are a whole series of player benefits that have been negotiated over the last 20 years that they want to restrict or eliminate," Fehr said after a 3 1/2-hour session at an airport hotel in Los Angeles, the second meeting between the sides in five days. 
 Fehr said management presented proposals dealing with schedules, termination of pay for released players and trade demands. He said the owners want to eliminate service time for players called up in September, which would delay players from becoming eligible for arbitration and free agency.
"That's an extraordinary proposal," Fehr said. "You would get a player up for a contending team to help them get into the playoffs, but he wouldn't get any major league credit for it. Those are not the kinds of proposals -- that have been in place for years and years -- that are likely to create the impression that clubs are desirous of reaching an agreement."
These were the first management proposals since owners reopened the collective bargaining agreement on Dec. 7, 1992. Management's negotiator, RICHARD RAVITCH, has said he intends to propose a salary cap. He said of yesterday's meeting:
"There was a long list of noneconomic items in the contract that the owners would like to see change. They listened. There was discussion about the historical genesis of why they were in the agreement the way they were. Nothing was agreed upon; it wasn't expected it would be." (AP)

HEADLINE: So Inviting, So . . . Sony;
Can a Public Plaza Be Too Corporate?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
When the public spaces on the ground floor of 550 Madison Avenue were run by AT&T, they were spare, monumentally scaled and usually empty. Today, as Sony Plaza, they are colorful, more intimately scaled and often crowded. They are also -- unmistakably -- Sony's.
In an annex at one side of the atrium, midblock between 55th and 56th Streets, hang six blue banners, all but one bearing the Sony name. The banner for City Bakery proclaims "Sony Commissary"; for Gottfried's Newsstand, "Sony Plaza Newsstand." Banners mark the Sony Signatures store and the Sony Wonder Technology Lab, a new attraction opening tomorrow in the annex. Opposite are the Sony Style showrooms, with more Sony banners in what was an open-air arcade when the building served as AT&T headquarters. 
 As the finishing touches are put on Sony Plaza, the reworking has set off a debate over whether this accretion of corporate identity has created the impression that the atrium is more a private preserve than a public domain, as it was meant to be.
Many agree that Sony's redesign has made the space more attractive, and drawn more people. But Sony also made its own name a little too visible, some officials and urban planners say.
"It feels a lot like a Sony lobby," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "And that's not something that I'd like to see replicated around the city in other spaces."
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan has endorsed most of the changes made by the Sony Corporation of America as a "considerable improvement," but added that she is "nonetheless concerned that the overall effect of the plaza is overly commercial."
Community Board 5 in midtown Manhattan has opposed Sony's plan to install an 11-by-20-foot high-definition television screen on the ground floor of the annex to silently promote the Sony Wonder exhibition.
 
Renovation Meets Intense Scrutiny
 Sony's renovation, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, has become the subject of intense scrutiny because the spaces were provided as public amenities by AT&T under a 1978 agreement with New York City. In return for the public space, AT&T was granted a development bonus equal to nearly six floors of the 36-story tower, which it still owns.
Also as part of the deal, AT&T agreed to build a science museum, which became the Infoquest Center exhibition. In the four-story annex where Infoquest was housed, Sony has built its Wonder Technology Lab, designed by Edwin Schlossberg, which is to be free to the public.
Planners, architects and neighborhood leaders have wrestled for years with the question of what do when public amenities built by private developers fail to live up to expectations. Some have been completely changed, like the arcade at 2 Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side, which was turned into a branch of the Museum of American Folk Art. Others have simply languished.
What makes the Sony case of such interest is that it involves a high-profile tower (topped by its renowned Chippendale-style pediment) in one of the densest quarters of Manhattan, where office workers, shoppers, out-of-towners and street dwellers can make good use of benches, chairs and tables under large trees, in a controlled climate.
"There isn't a seat in the house at lunchtime," said H. Guy Leibler, the president and general manager of Sony Plaza Inc., which operates the atrium, stores and exhibition. "People are talking, eating, walking through. There are new people who are here every day. People from the neighborhood are starting to use this as a meeting place."
Sony has argued that the way to bring the public into the space is to enliven and make it more comfortable. One of the architects, Charles Gwathmey, said the idea behind the renovation was "to engage the public in a landscaped greenhouse space."
 "The misconception -- and there is one -- is that all of this is now private," Mr. Gwathmey told the architects' panel. "The only thing that's private are the retail stores. The amount of space that was taken in comparison to the bonus was, I think, minor. And the judgment always has to be the quality of the new space and the offerings of the new space."
Russell Sanders, an account representative from Avon Products, was visiting Sony Plaza the other day to check out its progress. He works nearby and recalled the atrium as a barren space through which a lot of litter blew.
He has noticed the growing use of the plaza and the growing Sony presence, too. "I think it's more commercial," Mr. Sanders said, "but my impression is that it's like commercials on television. If Sony wants to maintain the space, they're using the commercials to pay for it. That's the price to be paid for having the plaza."
Community Board 5, however, believes an important threshold will be crossed with the installation of the giant television in the atrium. By a vote of 23 to 14, it recommended rejection of the proposal, but the Planning Commission later approved it and Sony plans to install it.
"Inevitably, people will congregate before the video screen," said Nicholas Fish, the community board chairman. "That will certainly take away from the ability of other people to simply come and read a book or daydream without being assaulted visually.
"Public spaces should be as neutral and inviting as possible and really ought to be a refuge for people who want to escape from the hustle and bustle of midtown, rather than being another corporate theme space."
In the eyes of Amanda M. Burden, a member of the Planning Commission, the AT&T space was, if anything, too serene. "It wasn't usable," she said at a meeting of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. "It worked for the eye. It was beautiful to walk through -- wonderful shadows and light, wonderful monumentality. But it was really cold, physically cold, physically uncomfortable."
 
A Convert to Sony's Side
 Although Ms. Burden originally opposed Sony's plans, she became a convert. And on April 20, she was one of seven commission members to vote in favor of the latest modifications proposed by Sony, including installation of the large television screen. Three members were opposed. Mr. Rose abstained.
Ms. Messinger also supported the changes. She said in her report to the planning commission that the suitability of the television screen depended on its programming.
Mr. Leibler, the Sony executive, said that two-thirds of those seated in the atrium would be able to ignore the screen if they chose. Those who cared to watch, he said, "will find the programming interesting, cultural and very reflective of what's happening in Sony Wonder" -- not at all commercial, and unconnected with any Sony product.
 
 
 
TECHNOLOGY, SONY STYLE
 The Sony Wonder Technology Lab, which opens tomorrow, is a hands-on showcase of technological innovation, geared mainly to children. The exhibition is reached by an elevator at the north end of the Sony Plaza atrium, on 56th Street, off Madison Avenue.
The displays include dozens of screens and speakers that present the history of modern communication; a small theater with a large-screen high-definition television, and studios that simulate television and music production, environmental research and planetary exploration.
 Admission is free. Sony Wonder is open Tuesdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., and Sundays, 12 P.M. to 6 P.M. It is closed Mondays.

2,801 Degrees Conferred On New Yale Graduates

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 23

 BODY:
Yale University held its 293d commencement today under sunny skies, conferring 2,801 degrees and provisionally awarding 218 law degrees. The law school's spring term ends after the university's commencement, and the law faculty votes on the degrees on June 1.
The Yale Concert Band performed as graduates filed into the university's historic Old Campus to be seated in front of a blue-and-white-striped canopy, under which school officials and others were seated. 
 Some graduates added personal touches to their attire. Graduates of the university's Divinity School attached halos made from pipe cleaners to their caps. Several rows back sat graduates of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies who had attached plastic branches, pine cones and grass to their caps.
The university chaplain, Federick Jerome Streets, began the ceremonies by joking about the summerlike weather, with temperatures in the 80's. "Please note, requests for clouds cannot be accommodated," he said.
 
Eight Honorary Degrees
 During the ceremony, Yale also awarded eight honorary degrees. Among those receiving degrees were Mario Vargas Llosa, the author; Jack B. Weinstein, senior Federal District Court judge, and Robert E. Cooke, professor emeritus, State University of New York at Buffalo.
Also receiving honorary degrees were Gladys Iola Tantaquidgeon, Mohegan medicine woman and founder and curator of the Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum; Amos Tversky, Davis-Brack Professor of Behavioral Science, Stanford University; Martin Puryear, artist; Kurt Masur, music director, New York Philharmonic, and Maxine Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
The graduates gave a standing ovation to Ms. Tantaquidgeon, who celebrates her 95th birthday on Tuesday.
There was no commencement speaker today. Sargent Shriver, the first director of the Peace Corps, spoke at the Class Day ceremony on Sunday.
After today's commencement, graduates attended ceremonies and received degrees at the Yale school or college they had attended.
 
Drew University
 MADISON, N.J., May 23 (AP) -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York told Drew University graduates today that drugs have weakened the nation and that they need to strive to make America great again.
Mr. Cuomo said he hoped that the graduates would look beyond the material luxuries their education would provide and would strive to restore those qualities "that made us great, that won the Second World War, that made us dominant in the world."
He said the nation now suffers from economic and educational inferiority, homelessness and drug addiction. "We lost it in the 1960's when we turned to things like heroin, cocaine and later crack because we became a little arrogant and self-satisfied," he said.
Mr. Cuomo was invited to give the commencement address to 413 graduates by Thomas H. Kean, Drew's president and former governor of New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Westchester Loses Bid to Force Cutting of Trees Near Airport

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, May 23

 BODY:
Westchester County today lost yet another bid to force four Connecticut landowners and the Town of Greenwich to cut down trees that the county says interfere with landings at the Westchester County Airport. But county officials said they would fight on.
In a decision announced today, the United States Supreme Court, without comment, let stand a Connecticut State Supreme Court ruling that blocked Westchester County's attempt to obtain an easement to trim or remove the trees. 
 But Marilyn Slaatten, the Westchester County Attorney, said that the easement was a small point and that she planned to go back to the Federal District Court to argue that the trees are a public nuisance and a safety hazard.
"The Supreme Court's decision was on just one question," Ms. Slaatten said. "We will probably be fighting this for another few years."
 
Number of Flights Drop
 Airplanes have been passing safely over the trees from the time the airport was built in the 1940's. But by 1988, the trees had grown so tall and the landings so steep that the airport was forced to shorten one of its two runways by 1,300 feet. Small private planes can still land on the runway but bigger commuter planes and corporate jets cannot. Takeoffs are not affected.
While the number of annual flights in and out of the airport has dropped to 180,000 from 200,000 in the last 10 years, the drop may have as much to do with the economy as the shortened runway, said Joseph J. Petrocelli, Westchester's acting commissioner of transportation.
Most of the trees are on the grounds of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a girls' school in Greenwich that is less than a mile from the airport in Harrison. Some are 75 feet high.
Cutting the trees and allowing planes to come in lower over the school's fields would pose a safety threat to the students, said Patrick Gaffney, a Manhattan lawyer whose firm represents the school without charge.
"Way before the airport was built and even before airplanes existed, these trees were growing," Mr. Gaffney said. "Many of the trees that the County of Westchester sought to have removed were over 100 years old."
 
Modernizing Airport
 The airport is undergoing a modernization that is expected to be completed next year. A parking garage and a new terminal will replace the World War II Quonset hut that has welcomed passengers since the 1940's.
If the trees had been in Westchester, the county could have claimed eminent domain. But because the trees were in Connecticut, though less than a mile away, the legal battle has lasted four years.
After two years of trying to negotiate a deal with the landowners to allow Westchester to trim some trees and cut and replace others, the county filed suit in 1990. The county won, with a Federal judge ruling that it was entitled to an easement because planes had flown over the property for so long without challenge.
But the landowners appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sent the case to Connecticut's highest state court for review. The landowners won that battle when the State Supreme Court ruled that Westchester could not tell Connecticut landowners what to do.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan Imperils City Hospitals

 BODY:
President Clinton's health-care plan, in the main a valuable reform effort, would inadvertently brutalize New York City hospitals. That is the opinion not only of local hospitals, but also of independent analysts. The problem for New York is that the President's plan -- and Congressional knock-offs like the recent proposal by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts -- would pay for universal coverage primarily by imposing gargantuan Medicare cuts that are unevenly distributed.
About half of Mr. Clinton's in-patient Medicare cuts would come from hospitals that train doctors and hospitals that serve indigent communities. New York hospitals do a lot of both: they account for 5 percent of national in-patient Medicare expenditures, and about 15 percent of Medicare's contributions toward medical training and indigent care. And though universal coverage would provide inner-city hospitals with a new revenue stream, the extra fees would not come close to making up for the lost Medicare and other reimbursements. 
 The Administration contends that hospitals can absorb Medicare cuts without cutting services. That might be true of hospitals in general. But it is not true of hospitals in New York City. They would be caught in a vise; Washington would squeeze revenues by cutting Medicare while Albany -- because it controls in-patient fees -- would prevent city hospitals from offsetting Medicare cuts by jacking up prices to non-Medicare patients.
Congress could take some of the bite out of Medicare cuts by applying those cuts across the board. For example, it could cut payments that now compensate hospitals for inflationary increases in medical prices -- a cut that would affect hospitals evenly. Instead, the President has proposed a small across-the-board cut and a huge 60 percent cut of money for medical training.
Some staff members of the Administration and of key Congressional committees admit that proposed Medicare cuts hit New York City unfairly. But they have been powerless to solve the problem because Congress is not ready to focus on details, and even if it were, it would be in no mood to figure out how to replace the lost Medicare savings. The danger is that Congress will succumb to temptation and pass reform that looks good on paper but pays for itself by ravaging inner-city hospitals.

HEADLINE: Lean on the Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Sanctions can work to restore democracy in Haiti -- if they are strong and if they are enforced. New, stiffer sanctions went into effect at midnight on Saturday. But as long as contraband gasoline flows freely across the border with the Dominican Republic, the U.N. embargo against Haiti exists in name only.
The immediate need is to get tough with the Dominican Republic, reminding its Government that these sanctions, approved by the United Nations, are mandatory and that those who ignore them will pay dearly for defying the international community. 
 U.N. investigators are now looking at violations of the embargo on the border; Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will decide what action to take after reading their confidential report.
Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is already signaling that it is not prepared to comply with the spirit of the embargo. In addition to its mandatory sanctions, the U.N. has called upon member states to freeze assets and revoke visas for supporters of Haiti's illegitimate military rulers. But the U.S. is only doing this selectively, exempting key supporters of the junta: the Mev, Brandt, Acra and Madsen families. Also, three Haitian senators who played important roles in the coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide reportedly will be allowed to keep their U.S. visas. These are precisely the people who need to be made most uncomfortable. Their privileges should be revoked.
Undermining the sanctions even as they go into effect is a dangerous policy. It increases the clamor for military intervention, and the likelihood that President Clinton, under pressure to achieve a foreign policy success, will conclude that an invasion of Haiti is not just an option but a necessity.
Pressure must be applied to the Dominican Republic, even though the results of recent presidential elections are unclear. Joaquin Balaguer, the incumbent President, claims victory but his opponent, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, says many of his followers were defrauded of their votes, and independent observers have backed up these claims.
Mr. Balaguer seems set to hunker down, as he did after the last questionable election, in 1990, and wait for the controversy to die down. No doubt he is hoping the United States, in its desire to preserve some semblance of stability on the island, will not make too much noise over election fraud.
That would be a mistake. While pushing the Dominican Government -- no matter who is in power -- to police its border, the U.S. also needs to support those who are trying to insure the fairness of the vote. In the Dominican Republic as in Haiti, long-term stability will come only one way: through democracy. This is not the time for mixed messages, on either side of the island.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
I.B.M. TO TRANSFER ADVERTISING WORK TO SINGLE AGENCY

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
I.B.M., in the largest shift in advertising history, unexpectedly announced yesterday that it would dismiss more than 40 agencies it has worked with around the world and move its entire account to a single shop, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. I.B.M., one of the world's biggest marketers, spends $400 million to $500 million annually on advertising.
The decision stunned Madison Avenue and is expected to reverberate for months. The changes were made without notice, so abruptly that in a couple of cases, some work by the agencies being dismissed has yet to appear. For most of the agencies, the losses are serious and might necessitate layoffs. In a couple of instances, they are potentially devastating. 
 At the same time, Ogilvy, which produces ads for brands like Pond's cold cream, Kimberly-Clark paper products, Shell gasoline and Duracell batteries, is expected to add staff. Ogilvy, one of the world's largest advertising agencies, was founded in New York City in 1948, where it continues to maintain its headquarters.
Advertising executives were also startled because the size of the account being united is more than twice as large as any previous consolidation, which have become increasingly common as more companies look to simplify their sales messages. A big account for an agency is usually a tenth the size of I.B.M.'s.
I.B.M.'s decision comes as the company tries to become leaner and more aggressive in a computer industry that it once dominated, making significant streamlining moves such as revamping its marketing force and laying off employees.
The decision, which takes effect a week from today, means that I.B.M. will call on a single agency to create campaigns for the I.B.M. brand, as well as all company products and services, in 144 countries.
"The customer is primarily looking to I.B.M. for seamless, easy solutions that tie products together and solve problems," said Abby K. Kohnstamm, vice president for corporate marketing with the International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y. "So it made sense to have a coordinated presentation of ourselves as a company that fits together." Ogilvy, though it had no previous relationship with I.B.M., was judged to be "very experienced in building and leveraging powerful global brands," she added.
This would be new for I.B.M., since even its best-known ads of the past, featuring an actor who impersonated Charlie Chaplin's "little tramp" and the cast of the television sitcom "M*A*S*H," were intended primarily to sell specific products rather than to establish a unified image.
I.B.M.'s decision is emblematic of three trends that are remaking the advertising industry. One is the huge, abrupt changes in account assignments since 1990, as economic difficulties have transformed consumer behavior. Shoppers, tempted as never before by lower-priced products offering quality and value comparable to brand names, have become tougher to sell to and more cynical about the industry's penchant for puffery.
As a result, familiar blue-chip brands have moved about with dizzying speed. Some recent examples are the Burger King and Hardee's fast-food chains, the Jeep-Eagle division of the Chrysler Corporation, Diet Coke and Subaru of America.
A second trend is the desire among so-called global brands, products sold around the world, to consolidate assignments, the better to reap benefits of efficiencies and effectiveness. Advertisers that have combined accounts at a single agency, or handful of agencies, include the Colgate-Palmolive Company and Reebok International.
The I.B.M. advertising changes are symptomatic of a systemic overhaul of the company being undertaken by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who became its chairman and chief executive in April 1993. Mr. Gerstner, who previously worked at RJR Nabisco and the American Express Company, is recentralizing many of I.B.M.'s corporate functions.
Mr. Gerstner, in a speech on March 24, said one of his strategies for reviving I.B.M. would be to capitalize on "our size and scale to achieve cost and market advantages." Indeed, several advertising executives said the changes were, in effect, symbolic of Mr. Gerstner's new broom.
Finally, the I.B.M. changes embody the importance of personal relationships in advertising -- or as one agency executive who does not work for I.B.M., speaking on the condition of anonymity, put it: "People are comfortable working with the people they are comfortable working with."
In this instance, two top executives of I.B.M. worked with Ogilvy when they were at American Express. One was Mr. Gerstner. The other was Ms. Kohnstamm, whom he hired a year ago yesterday from American Express as vice president for corporate marketing. Ogilvy is the lead worldwide agency for American Express.
Ms. Kohnstamm said that the experience she and Mr. Gerstner had with Ogilvy, particularly in working with Rochelle (Shelly) Lazarus, now the president of Ogilvy's North American operations, was "a plus."
"But it really was not a major factor in our decision," she said, adding that a team of seven senior I.B.M. advertising executives determined that Ogilvy was "a marketing partner with overriding multinational capabilities that could pull us together globally but also can work locally."
The I.B.M. decision was clearly a huge boost for Ogilvy, which has lost many large accounts like Hardee's. I.B.M. became one of Ogilvy's three largest clients, raising the agency's total worldwide billings, the ad spending on which agencies earn commissions, to $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion from $5.8 billion. Ogilvy will also be assigned what I.B.M. called "a substantial amount" of its direct marketing activities in many countries.
"No matter what life cycle you're in as a company, this is a watershed event," said Charlotte Beers, who joined Ogilvy in 1992 as chairwoman and chief executive to revamp the agency -- not unlike Mr. Gerstner's mission at I.B.M. Ms. Beers said that Ms. Lazarus would be "at the center of the core team" formed to handle the I.B.M. account, but said it was too soon to discuss how many additional employees Ogilvy would hire.
To work for I.B.M., Ogilvy will resign two accounts with billings estimated at $75 million: product advertising for the Microsoft Corporation, and the Compaq Computer Corporation's European account.
Those assignments could now be pursued by the agencies that were notified late Monday night or early yesterday morning that they were losing I.B.M. accounts. Every one, without exception, was shocked.
"It's absolutely unbelievable," said Parry Merkley, the president and creative director of Merkley Newman Harty, a small New York agency that was named to share the I.B.M. personal computer account in October with the Paris office of DDB Needham Worldwide. Merkley Newman's print ads for the IBM PC Company began running only last week -- and the television commercials are still in production.
"If they choose to consider the PC Company as part of a global strategy, the changes make sense," Mr. Merkley added. "But I'm still very surprised it happened like this." Merkley Newman lost billings estimated at $50 million, reducing the agency's accounts to $45 million, or less than half their former size.
Keith L. Reinhard, chairman and chief executive at DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, and a man not given to superlatives, called the consolidation "amazing." His agency also lost about $50 million in billings.
Two other New York agencies, Wells Rich Greene BDDP and Lintas Worldwide, are being hit hard because the I.B.M. losses follow departures of other large clients.
"We were taken by surprise because our relationship with I.B.M. has been terrific," Kenneth Olshan, chairman and chief executive of Wells Rich, said. The agency has created image advertising for I.B.M. Wells Rich, Mr. Olshan said, handled the equivalent of $40 million to $50 million in billings. The trade publication Advertising Age estimated that figure at $75 million.
Kenneth L. Robbins, chairman and chief executive of Lintas Worldwide, said that he believed the I.B.M. changes were "very consistent with a company in transition."
"But Lintas knows the business intimately in many countries," he added, "and we could have saved them some time and money" rather than hiring an agency that has not worked for the company. Lintas Worldwide's I.B.M. billings totaled $85 million to $90 million, he said; Advertising Age estimated them at $150 million.
Another large agency dismissed was the J. Walter Thompson Company, though the loss to its parent, the WPP Group P.L.C. of London, was mitigated by the fact that WPP also owns Ogilvy. Thompson's lost billings were estimated at $25 million.
Some small accounts of I.B.M.'s, primarily involving direct catalogue sales of products to consumers, were not affected by the decision, nor were the company's agencies in Japan or those working for joint ventures.

HEADLINE: Despite Embargo, Haiti's Rich Seem to Get Richer

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 24

 BODY:
Large gaps in a worldwide embargo that took effect on Sunday have allowed some of Haiti's wealthiest families, traditionally close allies of the defiant military, to continue a lucrative food trade, diplomats and Haitian business people say.
The situation resulted from a failure by the United States to freeze the assets of leading Haitian business executives and to keep them out of the food trade, and critics of American policy expressed doubts about Washington's willingness to end the political crisis. The freezing of assets is only being applied to Haiti's senior military officers and their allies in Government. 
 The decision to permit the wealthiest Haitian families to maintain their near-monopolies in basic foods, which are exempt from the embargo, was described by one diplomat as a "judgment call" based on a concern that punishing the economic elite would merely drive it closer to the army.
Critics say, on the other hand, that these families are already close to the army and that pressures must be applied to them for the sanctions to be effective. Most of Haiti's wealthiest traders have opposed the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and collaborated with the military leaders who overthrew him.
 
Ex-Friends of the U.S.
 Diplomatic and business critics also say there has been a hesitancy to pursue Haitian officers for what Administration officials have asserted is their role in lucrative cocaine trafficking. This, the critics said, has reinforced the view that longstanding allies of the United States who now oppose Father Aristide are being shielded from punishment.
A former Haitian official angered by Washington's policy said powerful Haitians had "inside information and connections in Washington that tell them that Aristide is never coming back," and added: "This failure to act decisively only reinforces that view here."
An American diplomat conceded that the failure to move against the country's richest families had left "a perception out there of us sending mixed messages."
But the United States Ambassador, William L. Swing, defended the policies and said today in an interview, "Whatever the perception may be, I believe that the Clinton Administration is absolutely serious about bringing back President Aristide to finish his mandate."
To accomplish this, Mr. Swing said Washington would "actively pursue every avenue," including possibly freezing the asserts of the powerful Haitian families or "going after the military for things like narcotics."
 
The Big Three
 The worldwide embargo, imposed by United Nations, bans trade with Haiti in all goods except medicines and basic foods.
In an executive order, the Clinton Administration said it would allow trade in these goods by people who are not members of the Haitian military or the army-backed provisional government.
A half dozen or so families -- the best known are the Brandts, the Acras and the Mevses -- have long dominated the economy, in large part through control of the food trade. Their influence has been reinforced by personal ties forged with generations of American diplomats and by their use of well-connected lobbyists in Washington.
 
Opponents Profit
 By allowing this elite to continue to trade in cooking oil, flour, rice and sugar, these families stand to make a lot of money, even as they oppose American policy.
In what is widely considered one of the most flagrant examples, the Mevs family has reportedly been building a huge oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo.
"Right in the middle of the embargo, you have a guy who is described by the Americans as a friend getting a contract like this," said one Haitian businessman. "The joke is that these people are being allowed to profit grotesquely from the sanctions."
The businessman said the depot was being built with the help of commercial financing from the United States, but this could not be confirmed.
Washington's hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests.
"Countries always look for local allies in their foreign policy and protect them no matter what," said one diplomat. "Unfortunately, in the case of Haiti, the United States' old friends are precisely the people responsible for this crisis."
 
A History of Coziness
 There is a less charitable explanation: that both the Pentagon and the intelligence community in Washington fear a spate of embarrassing revelations made by Haitians in reprisal for a crackdown.
Many Haitians suggest that Justice Department proceedings against army leaders involved in the drug trade have been stalled by fears that such a pursuit would produce a public washing of dirty laundry. Many of Haiti's top military officials received their military and intelligence training in the United States.
"The history of connections of these people in Washington gives them the ability to play with opinion here," said one former Haitian official. "All they have been doing lately is saying that Washington is not in a hurry for Aristide to come back, and even for those who don't want to believe it, each twist of the events seems to confirm their wisdom."
