HEADLINE: Planned Assault on Republican Bastion Lands McGreevey in Power Struggle 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey's plan to shake up the leadership of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, a rich source of political patronage, has set off a heated battle between the governor and one of Trenton's most powerful Republicans.
 The agency, which is allotted a portion of profits from Atlantic City casinos and doles out tens of millions of dollars each year to finance public development projects, has long been part of the political power base of Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican of Atlantic County. In recent months, however, the McGreevey administration has been pressuring the executive director of the agency, an ally of Mr. Gormley's, to step aside, even though his tenure is set to run through next June. 
 Mr. McGreevey's aides say that the governor is troubled that a series of bureaucratic delays at the authority have jeopardized $35 million in federal funds that were pledged for a housing project. On Monday, the administration sent a team of auditors to examine the financial records at the authority, in a very public move that was widely interpreted as an effort to hasten the departure of the executive director, James Kennedy.
"This is a simple matter of accountability," said Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey.
But Mr. Gormley has characterized the administration's actions as a power grab, and accused Mr. McGreevey of trying to punish him for aggressively fighting the governor's proposed increase on casino taxes during the budget negotiations in June. Mr. Gormley also warns that the drive to oust Mr. Kennedy will ultimately hurt the effort to rebuild Atlantic City by allowing the authority's money to be siphoned to other projects around the state.
"The governor has already caused layoffs in South Jersey because of his tax policies," Mr. Gormley said today, "and it's unfortunate that he now wants to cause more unemployment just because he doesn't like a state senator. Can't he find a better way to settle his political scores?"
Since 1984 the authority has received 1.25 percent of the profits of Atlantic City's casinos and has disbursed nearly $1 billion for public works projects and residential development and to spur expansion of casino hotels in Atlantic City. In recent years the agency has also diverted a portion of its money to projects in other parts of the state. Because the authority awards millions of dollars in contracts each year, the political official who controls it can also attract campaign contributions from engineers, consultants, law firms and others hoping to get business.
Mr. Gormley helped write the legislation that founded the authority, and said that Mr. Kennedy, who has been executive director since 1993, had done an admirable job using the fund to revitalize Atlantic City and provide jobs for economically troubled South Jersey.
But Mr. McGreevey, who had a warm relationship with Mr. Gormley during his first year as governor, became angry this June, his advisers said, when he heard reports that Mr. Gormley had offered to use authority money to finance a project in the district of a Democratic lawmaker in exchange for a vote against the governor's casino tax plan. 
In the months since reaching a budget agreement, the administration has repeatedly raised questions about leadership of the development authority because the agency has been unable to identify $22 million it pledged for a South Jersey housing project, and may lose $35 million in federal matching funds.
Mr. Gormley flatly denies offering authority money as part of any negotiation to fight the casino tax, calling the assertions "an absolute lie." He suggests that the McGreevey administration has its own ulterior political agenda and wants to replace Mr. Kennedy with an ally of Robert G. Torricelli, the former United States senator who now works representing several real estate developers.
But Mr. Rasmussen said Mr. Torricelli, whose former employees now hold several key positions in the administration, would have no role in the future of the authority.
"Mr. Torricelli has nothing to do with any of this," Mr. Rasmussen said. "They are only raising his name to divert attention from the real issues."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
In Chicago, Changing of the Guard at Sears Tower

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
When Trizec Properties acquired a second mortgage on the 110-story Sears Tower in 1997, it looked as if the company had made a shrewd investment. 
 In exchange for its $70 million stake, Trizec (then known as the Trizec Hahn Corporation) was to gain control this year of the tower, the nation's tallest building, with its 3.5 million square feet of space and a top-floor observation deck that is one of this city's major tourist attractions. 
 But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the weak economy and a glut of new office space coming onthe market changed Trizec's perspective on the black aluminum-clad building, which is made up of nine steel-framed shafts of varying sizes that were built to withstand the heavy Chicago gusts.
 So last month, Trizec, a publicly traded real estate investment trust that is based here, sold its interest in the property to MetLife for $9 million. The insurance company's first mortgage payment on the building is due in 2005. Analysts say the company will owe $840 million, a number MetLife will not confirm. MetLife is now the property's sole owner, but Trizec will continue to lease and manage the property. 
 With $3.5 billion in debt, Trizec is more heavily leveraged than most REIT's. Timothy C. Callahan, Trizec's chief executive for the last year, said the sale of the building dovetailed with the company's strategy of reducing its debt. Had Trizec held onto the Sears Tower, the company would have added hundreds of millions of dollars of debt to its balance sheet as soon as it took possession of the building, he said.
 "For us," said Mr. Callahan, a former chief executive of Equity Office Properties, the nation's largest office REIT, "that isn't necessarily a negative thing if we can point to value creation." But given that the Sears building was unlikely to appreciate in value before the mortgage had to be retired or refinanced, he said, "we felt that the investors would view this negatively." 
 Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as the headquarters of Sears, Roebuck & Company, the Sears Tower was the tallest building in the world from its completion in 1974 until 1996, when it yielded that distinction to the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which are 33 feet taller.
 In 1988, Sears, then undergoing financial difficulties, announced that it wanted to sell the tower. Unable to find a buyer, the company refinanced its debt on the property in a complex transaction that included a $600 million first mortgage from MetLife and a $215 million second mortgage from AEW Capital Partners, a Boston investment company.
 But by 1994, the value of the building had tumbled to less than $500 million, and occupancy had slipped below 60 percent, forcing Sears to give up ownership. The property was placed in a trust, with AEW to gain control in 2003. Three years later, Trizec bought AEW's mortgage and paid an additional $40 million for the adjacent 1,100-car garage, a property the company still owns. 
 By 2001, the building's occupancy rate had climbed to 95 percent. After the World Trade Center was destroyed, however, there were fears that the Sears Tower was also a terrorist target, and since then, Trizec officials say, the building's occupancy rate has declined to 88 percent. The building has added a few small tenants, but can no longer charge a premium for its space.
 Among the tenants that have either left, given up some of their space, or said they would leave or are considering leaving are Goldman Sachs (which is giving up 245,000 square feet, with eight years left on its lease); Universal Access Inc. (125,000 square feet); Unicare (151,000 square feet); Merrill Lynch (100,000 square feet); Fireman's Fund (87,000 square feet); and General Reinsurance (50,000 square feet).
 Trizec and MetLife officials say that only General Reinsurance's departure can be directly attributed to security fears. They say, for example, that Goldman Sachs's relationship with its client, the Pritzker family, accounts for its decision to lease 200,000 square feet of space in a nearby 1.5-million-square-foot building, the Hyatt Center. That building is being developed by a partnership of the Pritzkers and Higgins Development Partners. A Goldman spokeswoman said that the investment firm decided to move to consolidate its two Chicago offices.
 Mr. Callahan said that in contrast to many major cities, where construction cranes are scarce, downtown Chicago, particularly in the West Loop around the Sears Tower, is still undergoing a building boom. Aside from the Hyatt Center, which is expected to be completed in 2004, other buildings under construction include 111 South Wacker, with 1.1 million square feet; ABN AMRO, with 1.5 million square feet; and 1 South Dearborn, with 825,000 square feet. "A lot is being delivered between now and 2005," Mr. Callahan said, "and that will slow this market's recovery."
 Brokers' estimates of downtown Chicago vacancy rates at the end of the second quarter ranged from 15.4 percent to 15.9 percent.
 Michael J. O'Hanlon, an executive vice president at Grubb & Ellis, said that competition from buildings equipped with the latest communications and heat and air-conditioning technology has made it tougher for the Sears Tower to find new tenants or keep old ones.
 Another broker, Alain G. LeCoque, a managing principal at Newmark Midwest, said the building's tight security evokes painful memories. "Every time you walk into that building, you think about 9/11," he said.
 Last fall, after an appraisal, Trizec wrote down its investment in the Sears Tower from $70 million to $23.6 million and began discussions with MetLife in the hope that the insurance company would reduce Trizec's mortgage payments and extend the term of the loan. But instead, MetLife decided to take control of the building. Brian Fox, the chief marketing officer for MetLife Real Estate Investments, which has a $30 billion portfolio, said: "This made the most sense for both parties. It allowed us unfettered flexibility."
 Mr. Fox said that in the last year, leases for about 260,000 square feet of space had been renewed and tenants had leased 60,000 square feet in expansion space. The Sears building, he said, "does have great long-term real estate fundamentals."
 Trizec's decision to walk away from the Sears Tower has been well received among financial analysts. 
 Lee Schalop, a REIT analyst for Banc of America Securities, said that Trizec made the right move even though it was not facing a severe economic loss even if the Sears Tower lost more tenants. That is because the terms of its mortgage did not obligate the company to make loan payments that exceeded the building's cash flow. In addition, if Trizec had defaulted on its loan, all it would have lost was the building itself, Mr. Schalop said.
 "This was a perception risk, not an economic risk," Mr. Schalop said. "This is a company that has had a number of issues in the investor community. Anything that makes them look like they have more problems than they actually have is undesirable."
 James P. Sullivan, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisers, an independent investment research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in REIT's, was one of the first to urge Trizec to get rid of the property. He said that losing a trophy building -- even in the city where a company is based -- is of no consequence to a REIT.
 "Prestige?" Mr. Sullivan said. "Who cares? Financial returns are much more important to Trizec shareholders than pretty pictures and tall buildings."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Tourism Flat In 2002 

BYLINE:  By Winnie Hu (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
 The number of visitors to New York City essentially did not change last year, but business travel and international tourism dropped substantially, according to tourism figures released yesterday. 
Last year, 35.3 million tourists visited the city, up 0.3 percent from 2001, generating a total economic impact of nearly $21 billion. Officials said the total included record numbers of families and leisure travelers from other parts of the country, many of whom came out of a sense of patriotism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. But business travel dropped 7 percent, to 9.4 million visitors, and international tourism fell 10 percent, to 5.1 million, though city officials pointed out that those areas were showing signs of recovery.

HEADLINE: Voters in Seattle, Where Coffee is King, Reject a Tax on Espresso 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
A measure to levy a 10-cent-per-cup tax on espresso in what is known as the coffee capital of the nation was overwhelmingly rejected tonight by Seattle voters. 
 With results from 59 percent of the precincts reporting and all the mail-in ballots, which made up a large portion of the votes cast in today's primary, 68 percent of the voters opposed the tax and 32 percent voted for it. 
 The tax, which would have been the first of its kind in the nation, would have charged an extra dime for any coffee beverage containing a half-ounce or more of espresso but not apply to regular drip coffee. The revenue was intended to help finance early childhood education in the city, which is the birthplace of the Starbucks Corporation and scene of virtually constant coffee drinking. 
Some Seattle voters, typically willing to support taxes to raise money for social services, said it came down to a difficult choice between the many coffee shops that could be hurt by the tax and the beneficiaries of the revenue, young children. 
"There were as many reasons to vote for it as there were to vote against it," said Joe Brown, 25, who was drinking espresso tonight at Caffe Ladro in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood and voted against the measure. "But I had a feeling it was going to go down."
The espresso tax, formally called Initiative 77, would have been the first of its kind in the nation, according to the National Coffee Association, based in New York City, which tracks legislation and other developments related to the coffee business. 
The Economic Opportunity Institute, a think tank here gathered 30,000 signatures, 11,000 more than required, and got the measure on the ballot. The organization estimated that the espresso tax would have raised $6.5 million annually, based on gourmet coffee consumption statistics, said its executive director, John R. Burbank. 
City officials, using different coffee consumption figures, estimated the annual revenue at $1.8 million to $3.5 million.
The money would have gone to subsidizing early childhood education programs, which have been deeply financially strained in the last few years as a severe budget crisis has gripped the Northwest. The initiative's sponsors said the proposed espresso tax was a creative but reliable way to raise the money. 
Mr. Burbank was clearly disappointed tonight, but he said: "I think the whole purpose of this campaign was really to find a funding source for early learning and care."
Some, even those who said they would normally support a tax to raise money for education argued that the espresso tax was merely a short-term Band-Aid to the problems created by the state's tax structure. 
Washington is one of seven states with no income tax, and Mr. Burbank's organization, among others, has lobbied unsuccessfully for a state income tax. Washington's retail sales tax is among the highest in the nation, at 8.6 percent, and 9.2 percent on meals served in restaurants.
The opposition to the espresso tax, a coalition of coffee business, from Starbucks to small cafes called Joined Against the Latte Tax, or JOLT, argued that the tax would lead the city down a slippery slope of strange taxation.
"I think the Seattle voters understood that childcare is important and funding with an unfair tax is not the way to deal with something that important," said Randy Pepple, a spokesman for JOLT. 
Meade Emory, a professor of tax law at the University of Washington, said he agreed in part with the opposition that an espresso tax was not the solution to the city's economic problems. But he said he, and his wife, voted for the tax today. 
"It sends a strong message," he said, "about the need for the City Council and the mayor and the Legislature to come up with funds for early education."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
In picking a new leader, J. Walter Thompson is pursuing a simple goal: staying relevant.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IT is difficult for an agency as old as J. Walter Thompson, which will turn 140 next year, to record some firsts at so venerable an age. But it will do just that with a rare changing of the guard.
 Thompson, which works for blue-chip advertisers like Diageo, Ford Motor, Kellogg, Merrill Lynch, Nestle, Pfizer and Reckitt Benckiser, will announce today that Bob Jeffrey, president for its North American operations, will be promoted to chief executive, effective Jan. 1. 
 Mr. Jeffrey, in being named the ninth chief executive of Thompson since 1864, succeeds Peter A. Schweitzer, who will become chairman, a post that is now vacant. Mr. Schweitzer, 64, will also relinquish his duties as worldwide president to Michael Madel, now president for the Thompson operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
Mr. Jeffrey, 50, will become the first Thompson chief executive to have spent most of his advertising career outside the agency. He joined Thompson five years ago as president of the flagship New York office; he came from the agency now known as Lowe & Partners Worldwide, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, where he had been executive vice president and managing director for the San Francisco office. Mr. Jeffrey, who was also a founder of the Goldsmith/Jeffrey agency in New York, was promoted to his current post in 2001.
Mr. Madel, 53, will be the first Thompson worldwide president to be based outside New York, in this case London. Mr. Madel, who joined Thompson in 1990, adds responsibilities for the Asian-Pacific operations to the duties of his current post, to which he was promoted in 1997.
The changes come as Thompson, the largest agency in the United States in revenue -- and No. 4 globally, behind Dentsu, McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising and BBDO Worldwide -- confronts some daunting challenges.
While Thompson has recently gained additional assignments from clients like Pfizer, the agency has also lost some accounts from prominent marketers including the Miller Brewing Company division of SABMiller and Sun Microsystems. Thompson has had to shake up the ranks of senior managers at offices in cities like Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco to help reassure clients.
The agency stumbled in efforts to develop an entertainment marketing division, dismantling a unit based in New York named Content@JWT in favor of handling those tasks out of the Detroit office. And Thompson, like many large agencies, is deemed in need of improving its creative output, particularly as clients must deal with rapidly changing marketing and media trends.
The challenges include the rise of the finicky youthful consumer cohort known as Generation Y and the need to develop alternatives to traditional ad forms as consumers zip, zap and fast-forward television commercials.
One task facing Mr. Jeffrey is "to take the J. Walter Thompson creative product to an even higher level," Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of Thompson's parent, the WPP Group in London, said yesterday in a phone interview.
Another, Sir Martin said, "is to ensure that communications solutions for clients are coordinated across all disciplines as effectively as possible." That was a reference to the Thompson offerings in areas as disparate as advertising, entertainment marketing, interactive marketing, direct marketing and health care advertising.
Mr. Jeffrey, in a separate interview, acknowledged the scale and scope of what he would face.
"If you watch the movie 'Catch Me if You Can,' " set in the 1960's, "you see the prominent brands are Pan Am and T.W.A.," Mr. Jeffrey said. "Forty years later, look at the airline industry."
"If you look at the ad industry, you could prognosticate something similar," he added. "If we don't get our acts together, that could be us."
As a result, Mr. Jeffrey said, he and Mr. Madel have established "a very aggressive agenda" for Thompson, especially in "transforming ourselves into a more creative organization."
"We're in the beginning stages of putting together a team to drive the agency forward," he added, "and find more innovative ways of creating 'big ideas' that work for clients."
Mr. Madel, for his part, described the coming challenge for him and Mr. Jeffrey as "how we can move from being good to getting even better."
"A big element is the war for talent," Mr. Madel said, with Thompson battling for the spoils as "more agencies go out of business because they're unable to meet the changing needs of clients."
Mr. Schweitzer has spent nearly 30 years at Thompson, rising to became worldwide president in 1992. He announced in 1994 that he did not want to be chief executive, preferring to remain in Detroit, where he supervised the largest Thompson account, Ford. As a result, Chris Jones, a senior manager in London, was promoted to chief executive in 1997. But in 2001, when Mr. Jones stepped down for health reasons, Mr. Schweitzer assumed the post, saying he would remain "as long as I'm useful."
"It has been a long three years," Mr. Schweitzer said yesterday, adding that his most challenging task has been "having to make some hard decisions" related to the economy that included layoffs.
"I've always looked at this business as a team sport," Mr. Schweitzer said. "We now have a team to carry us to the next stage of life. It's time to give them their chance."
Mr. Madel will report to Mr. Jeffrey, as will Lewis Trencher, who continues as chief financial officer. Mr. Jeffrey will oversee Latin America in addition to North America as Mr. Madel assumes oversight for the rest of the Thompson world.

Eliot Spitzer staked out his position as the leading Democratic challenger to Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday in a speech to New York City business leaders, saying the state government was failing to take the right steps to revive the economy.
 Mr. Spitzer, the state attorney general, faulted the Pataki administration for everything from failing to create jobs in new industries to doing too little to spur the construction of more power lines, which he suggested might have eased the damage done by the recent blackout. Without mentioning the governor by name, he said the state government was "lacking in real strategic thinking." 
 He also said the state's dozens of public authorities had become too powerful, too rife with inefficiencies and too insulated from public scrutiny.
"The public authorities are becoming to New York's government what off-balance-sheet partnerships were to Enron," said Mr. Spitzer, whose national profile has risen dramatically over the last two years because of his attempts to rid Wall Street of conflicts of interests. "They are hiding spots, breeding grounds, for inertia, incompetence and, at times, worse."
The speech to the Association for a Better New York in Manhattan was seen by many in political circles as a not-so-subtle message from Mr. Spitzer to the Republican governor, as well as his fellow Democrats, that he intends to run in 2006, and anyone else thinking about getting into the race will have to face him, several political strategists said.
At a news conference in Albany, Governor Pataki dismissed Mr. Spitzer's criticisms of the public authorities, which he largely controls and has stocked with his most loyal political allies. "We all know why," he said when asked about Mr. Spitzer's speech. "Next question."
Later the governor's communications director, Lisa Dewald Stoll, said the attorney general was clearly beginning a campaign for governor. "These are desperate attempts to gain credibility on issues, like taxes, on which he's been deafeningly silent in the past," she said. "New Yorkers will see this for what it is: pure politics."
Throughout the summer, Mr. Spitzer has been visiting Democratic leaders around the state trying to solidify support for a run for governor in 2006. He just finished a swing through the Adirondacks and other northern regions this weekend, visiting 12 local party organizations. The attorney general has raised more than $2 million in the last nine months for his Spitzer 2006 committee, which could be used either for the governor's race or the attorney general's race.
This weekend, Mr. Spitzer criticized Mr. Pataki at a breakfast meeting with Democratic Party officials in Johnstown, N.Y., for instance, saying the governor had tried to push the burden for many services down to county taxpayers by cutting state taxes.
Some top party officials have quietly been supporting Mr. Spitzer's candidacy, hoping to head off a divisive Democratic primary like the one last year. The other top Democrats said to be considering a run for governor are Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary who ran last year, and Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive. Senator Charles E. Schumer's name has also been bandied about by some Democratic officials as a possible candidate, though the senator has not given any public clue that he is interested.
By delivering a speech about broad policy questions, the attorney general also appeared to be trying to modify his public image somewhat. He is well known for having a sharp legal mind and for constantly pushing the boundaries of his powers with creative lawsuits, but the speech seemed aimed at showing he also could devise strategies to help the economy and streamline government.
He said the state government had not adapted to a changing economy that relies more on trading information than manufacturing products. "How can we say otherwise when our tax burden and debt are too high and our population and job retention rates are too low?" he asked.
Mr. Spitzer asserted that many important aspects of state policy -- school construction, energy infrastructure and mass transit, for instance -- were adrift because the state over the years had shifted too much power to public authorities, where there is little or no scrutiny by the public or the Legislature. "For too long these problems have been swept under the rug, away from public view, by those who hope the scrutiny will go away," he said.
The attorney general also charged that the administration had not forced utilities to invest more in power transmission lines and had focused economic development grants on a few select industries, like finance and real estate, while doing too little to attract new ones.
Mr. Spitzer wound up his speech with an appeal to the governor and legislative leaders to come up with a consensus on how to resolve the inequities in education between urban and suburban schools, a problem the state's highest court has ordered the government to remedy.

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Short-Term Rates Unchanged; 
<BYL >By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve retained its cautious outlook for the economy today, leaving short-term interest rates unchanged at 1 percent.
 The decision was not a surprise as Fed officials announced a month ago that they were prepared to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at its current low levels "for a considerable period." 
 If there was an added nuance to the decision today by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, it was in its slightly more pessimistic tone about unemployment. In its statement accompanying today's decision, the Fed noted that the labor market had been weakening. That reflected the continued loss of jobs last month and several unexpected jumps in the number of people seeking unemployment claims. By contrast, the Fed described labor conditions last month as mixed. 
The wording suggested that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was more worried than before that a continuation of the relatively high unemployment rate -- slightly above 6 percent of the work force -- could affect economic growth in the months ahead.
Fed officials have made it clear they expect the economy to grow at a robust annual rate of 4 percent for the rest of the year and much of next.
But senior officials have also let it be known that they still see potential threats to the expansion that now seems to be under way. In addition to concerns about high unemployment, which could weaken consumer spending, officials view the inflation rate as uncomfortably low.
Today, the Fed repeated word for word its previous statements that "pricing power" of businesses is "muted" and that the risk of deflation is greater than the risk of inflation. "The probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level," the committee said. "The risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future." 
Shortly before the Federal Open Market Committee met today, the Labor Department offered new evidence that businesses had little or no margin to raise prices.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices edged up 0.3 percent in August, which translates to an annual rate of 2.2 percent. But most of that increase stemmed from a jump in energy prices. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, climbed 0.1 percent last month -- an annual rate of 1.3 percent.
Recent economic data offer many signs of greater business activity and increased demand from businesses and consumers, and many economists predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the months ahead.
Part of that growth stems from heightened consumer demand, which appears to have been stoked by the tax cuts that Congress passed this spring. But business investment has revived somewhat in recent months, and the stock market has been buoyant. Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.4 percent, the Dow industrials 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq 2.3 percent.
In a speech two weeks ago, the Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, said that he agreed with private-sector forecasts that economic growth would be strong but that unemployment would remain near current levels for the time being.
"I have been of the view for quite a while that acceleration of growth to 4 percent or better in 2004 is plausible," Mr. Bernanke said in a speech on Sept. 4. "I agree also that the decline in the unemployment rate, though steady, is likely to be slow." 
Today, Fed officials seemed determined to do as little as possible to excite financial markets. 
The central bank is still smarting from a torrent of criticism this summer that it miscommunicated its intentions about taking extraordinary measures to avoid the possibility of a downward spiral in prices.
Based on both formal statements and informal signals by Fed officials, bond investors became convinced this summer that the Fed was about to start buying up longer-term Treasury notes to keep long-term interest rates low.
When the Fed decided not to do that, or to reduce its overnight federal funds rate below 1 percent, long-term bond rates shot up and bond prices plunged -- leading to huge losses for many bond investors.
Today, the Fed seemed bent on reassuring investors that it had no plans yet to raise interest rates, even if the economic growth did become more robust.
"The message here is that the Fed is doing nothing for some time yet," wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank, said the Fed paid particularly close attention to inflation statistics published by the Commerce Department that suggest even greater price restraint than that shown in the C.P.I.

HEADLINE: Bush Links Pollution Measure To His Effort to Create Jobs 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush made a pitch today for his plan to reduce air pollution, and while he outlined the environmental benefits, his focus was just as much on the issues that his advisers say are more likely than any others to determine his chances at re-election: jobs and the economy.
 In a 21-minute speech in the East Garden of the White House, Mr. Bush mentioned jobs or the economy at least 21 times, saying his plan for reducing emissions from power plants and other major polluters would clean the air without driving up costs to business so much that it would kill employment. 
 Mr. Bush's proposal, which he calls the Clear Skies initiative, has been stalled in Congress, and his appearance today with a group of state and local government officials, business executives and other supporters was intended in part to put pressure on Congress to act.
It also underscored how Mr. Bush was casting many of the issues likely to come up in the presidential campaign as economic questions that would help determine whether the economy could again begin creating jobs after losing millions of them during his presidency.
"People in this country must understand that we can have a pro-growth agenda, a pro-job agenda and a pro-environment agenda at the same time," he said, "and Clear Skies legislation is just that."
Most environmental groups have criticized the legislation as too weak in its initial goal of reducing acid rain emissions from sources like power plants, and largely silent on the potentially bigger long-term issue of global warming.
In the Senate, at least four Republicans have signed on as sponsors or co-sponsors to what they describe as tougher proposals, and Senate leaders have resisted White House pressure to attach the bill to the energy legislation currently being considered by a House-Senate conference committee.
"Under the president's plan, acid rain emissions caps come too late and cut too little," Senator James M. Jeffords, the independent from Vermont who is the ranking minority member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. "Their plan will continue the rapid decline in the health of lakes and forests in the Northeast and across the country. There are other, much better bipartisan proposals before Congress that have greater support."
Mr. Bush's plan calls for substantial reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury over the next 15 years. It would allow utilities and other polluters to choose on their own how to meet the goals. Plants that cut emissions below the required level could sell credits to other companies that do not reach the goal, giving them a financial incentive to cut emissions.
His environmental policies, the president said, would allow communities "to meet national standards without sacrificing good jobs."
Environmental advocates have challenged the assumption that strict standards will eliminate jobs, saying that investment in new technology to clean the air, for example, will create jobs.

HEADLINE: The Dalai Lama on Tour, an Exile on Main Street 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN and DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
On his 15th trip to the United States, the Dalai Lama has been met by sold-out crowds from coast to coast. Tickets to his events have been bid up on eBay. He filled Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, and on Sept. 11 packed Washington National Cathedral, as 3,000 more people listened outside on the lawn. Scalpers did brisk business outside the basketball arena in Boston last Sunday selling last-minute tickets.
 As he begins the first of nine days of events in New York, this son of Tibetan peasants is at the high point of his global fame as a religious leader, head of state, pop icon, multimedia phenomenon and ascetic Buddhist superstar. 
 The Dalai Lama has always drawn a small circle of devotees in this country, but the huge turnouts on this trip are testimony to a growing American fascination with Buddhist practices and the search for genuine spiritual heroes who profess nonviolence in an era of religious strife and disillusionment. 
"I think I'm looking for something; I don't know quite what," said Vivian de Mello, of Providence, R.I., who is Catholic. Ms. de Mello paid $60 for a ticket in Boston on Sunday in what she called her quest to find a new religion.
"He makes me feel good, and I need that right now," said Michelle Caron, a financial controller from Medford, Mass., as she descended the stadium stairs after the event. "Just his aura, and the simplicity."
The Dalai Lama's popularity also owes something to the presence of his beatific visage on hundreds of books and videos, some which have recently crossed over to the mainstream market from religious and New Age audiences. One, "The Art of Happiness," sold more than 1.2 million copies and was on The New York Times best-seller list for nearly two years.
There are more than 300 listings for Dalai Lama books on Amazon.com, said Lynn Garrett, religion editor of Publishers Weekly, though some are different editions of the same book. 
"He is regarded as a religious voice, but he definitely crosses over into self-help," Ms. Garrett said. 
As Tibet's leader in exile, the Dalai Lama is primarily concerned with pressing for Tibetan autonomy from Chinese rule. Some supporters say they worry that mass marketing of his image has diluted his message, but others say his celebrity status has only broadened the cause of Tibetan freedom as well as the appeal of Buddhism.
Among Tibetans and their supporters, the Dalai Lama's visibility is prompting some controversy, said Matthew Wiener, director of programming at the Interfaith Center of New York and its Buddhism analyst.
"That is a consistent internal debate and question about the more trendy the Dalai Lama gets, how does that affect cause of Tibetan freedom, and how does it affect the Buddhist message of compassion," Mr. Weiner said.
The Dalai Lama has lent his name to so many books and projects, said Yodon Thonden, executive director of the Isdell Foundation, which supports Tibetan causes, that "in some ways it dilutes the impact of his presence."
Nevertheless, Ms. Thonden said, his high profile is ultimately beneficial for the Tibetan cause.
The Dalai Lama gives permission to almost every request to use his name or likeness, many who know him say.
"He'll give a talk and someone will ask him if they can put it in a book, and he almost always says yes," said Amy B. Hertz, who as executive editor of Riverhead Books has published three recent Dalai Lama books, including "The Art of Happiness."
Mr. Wiener said the Dalai Lama had made a conscious decision to be highly public, partly motivated by a sense among Tibetans that their history of isolation left them vulnerable to the Chinese takeover.
"The reverse of that is to say, 'Hey, we have to get publicity, we have to get the word out about our problems,' " Mr. Wiener said. "The Dalai Lama's extroverted response is in large part the result of thinking they got it wrong."
Advances and any profits from the books are usually divided between the authors and the Tibetan government-in-exile, Ms. Hertz said. 
The Dalai Lama was born Lhamo Thondup to peasants in northeastern Tibet. At age 2, he was recognized as the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama and taken to the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, to be educated by Buddhist scholars and monks. He was enthroned in 1940, at the age of 5. Ten years later, China began its invasion of Tibet, and when China suppressed an uprising of Tibetans in 1959, the Dalai Lama fled to India. He has lived ever since in Dharamsala and has never been allowed by the Chinese to return to his native country.
His travels across the globe have helped him develop a mastery of the media event. At a news conference yesterday to start his visit in New York, he took the stage at an auditorium at the Guggenheim Museum, and, after a tempest of camera flashes, he asked the photographers to stop taking pictures. He peered leisurely into the audience and greeted familiar faces one by one. Then, with a broad smile, he told the photographers to return to work. "Well, yes, flash!"
Tickets for teaching sessions at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan have long since sold out -- at $400 each, or $1,200 and $3,000 for V.I.P.'s and big donors. The steep prices are to defray the cost of advertising and producing the Dalai Lama's appearance this Sunday in Central Park, said Josh Baran, a publicist for the Dalai Lama's New York visit.
The Dalai Lama said recent contacts between Tibetans and Beijing were a "good start," and described a delicately balanced approach to China. He said he had always stressed that China should not be isolated and that issues of human rights, democracy and freedom should be raised in a "friendly atmosphere."
In recent years, China has poured money into Tibet and encouraged ethnic Chinese to settle there, bringing economic growth but also questions about the future of Tibetan culture.
"Unfortunately, sometimes our Chinese brothers and sisters need a little pressure," he said, adding: "And basically I feel pressure is not right. The friendly manner, the compassionate way, to educate them, explain to them and persuade them, that's the proper way."
He did not always draw such attention. The Dalai Lama first came to the United States in an era of widespread fear of new religions and dangerous cults.
Jeffrey Hopkins, a professor of Tibetan Buddhist studies at the University of Virginia who served as the Dalai Lama's interpreter from 1979 to 1989, said: "Twenty-five years ago, almost all the venues were small, people didn't know who he was, they had no idea where Tibet was, and they didn't know what religion to associate with him. They thought he might have been some far-out guru who maybe had selfish purposes."
But as his popularity has grown, some Buddhist leaders have expressed concern about what they call "bookstore Buddhists" who buy his latest releases and adopt Asian trappings without delving deeply into Buddhist teachings. 
"We need to adopt the wisdom practice," said Surya Das, a widely known American lama, "not the Asian accouterments."

HEADLINE: Flow of Saudis' Cash to Hamas Is Scrutinized 

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Nearly a year ago, Khalid Mishaal, a senior leader of Hamas, the militant Palestinian organization, attended a charitable fund-raising conference here where he talked at length with Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto Saudi ruler.
 According to a summary of the meeting written by a Hamas official, Mr. Mishaal and other Hamas representatives thanked their Saudi hosts for continuing "to send aid to the people through the civilian and popular channels, despite all the American pressures exerted on them." 
 "This is indeed a brave posture deserving appreciation," the Hamas officials said, the document said.
Today Mr. Mishaal, who was recently added to the United States Treasury Department list of what it calls terrorist financiers, controls a wing of Hamas that advocates violent confrontation with Israel, including suicide bombings. 
As relations between the Israelis and Palestinians continue to deteriorate, in no small part because of recent Hamas-sponsored suicide bombings, Saudis have come under fresh scrutiny by American and European investigators here and in Israel for their political and financial support of the group. 
At least 50 percent of Hamas's current operating budget of about $10 million a year comes from people in Saudi Arabia, according to estimates by American law enforcement officials, American diplomats in the Middle East and Israeli officials. After the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the Saudi portion of Hamas financing grew larger as donations from the United States, Europe and other Persian Gulf countries dried up, American officials and analysts said.
The estimated donations coming from Saudi Arabia -- about $5 million a year -- are a significant sum for Hamas but a very small portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars that flow into Saudi charities each year, officials said. Nearly all the donations are given in cash, making it extremely difficult for Saudi and American authorities to track the money.
"It's a ridiculous accusation; no Saudi government money goes to Hamas, directly or indirectly," said Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign affairs adviser to Prince Abdullah. "Why on earth would we not stop this kind of funding? Why on earth would our crown prince say we do not want to support Hamas and then allow people to do this under the table?"
Saudi officials say their government's support for Palestinian causes goes solely to the Palestinian Authority, about $80 million to $100 million a year.
Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, has denied that his government has financially supported Hamas or charities that serve as front organizations for Hamas. Prince Saud has said the government aids the Palestinian Authority because it is "the sole representative of the Palestinian people."
The American Treasury secretary, John Snow, who is to arrive here on Wednesday on a trip through the Middle East and Central Asia to address the financing of terrorism and economic development, said a major theme was to press Palestinian and Saudi authorities to crack down on Hamas by choking off its funds. 
During two days of meetings in Israel, which ended today, Mr. Snow conveyed a message of caution from the White House to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, urging him not to carry through with the threatened "removal" of Yasir Arafat and to halt construction of a barrier around Palestinian territory. But Mr. Snow aimed his strongest criticism at Hamas.
"The terror has to be stopped because the terror lies at the very heart of the region's troubles," Mr. Snow told Palestinian political and business leaders. "Hamas is clearly identified with terror. You have to go after it."
He said the White House was also asking Syria to crack down on Hamas. Mr. Mishaal and other senior Hamas leaders are based in Syria. 
The document that outlined Mr. Mishaal's visit with the Saudis, in October 2002, was seized by the Israeli military during a raid in Gaza last December, and a copy was recently given to The New York Times by a former Israeli official. The summary is written in Arabic on paper with a Hamas letterhead and was translated into English by the Israeli military. 
Four senior American law enforcement and diplomatic officials who reviewed the document did not dispute its authenticity, but declined to discuss its contents.
A Saudi official who was provided the document in Arabic and in English said it did not prove the Saudi government had contributed to Hamas, and he strongly criticized its contents as conveying a distorted view of the events. 
"This document is trash," the official said. "If the purpose of the document is to prove Saudi funding for Hamas, it fails miserably. There is nothing in it except the views and perceptions of Hamas members who attended this conference. The Israelis have made a big fuss about this document, and there is no there there."
Several Saudi officials acknowledged that wealthy Saudi citizens have made sizable cash donations to Hamas. But they said the government is working to curb such contributions. 
Saudi leaders, facing increasing pressure from the United States, say they have done much to stem the flow of donations to charities linked to terrorism. They have barred Saudi charities from sending money out of the country and have prohibited individuals from making anonymous wire transfers of cash.
A senior Treasury Department counterterrorism official said Bush administration officials had repeatedly raised their concerns about Hamas financing with Saudi leaders. American officials have also begun to work closely with the Palestinian Authority on the issue, including meeting with Amin Haddad, governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority. 
Some terrorism and political analysts say Hamas is divided into two wings: one carries on social work, like hospitals and schools; a military wing engages in armed attacks and suicide bombings against civilians. 
Other analysts say there is no longer a clear distinction between Hamas's social and military operations. Members of Hamas, Al Qaeda and Islamic Jihad often work within one another's organizations, they say, and all three groups were born of an older group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
Earlier this month, after intense lobbying by the United States and Israel, the European Union placed the political wing of Hamas on its blacklist of terrorist organizations, which means the 15 members of the European Union can freeze Hamas's assets.
In the Hamas document, drafted last November before the war with Iraq had begun, Hamas officials concluded that "among many echelons in Saudi Arabia, there is clear, tangible and conspicuous mistrust of the United States, particularly in view of its succumbing to the influence and incitement of the Zionist lobby." 
"They consider the expected American attack on Iraq as only the first step, which will have ramifications for everyone, especially for Saudi Arabia," the document added.
A senior American diplomat in the Middle East pointed out that wealthy Saudis contribute at least 2 percent of their annual income to charitable causes, and that charities that assist hospitals, schools and orphanages in Gaza and the West Bank are flooded with donations from Saudi citizens. Names of charities often change, and it sometimes takes years to determine whether a charity is a front for Hamas, the official said. "It is considered rude in the kingdom to inquire about the motives behind a charity, and so Saudis don't do it," the official added.
The conference that Mr. Mishaal attended last year was held by the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, a Saudi charitable organization based here. The charity's American branch was incorporated in Virginia in 1992 by Abdullah bin Laden, a relative of Osama bin Laden. Members of the Saudi royal family have contributed large sums to the charity, which has publicly stated that one of its educational goals is to "arm the Muslim youth with full confidence in the supremacy of the Islamic system over other systems." 
Although the World Assembly, which is known as WAMY, has not been charged with a crime in the United States, law enforcement officials in India and the Philippines have accused it of financing terrorism in their countries. 
According to the Israeli military, Hamas's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, in a speech last month in Gaza, thanked the World Assembly and another Saudi charity for their continued financial support. On Sept. 6, Sheik Yassin narrowly escaped assassination when an Israeli Air Force jet dropped a bomb on a building in Gaza City where he and other Hamas leaders had gathered. 
Saleh Sulaiman al-Wohaibi, the secretary general of the World Assembly, has adamantly denied that his charity provides contributions to terrorist organizations. 
"WAMY has been publishing annual reports detailing expenses, humanitarian aid extended to different organizations," Mr. Wohaibi said in an interview published on Sept. 11 in The Saudi Gazette. "Hence, an organization with suchlofty aims and objectives cannot be deemed to have a relationship with terrorism."

HEADLINE: Relentless Foe of the Amazon Jungle: Soybeans 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CUIABA, Brazil 

 BODY:
It takes only a trip on the busy but rutted highway that leads north from here to understand how an area of the Amazon jungle larger than New Jersey could have been razed over the course of just a year. 
 Where the jungle once offered shelter to parrots and deer, the land is now increasingly being cleared for soybeans, Brazil's hottest cash crop. 
 Soy cultivation is booming, driven by a coincidence of global demand from as far off as China and the local politics of state where the new governor was known as the Soybean King even before his election last October. 
Today soybeans are eating up larger and larger chunks of the Amazon, leading to a 40 percent jump in deforestation last year, to nearly 10,000 square miles. Even the pastures where cows grazed until recently are being converted, pushing a cattle herd that has become the world's largest even deeper into the agricultural frontier. 
"The new factor in the equation of Amazon deforestation is clearly soybeans and the appeal they hold for agribusiness," Stephan Schwartzmann, director of the Washington-based group Environmental Defense, said after a visit to the region in July. 
A dry season that was unusually parched also appears to have figured in the surge in deforestation from August 2001 to July 2002, according to the country's National Institute for Space Research. So did a certain laxness in law enforcement, traditional during an election year, and a weak currency that made farming for export especially attractive, analysts have suggested.
But experts are unanimous in warning that as soybean farming continues to spread through the adjacent southern Amazon states of Mato Grosso and Para, the threat to the Amazon ecological system is likely to worsen in the next few years.
Environmental groups had hoped that Brazil's left-wing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, would take steps to combat deforestation. But Mr. da Silva has instead emphasized increasing agricultural production to swell exports and feed the urban poor, a position that has earned him criticism even from allies.
"The Amazon is not untouchable," Mr. da Silva said during a visit to the region in July. That view is strongly supported by Blairo Maggi, the new governor here in the state of Mato Grosso, who has repeatedly dismissed any concerns about deforestation.
Mr. Maggi, elected last year as the candidate of the Popular Socialist Party, and his family own one of Brazil's largest soy producers, transporters and exporters. The Soybean King, as the Brazilian press is fond of calling him, advocates soybeans as an engine of growth and development in the Amazon.
In fact, Mr. Maggi has called for nearly tripling the area planted with soybeans during the next decade in Mato Grosso, whose name means dense jungle. His own company, Grupo Maggi, announced early this year that it intended to double the area it has in production.
"To me, a 40 percent increase in deforestation doesn't mean anything at all, and I don't feel the slightest guilt over what we are doing here," Mr. Maggi said in an interview at his office here in Cuiaba, the capital of Mato Grosso. "We're talking about an area larger than Europe that has barely been touched, so there is nothing at all to get worried about."
Economists say that the main spur to the soybean boom is the emergence of a middle class in China, much of whose newly disposable income has been spent on a richer, more varied diet. During the past decade, China has been transformed from a net exporter of soybeans to the world's largest importer in some years of whole soybeans as well as oil and meal byproducts.
At the same time, the recent outbreak of mad cow disease in Europe has led to a sharp shift away from using ground-up animal body parts in feed, further increasing demand for soy protein for cattle and pigs.
Initially, the planting was focused in savanna in the area that the Brazilian government defines as Legal Amazonia, but which is not truly forest. But as soy prices rise, producers are pushing northward into the heart of the Amazon, especially along the 1,100-mile highway called BR163, which links this city to the Amazon port of Santarem. 
With Mr. da Silva's support, state governments in the Amazon are pushing to complete the paving of highway BR163, which scientists and economists say would accelerate both deforestation and soy cultivation. Mr. Maggi said an agreement had been reached to split the paving costs among private interests and the state and federal governments. 
Mr. Maggi rejected the argument advanced by his critics that there is an inherent conflict of interest between his roles as governor and businessman. "It's no secret that I want to build roads and expand agricultural production," he said. "The people voted for that, so I don't see the problem."
The soybean producers who backed Mr. Maggi have been calling for some jungle areas to be reclassified as transitional land or savanna. Brazilian law permits landowners to raze trees and brush and plant crops on 20 percent of their jungle holdings, but that figure rises to 50 percent in transitional areas and 65 percent in savannas. 
During the interview, Mr. Maggi argued that the goal of more than doubling soybean production in his state over the next decade could be achieved "if we take full advantage of the deforestation ceiling of 20 percent without going beyond it." But most Brazilian and foreign experts disagree.
"It would be impossible for them to do that within the law" as currently written, said Dan Nepstad, an American scientist with the Amazon Institute for Environmental Research in Belem. "I suspect that is why they now want to play with the land classification scheme." 
Much of last year's deforestation produced clouds of smoke so thick that some airplane flights had to be canceled. But beyond fouling the air with jungle burning, the rapid expansion of soybean production has also contributed to pollution of watersheds that feed into the Amazon, threatening isolated tribes.
Mr. Maggi says any pollution and deforestation problems are largely caused by thousands of poor families from other regions of Brazil that the federal government has settled on homesteads in remote areas of this frontier state.
Recent government research, however, indicates that only 17 percent of deforestation can be attributed to small peasant farmers trying to feed themselves.

HEADLINE: A Tax-Cut Victim 

 BODY:
If there was one thing Americans had a right to expect from Congress, it was a federal plan to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs. It is a promise that has been made again and again -- in particularly high decibels during the last presidential election. The House and Senate have passed bills, and although both are flawed, this page has urged Congress to finish work on them as a first step toward fulfilling this longstanding commitment. 
 Unfortunately, things have changed. The government cannot afford the program now. That is the fault of President Bush and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. They broke the bank with their enormous tax cuts. The country is facing the largest budget deficit in history, and there is no realistic plan for getting it under control. The limited version of a prescription drug benefit now being considered in Congress would cost about $400 billion over 10 years. 
 Older Americans had a right to expect that help, but they do not have a right to demand it, not when it would be financed by borrowing, with the bills to be paid by their grandchildren.
Mr. Bush, a specialist in pain avoidance, told people that they could have the programs they wanted -- prescription drugs for the elderly, better schools for children -- along with modest tax cuts for the middle class and whoppers for the wealthy. When 9/11 occurred, the president simply added the war on terror, and then the war on Saddam Hussein, to the list. For all his talk about fiscal conservatism, Mr. Bush has never vetoed a spending bill, even the obscene $180 billion farm subsidy program. To pay for it all, he simply increased the deficit. 
Deficits in and of themselves are not necessarily a problem, but the current one is frightening for two reasons. One is its size: projected at well above $500 billion for next year, and approaching 5 percent of the gross domestic product. The other is its permanence. Cutting taxes temporarily to fight the recession made sense, but the Bush tax cuts are meant to be permanent -- even though Congress gave most of them a phony 10-year expiration date in an attempt to mask their effect. 
Dropping the proposal is, of course, just what a large chunk of the Republican Party was hoping for all along. For those Republicans, deficits are a useful tool to beat back popular entitlement programs -- a "starve the beast" strategy, in the words of Ronald Reagan's budget director. Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, rail against the deficit, but they are still pushing for the prescription drug plan. Like the tax-cutters, they are simply building up to some sort of financial Armageddon -- like soaring interest rates or a collapsing dollar -- and hoping that blame will fall on the other party.
Our answer is different. The people have to decide whether they want tax cuts or programs like the prescription drug plan. It's true that the tax-cut radicals will win this round. But then we will have an election.

HEADLINE: Edwards Formally Enters Race For President 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ROBBINS, N.C., Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Standing by a shuttered textile mill where his father had worked, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina presented himself today as a champion of the working class who as president would bring more jobs to America and end what he considers special breaks for the wealthy.
 Hundreds of supporters arrived on chartered buses at this tiny rural town where Mr. Edwards grew up to hear him formally announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. In his speech, he extolled the virtues of his blue-collar roots and said his biography should be a model for the nation. He noted that he had gone from humble beginnings to a life as a medical malpractice trial lawyer, earning millions along the way, and then to a Senate seat in 1998. 
 Ignoring his Democratic rivals, he zeroed in on President Bush, saying his privileged upbringing and ties to corporate America left him ignorant of the concern of "regular people." 
 "We deserve a president who is close to our people, not the lobbyists," Mr. Edwards said, "who listens to our people because he knows them, he works for them. A president who hears them when they cannot speak, because they've lost their jobs, because they're caring for a child or just because the simple struggle to make ends meet leaves them no time for anything else."
 His 25-minute speech was followed by a rally in Columbia, S.C. 
Speaking here, he briefly touched on national security, terrorism and the Iraq conflict. In South Carolina, he did not mention Iraq. His decision to play down such issues appears to reflect a calculation among strategists that the best approach would be to present Mr. Edwards as a Southerner focused on domestic concerns like the economy, health care and education -- not unlike Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential run. 
 Although the address here, an extended version of his stump speech, was promoted as the official beginning of his candidacy, Mr. Edwards, 50, has been on the campaign trail for more than a year. Last month, he began broadcasting television advertisements in early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Oklahoma, as well as in South Carolina, a state pivotal to his candidacy and the place where he was born and lived until he was 10. 
 Democrats say Mr. Edwards shows little sign of catching on, despite even rivals' praise that he is a talented candidate, a good, engaging public speaker and sharp debater.
 Early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show him in the middle of the pack of nine candidates, pressuring him to use his speech today to try to invigorate his campaign.
 The speech was somewhat overshadowed by reports that Wesley K. Clark, the retired Army general who is a fellow Southerner, from Arkansas, would announce on Wednesday that he is joining the race.
Although Mr. Edwards's aides expressed frustration with General Clark's timing, Mr. Edwards said after his appearance in South Carolina: "I think General Clark is a good man, and he will make a good candidate. It doesn't affect me at all."
 A concern for some Democrats has been Mr. Edwards's relative lack of government experience. He is a first-term senator who previously held no public office. On Sept. 7, he announced that he would not seek re-election to focus on his campaign.
 Mr. Edwards addressed that concern today, saying: "I haven't spent my life in politics, but I've spent enough time in Washington to know how much we need to change it. You know, folks from Robbins don't have lobbyists fighting for them in Washington. They count on their government to protect their interests."
 Although he spoke little about national security, Mr. Edwards promised that he would keep the country safe, and he faulted Mr. Bush for not corralling allies for the Iraq war. Mr. Edwards voted for the Congressional resolution to support the war, as well as the antiterrorism law, the Patriot Act, that expands law enforcement powers to counter terrorism.
"We need a president who will unite the world in the war on terror and in the fight for security," he said, "because we are all in this together, and we can never forget it."
Mr. Edwards made clear that his strengths were based in domestic concerns. He criticized Mr. Bush's tax cuts as benefiting principally the wealthy. Mr. Edwards said he would roll back all the cuts except those that benefit "working families."
At the South Carolina rally, a group of Bush supporters carried signs saying, "Ambulance chasers are not regular guys" and "No experience," while others yelled catcalls during the speech.
 Mr. Edwards was once seen by Democrats as a potential front-runner, a Clinton-like fresh face from the South without the whiffs of scandal that trail the former president. But Mr. Edwards veered off the trail this year to raise money and contemplate whether he would seek a second term in the Senate. In the interim, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts moved ahead in polls.

HEADLINE: Aides to General Say He Will Enter '04 Campaign 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Aides to Gen. Wesley K. Clark said today that he had decided to join the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, leaving prominent Democrats to speculate that that Army general with no elective experience could soar or crash -- and in a relatively short time.
 The wild-card aspect of a Clark candidacy, which he is expected to announce on Wednesday in Little Rock, Ark., will probably shake up the already volatile nine-candidate field, but no one quite knows how. 
 "Obviously, he creates a new kind of excitement," said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic strategist and pollster. "If he succeeds, it will be because he surprises people by being credible and having depth and passion on domestic issues. 
"But it is also possible that he disappears into oblivion. He could be flat, he could be terrible with the base, he could not have the common touch."
Word that General Clark was getting into the race -- even if, as some speculated, only to position himself for vice president -- overshadowed today's other presidential primary news, that Senator John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina, was officially announcing his candidacy.
General Clark joins a contest in which candidates have scoured the country for money and support for two years, dividing the pool of Democratic donors and fund-raisers. How much a late-comer can siphon off is an open question. General Clark has no hard cash yet, though supporters have pledged at least $1.5 million. By contrast, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has $16 million.
But in a short period, with no formal campaign structure, General Clark has attracted experienced political professionals to his side, many from the camps of former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore.
He has even earned a stamp of approval from Mr. Clinton himself, who said recently that the Democratic Party had "two stars": his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, and General Clark.
General Clark has also won a potentially valuable endorsement from Representative Charles B. Rangel, the dean of New York's House delegation and a leading black official.
"I want to win," Mr. Rangel said today. "All we need is an intelligent person who can enter the debate on an equal playing field." 
With General Clark, he said, "President Bush won't be wearing any more flight uniforms on the campaign."
In the tradition of other generals with limited political experience before ascending to the presidency, General Clark, 58, said today that he wanted to be president and told CNN that he believed he was the most qualified person for the job. He retired in 2000 after serving as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, and has been a merchant banker in Little Rock.
The fact that he has never been on the campaign trail means that no one, least of all his rivals, has any idea what to expect.
"We'll see whether there's a constituency in the Democratic Party for General Clark," said Jim Jordan, campaign manager for Senator Kerry. "He's obviously impressive. But a career military man with no domestic experience would be an exceptionally unusual profile for Democrats to choose."
Anita Dunn, a Democratic consultant who worked on former Senator Bill Bradley's presidential campaign in 2000, predicted that because the race was "wide open with huge numbers of undecided voters," General Clark would get an initial burst of momentum. But, Ms. Dunn added, "people who have not run for office before, even if they have functioned at a very high level of government or business or the military, find this a difficult arena."
General Clark's own quickly assembled team sees him as a dynamic executive with the unquestioned stature to challenge President Bush as commander in chief at a time of international turmoil. He has opposed the war in Iraq and has been a steady critic of the handling of the occupation. His aides also expect his candidacy to inject excitement, even glamour, into the race.
"He thinks this is a special time in history and that the time is right for the kind of candidacy he has in mind," said Mark Fabiani, a communications strategist for Mr. Gore now with the Clark campaign. 
Experts said General Clark could expect a flash flood of campaign financing -- so-called love money -- in his campaign's first weeks, a result of the buzz surrounding his announcement. The question is whether that will continue.
General Clark enters the race as polls show President Bush increasingly vulnerable, especially on foreign affairs. But they also show that Americans are most concerned about the economy, an area in which General Clark has no experience.
Some Democrats see him as a plausible alternative to Howard Dean, who, some worry, is an insurgent from a small state who could lead the party to disaster in the general election. "I know Democrats across the country who have been waiting for that 10th candidate," one Democratic strategist said.
General Clark and Dr. Dean will be appealing to the same audience with some of the same qualities. But Dr. Dean has nearly 12 years of experience dealing with domestic issues as governor of Vermont. So far, General Clark has offered little more than generalities on domestic policy; his entry into the race will intensify the questions into his positions.
There are practical questions, too. For someone who presents himself as decisive, he has taken a lot of time assessing his potential candidacy. Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University, said he did not know of anyone who had entered a presidential race this long after other candidates and won the nomination.
Steve Kirsch, a fund-raiser and the nation's fourth-largest donor in the 2002 races, said: "It's late, there's no question about it. He's a newcomer to politics, and he doesn't have an organization. But never underestimate Wesley Clark."

HEADLINE: TURF; 
Neighbors Think Outside the Block

BYLINE:  By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
ON a sunny morning last week, Judith Stonehill stood along the Hudson River, gazing ruefully across West Street at two glass towers designed by Richard Meier. "They are striking. They are even elegant," she said of the condominium towers, which stand one block outside the Greenwich Village Historic District. Ms. Stonehill let out a heavy sigh. "They look as if they are from another planet."
 And now they are about to be joined by a third building, also designed by Mr. Meier -- right next door. At 16 stories, it will tower over the mishmash of town houses and warehouses that line the cobblestone street east of the site. The developers have already started demolishing a 100-year-old building there. 
 The endless subversion of the old to make way for the new: that's what makes New York New York. And while residents may fight individual buildings, many who will live in the shadows of new skyscrapers believe they can't do anythingto stop them. 
But maybe they can. Community groups in places like Harlem, South Street Seaport and Park Slope, Brooklyn, have lobbied the city successfully this year to change the rules governing what gets built in their neighborhoods. Their tool is so-called contextual zoning, which controls the size and form of buildings in neighborhoods whose character the city believes is worth keeping. 
The dry, legal province of zoning has become increasingly important to preservationists because it offers protections that even historic designation does not. While the Landmarks Preservation Commission, a politically appointed body, regulates alterations and development within New York's 81 historic districts, only zoning can dictate the heights of new buildings nearby. 
So now, unlike traditional preservationists, who focus on drawing lines around discrete pieces of the past, neighborhood advocates are looking at the larger context. Progress is fine, they say, but does it make sense to plop a 50-story high-rise next to a three-story brownstone? 
"The beauty of New York is that it is a city of mountains and valleys," said Florent Morellet, owner of the restaurant Florent in the meatpacking district, who helped organize a neighborhood group in support of historic designation for the Gansevoort Market. "We need to keep some valleys because otherwise it becomes a plateau, and that is kind of boring."
Last week, the City Planning Commission announced zoning rules that will restrict new buildings in a 44-square-block area of central Harlem to heights compatible with surrounding buildings. The commission has approved similar rules for East Harlem and Park Slope, among others. Now the trend is rippling across New York, as other neighborhood groups bid for more compatible development. 
Residents typically don't pay attention to zoning until someone tries to build something next door. That was the case in Fort Greene, a rapidly gentrifying community of 19th-century brick town houses in Brooklyn. Developers are erecting an 11-story luxury condominium, clad in prefabricated panels of aluminum, stone and brick, just outside the historic district. 
On Monday, 15 residents picketed the construction site, chanting, "Too tall! Too ugly!" as commuters honked their horns in support. 
Under current zoning, the protesters can only hope for the architect's change of heart. But Howard Pitsch, chairman of the Fort Greene Association, a civic group, hopes this clash will provoke his neighbors to campaign for compatible zoning in the community. "That would be a movement which has regrettably lagged behind," he said. 
The rapid pace of development along West Street in Manhattan is likely to spur similar efforts. 
The new Meier building, a project of the developer Izak Senbahar, will join a steady march of new sky-kissing towers in the area. Developers "took a situation that was of concern and worrisome, and escalated it to a crisis," said Christine C. Quinn, a City Council member who has taken up the cause of compatible zoning. 
Mr. Meier responded that existing zoning rules allow new layers of history to enliven older buildings. "I think they complement one another," he said. "They are fine examples of a building of a certain period, and this is an outstanding example of a building of our time." 
Some neighbors believe that development represents progress. "I am not a fan of Richard Meier's architecture, but I am a pragmatist," said Kenny Schachter, whose town house and art gallery sit steps from the base of the southern Meier tower. "We live in a capitalist society, and nothing is going to get in the way of business enterprise." 
But others argue that preserving neighborhood character is a goal that should supersede, or at least run parallel with, economics. They say that soaring contemporary buildings can overpower historic structures. "The problem is that these designs are great on the drawing board but don't necessarily take a look at what is surrounding them," said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. 
His group recently worked to secure historic designation for the Gansevoort Market neighborhood, where meatpacking warehouses intermingle with bars and chic boutiques. While historic designation will give the neighborhood some protection, only zoning can guarantee height restrictions for buildings outside the historic district.
Standing one day this week on the border of the district, where a 34-story hotel is planned, Mr. Berman raised his voice above the din of idling meat trucks. "To say that it would stick out like a sore thumb would be a vast understatement," he said.
Without zoning controls, developers and architects "just insert buildings as sculpture," said Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council, a nonprofit group that helps neighborhoods secure historic designation. Contextual zoning does not mean stopping development, he said, but "looking at the place as a whole, as an ecosystem."
Striking a balance within an ecosystem is not easy, all sides concede. "If every place had contextual zoning, we would never have the Empire State Building or the Guggenheim, which are two of the most uncontextual buildings that there could possibly be," said Andrew Dolkart, an associate professor of historic preservation at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. "Neighborhoods change, and somehow there has to be a balance between these things." 
Pressure to generate new housing is also felt by the planning department, which is "focused on balancing growth with neighborhood preservation," said Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman.
The scales tipped in favor of preservation recently when the city rezoned part of the South Street Seaport Historic District, making it impossible for developers of a proposed 400-apartment complex to proceed with their project. The City Planning Commission originally proposed lowering the height limit of new buildings in the area to 170 feet from 210 feet. Then, in April, the City Council voted to cut it down even more, to 120 feet. Last month a partnership controlled by the developer, Milstein Properties, sued the city.
James M. Yasser, the senior vice president of Milstein Properties, said the neighborhood would suffer. "I'm not saying we were the panacea for the lack of economic activity over there, but building after building along those blocks has collapsed over the years," Mr. Yasser said. "That's what happens when there is no economic stimulus in an older neighborhood." 
Proponents of the rezoning said Milstein had alternatives. "You could have very nice and lucrative town houses," said Alan Gerson, a council member who lobbied for the council's zoning revision.
Of course, it is often the historic character of an up-and-coming neighborhood that attracts developers in the first place. One of the developers of the Fort Greene condominium, David Weiss, said he and his partners were drawn to "the beauty and preservation and attention that the neighbors have given to their own community."
That's precisely what angers residents on the streets that will abut the new building. "This is our hard work that created this neighborhood," said Paul Palazzo, a lighting designer who has lived there since 1984. 
It's not just the building itself that worries residents, but the kind of people the new condos are pitched to. "The thing we love about Fort Greene is that it is mixed income," said Renee Turman, a 34-year-old renter who attended a meeting of residents in Mr. Palazzo's living room last week. The building, she said, "is going to destroy that community because only one kind of person will be able to afford that kind of building." 
She and other neighbors are pressing the developer to change the building's facade to look more like other buildings on the street. "We are asking for a sympathetic melding with that streetscape of 1850's town houses," Mr. Palazzo said. He and his neighbors would also like the building to be lower.
But that is unlikely, given the current rules, which would allow the building to rise even five stories higher than the developers plan. Under strict height restrictions, buying the land, which cost $3 million, "would not have been worth it," Jonathan Jacobs, one of Mr. Weiss's partners, said.
Standing a block from the site of the protests on Monday, Mr. Jacobs said, "We can't be living in the past here." Pointing at a seven-story home for the elderly built in 1929, he added, "When this building was built, I am sure the people in all the brownstones said, 'Wow, look at this modern building.' "

Shares Fall on Weakness in Technology and Oil Issues

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday, eroding some of Tuesday's gains, as weakness in technology and oil stocks offset a rally in shares of the Altria Group after it won a favorable court ruling.
 Oil stocks fell, tracking declines in crude oil prices, on news that record imports bolstered United States oil inventories last week. 
 Crude oil futures in New York ended down 53 cents at $27.03 a barrel, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session and hitting new four-month lows. The Standard & Poor's energy index, made up of the shares of big oil companies and oil-service companies, fell 1.8 percent. 
On a day with little earnings or economic news, investors saw scant reason to buy stocks a day after the main indexes had their biggest gains in nearly two months, traders said. Stocks rallied Tuesday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates at 45-year lows, raising hopes that the low rates would help spur an economic recovery.
"Investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach as we come to the traditional earnings season," said Neil Massa, a trader at John Hancock Advisers in Boston.
The quarterly earnings season begins in earnest in early October.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 21.69 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 9,545.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 3.35 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,025.97. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,883.10.
Volume was active, with roughly 1.31 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, and about 1.89 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq. 
Shares of Altria, the parent of Philip Morris USA, rose a day after it won a legal victory in the Illinois Supreme Court. Altria shares jumped $4.19, or 10 percent, to $44.65.
DuPont, the chemicals maker, warned that profits in the second half would fall short of expectations, hurt by sluggish demand from builders, automakers and electronics companies. Shares of DuPont fell $1.50, or 3 percent, to $42.47.
Shares of Citigroup rose a day after it said that Sanford I. Weill would step down as chief executive on Oct. 1, three months earlier than he planned when he named his successor in July. He will be succeeded as chief executive by Charles O. Prince. Mr. Weill will remain chairman until 2006.
Analysts said Citigroup probably sped up the succession timetable to reduce investor uncertainty. Shares of Citigroup rose 24 cents, to $44.94.
Jack in the Box was the New York Stock Exchange's biggest percentage loser, after it cut its profit outlook for this fiscal year, citing lower franchise fees and rising expenses. The chain also warned of slower earnings growth and a slower pace of new restaurant openings. Jack in the Box shares fell $3.11, to $19.68.
The government said housing starts slid 3.8 percent in August, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are affecting the housing boom.
The Commerce Department also said permits to break ground for single-family homes jumped 2.9 percent to a record high, as builders rushed to lock in construction authorization before higher rates put off buyers.

Treasury Prices Climb
By Bloomberg News
Treasury notes had their biggest gain in almost two weeks in New York trading yesterday on speculation the Federal Reserve would refrain from raising its benchmark interest rate until the second half of 2004.
By late in the day, the 10-year note gained 25/32, to 100 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.18 percent from 4.28 percent on Tuesday. 
The 30-year bond jumped 1 18/32, to 104 5/32. Its yield declined to 5.09 percent from 5.20 percent.

HEADLINE: Most New Jersey High Schools Could Get U.S. Warning Letter 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
About two-thirds of New Jersey's public high schools could receive early warning letters in the next few weeks saying they are in danger of failing to comply with stricter federal educational standards, state education officials said yesterday. 
 The officials said, however, that parents should not panic about the overall condition of the state's 389 high schools, given the requirements of the federal standards established by the No Child Left Behind Act. 
 For the purposes of the new requirements, schools have been judged in 41 categories to determine whether they meet minimum standards. If they fall below standards in any one category, they will receive the early warning letter. Once they receive that letter, they will have to show improvement within two years to avoid being placed on a list of "schools needing to improve." 
New Jersey, like other states, has already been reporting whether its elementary and middle schools are achieving standards set by the federal act, adopted in January 2002. But this is the first time they have released information about high schools, because the state began using a new test -- the High School Proficiency Assessment -- in the spring of 2002, and has only those results and those of spring 2003 to establish a new benchmark. 
William L. Librera, the state's commissioner of education, said in a briefing yesterday in Trenton that he had concerns with some of the reporting requirements of the federal law, but he said that in the long run it enabled states to help local schools avoid failure. 
"At its core," he said, "we view this as an opportunity to both challenge and assess our schools, and lend assistance where needed." 
The new test measures achievement in language arts and mathematics, grading students as either advanced proficient, proficient or partially proficient. The state has to submit results for nine categories of students, including various ethnic groups, economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities and students with limited skills in English, but only if any school had at least 20 students in each category. They also had to report graduation and dropout rates of the school's students and the rate of participation in each of the tests for both years. 
A low score in any category would cause the early warning letter to be written. In each school, 73 percent of the students in each subgroup had to score advanced proficient or proficient in the language arts portion of the test, and 55 percent had to achieve those results in the mathematics portion of the test, to avoid getting an early warning letter. 
"In one school, the participation rate for one of the subgroups was 0.9 percent below the acceptable level, so that triggered an early warning letter," said Richard Vespucci, a spokesman for the Department of Education. "But that's the way the law is. You have to report that." 
Dr. Librera said that a final count of the schools receiving the early warning letters would come in a few weeks. 
Some educators criticized the federal requirements as misleading to parents. The New Jersey School Boards Association has joined a national effort to lobby Congress for changes to the law to make the information more accurate. 
"The public deserves accountability about school performance, but that information must provide an accurate picture," Edwina M. Lee, executive director for the New Jersey group, said yesterday after the high school data was released. "The reporting process under No Child Left Behind can lead to misperceptions and can cast too many schools in a negative light where they do not belong."

HEADLINE: Home Building Holds Up Amid Higher Rates 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Housing starts fell 3.8 percent in August from a 17-year high in July and building permits for single-family homes were a record, the Commerce Department said yesterday, signs that residential construction is holding up amid higher mortgage rates.
 Builders started work on homes at an annual rate of 1.82 million last month, down from the pace of 1.89 million in July, the department said. Building permits for single-family homes rose to a 1.48 million rate, the highest since record-keeping began in 1959. 
 "What the builders are telling us is that they're just kind of keeping up with buyer demand which is very, very good," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "I'm sitting around here being forced to increase my forecast for the rest of this year."
Builders are working through a backlog of orders that had piled up earlier this year when home sales reached a record. Mortgage rates, while up about one percentage point from June's record low, are down from last year's average. Home purchase applications last week were the highest since late July, a separate report showed yesterday.
Mr. Seiders forecast 1.76 million homes to be built this year, the most since 1.81 million in 1986. He had been expecting 1.73 million for 2003. Residential construction accounts for about 5 percent of the value of goods and services produced in the United States and, along with consumer spending, has been supporting economic expansion.
"Housing's contribution to growth will be positive in the third quarter, and likely neutral in the fourth," said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. "Any weakening in housing investment due to higher mortgage rates is not likely to show up until 2004."
Mortgage applications for home purchases rose for a third week last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. The group's index of purchase applications climbed to 432.4, the highest since the week ended Aug. 1. 
The surge in building permits, which often provide a signal of construction activity in coming months, was led by a 2.9 percent gain for single-family homes. Total permits rose 4.8 percent, to 1.886 million, the fourth consecutive month they have held above 1.8 million. That has not happened since 1973.

HEADLINE: Ex-Leader Stole $100 Million From Liberia, Records Show 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia 

 BODY:
Charles Taylor, for six years the warlord president of Liberia, stole or diverted nearly $100 million of his country's wealth, leaving it the poorest nation on earth, according to a close review of government records, an investigation by United Nations experts and interviews with senior Liberian officials.
 Mr. Taylor stole government money to buy houses, cars and sexual partners, senior members of his government said. He illegally diverted many millions in government revenues to buy weapons in defiance of an international arms embargo, fueling a futile civil war, United Nations investigators say. 
 Mr. Taylor started his presidency "just ripping stuff off," said William Milam, United States ambassador here from 1995 to 1998. He ended it much the same way. 
"You can safely say it was tens of millions," Alex Vines, who served on a United Nations panel of experts trying to enforce the arms embargo against Liberia. The embargo "failed miserably, with devastating human consequences," Mr. Vines said. But the United Nations investigators, who began tracing the missing millions two years ago, starting documenting that failure by following the money.
The total of close to $100 million is an estimate of stolen and diverted government funds, excluding graft from private enterprise, since 1999. The sum farexceeds the amount of aid expected to flow to this ruined land in the next year or two. Much of the money came from a shipping network, set up by the United States at the dawn of the cold war to protect American military and economic interests, that Mr. Taylor took control of in 1999, interviews and government documents showed.
Mr. Taylor fled to exile in Calaba, Nigeria, on Aug. 11. Attempts to reach him there were futile. 
But his flight allowed former senior members of his government to speak freely with a reporter, detailing what United Nations investigators also described. These interviews included talks with Mr. Taylor's finance ministers and the governor of Liberia's Central Bank, as well as with Western diplomats, American officials, and Monrovian bankers, shippers and civil servants. 
The bottom line for Liberia is clear. Its government revenues totaled roughly $200 million during Mr. Taylor's last four years in power. Half that money, possibly more, has vanished.
"The revenue base was largely diverted," said Nathaniel Barnes, Liberia's finance minister from September 1999 to July 2002. "I think the original intent was for the quote-unquote war effort. But there was no kind of accountability." 
"The fundamental problem was the leadership's inability to transform from warlord to statesman," Mr. Barnes said.
Twenty years ago, Mr. Taylor was a senior government procurement officer in Liberia. His sticky fingers earned him the nickname "Super Glue." Charged with embezzling nearly $1 million in 1983, he fled. He was arrested in Massachusetts in 1984, then escaped from jail in 1985 and disappeared.
He resurfaced in Liberia in 1989 as a Libyan-trained warlord, leading a rebel force. The first seven years of the war that he started killed about 150,000 and drove hundreds of thousands into exile.
Mr. Taylor and his allies "didn't care how many bodies they had to crawl over to get to the cash box," said Nat Richardson, a former director of Liberia's state mining company.
The war ended, temporarily, when Mr. Taylor was elected president in 1997, in a fair vote colored by fears of what might happen if he lost. Legislators and ministers alike say now that they rarely dared question his conduct in office.
Mr. Milam said that as president Mr. Taylor showed himself to be "primarily avaricious, trying to put his hands on every loose piece of change and every resource he could find."
Then, in 1999, Mr. Taylor put his hands on a unique resource: the Liberian maritime registry system.
Liberian registry was created by the United States in 1948, primarily to benefit Americans. The registry lets American shippers hire crews outside American wage and labor laws; the ships can be re-flagged and made available to the United States military in times of war.
The registry covers a third of the world's shipping tonnage, more than 1,700 vessels. It generated a steady flow of revenues, averaging about $18 million a year, to Liberia's Bureau of Maritime Affairs in the 1990's. The registry has no responsibility for what happens to the money once it reaches Monrovia.
In 1999, Mr. Taylor fired the Virginia company that had run the registry for 50 years and set up a new one. Then, the United Nations investigation showed, he started using registry revenues to buy weapons.
"He took the money from the source," said Chauncey Cooper, a former Liberian diplomat turned journalist and shipping company director. "And he used the money at will."
The money made Monrovia a free-trade zone for weapons dealers, especially after Liberia's neighbors, enraged byMr. Taylor's constant cross-border incursions, started to sponsor rebel forces in 1999.
In response, Mr. Taylor built up his arsenal, paying arms dealers with registry revenues or smuggled diamonds from Sierra Leone, where Mr. Taylor is under indictment in war crimes.
His buyers, the United Nations investigation showed, included his newly appointed deputy maritime affairs commissioner, Sanjivan Ruprah, a Kenyan. Mr. Taylor gave Mr. Ruprah a forged diplomatic passport in a false name, the investigation showed. Then he sent registry revenues directly to Mr. Ruprah, who worked with Victor Bout, one of the world's biggest arms merchants, to buy weapons for Mr. Taylor, in transactions documented by the United Nations investigation.
Gloria Musu-Scott, appointed by Mr. Taylor as chief justice of the Supreme Court, said the spending was illegal and unconstitutional. But some Taylor loyalists insist the methods were justified by the rebel threat.
Mr. Taylor also seized control of the government forestry department's revenues, buying weapons with money skimmed from exports of timber taken from of the last rain forest in West Africa.
Records provided by United Nations investigators and Liberian officials show $66.6 million in maritime and timber revenues that should have been deposited in Liberia's Central Bank from 1999 to 2001. The money never arrived.
The Central Bank, created in 1999 at the insistence of the World Bank and other international institutions, was to be the depository for all government revenues, then running at about $60 million annually.
But no money arrived until 2001, and almost none has arrived since, said the Central Bank's executive governor, Elie E. Saleeby.
Since 2001, as Liberia's economy died, and all other sources of income dwindled or disappeared, maritime revenues became the only steady stream of government income. They should average about $1.5 million monthly. But toward the end of Mr. Taylor's tenure, total government revenues fell to $500,000 a month.
"I know for a fact that not all those revenues have arrived here," said Mr. Saleeby, who worked at the World Bank for 16 years. Interviews and revenue figures produce an estimate of between $20 million and $30 million missing over the past two years.
Liberia's missing millions provide a pointed lesson, Mr. Vines said: if world powers want to stop the flow of arms to rogue states, they might start by deploying an army of accountants.
When he left Liberia on Aug. 11, Mr. Taylor was carrying $3 million donated by the government of Taiwan to disarm and demobilize his private militias. This last theft brings the estimate of stolen and diverted public funds for the last four years of his presidency to $90 million to $100 million.
Almost nothing is left to steal. According to United States officials, Liberia is now the poorest nation on earth.
Though in exile, Mr. Taylor is in daily telephone contact with his allies in Monrovia.
Recently, Cyril Allen, chairman of Mr. Taylor's National Patriotic Party, sat on his balcony, overlooking his swimming pool and tennis court, next to his living room, decorated with leopard skins and a portrait of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.
He said Mr. Taylor would make out fine.
"Charles Taylor has good friends who will give him four or five million dollars, good friends like Colonel Qaddafi," Mr. Allen said. "He's living in style in Calaba. His state of mind is all right" -- with one exception.
"He likes power," Mr. Allen said. "He's missing it."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 10 about a $2 million reward offered by the United States for the capture of Charles G. Taylor, the former president of Liberia, misspelled the name of the Nigerian city where he moved after resigning on Aug. 11. (The error also appeared in an article on Sept. 18 about the way Mr. Taylor enriched himself.) The city is Calabar, not Calaba.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Votes to Give Pension Relief To Companies 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee voted yesterday to give companies a break on their pension requirements, which would save them about $60 billion over the next three years, according to a new government analysis.
 America's pension funds now have a total deficit of about $400 billion -- a record -- and unless the rules governing pension financing are eased, many companies will have to start making large contributions to close the gap. The Senate bill would shield companies from having to do that during a slow economy, helping them conserve cash. But it would also weaken the pension funds, the government projections show. 
 A far more modest pension bill, which would last two years and save companies an estimated $25.5 billion, was introduced yesterday in House committee.
The bills seek a balance between making sure companies keep their pension funds healthy and pushing the companies so hard that they themselves are put in financial jeopardy. There is pressure to come up with a remedy because a previous pension relief measure expires at the end of the year, and without a new one, pension contributions will balloon.
Business groups have complained forcefully that current pension rules are still too demanding, but it has been impossible for Congress or employees to evaluate those arguments because individual companies do not provide current information about the health of their pension plans.
The new analysis, made by the federal agency that insures pensions, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, is the first study of pension contributions released by the government since pension funds began to deteriorate about four years ago.
The results confirm concerns about the pension funds. On the one hand, the study shows that pension contributions grew significantly starting in 2000 and will become an even greater burden on companies in the coming years if the rules that govern pension financing remain unchanged. But it also shows that if relief is given to the companies, sick pension funds will get even sicker.
This year, companies are expected to pay $65.5 billion into their pension funds, compared with $6.4 billion in 2000, as contributions covered by stock market gains in the 1990's were wiped out. 
Next year, without legislative relief, the companies will have to pay about $125.3 billion, according to the analysis.
If the Senate bill becomes law, companies would still have to pay $103.5 billion next year to keep their pension plans legal.
The agency's study showed that about half of the savings to companies in the Senate bill would come from a provision that would change how they calculate the value of their pension promises to employees. For three years, it would allow companies to alter a crucial interest rate used in their calculations; the new rate would make the pension values look smaller. That, in turn, would lead to smaller pension contributions. 
The other half of the pension savings would come from a provision to exempt many companies from having to make special, accelerated pension contributions, called deficit-reduction contributions, for the next three years.
Normally, companies make a minimum pension contribution each year, and must make the deficit-reduction contributions only if their pension funds develop significant, lasting deficits. 
This requirement was enacted in 1987, after a record-breaking pension default at LTV Steel convinced Congress that the basic financing rules, enacted in 1974, were not enough to halt the decline of a severely underfinanced plan.
Until now, many businesses have been able to avoid making these special contributions because of the lag built into the pension accounting system. 
Actuaries customarily spread pension gains and losses over several years, meaning that many plans are only now dealing with the damage caused by the bear market that began in 2000. 
The same lag also means the summer's upturn in the stock market will not fully register on pension books until later. Thus, companies now facing the deficit-reduction contribution requirement cannot count on the markets to rescue them.
The pension agency's analysis found that if the Senate bill becomes law, each of the two provisions would save companies about $30 billion over the next three years.
The study also measured the effect of these changes on the solvency of pension plans. It found that if the current rules are left in place, the overall pension deficit of $396 billion would shrink to $267 billion after three years.
If the Senate bill is enacted, the deficit would also shrink, but not as much, the study said, projecting a $328.5 billion shortfall.
Steven Kandarian, executive director for the agency that did the projections, said he feared that by easing the demands on companies, the bill would put pension plans at risk. 
"These plans are already underfunded by billions of dollars," he said. "This provision digs the hole even deeper, and weakens important protections that have been built into the system over the last 16 years."
Also contained in the Senate bill is a provision that would strengthen pension funds by requiring companies to pay in more as their workers draw close to retirement. 
The pension agency has been calling for such an approach, but the Senate bill would not fully incorporate it for eight years. 
The House bill would change only the way companies calculate their pension obligations -- yielding smaller contributions -- and would grant the change for just two years. It would not give any exemptions from the deficit-reduction contributions.

HEADLINE: Cote Basque, a Society Temple, Is Closing 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
La Cote Basque, the high-society temple of classic French cuisine that became the setting of a catty and thinly veiled excerpt from an unfinished novel by Truman Capote, plans to shut down early next year and reopen as a more casual belle epoque brasserie with lighter and less expensive fare and a different name.
 The closing, after 45 years of serving guests like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Babe Paley and Frank Sinatra, is considered by some restaurant watchers as another blow to New York's dwindling corps of rigidly traditional haute cuisine establishments, with their high-calorie sauces, dress codes and taciturn waiters. 
 In April, Lespinasse, the sumptuous four-star restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel that in 12 years became the dining room of choice for royalty and celebrities, shut its doors. 
But Tim Zagat, a co-chairman of the Zagat restaurant guides, said, "We have more good French restaurants than we had 5 or 10 years ago."
"I would not say it's a decline in French restaurants," he said.
He added that the closing of La Cote Basque was "simply a great restaurateur deciding to ease off at age 70."
The closing was first reported yesterday in the New York Observer and confirmed in an interview with Jean-Jacques Rachou, the owner and chef of La Cote Basque since 1979. The Observer said that in 1975, New York City had 25 traditional French restaurants and that today it had 8.
La Cote Basque, at 60 West 55th Street since 1995 and just a block to the east before that, is known as much for its elegantly arrayed tables, set against a backdrop of handsome French seaside murals, as for its food. Mr. Rachou said he spent more than $2,200 a week on flowers and more than $3,000 on linen.
The restaurant was opened in the late 1950's by Henri Soule, who earlier opened Le Pavillon. It quickly became an intimate dining spot for the upper crust.
Mr. Rachou bought it in 1979 a few years after Mr. Capote published an excerpt from his never-finished novel, "Answered Prayers," in Esquire that indiscreetly told barely disguised tales about his dining cronies. The excerpted chapter is called "La Cote Basque 1965."
In the interview, Mr. Rachou, a witty and expansive man who has been a mentor to many of the city's top chefs, said that with the weak economy of the last few years, he wanted to offer simpler, less expensive dishes, as he does during Restaurant Week.
"I do a special meal, $20 for lunch, $30 for dinner, and then I am full," he said of the restaurant. "This gives me a good idea to create a medium-priced restaurant."
A fixed-price dinner at La Cote Basque is $70 per person, and an average a la carte meal is about $100, not including wine, he said 
In addition, Mr. Rachou said, he has found it difficult to mingle the increasing number of informally dressed customers with those who come in suits or stylish dresses.
"My idea is to make the brasserie relaxed," he said.
The new restaurant, he said, will serve such brasserie staples as cassoulet, tripe and boeuf bourguignon. La Cote Basque does serve some lighter dishes, but it is best known for heavier dishes like quenelle of pike with scallops in two sauces.
"In time I think you have to adjust yourself and do what people are asking now," he said.
Mr. Rachou, who has been cooking since he was 11, said he fell in love with brasseries when he returned to France a year ago.
If his brasserie works out, he said, he might open a smaller version of La Cote Basque on the East Side for its devoted clients, though he acknowledged that many of them have retired to Florida over the years.
"I'm a Capricorn, I'm stubborn," he said. "I will never retire, and if I retire, it will be in glory."

HEADLINE: A Dissent on the Digital Divide 

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
CONTRARY to the federal government's current thinking about the digital divide, the gap may not be closing so quickly after all, according to a new statistical analysis of data from household surveys.
 Steven P. Martin, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who conducted the new analysis, argues that the government's most recent report on Americans' Internet use, which used the same data, was flawed. 
 In that report, released in February 2002, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a branch of the Commerce Department, painted a positive picture of the spread of Internet use among low-income families. 
 Dr. Martin, an assistant professor, contends that the data actually show the opposite of what the report highlighted. 
 "Computer ownership and Internet use may actually be spreading less quickly among poorer households than among richer households," he wrote in an article published this month in IT & Society, an academic journal focusing on the impact of the Internet (www.ITandsociety.org). He predicts that it may take two decades for the lowest-income groups to catch up to wealthier households.
 The debate has been simmering for years. Is the disparity between rich and poor when it comes to computers and the Internet troubling enough to warrant a change in government policy or concerted help from nonprofit organizations and corporations? Or is it something that will quickly heal itself through market pressures? 
 The 2002 report pointed out in its executive summary that Internet use had increased faster for poor families than rich ones.
 Yet earlier reports published during the Clinton administration had been less positive. The last of these, issued in 2000, said that although the have-nots had made striking gains, the disparity among groups of different income levels remained and had widened slightly in some cases. 
 Soon after the publication of the 2002 report, the Bush administration moved to end financing for government programs that supported community computing centers and local organizations that needed technological improvements. The cuts were opposed by technology advocates and rights groups. In the end, the programs did maintain some financing last year. 
 Advocates for community programs have argued that the gap between the haves and have-nots was more troubling than the administration made it out to be. "The digital divide is not abating," wrote Norris Dickard, a senior associate at the Benton Foundation, a technology advocacy group, in a report released last year. "Reduced national attention to this problem will dampen economic productivity and opportunity in low-income and rural communities."
 Dr. Martin does not contend that the government was working with bad data in its 2002 report; the numbers came from Current Population Surveys, data that is collected by the Census Bureau and regularly used by social scientists. He argues rather that the authors focused on statistics that can tell two stories at once, and then chose to emphasize the positive. 
 As an example, he cites the government's use of annual rates of increase in Internet use. It is true, he writes, that Internet use among the poorest families -- those with annual incomes of less than $15,000 -- grew by an average of 25 percent from December 1998 to September 2001, while the rate among the most affluent families, with annual incomes of more than $75,000, increased 11 percent annually. But he argues that is because so few of the poorest families were using the Internet in 1998 to begin with. (Only 14 percent of the poorest families used the Internet from any location in 1998; 25 percent used it in 2001.)
 The percentage of wealthiest families using the Internet in 1998 was already high, at 59 percent. By 2001, that number had risen to 79 percent. Because the number was relatively high to begin with, the growth rate inevitably slowed down. 
 Dr. Martin re-analyzed the data using what statisticians call odds ratios, a method that can avoid the pitfalls of looking simply at growth rates. By his measure, the odds that a family in the poorest bracket would use the Internet increased by a factor of 2.1 over those three years, while the odds for a family in the most affluent group increased by a slightly higher factor of 2.6.
 Using those tools, Dr. Martin said in an interview that it could be 2013 before 90 percent of the poorest families use the Internet, be it from home or a community center or a library. Based on the numbers for computer ownership, he conjectures that it could be 2020 before 90 percent of the poorest families own PC's. (In this case, the poorest families are defined as the bottom 25 percent and the richest, the top 25 percent.) By contrast, in 2001, 88 percent of the richest families owned computers.
 Ranjit de Silva, a spokesman for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, said by e-mail that the authors of the 2002 report used a standard methodology for measuring inequality. Although he would not comment on specifics in the journal article, he acknowledged that Dr. Martin's alternative methodology was "one of a number of other analytical techniques that could be used."
 The government plans to release a new study at some point, although Mr. de Silva could not specify when.

HEADLINE: Republicans and the Dean Factor 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks ("Republicans for Dean," column, Sept. 16) writes: "As voters become more educated, they are more likely to be ideological and support the party that embraces their ideological label. 
As a result, the parties have polarized." 
 I would say the electorate has been polarized by increasingly shrill voices at both ends of the spectrum: the talk-radio personalities, commentators-for-hire, nonfiction best-seller authors, cause-of-the-week protesters and third-party candidates who have spewed faux populism into a media desperate for content.
And the electorate has been polarized, too, by the disgraceful behavior of elected officials in the form of sex scandals, impeachments, redistricting, recalls and exploitation of national tragedy for political gain. 
Most Americans want to make a decent living; we want to be safe from terrorists; we want to protect the environment; we want to provide a social safety net; and we want to create new economic opportunities for our citizens. 
The candidate who can successfully argue these issues will win in 2004.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Embraces Its Offbeat Child, 'Hairspray' 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
It was just after 8 p.m. that the capacity crowd for tonight's performance at the Morris A. Mechanic Theater in downtown Baltimore erupted in delighted roar, screaming for the song "Good Morning, Baltimore," a catchy little tune that celebrates their city and all the rats, alcoholics and flashers therein. 
 The song is the first number from the hit Broadway musical "Hairspray," which is set in 1962 Baltimore and which opened a planned multiyear national tour here tonight, coming home to the city whose very grittiness inspired it. 
 "It makes you feel proud," said Nancy Robusto, a Baltimore native who arrived at the theater early. "It makes you feel good that the place you grew up in is a place that people are finding funny, and interesting, even with its faults. You can make fun of something and still love it." 
Indeed, the musical's arrival marks another step in the remarkable transformation of "Hairspray," based on the 1988 John Waters film, from a sweetly subversive cult movie into a revered point of civic pride. 
The story of a chubby teenager, Tracy Turnblad, who conquers prejudice (and the hunky male lead) by integrating a television dance show, "Hairspray" sold out its two-week run at the 1,600-seat Mechanic Theater here before tickets even officially went on sale to the public. (The theater's subscribers and theater groups bought out the run.)
Online scalpers and those on the street have been getting several times the face value of the $75 orchestra seats, despite the lack of a big star in the cast. As in the film and on Broadway, Tracy's mother, Edna, is played by a man, in this case, Bruce Vilanch, a comedy writer with little theater experience. 
(Harvey Fierstein plays the role on Broadway, while the drag queen Divine played Edna on film.) 
In the days leading up to the show's opening, however, the hype has only increased, with the city's downtown business development group offering "Hairspray" dance parties and lectures on big hair at the prestigious Walters Arts Museum.
A local tour guide has been staging "Hairspray" historical tours, while city salons have been offering deals on throwback 1960's hairdos. 
The city's academics were also getting in the spirit; last Saturday, the University of Maryland School of Law played host to a sold-out panel titled "Hairspray in Context: Race, Rock and Roll and Baltimore," which explored the movie and musical's social value.
"I have never seen a show create so much buzz in an individual city," said Marks Chowning, the theater's executive director, who has managed a series of major regional theaters since 1990. "It's a wonderful story, but its also because it's pure Baltimore and people like that."
All of which comes as no small irony to Mr. Waters himself, the offbeat filmic provocateur who has long portrayed his hometown as a haven of losers, oddballs and societal castaways.
"I haven't changed," said Mr. Waters, who will begin filming his new movie, "A Dirty Shame," about sex addicts, in the city next month. "They've all changed."
Mr. Waters, who arrived at the opening with his parents and was surrounded by photographers, has in fact been active in promoting Baltimore, appearing in a promotional advertisement featuring a photograph of Mr. Waters and the tagline, "See the city that inspired the show." 
Local media outlets have followed almost every development of the musical since spring of last year, when plans for a Broadway engagement were solidified. Since then, the Broadway production of "Hairspray," which opened in New York in August 2002, has already earned back its $11.5 million investment, won eight Tony Awards, including best musical, and continues to sell out regularly.
The Baltimore Sun alone has done 29 articles and editorials on the show in the last two years, including an editorial that named Mr. Waters the "Marylander of the Year."
"Until last August, Baltimore's principal claim to fame for the year 2002 was that it led the league in Wheels Falling Off Buses," said the editorial. "But then 'Hairspray' opened on Broadway and became a big hit -- the biggest hit of the season -- and suddenly there was a national spotlight shining down on a raucous, big-hearted, cross-dressing, mashed-potato-dancing version of the city's hidden, happy self. Who wouldn't feel better about that?"
While the musical takes its fair share of artistic license -- The Sun called its version of 1960's race relations in the city a myth, though a happy one -- the musical's central conceit is based in reality, in particular The Buddy Deane Show and its host, Winston Joe (Buddy) Deane, a 1960's Baltimore icon whose dance show played on local television from 1957 to 1964. (Mr. Deane died in July at the age of 78; his widow attended the opening.)
The arrival of the musical "Hairspray" also seems to have offered a momentary respite from such real-life civic concerns as a high unemployment rate, an entrenched drug problem and, of course, the potential arrival of Hurricane Isabel.
"I hope this will help," said Lola Jones, 56, who was a dancer on The Buddy Deane Show and subsequently became -- no kidding -- a prominent local hairdresser. "They are trying to bring downtown back. And they owe a lot of it to John Waters."

 BODY:
"ESSENTIALLY unchanged" -- that is how Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, described the unemployment rate in August compared with July. The secretary of labor, Elaine Chao, however, hailed the news, saying, "I'm pleased that the unemployment rate has dropped."
 Why the different interpretations? Who is right? 
 In a sense, both are. The official estimate did fall by a tenth of a point, from 6.18 percent in July to 6.08 percent in August. 
But the unemployment rate is just an estimate based on a sample of the population, and like all estimates, there is no guarantee it is exactly right. It could be off because of sampling errors (results differ from sample to sample) and nonsampling errors (respondents may not answer the questions correctly). 
Sampling errors alone are enough to lead one to doubt whether unemployment actually fell in August. 
If everyone in the country were included in the labor force survey, the unemployment rate would be unaffected by sampling errors. But interviewing everyone every month is not feasible. Instead, the survey is given only to a representative sample of households. 
Granted, the number of households is large -- about 60,000 -- but if the same survey were put to a different 60,000 households, the rate would probably come out slightly different. 
"Sampling variability" is the name that statisticians give to differences in estimates that arise by chance because of the particular sample surveyed. This variability can be reduced by drawing a larger or more efficient sample, but not eliminated. 
Fortunately, the imprecision inherent in statistics because of sampling can be gauged because sampling variability adheres to certain statistical laws. 
To distinguish the signal from the noise, the bureau computes the "standard error" of the estimate, a measure of the extent of sampling variability. Under plausible conditions, 68 percent of sample estimates would lie within one standard error of the value that would be obtained from a complete count of the population. 
The standard error for the change in the unemployment rate from one month to the next is around 0.12 point. 
To see why the Bureau of Labor Statistics considered the rate "essentially unchanged," consider the following: If the "true" unemployment rate had remained unchanged, there was still a 40 percent chance that the household survey would have indicated a movement of at least one-tenth of a point. 
Clearly, there is not enough ground to conclude that the rate actually dropped. 
By way of analogy, consider a coin-flipping experiment. Suppose you have a nickel that you suspect is a fair coin -- meaning it is just as likely to come up with a head or a tail -- but you are not sure. If you flip the coin 10 times and heads comes up 6 times, you would be reluctant to reject the idea that the coin was fair. If heads came up 9 times, however, you would seriously doubt whether the coin was fair. 
In essence, the movement in the estimated unemployment rate from July to August, if the true rate was constant, was no more unlikely than getting 6 heads out of 10 flips of a fair coin. 
This approach, known as classical hypothesis testing, is the most widely used method of statistical inference. Like detectives, statisticians gather evidence to see if an initial hypothesis can be rejected. The hypothesis -- in this case, the presumption of no change in the unemployment rate -- is innocent unless proved guilty. 
If the hypothesis is unlikely given the evidence, the result is called statistically significant. The change in the unemployment rate in August was not statistically significant because chance could not be dismissed as the explanation for the small drop.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not use a hard and fast rule for interpreting trends in the data, but it does rely on statistical significance in part as a guide. 
Detecting when the labor market has turned a corner is difficult given the noise in the data. 
How can mistakes be avoided? In addition to bearing in mind the imprecision of the data, it also makes sense to average a few months' worth of data to smooth out blips, and to examine multiple indicators of labor market performance. 
In addition to the household survey, the bureau conducts a monthly survey of 400,000 business establishments to gauge employment changes. 
Because the establishment survey is much larger and is regularly anchored to a complete count of payrolls from tax records, the financial markets have historically reacted more to that measure. When it was announced that employment fell by 96,000 jobs in August according to the establishment survey but grew according to the household survey, interest rates instantly dropped in response to the more dismal account from the establishment survey. 
Much has been made recently of the divergent trends displayed by the two surveys. Since the official end of the recession in November 2001, the establishment survey indicates that employment fell by 1.1 million jobs while the household survey indicates that it grew by 1.4 million. 
But the picture is not nearly as cloudy as some have made it out to be. First, the household survey shows an artificial jump of more than half a million jobs in January 2003 because of a technical adjustment that ratcheted up the size of the population that month. 
Second, the two surveys count jobs differently. The household survey counts people who hold two jobs only once, while the establishment survey excludes self-employed, private household and agricultural workers, for example. 
If adjustments are made to the household survey to make it count jobs in a manner comparable to the establishment survey, then instead of an increase of 842,000 jobs since August 2002, the household survey indicates a loss of 425,000 jobs -- almost as large as the 560,000 jobs lost according to the establishment survey. 
These adjustments do not account for the entire divergence between the surveys since the end of the recession, but both surveys point to a job-loss recovery. 
With luck, the next time an administration official voices pleasure that the labor market has improved, there will be less question as to whether it really did.

HEADLINE: Dalai Lama Says Terror May Need a Violent Reply 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Dalai Lama, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and one of the world's most prominent advocates of nonviolence, said in an interview yesterday that it might be necessary to fight terrorists with violence, and that it was "too early to say" whether the war in Iraq was a mistake.
 "I feel only history will tell," he said. "Terrorism is the worst kind of violence, so we have to check it, we have to take countermeasures." 
 The Dalai Lama spoke in his first visit to New York City since the 2001 terrorist attacks. He is on the last stop of a United States tour that has highlighted his dual roles as Buddhist teacher and head of state. 
In the past 13 days, he has met with Tibetan exiles in several cities, dedicated an interfaith temple in Bloomington, Ind., and pressed the Tibetan cause in Washington. 
At a time when many political and religious leaders are saying that the American antiterrorism campaign and the war in Iraq are only fueling additional terrorism, the Dalai Lama refused to pass judgment. 
But he emphasized that "the real antidote" to terrorism in the long run is "compassion, dialogue -- peaceful means" -- even with terrorists. "We have to deal with their motivation," he said. "Terrorism comes out of hatred, and also short-sightedness."
He likened Osama bin Laden to a butcher who had grown inured to slaughtering animals. With terrorists, the Dalai Lama said, applying a Buddhist analysis, "their whole mind is dominated by negative emotions."
He rejected the prediction popularized by some scholars that the world is headed toward a "clash of civilizations" between Christian and Muslim nations. He cited the citizens in the Soviet Union who once expressed hostility to the United States and the West and have now changed their minds. The Arab world can do the same, he said.
The Dalai Lama, 68, was interviewed in a hotel room in Manhattan as he prepared himself for the first of four days of teachings in Buddhist philosophy at the Beacon Theater. On a table next to his armchair was a stack of thick paper strips with handwritten text that contained the teachings of a 17th-century Tibetan scholar. He planned to use the texts for the day's lecture. 
He sat cross-legged in the armchair, his eyebrows bouncing in amusement behind his glasses. He spoke in English with occasional help from his translator, Thupten Jinpa, and his representative in the United States, Nawang Rabgyal. He had just posed for pictures with a celebrity visitor, the singer Ricky Martin, who left wearing a long white scarf called a kata that is traditionally bestowed as a blessing. 
Since the Dalai Lama was driven out of Tibet 44 years ago by the Chinese takeover, he has never been back. But he said that he "certainly" expected that China would eventually allow him and other Tibetans living in exile to return. He long ago abandoned the goal of independence from China. Instead, he says, he seeks autonomy.
The Chinese government has relocated many Han Chinese into Tibet as part of its strategy to assimilate the region. The Dalai Lama said he was concerned about this "population transfer," and had pressed this point in his meetings with President Bush and members of Congress. 
The Chinese are now building a rail line through Tibet that will ease Chinese settlement there. But the Dalai Lama said that the line was "basically welcome" because it could help economic development. 
He said one reason he advocated that Tibet remain part of China is that "we are materially very much backward." 
As his entourage left the hotel, the Dalai Lama wasgreeted by a crowd of Tibetans, some nannies pushing strollers, many weeping.
"We are so happy and we are so sad, too," said Pasang Keyray, a Tibetan born in India who arrived in the United States two years ago. "We haven't seen him for a long time. We are lucky we have such a good leader." Pointing to the Tibetan flag flying from the hotel awning, she said, "I am hoping to put this flag on Tibet one day." 
At the Beacon Theater, doubled-up lines stretched for more than a block in two directions, and the police closed off 74th Street to cars. Inside, the Dalai Lama greeted more than a hundred monks in yellow and crimson gathered on the stage, and took his place on a raised platform. He spent the rest of the day preaching in Tibetan, reading from the strips of ancient text in his lap.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CONGRESS; 
Afghanistan And Iraq Tab Of $87 Billion Is Submitted

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
President Bush formally asked Congress today for $87 billion to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan and support the troops there. The details of his request immediately raised questions among both Republicans and Democrats who feared that domestic spending might be shortchanged.
 About three-fourths of the money would be used to pay for the military occupation of Iraq, but the request also includes $5.7 billion to rebuild Iraq's electrical network, $3.7 for improved water and sewer systems and $5.1 billion for a new civil security system. The administration wants to spend $850 million on a new pediatric hospital in Iraq along with other health improvements. 
 "These reconstruction funds are essential to secure the transition to self-government and to create conditions for economic growth and investment," Mr. Bush wrote in a letter to Congress. "The sooner we achieve these conditions, the sooner our troops will return home."
Members of Congress said that they would begin hearings on the spending bill early next week and that they plan to begin voting on pieces of the request before the mid-October recess. 
But Republican lawmakers who met with administration officials behind closed doors today said even the president's allies questioned whether the $20.3 billion in reconstruction funds was too generous. Several Republicans said Iraqi oil money should pay for more of the cost, and some said they recommended that the reconstruction money be a loan to Iraq rather than the direct grant requested by the White House.
Senator George V. Voinovich, a fiscally conservative Republican from Ohio, said the American people were going to wonder whether it was fair to have a vast public works program in Iraq but not at home.
"Look at the roads we need to go forward with here, the sewers and water projects in terms of our own economy," Mr. Voinovich said. "It's hard to say to everybody, 'Well, we don't have money for sewers and water, but we're going to put in all that money over there.' What everyone's looking for is a sense of equity and fairness, so it all makes sense to the American people." Many Republicans, he said, want to make sure the money is eventually paid back.
His comments echoed those of Democrats, who accused the administration of being stingy at home and generous abroad. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the request would mean spending $255 for each Iraqi on electric improvements, while the administration plans to spend 71 cents a person on power improvements at home. 
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, introduced a bill today that would cancel a portion of the administration's tax cut for the wealthiest taxpayers to help cover the costs in Iraq.
Republican leaders said that the request was a vital step in the war on terrorism but added that the approval process would not be a rubber stamp. Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said his panel would "ask some tough questions of the administration" and expected detailed justifications. His counterpart in the Senate, Ted Stevens of Alaska, said hearings could begin as soon as Monday, but he rejected a Democratic proposal to have separate votes on the military and reconstruction portions of the request.
The reconstruction portion is only a fraction of the overall cost of rebuilding Iraq, administration officials said, predicting that $50 billion to $75 billion would eventually be needed. About $12 billion of that could come from Iraqi oil revenues next year, they said, with the rest coming from international donors. 
At the moment, however, the administration has commitments for only about $1 billion from other countries, and several lawmakers said they fully expected the White House to return to Congress with another request before the next fiscal year ends, on Oct. 1, 2004.
The entire proposed spending would be added to next year's record-setting deficit, and today the head of the General Accounting Office, in a blistering speech, warned that federal budget problems are far deeper and more entrenched than either the official numbers or the bulge in war costs suggests.
David Walker, the comptroller general and head of the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, said the government would probably have to cut spending and raise taxes in coming years as baby boomers begin to retire.
"It is time to admit that we are in a fiscal hole and to stop digging," he said in a speech at the National Press Club. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 18 about President Bush's formal request to Congress for $87 billion to finance military operations and reconstruction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan referred incorrectly to the way $12 billion in expected oil revenues in Iraq would be spent next year. Bush administration officials say it will be used primarily to run the Iraqi government, with a small amount applied to rebuilding efforts; the entire amount will not be spent on reconstruction.

HEADLINE: In California, Legal Moves And Lap-Dancing, Too 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY; John M. Broder and Charlie LeDuff contributed to this article. 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
As candidates in California's recall election ignored the growing legal turmoil around them, state and local election officials told a federal appeals court here today that postponing the election would create tremendous voter confusion and increase the likelihood of voting errors.
 The assertions were made in papers filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking that it reconsider a ruling on Monday by three of its judges. The judges ordered the recall election for Gov. Gray Davis, scheduled for Oct. 7, delayed until punch-card machines in some counties with large minority populations could be replaced with modern systems. 
 The appeals court, which had asked for the filings, did not indicate today whether it would take up the matter. But with less than three weeks until Oct. 7, a court spokesman said a determination was likely soon, mainly so the dispute could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court if necessary.
"I think we're really talking about a very fast process," said the spokesman, David Madden. If a new hearing were called, it would be held by 11 of the court's 26 judges.
One elections official, Jill LaVine, the registrar of voters in Sacramento County, told the court that in the aftermath of Monday's order some voters were "so disgusted with the entire election they were vowing never to vote again." About 25,000 people in Sacramento County have voted by absentee ballot, and the statewide total is more than 420,000.
Ms. LaVine said that delaying the election had "resulted in more voter confusion and antipathy than would ever potentially occur as a result of the continued use of the punch-card voting system at issue." 
Yet even with the extraordinary legal maneuvering, involving issues no less weighty than constitutional law and the disenfranchisement of minorities, the race managed to amuse, befuddle and entertain.
One of the 135 candidates vying for Mr. Davis's job, the pornography star Mary Carey, held a fund-raiser in Hollywood featuring a screening of her new movie. Tickets went for $20 and everyone under 18 was turned away.
The leading Republican on the recall ballot, the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, was a guest on the Howard Stern radio program after federal regulators ruled that Mr. Stern's show was a news program and thus exempt from the equal-time provision of federal law.
Mr. Stern received Mr. Schwarzenegger warmly and endorsed his candidacy. But he seemed more interested in the actor's views on a new Los Angeles ordinance banning lap-dancing at strip clubs than on his proposed fixes for the state's workers compensation system.
Mr. Schwarzenegger, who is trying to soften his macho image to attract more votes from women, danced around the strip-club issue.
"I don't want to get involved because it's a local issue," he said. "If they think there is something wrong or something has come down in those clubs, that's a decision they have to make. I have to think much more about the bigger picture. The most important thing for me is to bring the economy back."
Mr. Schwarzenegger, like other candidates, said he was not adjusting his campaign to the possibility that the vote could be postponed.
"I think of one thing and that is Oct. 7," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "There will be the election because it's the people's will. You have to represent what the people want rather than what the three judges want."
The punch-card machines used in Sacramento County and at least five other counties are scheduled to be replaced by March 2, the state's presidential primary day, under a lawsuit settled last year. Those counties have large minority populations and accounted for nearly half of the people who voted in the 2000 presidential election.
The American Civil Liberties Union, representing a coalition of civil rights groups that sought the election's postponement, said in papers filed with the court that there was no time for the appeals court to reconsider the three judges' ruling. The A.C.L.U. said the panel had acted appropriately in delaying the vote and in drawing upon Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case resulting from the 2000 presidential vote in Florida. The group said the dispute should go immediately to the Supreme Court.
The A.C.L.U. has argued that punch-card machines have a higher error rate than other systems, an argument embraced by the three-judge panel. But election officials as well as backers of the recall have taken issue with the A.C.L.U.'s statistics, even while acknowledging that the punch-card machineswill be replaced.
"The punch card voting system has been in use in Los Angeles County for 35 years, with over 100 million ballots cast," Conny B. McCormack, the registrar-recorder in Los Angeles County, told the court in a filing today. "I have every confidence that the gubernatorial recall election scheduled for Oct. 7, 2003, can and will be administered fairly and effectively."
Backers of the recall, who are also opposed to a delay, filed papers today asking for the appeals court to reconsider the judges' ruling if the larger court could conduct a "prompt" new hearing. 
Charles P. Diamond, who represents Ted Costa, an author of the recall effort, said the question of a delay was "not simply a scheduling matter."
"Waiting disenfranchises all voters for the next seven months," Mr. Diamond wrote, "stripping them of their recall right and potentially protecting the present governor from the people's will."
Mr. Davis, like the other key players in the dispute, avoided the messy legal wrangling. He stuck to his campaign-as-usual schedule, continuing a weeklong round of appearances with national Democratic Party figures passing through California. Today he met with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a presidential contender, at a Veterans Administration facility in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, four major candidates for governor did their part to keep up appearances as well, meeting in a debate sponsored by the Los Angeles Press Club. Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, State Senator Tom McClintock, Arianna Huffington and Peter Camejo took questions for 90 minutes. Mr. Schwarzenegger skipped the event.

HEADLINE: A Chink in the Armor 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two years after 9/11 and one year before the presidential election, concern about terrorism continues to dominate American politics. For President Bush no less than his Democratic challengers, it is an unpredictable issue.
 The president now faces at least two problems politically. The first is the effect of the war in Iraq on the fight against terrorism. The second is the declining importance of terrorism on the public agenda as the attacks recede and the election approaches. 
 With Americans increasingly critical of the situation in Iraq, opinion is now shifting on how the war has affected the likelihood of another terrorist attack in the United States. In April, an ABC News survey found, 58 percent thought the war reduced the chances of an attack, while only 29 percent thought it made domestic terrorism more likely. Now those figures are 40 percent and 48 percent, respectively.
Obviously, events could change these perceptions, like the capture or killing of Saddam Hussein or a marked improvement in the situation in Iraq. What's more, the president -- especially a Republican president -- almost always enjoys the benefit of the doubt on national security issues.
As the public turns its attention to other issues, however, Mr. Bush's position weakens. According to a Newsweek poll this month, his approval ratings on domestic issues are dismal: 32 percent on the budget, 38 percent on health care, 41 percent on the economy, 42 percent on energy policy.
These issues are becoming more prominent as terrorism loses some relative standing on the public agenda. In a Gallup poll last month, just 12 percent cited terrorism as the country's foremost problem, compared with 48 percent who named an economic issue. Also in August, a Pew survey found that 57 percent of Americans said it was more important for Mr. Bush to focus on the economy than on terrorism.
Of course, the president still benefits from the transformation of his image that occurred after 9/11. Three-quarters of the public see him as a decisive and forceful leader, according to a recent Gallup poll, compared with only 55 percent before the attacks. And public worry about the threat of terrorism remains substantial: that August Pew survey found 75 percent of respondents saying the world is a more dangerous place than it was a decade ago, compared with 53 percent two years earlier.
Even if the economy does not improve, concern over terrorism will play a significant role in the campaign. On this issue, President Bush remains a formidable candidate, and the task for the Democrats will be to nominate a challenger whom voters see as a strong leader. If the Democrats do, and the war in Iraq continues to create controversy, then they might find that the debate over America's response to terrorism isn't so lopsided after all.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE OUTLOOK; 
Rocky Path for Bush: Effort to Remake Iraq Hits Roadblocks

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Everywhere he turns from the United Nations and Congress to allied capitals and the warrens of Baghdad and Tikrit -- President Bush is finding major obstacles to his effort to secure and rebuild Iraq.
 The problems, ranging from money to troops to moral support, are complicating White House efforts to assure the American public that the situation in Iraq will actually improve with time. 
 On the ground, there has been a pause in the sort of major bombing attacks that shook the administration's confidence and forced troops to dig more trenches and put up more barricades, isolating themselves from the country they are occupying.
But now some defense officials are saying the occupation force's state of siege, combined with continuing difficulties in restoring services in Baghdad, is making Iraqis increasingly hostile toward those who are supposed to be their liberators. And today, the eighth tape purporting to be from the deposed dictator, Saddam Hussein, surfaced, urging yet more attacks. 
In addition, administration officials are acknowledging there may be an embarrassing lack of foreign donations to rebuild Iraq. European diplomats said today that the United States would be lucky to get $1 billion in pledges at a donors' conference in Madrid next month -- about 10 percent of what the United States wanted, according to these officials.
The donor disappointment is, in turn, stirring resentment in Congress over Mr. Bush's request for $87 billion in military and economic assistance to Iraq in 2004. Some lawmakers are saying one big chunk of the huge package, the $15 billion earmarked for non-military activities, may be especially scrutinized, especially if donations from other countries are only a fraction of that sum.
Finally, the United States is having difficulties negotiating a new United Nations Security Council resolution to give the United Nations broader authority over Iraq. Such a resolution would make it easier to entice foreign donations and foreign peacekeepers.
France remains adamant that the resolution must transfer much of the authority now held by the American-led occupation to the United Nations itself, and that an Iraqi interim government be placed in charge quickly -- so quickly, in fact, that American officials say they doubt one could be ready.
Progress toward accommodation is slow, administration officials say.
"We've taken suggestions on board, and we're trying to integrate them in a way that makes sense," said an administration official. "But we haven't even finalized language within our own councils. It's still within the Washington clearance process. We're not yet ready for prime time."
The campaign to get foreign troops is still struggling to get traction. The administration says all it wants is about 15,000 troops so that an American division can rotate out on schedule in February or March.
American officials have looked mainly to Turkey, India and Pakistan. But when a top American envoy visited India recently, a senior Indian military officer publicly expressed concern that sending troops to Iraq could leave India vulnerable in the disputed state of Kashmir. 
And on the economic aid front, the European Union, which accounts for 20 percent of the world's wealth, has offered only $250 million for Iraq next year, European and American officials say. American officials have been taken aback by what they view as a minuscule amount. But the political fact of life in Europe is that the Iraq war remains unpopular, and Mr. Bush himself is widely disliked. 
Administration officials and international aide officials say the money is not flowing for many reasons. One of the biggest is that the country remains too dangerous for aid workers to go in.
Another is that there have been no solid budget numbers on what Iraq needs -- apart from an unreleased 13-page laundry list ranging from soccer stadiums to health clinics created by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the administration of the occupation forces. 
"This is a wild estimate, a wish list," said a top international economic policy maker. "The Americans have gone to different Iraqi ministries and asked, 'What do you need?' But it's all back-of-the-envelope stuff."
The United States has made its best headway on getting recognition for the Iraqi Governing Council, the 25-member body handpicked by the American-led occupation. A month or two ago, Arab and European diplomats openly ridiculed this group as puppets for the United States. But, after strenuous American lobbying, the Arab League has recognized the council. Now the United States is trying to get the European Union to deal directly with the council. From there they hope to seat it officially at the United Nations. 
If that happens, Washington feels it can then call on the council to set the timetable for returning to self-government at a year -- and fend off French demands that it be faster.
Officials close to the Coalition Provision Authority say the hope now is for the respite from violent attacks to continue, for some foreign troops to be introduced and for a crash effort to bring in more Iraqis to handle security.
Speeding up the creation of a new Iraqi army and training police units and self-defense militias would free American and British forces to focus on chasing suspected terrorists and attackers, whether they are common criminals, forces still loyal to Mr. Hussein or groups infiltrating from other countries since the end of the war.
The Bush team does not like to change policy drastically. Its plan now seems to be to continue on the present course, get incremental amounts of help on the security side and hope that a more stable situation will open the aid spigots from abroad.

HEADLINE: Colleges Caught In a Vise 

BYLINE:  By Stanley Fish; Stanley Fish is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
When a parent calls to complain about overcrowded classrooms or a reduction in courses and thinks to cinch the case by saying, "After all, I'm a taxpayer and I pay your salary," I respond by asking a question: what percentage of the university's operating costs do you guess are covered by public funds? Almost always, the answer is something on the order of 75 percent. When I say, no, the figure is just 25 percent and heading downward -- and add that in some states the figure has dipped below 10 percent -- the reaction is usually equal parts surprise and dismay. 
 I follow up with another question: what percentage of the cost to educate a student do you guess is covered by tuition? Again, the parent is usually shocked by the answer: if you include not just classroom education but the cost of everything that must be in place for that education to occur -- a library, laboratories, computer centers, building maintenance, utilities, safety patrols and more -- tuition covers only 26 percent. At this point in the conversation the unhappy parent is beginning to see what public universities are facing these days: "You're telling me that state funds are being withdrawn at the same time expenses are exceeding tuition by a factor of three to one. How can you stay in business?" 
 That's a good question. It is, however, one that two Republicans on the House education committee, John Boehner and Howard McKeon, do not seem to have spent much time considering. Rather, they have issued a report, "The College Cost Crisis," holding that "institutions of higher learning are not accountable enough to parents, students and taxpayers -- the consumers of higher education." This conclusion is not backed by any analysis, except for a couple of references to "wasteful spending." But the message is clear: universities should operate more like businesses and become more efficient. If they don't, Mr. McKeon has the answer, a bill that would cut federal financing to colleges whose tuition hikes are more than double the rate of inflation or the consumer price index.
But this remedy won't do anything except make the situation worse. If there is a crisis in college costs it has not been caused by price-gouging or bureaucratic incompetence on the part of universities; a better analogy would be the mass circulation magazines of the 1950's like Collier's and Look, which folded at the very point when they had more readers than ever. The problem was that production costs far outpaced the revenues from subscriptions and advertisers, and every new reader actually cost them money. 
This is just what is happening at many public universities. More people want the product -- applications to my university are up 35 percent in the past two years -- but as the demand for it rises the government support for delivering it is withdrawn. The result: each new student we take increases the number on the debit side of the ledger. Moreover, the costs that neither tuition nor public dollars will cover are rising exponentially. Even if states impose salary and hiring freezes, they would be more than offset by increases no state government can control: raises mandated by union contracts, skyrocketing utility and insurance rates, the cost of replacing worn-out equipment, the cost of replacing equipment declared obsolete after three years, the cost of buying equipment that didn't exist 18 months ago, the cost of maintaining a crumbling physical plant, the cost of security measures deemed necessary after 9/11.
And now, on top of this, comes the threat of Mr. McKeon's bill. First of all, it seems curious to find members of the free-market Republican Party advocating price controls. In fact, it is downright unbusinesslike. Because if a business were to find itself with rising costs and falling revenues it would lop off unprofitable lines, close units, downsize the work force, relax quality control and, of course, raise prices to whatever level the traffic would bear. In university terms, this would mean offering fewer courses, closing departments, sending students elsewhere, skimping on advising, hiring the pedagogical equivalent of migrant workers, eliminating remedial programs, ejecting the students for whom remedial programs are necessary, reducing health and counseling services, admitting fewer students and inventing fees for everything from registration to breathing. 
Now, if a university were to offer this list as its plan to be more businesslike, Representatives Boehner and McKeon, the rest of Congress, America's parents and our other "consumers" would scream bloody murder. "That's not what we're paying for," all these aggrieved parties would complain. But, of course, that would be exactly what they were willing to pay for. 
If the revenues sustaining your operation are sharply cut and you are prevented by law from raising prices, your only recourse is to offer an inferior product. Those who say, as the state has said to the University of Illinois, "We're taking $200 million from you but we expect you to do the job you were doing and do it even better," are trafficking either in fantasy or hypocrisy. I vote for hypocrisy.

HEADLINE: Clark Makes It 10, Roiling Democratic Race 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark's entrance into the presidential race today has forced all the Democratic presidential candidates to rethink how they were approaching what was already a complicated and unwieldy primary contest. 
 But as was evident at General Clark's formal announcement here today, the candidate who might be most vulnerable to this 10th Democratic entrant is former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont. 
 From the moment General Clark -- or "the general," as members of his staff invariably referred to him today -- took the stage, it was clear that his campaign is being designed as an establishment counterweight to Dr. Dean's effort. 
General Clark's aides are trying to do what some of Dr. Dean's opponents -- notably Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina -- tried earlier this year, suggesting to primary voters eager for a victory that an antiwar former governor from Vermont would get clobbered in a contest with President Bush. But unlike those senators, General Clark can also criticize President Bush's execution of the war in Iraq without having to explain a vote in favor of it. 
General Clark has drawn out of retirement a half-dozen close aides to former President Bill Clinton. They helped organize his flashy first political rally here today and repeatedly described him as a far stronger candidate than any Democrat in the field so far. For the same reasons, he has attracted a growing number of members of Congress, including Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who view him as the party's best alternative to both Dr. Dean and Mr. Bush.
General Clark, in an interview this morning, played down the notion that his was a "Stop Dean" candidacy, as suggested by some of his supporters. He argued that his appeal was much broader than that, drawing an implicit comparison with Dr. Dean.
"I've heard that expressed," he said. "But I've heard a lot of people say: 'You cut across party lines. You are drawing independents. You draw Republicans.' They want to know more than just that the war was wrong."
But his relatively brief announcement today -- just 11 minutes long -- contained unmistakable assaults on the more unconventional foundations of the Dean candidacy. From the moment he took the stage, General Clark served notice that he would not let Dr. Dean seize the advantage in drawing new voters into the system, something that has been a critical part of the Dean phenomenon.
General Clark specifically thanked members of the Internet-based Draft Clark movement that helped push him into the race -- his aides put their number at close to 50,000 -- and said that his campaign would be directed at Democrats, Republicans, independents and "those who have never participated before."
"You'll come with us," he said, in a declaration whose significance was not lost in Burlington, Vt.
Late today, General Clark's campaign announced that his first stop would be not in Iowa or New Hampshire, as is traditional, but in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It is a symbolic gesture, an aide said, intended to raise the memory of the disputed 2000 Florida recount -- an event that is as central to Dr. Dean's appeal to Democratic primary supporters as his early opposition to the war.
General Clark's candidacy came with a push not only from the Draft Clark movement but also from the most establishment of Democrats: His advisers include Democrats close to Mr. Clinton, including Mark Fabiani, Skip Rutherford and Ron Klain. 
General Clark's speech seemed intended to bridge the insurgent aspects of Dr. Dean's candidacy and the concerns of the party regulars who have viewed the prospect of a Dean nomination as a potential debacle for the party. 
General Clark recounted his military service and his years in Vietnam, the first thing Democrats point to in describing him as the best candidate to put up against Mr. Bush. He echoed, if in notably flatter tones, the anger of the typical Dean speech as he suggested that he alone could challenge the Bush administration with the "tough questions" that he said would lead to Mr. Bush's defeat.
General Clark, who retired from the military in 2000, marched into the Democratic presidential field with a pledge to aggressively challenge Mr. Bush on his handling of the economy and military affairs. 
But his speech was short on any kind of detailed discussion of policy that has become common with the other Democratic candidates and amounted to a quick scan of the political landscape. He spoke to people who held up signs -- "When Clinton lied, nobody died!!" read one -- that left little doubt how hungry this crowd was for victory next year.
"Now, I warn you: We'll ask the tough questions as we move forward, we'll hold this administration accountable," he said. "Why has America lost 2.7 million jobs? Why has America lost the prospect of a $5 trillion surplus and turned it into a $5 trillion deficit that deepens every day? Why has our country lost our sense of security?" 
General Clark did not offer any answers to his questions today. 
Nor did he hold a post-announcement news conference to answer questions about his candidacy, and once finished, he walked down a receiving line shaking hands, watched over by security guards and aides who pushed reporters away.
General Clark's speech was the kind of criticism of Mr. Bush that has become familiar to anyone watching the Democratic field. It was light in suggesting contrasts on issues with Democrats, signaling that his candidacy will be very much based on the arguments that his credentials and resume would make him the strongest candidate to unseat Mr. Bush.
General Clark is a graduate of West Point and a Rhodes Scholar. He served as the supreme allied commander for NATO and conducted the war in Kosovo for President Clinton.
General Clark's views on issues remain something of a mystery. But his public statements and the Web sites set up by those who urged him to enter the race suggest that he is a moderate Democrat with minor differences with the rest of the field.
He said he would support rolling back some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, retaining those for the middle class. He has presented himself as a strong advocate of affirmative action and opposes the push by the Bush administration to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
He supports abortion rights in general. He said today that he opposes gay marriages but supports domestic partnership. He supports allowing gays in the military.
General Clark's formal announcement sent quivers of uncertainty among his opponents as they tried to take stock of this unusual and late entry into the race. 
Joe Trippi, Dr. Dean's campaign manager, scoffed at the notion that General Clark would become the "Stop Dean" candidate of the race. And while he said that the general might have more success than anyone but Dr. Dean in recruiting new voters into the system, he warned, "The bigger danger is that it becomes more of a top-down, more of an establishment campaign."

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
Lots of Zoom, With Batteries

BYLINE:  By CHRIS DIXON 

 BODY:
"O.K., you hit this button," says Alan Cocconi, pointing to a control on a little G-force meter attached to his dashboard. "Then hold down the brake really hard. Push on it with all your might. When it says 'Go,' let off the brake and hold on."
 With that he steps out of the car. A flat, straight half-mile of asphalt is dead ahead; alongside stretches the runway of Brackett Field Airport east of Los Angeles. With the throttle and brake pedals fully pressed, the bright yellow sports car shudders with power -- but rather than the roar of a caged Lamborghini, the only sound is a muffled whine. Though the whine becomes only marginally louder when the brakes are released, everything else changes as the car lunges forward in a jaw-dropping, stomach-clenching and near-terrifying blur. In 3.7 seconds, it's all over. That's the time it has taken for this little electric sports car, the Tzero by AC Propulsion, to reach 60 miles per hour. And its only power is from a simple array of lithium-ion laptop computer batteries. 
 Few street-legal automobiles are capable of running to 60 m.p.h. in under four seconds, and it's a safe bet that the Tzero is the only electric-powered car that can. The founders of AC Propulsion, based in San Dimas in the suburbs east of Los Angeles, seem to think that the lithium-ion batteries have led them to the holy grail of electric motoring: range and performance in one package. This is, however, after the major automakers have cast aside ideas of all-electric vehicles and turned their attention to hybrids and fuel cells.
Thunderously fast but whisper quiet, the rear-wheel-drive Tzero began life in the late 1990's as a showcase for AC Propulsion's high-revving AC 150 drive system. A 220-horsepower street-legal racer, the car was powered by a series of deep-cycle automotive lead acid batteries. With 1,250 pounds of batteries on board, the original car was good for 4.1-second zero-to-60 times with a top speed of 90 m.p.h. and a range of 80 to 90 miles.
Last month, however, AC Propulsion unveiled the latest version of the car, now powered by 6,800 lightweight lithium-ion laptop computer batteries. With these batteries -- and an increased top speed -- the Tzero weighs 700 pounds less and the company says it will run up to 300 miles on a single charge -- which requires a few hours plugged into a 220-volt outlet like the ones many households have for clothes dryers. It can also be recharged at a 110-volt outlet, but it takes about three times as long.
The car, priced at $220,000, is available only directly from AC Propulsion and has not yet met federal safety regulations. The company says, though, that it is legal for street use when registered as a "special construction vehicle," which is the way homemade and kit-built cars are registered. The Tzero at the speedway had a California license plate and had been driven to the track. So far, the company said, deposits have been made for eight cars with the lithium-ion system. (Two earlier versions, with lead acid batteries, were sold for private use.)
What will a Tzero buyer get?
A car that, from zero to 100 and through the quarter mile, will run with, or beat, the $281,000 Lamborghini Murcielago, the $224,000 Ferrari 575M Maranello or the $440,000 Porsche Carrera GT. And do it cleanly and quietly. However, with the single-gear Tzero's engine limited to just over 100 m.p.h. at 13,300 r.p.m.'s, it will never win an oval-track race against those supercars. But its developers are betting that the car's power and range will generate renewed interest not only in their company's offerings, but in electric cars in general.
The Tzero is the brainchild of Mr. Cocconi, an engineer, and Tom Gage, a former race car driver and an engineer. Mr. Coccini founded AC Propulsion just over a decade ago after having worked for General Motors as a founding engineer on the company's Saturn EV1 electric car project. Mr. Cocconi said he decided to go out on his own after G.M. decided to build the car. "I didn't want to be a part of the big G.M. machine," he said. "About a month afterward, I thought about upgraded chargers and what techniques were possible and I started AC Propulsion." With that, he ripped the engine and transmission out of a Honda CRX, and set to work devising his own drive system. Today, 160,000 miles later, he said, that Honda is still humming.
Mr. Gage met Mr. Cocconi while working as an automotive industry consultant on electric vehicles in the early 90's. "When I interviewed Alan," Mr. Gage said, "it became obvious that not only did he clearly know what he was talking about, but he was doing something about it. I drove a prototype of his and was blown away." A year later, he said, the consulting work dried up and he joined AC Propulsion.
The company's early days coincided with California's Zero Emissions Vehicle or Z.E.V. mandate. When it appeared that automakers would be required to sell a substantial number of Z.E.V.'s, manufacturers were a primary customer for AC Propulsion's systems for testing and evaluation. When the mandate was challenged by manufacturers in 2001, Mr. Cocconi said, sales dried up. Today the company sells its $25,000 E.V. conversions to private enthusiasts and to bus companies. Mr. Gage said that the lithium-ion setup, and plans to offer a conversion system for Toyota's Scion xB, could chart a new course for a company that today has only 12 full-time employees. 
M R. GAGE said that he and Mr. Cocconi realized that they could never produce a car with the economies of scale of a Honda or a Toyota. "That's how the Tzero was born; it's a niche," Mr. Gage said. "We knew it would be expensive because it was hand-built in-house, but it would justify its price because it would have outstanding performance." The Tzero was based on a mid-90's car called the Sportech that was designed by several Detroit engineers and powered by a motorcycle engine. According to Mr. Cocconi, only five were made. AC Propulsion modified the Sportech's bare-bones design with a beefier frame, doors, windows and a roof.
A few weeks ago, AC Propulsion took the revamped Tzero to the California Speedway in Fontana, 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Under the baking sun, the first tests were run alongside a Chrysler Crossfire and a Scion xA that Mark Vaughn, a senior editor of AutoWeek magazine, had brought to track test. Also on hand was Tony Shalhoub, the star of the USA Network series "Monk." Mr. Shalhoub, who described himself as the avid owner of a Toyota RAV4 EV and was tipped off to the demonstration by a Toyota dealer, said that he wanted to see what the Tzero would do. 
On the first day of testing the new lithium-ion system, the Tzero's traction control and handling were not calibrated to the car's 700-pound lighter weight. Thus the Tzero could only muster a 4.1-second zero-to-60 time because its rear tires kept breaking free. In the slalom, the Tzero ran only slightly faster than the Mercedes-engineered Crossfire, but Mr. Vaughn said that with the suspension properly calibrated and stickier tires, it could have run faster.
"It's pretty cool," Mr. Vaughn said. "With a gas car you have to play around with engine power and adjust where you engage the clutch. With this thing, you just step on the pedal, light the fuse and keep steering."
Next, the Tzero and Mr. Shalhoub disappeared up the test track, with an occasional smoking of the tires. He came back, zigzagging on the way, and compared the car's acceleration to a ride he had taken in a Navy Blue Angel jet. "I thought I was at the top end," he said. "Then I stepped on it a little more and it doubled in speed. It's terrifying, but it actually handles beautifully."
Mr. Vaughn, who described AC Propulsion as "the most legitimate of all electric-auto makers," said that the company faced an uphill battle even with the Tzero's 300-mile range and a promised 190-mile range in a converted Scion xB, a small, boxy four-door wagon that is considerably heavier than the Tzero. "For AC Propulsion," he said, "the Tzero alone might not be the secret. Even if they get a sugar daddy, that's not enough. They need to get a Honda or Toyota to say, 'Yeah, we want it.' If they're going to offer conversions for xB's, which makes sense, that would offer a lot."
Last week, in preparation for a pending clean-car challenge called the Michelin Challenge Bibendum, next Tuesday to Thursday in Sonoma, Mr. Cocconi was again ready to put the Tzero through its paces. With suspension and traction bugs ironed out, the Tzero ran the 0-60 test that yielded 3.7 seconds. It was also ready for a drive along the stunning Glendora Mountain road in the Angeles National Forest. With ample opportunity to run in the real world, the car was a wonder to behold. Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released -- slowing sharply as energy is recaptured -- it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a G-force, it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides. After a driver has had a few minutes to get used to the system, there comes a wonderful sense of limitless, fluid power as the car quietly wails, dodges, thrusts and parries on the mountain road.
"That's unique with an electric," Mr. Cocconi said. "Whether you accelerate or decelerate, you're always in the right gear." He said that no traditional stick shift could do that.
In between the beautiful vistas and the twisting road, it was fascinating to catch glimpses of the ammeter, the gauge that shows the power being consumed. While it goes into negative territory on uphill acceleration, it flies the other way on downhills, charging the batteries. Mr. Cocconi said that because of the up-and-down nature of mountain roads, and relatively slow speeds, this is where the car is most efficient. Still, he said, he drove it 250 miles last week on the freeway, and the car's computer indicated it could have gone at least another 40.
At the end of a hard drive, including five scorching zero-to-60 runs, the car had traveled 57 miles and used only 9,900 of the 50,000 watt-hours in its batteries, costing less than the price of two gallons of gasoline. "These batteries," Mr. Cocconi said, "they're really pretty magical."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Six Characters in Search of an Infant

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Because John Sayles's social mosaics offer no pat solutions or happy endings, they are about as far as you can get from escapist movie entertainment and still call it fictional. His newest film, "Casa de los Babys," adheres to the same essayistic format as many of its forerunners. This coolly observant movie follows six white American women, all but one over 30, who are impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in an unidentified South American country before picking up their adoptive babies at an orphanage.
 Despite its emotionally loaded theme, the film is a scrupulously suds-free examination of motherhood as it is viewed in first- and third-world countries. The closest it gets to misty-eyed is in its panoramic shots of wide-eyed Latino infants who will soon be transported from a nation mired in poverty to a land of plenty. 
 Like every other movie by this writer and director, "Casa de los Babys" is rooted in Mr. Sayles's profound awareness of the degree to which the personal is political in everyone's lives, and the ways in which money, class and ethnicity shape our points of view. At his savviest, Mr. Sayles shows an exceptional talent for camouflaging his characters' functions as mouthpieces by giving them sharp, quirky dialogue.
Running just 95 minutes, "Casa de los Babys," which opens today in New York, lacks the epic historical sweep of Mr. Sayles's last film, "Sunshine State." Some of the pieces in its jigsaw puzzle are too fragmentary, and there's a sense of racing against time to fill in the blanks. Yet the movie's even-handed portrayal of two cultures uneasily transacting the most personal business resonates with truth.
As you observe the six Americans trapped in a bureaucratic limbo while the orphanage near their hotel processes the adoptions, you can't help wondering what kind of mother each will be. The most dubious candidate, dubbed "the nightmare in 214" by the contemptuous hotel staff, is Nan (Marcia Gay Harden), a bullying know-it-all who tries to bribe her lawyer to put her at the top of the list for receiving a child. She is the kind of woman who, when stalled, shouts, "Believe me, you don't want my husband to have to come down here!"
Ms. Harden's extraordinarily rich performance digs under the character's abrasive surface to suggest the childhood traumas that hardened her and have put her at risk of inflicting the same abuse on the next generation. Nan is the token Ugly American in an otherwise sympathetic ensemble that finds Maggie Gyllenhaal, Daryl Hannah, Susan Lynch, Mary Steenburgen and Lili Taylor, who play the other mothers-to-be, near the top of their games.
Ms. Gyllenhaal's underwritten character, Jennifer, is the wistful, well-to-do partner of a starchy husband who has already decreed that his adoptive son will carry on his name. Ms. Hannah's Skipper, a Colorado golden girl, exercise fanatic and masseuse, has lost three babies to birth defects. Ms. Lynch's Eileen is a tender-hearted Irish-American who in the film's most lyrical moment dreams out loud about spending an enchanted snow day with her daughter in Boston.
Ms. Steenburgen's Gayle, a recovering alcoholic who speaks fluent Spanish, attends a local 12-step meeting, and Ms. Taylor's Leslie, a hard-headed single New Yorker who works in publishing, rebuffs a macho teenage beach boy, one of many idle Latino men avariciously buzzing around the visitors.
To varying degrees, the women remain unaware of the crushing poverty and unemployment surrounding them.
The local characters, who drift in and out of the movie, include illiterate street children who steal and sniff glue and able-bodied men reduced to groveling for nonexistent jobs. One unemployed construction worker imagines someday settling in Philadelphia because, he says, it's the "cradle of liberty." Yet he could get there only by winning the national lottery, whose magic numbers are chosen by a serpentine, mumbo-jumbo-spouting television astrologer, or by stealing into the United States illegally.
But the film's most poignant juxtaposition contrasts the two cultures' attitudes toward children and motherhood. To the Americans who have lost the race with their biological clocks, a baby is a precious commodity worth almost any price. But to the film's Latinos, who don't practice birth control and who start having families they can't afford to support while still in their teens, children are at best a burden and at worst a curse.
"Casa de los Babys" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has adult language and themes.

HEADLINE: Germany Will Share The Burden In Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Gerhard Schroder; Gerhard Schroder is the chancellor of Germany. This was translated by the German Embassy.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Terrorism continues to be a very serious risk to security and stability in the world. With the fight against terrorism far from over, Germans and Americans stand united in the battle. Together, we will prevail.
 For many months now, German soldiers have been fighting side by side with American troops in Afghanistan, once a haven and a logistical base for international terrorism. I am firmly convinced that we have no choice but to continue on in this common struggle, given the threat that global terrorism and Al Qaeda pose to the international community. 
 I put my own political future on the line in 2001 when I asked the German Bundestag for a vote of confidence for sending troops to Afghanistan, a military commitment unprecedented for Germany.
Until very recently, German troops played a leading role in the International Security Assistance Force, which has brought a measure of stability and order to Kabul and the surrounding areas. Though the force is now commanded by NATO, a German NATO general is in charge. Freeing Afghanistan from the bondage of the Taliban and Al Qaeda was an exceptional accomplishment. 
Now, however, we must focus our efforts on helping a troubled country introduce democracy and rebuild itself under extremely difficult circumstances. Germany is therefore prepared to participate in extending the reconstruction program beyond Kabul and to assign military personnel to protect civilian aid workers and organizations.
It would be tragic, both for the Afghan people and the international community, if this country were to relapse into tyranny or once more become a breeding ground for terrorists. We have a joint responsibility to prevent this, for it is in our common interest and in keeping with our common values.
German-American cooperation is solid in other areas as well. Our troops are working with American forces in the Balkans to ensure stability there. Our navy is helping to patrol the Horn of Africa, protecting international sea routes. And more than 8,000 German troops are participating in peacekeeping missions around the world. 
In the fight against terrorism, German intelligence services and law enforcement are working closely with American and other international partners. And on the diplomatic front, Germany and its European partners are doing their utmost with Washington to bring forward the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Our commitment to peace in the Middle East, based on the security of Israel and the right of the Palestinian people to form a state of their own, is a pillar of our foreign policy. 
It is true that Germany and the United States disagreed on how best to deal with Saddam Hussein's regime. There is no point in continuing this debate. We should now look toward the future. We must work together to win the peace. The United Nations must play a central role. The international community has a key interest in ensuring that stability and democracy are established as quickly as possible in Iraq. The international mission needs greater legitimacy in order to accelerate the process leading to a government acting on its own authority in Iraq. 
In addition to its current military involvement in Afghanistan, the Balkans and elsewhere, Germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid, to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of Iraq and to train Iraqi security forces.
When we gather in New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, we will underline that Germany and the United States are linked by a profound friendship based on common experiences and values. For Germans, the 2003 general assembly is very special. It was exactly 30 years ago that Germany was admitted to the United Nations, a milestone in our postwar history. Back then, Germans were still forced to live in two states, divided by a wall and a dangerous border. Today, Germany is united.
We Germans will not forget how the United States helped and supported us in rebuilding and reuniting our country. That Germany is living today in a peaceful, prosperous and secure Europe is thanks in no small measure to America's friendship, farsightedness and political determination.
Beginning with President Harry S. Truman, all American presidents have supported and encouraged European integration. This remains a wise policy, for a strong and united Europe is also in the interest of the United States. With the adoption of a European constitution and the enlargement of the European Union, Europe is opening an important new chapter in unity. Germany, as a civilian power in the heart of Europe, knows from its own history that cooperation and integration are conditions for security and prosperity.
Not until after the fall of the wall and unification did Germany fully regain its sovereignty. Today we are a full member in the international community -- with all the rights and obligations this entails. Germany's role in the world has changed and so has our foreign policy. My country is willing to shoulder more responsibility. This may entail using military force as a last resort in resolving conflicts. 
However, we must not forget that security in today's world cannot be guaranteed by one country going it alone; it can be achieved only through international cooperation. Nor can security be limited to the activities of the police and the military. If we want to make our world freer and safer, we must fight the roots of insecurity, oppression, fanaticism and poverty -- and we must do it together.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Fall; Long-Term Figure Rises 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell more sharply than expected last week, the Labor Department said today, but a rise in the number of longer-term unemployed marred the improving jobs picture.
 The Labor Department said that 399,000 people filed for state unemployment insurance payments in the week to Sept. 13, down 29,000 from a revised 428,000 the week before. 
 The drop in initial claims was the largest one-week decline since a 31,000 decrease in the week ended April 5, and brought claims well below Wall Street forecasts for 410,000. The previous week's figure was revised from 422,000.
"It's definitely one week's worth of good numbers, but the trend is still as discouraging as ever," said Lara Rhame, a senior economist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The widely watched four-week moving average of jobless claims rose to 410,750 in the Sept. 13 week from 408,750 the previous week. 
The number of people continuing to draw benefits rose to 3.68 million in the Sept. 6 week, the latest week for which figures are available. This was its highest since late June and a sign that people are still struggling to find work.
A separate report from a private research group showed that its forecasting gauge rose in August for the fourth consecutive month, suggesting economic growth will strengthen in the second half of the year.
The group, the Conference Board, said the index of leading indicators rose 0.4 percent in August, matching expectations of Wall Street economists, after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in July.
"The economy is improving, although the road will likely remain bumpy," a Conference Board economist, Ken Goldstein, said. "With export growth still months away, the growth burden remains on consumer spending and business investment."

HEADLINE: U.N. Senses It Must Change, Fast, or Fade Away 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
A mood of skittish uncertainty has descended on the leaders of the United Nations. They are eager to overhaul their institution, but worry whether any change can give it the freedom it needs to survive without being seen as either a lackey of the United States or an easily swattable gadfly.
 The bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad last month has, however, also made the secretary general, Kofi Annan, more aggressive. He is more nervous about putting his people in harm's way, particularly if they are operating with an ambiguous mandate, but he is increasingly insistent that member states end a decade of dawdling and remake the institution to fit the geopolitical realities of the 21st century. 
 Mr. Annan, who says he will outline plans for reform as the annual General Assembly gathers next week, has said that only "radical" revisions in the institution are likely to preserve it. Iraq has shattered any global consensus on handling security issues, and, as last week's meeting in Cancun showed, there is no consensus on trade issues. 
It is already clear that events since Sept. 11, 2001, have cost the United Nations dearly. The fundamental assumption of its neutrality has been supplanted, at the fringes of the Muslim world, with the assumption that the United Nations is simply a stalking horse for the imperial ambitions of the United States.
Two weeks after the Baghdad bombing on Aug. 19, the United Nations public relations personnel in the Arab world gathered here to brief Mr. Annan on this growing perception. Salim Lone, the communications director of the Baghdad mission and a survivor of the bombing, said, "It was clear to many of us in Baghdad that lots of ordinary Iraqis were unable to distinguish our U.N. operation from the overall U.S. presence in the country." 
"This perception is growing in the Middle East," he said. "Extremists prosper from that, which is why I am afraid that a terrible line has been crossed by this bombing and given other groups a new terror option."
Europeans today view the United Nations as the embodiment of international law and world order. The United States seems to view it as a tool to be used when handy. Africans and Asians tend to have more case-specific uses for United Nations diplomacy and its general advocacy for the poor and disadvantaged who are not much in the minds of rich nations. 
But for United Nations officials, many of whom have never worked anywhere else, the bottom-line question remains how to relate to the United States.
"The worst fear of any of us," said Shashi Tharoor, an under secretary general whose entire career has been spent at the United Nations, "is that we fail to navigate an effective way between the Scylla of being seen as a cat's paw of the sole superpower and the Charybdis of being seen as so unhelpful to the sole superpower that they disregard the value of the United Nations."
Mr. Annan believes that one problem is that the United Nations does not reflect the world as it exists today. The Security Council, he argues, must be enlarged, with new members added to both the group of 10 elected nations that serve two-year terms, and the group of five permanent members that hold veto power: the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia.
The General Assembly, he said, needs to remake itself so that it does not simply pass "lowest common denominator" nostrums. "We started with 51 member states and we are now 191 member states," he noted, but "the structure of the Council has not changed."
In public forums and in worldwide news outlets, Mr. Annan has been hammering home his points, saying, with soft-spoken passion, that the global security infrastructure is broken, and if it is not fixed right away, it will be too late.
The United Nations, whose $1.2 billion budget supports three major regional headquarters outside New York, supports more than 9,000 employees worldwide and dozens of peacekeeping and relief missions. Its usefulness -- in places from Kosovo to Liberia -- is not widely disputed, but its raison d'etre is.
American ambivalence over the institution has come into focus over Iraq. The question is now being asked: is it worth bringing the United Nations into more of a substantive partnership role in Iraq's political transformation?
The Bush administration is facing a lot of international skepticism. Despite the recent decision to turn back to the United Nations for its imprimatur on the forced remaking of Iraq, many here fear that the United States may step back yet further from the creed of multinationalism hewn to by presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton and treat the organization merely as a necessary evil.
The latest draft resolution on Iraq being circulated by the United States reflects a continued wariness. Instead of offering the United Nations the role of midwife to a new government, which it played in Afghanistan, or the more direct administrative role that it had in East Timor, it calls on Iraqis -- specifically the Governing Council created under the auspices of the United States and Britain -- to be the midwives of their own future, and to set the timetable for the restoration of Iraq's political rebirth as a sovereign nation with a constitution and a democratically elected government. 
The resolution, as originally crafted, still leaves the United Nations in the role of facilitator, not decision maker, with the job of "providing humanitarian relief, promoting the economic reconstruction of and conditions for sustainable development," and "advancing efforts to restore and establish national andlocal institutions for representative governance."
Such language seems unlikely to satisfy the French and Germans, who see the United Nations at the center of balanced world governance. The French dislike the degree of American power being exercised today around the world, and the American tendency to skirt, isolate or ignore multilateral institutions.
Meanwhile, the vicious, small conflicts that the great powers are sometimes reluctant to confront continue to flare, these days in Central and West Africa. At the root of them is often a pure economic conflict, like the possession of diamond mines set against a backdrop of failed development schemes.
A significant body of American opinion, particularly conservative opinion, is that the United Nations has been ineffectual in halting such conflicts.
In most such situations, said Joshua Muravchik, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, "the story of United Nations efforts to play a security role has been a story of failure, except in a significant handful of cases, like Salvador and the Sinai, in which there really was a deal made that all sides wanted to keep."
Overarching security issues, like nuclear proliferation, are trotted on and off the United Nations stage but never seem to be resolved by the United Nations itself.
In an interview less than a month before the Baghdad bombing, the former British envoy to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said the problem was not so much a growing misunderstanding of what the United Nations is, as a perpetual misunderstanding of what it can do. 
"It sets the agenda on development, environment, rights, the way the world is going to look in the next generation," he said. "It's not a short-term fix organization. The U.N. doesn't have power unless those who have power switch it through to the U.N. as a matter of choice. But on the longer-term issues they are not in control. The U.N. provides the order on the long-term issues."
But it is the current short-term issue, Iraq, that threatens to shape the world body for the long term.

HEADLINE: Snapping ToAttention 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Democrats wandering like outcasts in a desert of disillusion have spotted---- what?
 Is that a four-star general out there? You say he's from the South? And he's a Democrat who wants to be president? 
 All right, all right, calm down! Yes, the original lineup of Democratic candidates -- Dean, Kerry, Lieberman, et al. -- was a caravan of disappointments. But some questions must be asked. 
Is Wesley Clark -- first in his class at West Point, Rhodes scholar, former NATO supreme allied commander, holder of the Purple Heart and Silver Star -- the real deal, or just a mirage?
Is this (by all accounts) brilliant former general really a dream candidate for the parched and leaderless Democrats, or just a dream?
In theory, he's almost perfect. He inoculates the Dems against the G.O.P. canard -- now more than half a century old -- that they are somehow less than patriotic. General Clark was severely wounded in combat in Vietnam and led the successful military operation in Kosovo in 1999.
Republicans are not eager to have the general's career contrasted with the military misadventures of George W. Bush, who escaped Vietnam by joining the Texas Air National Guard and who celebrated the alleged end to major combat in Iraq by staging his very own "Top Gun" fantasy aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln.
General Clark's instincts (or at least the little we know of them) seem to push him in the direction of bridge-building and cooperative efforts, which would be good for a party in disarray, and even better for a country that needs as many allies as possible in the fight against terror and other threats around the world.
With regard to the fight against terror, he has said the first order of business for the U.S. should have been an alliance of the U.S., the United Nations and NATO against Al Qaeda. As for Iraq, in a telephone conversation yesterday he told me the American people deserve to know a lot more about our rationale for invading.
"It's important to ask why the administration set the timeline in such a manner that they were unable to wait for an international coalition to emerge and work together," he said. "And why is it that they failed to plan adequately for the postwar task? Certainly the officers in uniform understood very well the difficulties and what could happen afterward. Why is it that the administration didn't want those difficulties aired?"
The problem, of course, is that presidencies are not won on paper. It takes awhile -- sometimes too long -- to determine what's real about a politician, any politician. Lyndon Johnson ran as a peace candidate in 1964. Richard Nixon said he had a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam. George Herbert Walker Bush told the voters to read his lips. Bill Clinton said, "I did not have sex. . . ." And George W. Bush assured us he was uniter, not a divider.
So we'll scrutinize General Clark, undoubtedly a lot more closely than he would like. Meanwhile, he's the flavor of the moment. He comes across as less angry than Howard Dean (who can give the impression that one-on-one he might put the president in a headlock). He seems more personable than John Kerry, more mature than John Edwards, more telegenic than Joe Lieberman and so on.
The general cheered Democrats with this swipe at Mr. Bush on Wednesday: "For the first time since Herbert Hoover's presidency, a president's economic policies have cost us more jobs than our economy has the energy to create."
But he also said that while his campaign is committed to asking hard questions and demanding answers, "we're going to do so not in destructive bickering or in personal attacks, but in the highest traditions of democratic dialogue."
The comparisons of General Clark to a fellow named Eisenhower are as overblown at this point as they are inevitable. But there's a lot that any candidate can learn from the Eisenhower model: the quick and endearing smile, the optimism, the quiet sense of strength, the ability to read and reflect the national mood.
We'll know a lot more about General Clark soon enough. Meanwhile, the Democrats should welcome him not as a savior but as someone with the potential to energize their stagnant field of presidential contenders.

Paul Krugman is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Tourist Draw for Sale, With Mystery the Lure 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: GOLD HILL, Ore. 

 BODY:
Deep in the woods of this old gold mining town in southern Oregon, there is an unusual 22-acre lot for sale. 
 The asking price is $3.5 million, astoundingly high for a country-road plot with a three-bedroom house tucked away in an economically struggling corner of the country. But on one of these acres lies the Oregon Vortex, which is either a passport to the paranormal or one terrific tourist trap, depending on whom you believe. 
 "World famous-renowned business," reads the real estate advertisement for the property, 4303 Sardine Creek Road in Gold Hill, which was opened to the public in 1930. 
The Cooper family has run a business at the Oregon Vortex for more than 40 years, and every year it draws thousands of tourists, mystics, psychics, scientists and those obsessed with the unexplainable.
The vortex is billed as a mysterious point where some laws of physics are temporarily suspended as the result of a confluence of magnetic fields.
The owner, Maria D. Cooper, and the other tour guides say the vortex makes objects defy gravity and other laws of nature. Balls roll uphill, brooms stand on end and people appear dramatically taller or shorter as they switch places. 
Some people even visit the vortex because they find relief there for their back pain, Ms. Cooper said.
"It's a unique piece of land and we don't really know what makes it all happen," she said. "It is strongest when the moon is full."
Admission costs $6 to $8.
There are dozens of such mysterious places and legends around the country and the world. A partial list includes the Bermuda Triangle and sites called Gravity Hill, Anti-Gravity Hill, Spook Hill and Confusion Hill. Many of the mysteries at such sites have been debunked as the result of fraud or optical illusion, although the debunking apparently does little to deter tourism, lively debates and a deep fascination with such "X-Files"-style attractions.
The Oregon Vortex was featured on an episode of "The X-Files" in 1999, and is among the most alluring of these mystery spots, according to a review of travel guides and the many Web sites that mention it.
"After subjecting many spots to rigorous, very scientific tests, our Mystery Spot Test Kit indicates that the Oregon Vortex is the most disturbed," according to Roadside America, an on-line guide to "off-beat" tourist attractions. 
So what exactly happens at the Oregon Vortex? 
Ms. Cooper's family bought the property in 1960 from the wife of a local scientist and mining engineer, John Litser, who had conducted experiments on the vortex and died in 1959. She said a spherical field of force and 15 crisscrossing magnetic fields created a variety of strange occurrences on three-quarters of an acre.
Legend has it that after compiling his findings, Mr. Litser said, "The world is not ready for this," and burned all of his notes.
But on sale for $7 at the Oregon Vortex gift shop is a small pamphlet of Mr. Litser's notes. In "Notes and Data Relative to the Phenomena at the Area of the House of Mystery," he argues that an actual vortex exists here, half above ground and half below, affecting a circular area measuring 165 feet, 4 1/2 inches in diameter. 
The woodsy hilly property, with steep slopes and skewed angles, also includes the "House of Mystery," a slanted wooden shack built in 1890 as an assay office for a gold mining company here, before it slid off its foundation. The house then became the perfect laboratory for demonstrating the "unusual conditions that exist here," according to the brochure for the Oregon Vortex and the House of Mystery.
As this reporter, who is admittedly prone to motion sickness, stood within the confines of the Oregon Vortex, it felt like being on a small boat in choppy waters with a hangover.
Nevertheless, scientists and other skeptics do not buy it. Places like the vortex, with their hills and weird angles, can leave people feeling disoriented and susceptible to tricks of the mind and eye.
"It's an optical illusion," said Russell J. Donnelly, a professor of physics at the University of Oregon. "It's kind of cute. I'm a professional scientist, and I don't like to debunk everything -- it's a harmless fantasy."
James Randi, a former magician who is now the nation's most prominent skeptic on all matters illusory, paranormal and occult, said that the mind often played tricks on visitors to places like the Oregon Vortex and that too many operators of such attractions cashed in on those deceptions.
"People believe, falsely, that what they see with their senses must be real," Mr. Randi said. "Your senses deceive you all the time, otherwise David Copperfield would be out of business."
But others resist these conclusions. "You can find scientific survey maps of the United States and the planet that show both magnetic and gravitational anomalies," said Michael A. Grizzel, a chemical engineering and biotechnology researcher at the University of Maryland, who started the Enigma Project in 1978 to investigate claims of paranormal and unexplained phenomena. "That's not to say they represent anything of real high strangeness, but that possibly leaves the door open for some type of bona fide mystery."
Mr. Grizzel insisted that until a full and independent scientific investigation was conducted on the Oregon Vortex, it still qualified as a mystery.
Ms. Cooper, 60, who was a psychiatric social worker before she took over at the House of Mystery for her ailing father in the late 1970's, said she was ready to retire from the vortex tourism business.
"It's time for me to move on," she said, after an hourlong tour on a recent Sunday to 32 baffled and dizzy vortex visitors, a tour she gives several times a week. "It's time for me to turn it over to another."
She said that a few people had bid on the land but that nothing was official yet.
Meanwhile, the vortex is as popular as ever. Carla Bryant was on her second visit recently, 54 years after she first saw it as a 10-year-old with her parents. After the tour, she said she was as convinced as ever that something strange was going on in Gold Hill.
"I had to come back," she said. "I married a man from Maine who never, never sees anything like this."

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion'

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
Directed by Tom Peosay
Not rated, 100 minutes
 Tom Peosay's documentary "Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion" is an impeccably made, often moving account of the captive nation of Tibet, forcibly annexed by China more than 50 years ago. 
Using material gathered during 10 years, Mr. Peosay's film functions as both a breathtaking travelogue and a political provocation, offering convincing evidence of the Chinese government's determination to wipe out Tibetan culture and identity.
Although the film pays ample tribute to Tibet's status as a Buddhist spiritual capital, "Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion" also deals in brute, practical politics, examining Tibet's strategic position as a buffer between two of the world's most populous states -- China and India -- and its importance to the Chinese as a power base in the Himalayas.
Some of the most powerful imagery in the film comes from Mr. Peosay's exploration of ruined Tibetan monasteries. As the narrator, Martin Sheen, notes, the ruins look as if they date from a far distant past, when, in fact, the monasteries were systematically destroyed by Chinese military forces in the late 1950's and early 60's. (Another wave of destruction came with the Cultural Revolution, beginning in 1966.) Not only buildings were attacked: a Buddhist nun describes her savage torture at the hands of Chinese military officials with a gasp-inducing matter-of-factness.
The Chinese government, Mr. Peosay suggests, no longer needs to deal in such crude and obvious methods. Its weapons now are economic ones, as it tries to flood Tibet with immigrants from central China, bringing the dubious material benefits of China's overheated economy with them. With Lhasa, Tibet's capital, overwhelmed with tourists (a new railroad connection is expected to bring even more), Tibetan culture and religion have been turned into more commodities, to be peddled in the form of cheap souvenirs manufactured and sold largely by Chinese immigrants.
Mr. Peosay has arranged his complex material with analytical intelligence and solid dramatic instinct. Though the film is plainly partisan, it also finds room for a Chinese government spokesman to explain his position -- that China is merely doing its duty by bringing Tibet into the 21st century -- without overtly ridiculing him, a gesture of maturity and respect that seems quite important in the context of today's cheaply sarcastic and grossly manipulative political documentaries, as pioneered by Michael Moore.
"Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion" opens today in New York. A more concise and affecting summation of the Tibetan crisis would be hard to imagine. DAVE KEHR

HEADLINE: Argentina Preparing Debt Plan 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
A three-year deal with the International Monetary Fund finally completed, Argentina is preparing to present a plan to renegotiate $90 billion of defaulted debt with private investors across the globe.
 Argentine officials are hinting at an ample menu of options for bondholders, but analysts say many will find the choices unpalatable. And if other creditors follow the path of Kenneth Dart, an American billionaire who this week won a $700 million lawsuit in a Manhattan court for full repayment of his Argentine bonds, the result could be grimmer all around. 
 Argentina's economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, who is to present the plan at the International Monetary Fund meeting that opened this week in Dubai, recently predicted that investors would be unhappy. 
"There will obviously be a lot of long faces pulled in various languages," Mr. Lavagna said in a television interview, but he added: "After our offer, there will be a plan. There will be alternatives. There will be a menu of options."
Analysts are predicting at least three major choices, simplifying a clutter of more than 150 types of Argentine bonds on the market: First, a par bond with no write-down of principal but a sharply reduced interest rate and a longer maturity. Second, a discount bond demanding a sizable reduction in investors' principal but carrying a higher interest rate and a shorter maturity. And third, a bond indexed to Argentina's economic performance in coming years.
Walter Molano, chief Latin American economist at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn., said the innovative indexed bonds could be a good bet, as Argentina is growing again after four years of recession, though he predicted that most investors would play it safe and opt for the par bond.
Others say indexing bonds to economic performance throws up fresh questions of how growth rates are calculated and whether bondholders will take the Argentine authorities' claims on trust.
So far, the country's new and immensely popular president, Nestor Kirchner, has been given the benefit of the doubt. And his gambit of taking a hard line with the I.M.F. seems to have paid off.
Last week, a day after Argentina failed to make a $3 billion payment to the fund -- the single largest nonpayment of a loan in I.M.F. history -- negotiators signed a three-year deal to refinance $21 billion of debt to multilateral agencies like the World Bank without imposing as much fiscal austerity on Argentina.
Mr. Kirchner agreed to aim next year for a primary budget surplus of 3 percent of gross domestic product -- far lower than the targets of other I.M.F.-assisted countries in the region -- but left the targets for 2005 and 2006 open to negotiation.
The 3 percent target, according to Adauto Lima, who tracks Argentina for WestLB in Sao Paulo, would hardly cover the Argentine government's obligations on other bonds it has not defaulted on, so he predicted that the offer to bondholders next week would be less than generous.
"Their senior debt is already more than 3 percent of G.D.P.," Mr. Lima said. "And even if Argentina grows at 5 percent in the next years, there still won't be that much money left over to pay bondholders."
Mr. Lavagna indicated that Argentina would be no more conciliatory to private investors than it was to the I.M.F., saying: "Let there be no doubt, we are prepared for them to reject our first offer out of hand."
Such tactics, Mr. Lima said, could prompt a slew of court cases by unhappy investors, though few will have had as much experience as Mr. Dart. His companies bought bonds worth 595 million pesos before last year's sharp devaluation, which unhooked the Argentine currency from parity to the dollar. Factoring in just the devaluation that reduced the peso to a third of its former worth, those bonds would now have a face value of $203 million.
Mr. Dart contended that Argentina must honor his bonds at the pre-devaluation rate plus interest, bringing the total to $700 million.
Judge Thomas P. Griesa of United States District Court in Manhattan agreed, but he suspended payment for 45 days, given that Argentina is about to present its restructuring plan.
Argentine officials have called Mr. Dart a "vulture capitalist," and Mr. Lavagna accused him of buying the bonds "for no other reason than to sue the government."

HEADLINE: Japan's Economic Surge Is Giving Koizumi aLift 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi must be counting his lucky stars.
 Just a few months back, most analysts thought he would have trouble being re-elected president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party at party polls this Saturday, and therefore might lose his job as prime minister. Economists were speaking of another recession, stock prices had fallen to 20-year lows and Japan's banks were tottering yet again. Mr. Koizumi, who spent his first two years in office raising taxes and cutting public spending, would be blamed. 
 But now Mr. Koizumi looks like a genius, even if his policies to date have had little to do with the improvement in the economy or stock prices. Japan grew 3.9 percent in annualized terms in the second quarter, outpacing the American economy. The Nikkei 225, though still 25 percent below where it was when Mr. Koizumi took power in May 2001, has risen 44.5 percent in the last five months. Higher stock prices have also taken the heat off the banks.
The turnaround has all but guaranteed Mr. Koizumi a victory on Saturday, which paves the way for a new three-year term as premier. 
The question then, is whether Mr. Koizumi can keep the party rolling by breaking his promises to cut spending, or whether he will use his fresh mandate to push through his reform plans that could scuttle the recovery.
Political logic dictates that leaders returned to power want to make good on their campaign promises. In Mr. Koizumi's case, that would mean continuing to rein in Japan's huge budget deficit and breaking up the bureaucracies that dole out pork-barrel projects. While laudable as long-term goals, in the short term they have deepened Japan's deflation and slowed the economy's recovery.
There are signs, though, that Mr. Koizumi will be less dogmatic about fiscal prudence in a second term. The prime minister, analysts say, has probably promised to ratchet up spending in the next year to obtain the needed votes to win re-election as party chief. With elections for the lower house of Parliament likely in November, Mr. Koizumi will want to appeal to voters in crucial rural districts, which receive a disproportionate amount of public works projects.
Mr. Koizumi might also be forced to replace his finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, with a Liberal Democratic kingpin like Taro Aso or Mitsuo Horiuchi, who can bring him the needed votes but will want more spending in return.
"It's a pure coincidence that the economy has picked up before the elections," said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at UBS Securities, dismissing Mr. Koizumi's claims that his policies are responsible for this year's surprising growth. "Despite Koizumi's adherence to tight fiscal policy, he will be under pressure to come up with a supplementary budget."
Some extra spending -- say, an additional budget worth 5 trillion yen ($43 billion), or 1 percent of gross domestic product -- will fuel the recovery. Money spent building day care centers, enhancing the country's research facilities and other products could add jobs and bolster the country's economic potential. An extra budget, which might be compiled before the end of the year, could convince economists to upgrade their growth forecasts.
Bending to demands from the public and those in his own party, however, will undermine Mr. Koizumi's credentials as a reformer. 
To at least maintain the impression that he is still committed to attacking the bigger problems that plague Japan, like its bloated bureaucracy, its runaway debt and a shaky financial system, he will probably retain Nobuteru Ishihara as minister of administrative reform and let Heizo Takenaka remain banking czar, but remove him as economy minister.
But few backers of reform will be deceived by these gestures. Mr. Koizumi is foremost a pragmatist who bases his economic decisions on their political consequences. His efforts to unravel Japan's vast bureaucracies are driven more by a desire to punish his rivals than to unleash any competitive economic forces, they say. But Mr. Koizumi will need to repay those same rivals who backed him for re-election, a sign that his reformist zeal may fade.
"Although some observers may expect structural reform to move forward as the opposition forces lose strength, our view instead is that the process would further sidetrack Koizumi's reform drive," said Yukari Sato, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities.
Even when Mr. Koizumi could have made a bold move to overhaul the economy or end deflation, by appointing a new central bank governor, for instance, he chose a centrist to maintain harmony between competing bureaucracies. 
This suggests that Mr. Koizumi's promises to take significant steps to reform Japan during his second term will fall flat and that ultimately he will bend to pressure and spend more to keep the economy growing, at least until the next election.
"He has had terrific opportunities during the past two and a half years to do something to boost the economy, and he hasn't," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Securities in Tokyo. "Elections are always a chance to claim something radical is going to happen, but nothing ever happens."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: INTERIM GOVERNMENT; 
Iraqi Factions Seek to Take Over Security Duties

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: SALAHUDDIN, Iraq, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
Five Iraqi leaders devised a sweeping new security proposal today that would call for most American troops to withdraw to their bases and turn over day-to-day police duties to Iraqi militia forces working under a new interior ministry.
 While the proposal still requires approval from Iraq's Governing Council and the American authorities, it represented the strongest action to date on the deteriorating security climate in Iraq by leaders of the former Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein. 
 Some of these leaders, who met privately here in this city in northeastern Iraq to create the proposal, said they were prompted to act out of deep frustrations over the continuing instability in the country. 
Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party and the host of the meeting, said in an interview that United States forces were making serious mistakes by trying to become a "front line" occupation force. He said they needed to turn over this task quickly to Iraqi militia forces who could work with Iraqi civic and tribal leaders to draw up security arrangements tailored to each part of the country. 
The proposal, which will be presented to American officials in the next few days, raised questions of how the disparate Iraqi militias would function together, if at all, and whether their return to the streets would foment a kind of warlordism in Iraq. The Iraqi leaders said, however, that their forces could be integrated under the control of a new interior ministry and monitored by Iraq's interim government and the United States military.
The militias, Mr. Barzani said, could provide a transitional force until tens of thousands of Iraqi police officers and a new Iraqi army were ready to assume the task. 
Mr. Barzani said Iraqi leaders want to continue to work closely with the more than 140,000 allied forces in Iraq, but he indicated that the five former opposition leaders would recommend to the 25-member Governing Council that the United States military take a secondary and much reduced role. 
"The biggest mistake the Americans have made is to confront the Iraqis face to face and to be in the front line of confrontation," Mr. Barzani said. "But I think American forces should be withdrawn to bases nearby. They should not be policing and conducting patrols. They should hand over these duties to Iraqis."
It was not immediately clear how the United States will respond to the proposal. But military authorities have said they would be receptive to a workable plan to speed up the transfer of security functions in the country to the Iraqis.
Gen. John P. Abizaid, who heads the United States Central Command, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that American military commanders were considering a plan to pull back from policing duties by next spring.
The commander of the allied forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, told reporters in Baghdad today they "would be willing to do that immediately" if local security forces were prepared to take over.
The plan drawn up by the Iraqi opposition leaders would call for a more rapid pullback of allied forces and would bring into play Kurdish, Shiite and other militia forces that the American military commanders have either sought to disarm, disband, or, in the case of the Kurds, restrict to guard duties in the Kurdish homelands in northern Iraq.
The meeting here was unannounced and came as a surprise to some members of the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council in Baghdad. 
No American military officials were present, but a senior Central Intelligence Agency officer in Iraq lunched with the five leaders at Mr. Barzani's guest house here. When a reporter was invited into the lunch by Mr. Barzani, the C.I.A. official and his aides departed.
The dramatic initiative by the core leaders of the former Iraqi opposition to Mr. Hussein follows a month of increasing violence and security setbacks for American forces that have created a perception that the American security plan for postwar Iraq is failing.
Today's meeting also reflected the growing determination on the part of the interim Iraqi government to assert itself politically by insisting on taking over more responsibility from the Coalition Provisional Authority headed by L. Paul Bremer III. 
"The Iraqi people understand the logic of liberation and they reject the logic of occupation," said Ahmad Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and one of the participants in today's meeting. Mr. Chalabi is president of the Iraqi Governing Council this month under a rotation arrangement. "The faster that sovereignty is vested in the Iraqis, the faster that security will be established in the country," he said.
Mr. Chalabi, who leaves for the United States this weekend, said the new security plan had been completed. It was expected that it would be presented to senior Bush administration officials in coming days. 
"It would put the Iraqi militias under the ministry of interior and take control of security in agreement with the Americans with some sort of liaison so we can avoid incidents of friendly fire," he said, adding that the plan could be carried out this fall.
Also attending the meeting were Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the second largest Kurdish faction; Iyad Alawi, leader of the Iraqi National Accord; and Adel Abdul Mahdi, a senior official of the main Shiite religious party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.
"The current situation cannot continue," said Mr. Abdul Mahdi, whose party blamed American forces for the security lapse that led to the car-bomb attack that killed Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim. "The death of Ayatollah Hakim was for us like Sept. 11, and we believe Iraqis now should take a clear responsibility on the question of security." 
A number of Governing Council members, including Mr. Abdul Mahdi, said in interviews that they would take no step to undermine the relationship between the interim government and the occupation authority. They added, however, that they were resolved to assume a greater measure of sovereignty and more authority for the current interim government while following an agreed plan to write a constitution and hold elections for a permanent government over the next year.
"We do not prefer to do things quickly at the expense of doing them well," said Akila al-Hashemi, a Shiite from a prominent religious family in Najaf who held a Foreign Ministry post in Mr. Hussein's government and was selected to serve on the Governing Council. 
But in comments reflecting the current mood on the Governing Council, Ms. Hashemi told a group of her colleagues recently, "Rights are taken, they are not given."
A number of Iraqi ministers appointed this month to take over major sectors of the government and economy already have complained to the Governing Council that they have no budget resources and that their directives are either ignored or reversed by Mr. Bremer's staff.
Nevertheless, some of Mr. Bremer's aides believe that the interim Iraqi government is ill equipped to assume greater responsibilities.
A proposal by France this month to transfer sovereignty to the interim Iraqi government within weeks seems to have been rejected by some Governing Council members. 
"We are not counting on the French position," said Muhammad Othman, a Kurdish physician who returned from exile in London to join the Iraqi council. "But it is a good opportunity to push our cause and to get a resolution at the United Nations that restores our sovereignty."
Ms. Hashemi, who visited Paris on Sept. 10 and met Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, said she admonished the French not to try to drive a wedge between the United States and the new Iraqi government by offering a tempting plan for quick sovereignty.
"Don't think the Iraqis will ever forget what the Americans did in liberating them," she said she told French officials, adding, "We will not allow the Americans to fail."

HEADLINE: Dalai Lama Lite 

BYLINE:  By Patrick French; Patrick French is author of "Tibet, Tibet: A Personal History of a Lost Land."

DATELINE: SALISBURY, England 

 BODY:
I first met the Dalai Lama almost 20 years ago when I was a teenager studying at a college run by Roman Catholic monks. He had come to see a Christian monastery in action. Although the Dalai Lama was not a globally famous figure at that time, I was captivated immediately by his charisma, and by the tragic plight of the Tibetan people. I visited China and Tibet two years later, in 1986, and later became a director of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign.
 During his current tour of the United States, the Dalai Lama has confirmed his status as the world's No. 1 feel-good guru, reaching across boundaries of culture and religion. Who could fail to admire a spiritual leader who, fresh from meeting President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, tells Harvard students to spend less time on their studies and more on becoming nice people, and makes them laugh by telling how he hit a parrot with a stick when he was "a young, naughty Dalai Lama?" A leader who suggests that dialogue and compassion are the best way to deal with terrorists? Who gives a free public talk in Central Park? 
 But the risk of the Dalai Lama's ever growing celebrity is that it distorts what he really represents, namely an ancient cultural tradition that is not always appealing to the Western world. In short, the Dalai Lama -- or a simplified version of him -- has been appropriated by the American people over the last decade. A chain e-mail message recently circulated with his "millennium mantra," offering advice such as "Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon" and "Once a year, go someplace you've never been before." This e-mail message was in fact a hoax, but it nevertheless was widely circulated. During his United States tour in 2000, after being briefly mistaken for a Muslim by Larry King on CNN, the Dalai Lama had to endure being introduced to a crowd in Los Angeles by Sharon Stone. Barefoot and draped in a feather boa, she described him as "the hardest working man in spirituality" and as "Mr. Please, Please, Please Let Me Back Into China!" That he came from Tibet was momentarily lost.
The Dalai Lama has become whoever we want him to be, a cuddly projection of our hopes and dreams. This enthusiasm, though, has not translated into any tangible political benefit for Tibetans. He has been seen on advertisements for Apple computers and SalesForce.com software; significantly, he was not paid for either of these uses of his image. Some of the books that purport to be written by the Dalai Lama are scarcely by him at all, but have his face on the cover to increase sales.
In reality, Tibetan Buddhism is not a values-free system oriented around smiles and a warm heart. It is a religion with tough ethical underpinnings that sometimes get lost in translation. For example, the Dalai Lama explicitly condemns homosexuality, as well as all oral and anal sex. His stand is close to that of Pope John Paul II, something his Western followers find embarrassing and prefer to ignore. His American publisher even asked him to remove the injunctions against homosexuality from his book, "Ethics for the New Millennium," for fear they would offend American readers, and the Dalai Lama acquiesced.
When he is speaking to his own people, the Dalai Lama is very different from the genial figure we see in the West. I remember a public talk he gave at his headquarters in Dharamsala in northern India in 1990, after conflict between Tibetans and Indians there. He spoke in Tibetan, and his delivery was stern and admonitory, like a forbidding, old-fashioned father reprimanding his children. The crowd listened respectfully, and went away chastened.
While the current love-in has been going on in America, the Tibetan government in exile back in Dharamsala has been brawling. The prime minister of the exiles, Samdhong Rinpoche, walked out of the Assembly last week when accusations (later withdrawn) were made regarding corruption in the New York-based Tibet Fund. In the 1980's, Dharamsala was a vibrant intellectual community. Today, it has been killed by kindness: much of the talent has migrated to Europe and America as a result of generous foreign sponsorship programs. The government in exile has to struggle on, aware that its influence is severely limited.
In 1999 I went on a three-month research trip through Tibet and its borderlands. In contrast to my 1986 trip, when I saw only the outward trappings of oppression, it was a devastating experience. The tales of human suffering, particularly from the period after the Communist invasion of 1950, were worse than I had expected. Nor was modern Tibet a reassuring sight: rural poverty and shoddy, improvised Chinese-style cities.
When I came back I resigned from my position at Free Tibet Campaign. After seeing the daily compromises that Tibetans have to make in order to live in a police state, I felt that foreign campaigners were not making their lives any easier. Some Tibetans believe that overseas campaigning makes the Chinese government, with its xenophobic fear of foreign interference, create stricter controls over them.
Relations between Beijing and Dharamsala are now better than they have been for some years because of a visit to China in May by a delegation of Tibetan exiles. But the central fact remains that the Chinese government is unlikely to reach an agreement with the Dalai Lama unless he abandons his main demands: a democratic, demilitarized, enlarged and genuinely autonomous state. They want him to return as a figurehead, with as many exiles as possible, so that they can claim to have solved the Tibetan problem. Given Tibet's desperate current state, his return could by itself create significant progress by giving a voice to Tibetans inside the People's Republic of China.
American enthusiasm for the Dalai Lama is not the same as genuine political support for Tibet. No United States government will place sympathy for Tibetans above America's strategic and economic interests. China is too large a power to be pushed around, and has always been vociferous in its refusal to listen to advice about Tibet. It is hard to see how the People's Liberation Army could be persuaded to leave the Tibetan plateau without regime change in Beijing, which is something that even President Bush might be nervous to contemplate.
Passion for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhism is a great thing, but Americans keen to buy into that image should take care to understand the man and what he stands for, and above all the moral complexity of life for the Tibetans inside Tibet.

HEADLINE: Fed Decided Against Revamping, Minutes Show 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers, accused recently of sending confusing signals to investors, held a special meeting on Monday to discuss ways to improve the way they communicate with both Wall Street and Main Street.
 However, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and the Federal Open Market Committee decided against revamping procedures, at least for now. 
 The Fed policy makers normally issue a statement, generally brief, after each of their eight regularly scheduled meetings to discuss interest rate policy. The statements talk about their interest-rate decisions and usually provide views about the economy's prospects. 
"After a detailed discussion of the issues, the committee elected not to make substantial changes in its current approach to the policy announcement at this time," according to Fed minutes released today.
The minutes described not only Monday's discussion but also details of the debate during the Fed's regular meeting on Aug. 12.
Referring to Monday's meeting, the minutes said: "Although a variety of views was expressed, most members felt that current practices were generally appropriate in providing information to the public about the rationale for the committee's decisions and its views about the risks to future economic performance."
Fed officials let it be known that their communication effort was still being reviewed. The minutes said that Fed policy makers might consider from time to time "changes that might improve the committee's communication of its assessment of the economic situation."
The minutes showed that Fed members, in addressing the recent increase in long-term interest rates, said at the Aug. 12 meeting that while the rise "would have some restraining effect," they did not think it would derail the budding economic recovery.
"A number of factors suggested that the risks from higher interest rates might not be large," the minutes said. "These included the possibility that higher rates in part reflected growing optimism about the economic outlook that would engender a faster pace of business spending, more than offsetting the effects of the higher rates on consumer spending."

HEADLINE: G.M. Plant Will Remain Open Until 2007, Union Says 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
Workers at the General Motors plant in Linden, N.J., which faced a permanent shutdown by 2005, got yet another reprieve that would keep it open into 2007 as a result of a tentative settlement reached yesterday between the company and the United Auto Workers, a union official said. 
 Guy Messina, president of Local 595 of the United Auto Workers, the union that represents workers at the 65-year-old plant, said he had been informed of that portion of the tentative settlement by officials of the international union. 
 Mr. Messina said that the reprieve for the plant, according to national union officials, would last the four-year term of the tentative agreement, which will be voted on by the local's membership next week. 
"This four years gives us time to, first, give our members some peaceof mind," Mr. Messina said. "Secondly, it gives the company time to find a new product for us to build at this plant to keep it open even longer, and we have a gut feeling that something is in the wind." 
Dan Flores, a spokesman for General Motors, would not confirm Mr. Messina's statement and said that the company would have no comment on any aspect of the tentative settlement at this time. As far as he knew, he said, the company's position remained that of closing the Linden plant by 2005. 
But the office of Senator Jon S. Corzine, who last month urged the company to keep the plant open, said that they, too, had heard from union officials and others in Detroit, where the negotiations concluded yesterday morning, that the tentative agreement would keep the Linden plant operating for four more years. 
David Wald, a spokesman for Senator Corzine, said it was "terrific news for New Jersey, where the recession has hit hardest in manufacturing and telecommunications sectors." 
In February 2002, G.M. officials, citing decreased demand for the two- and four-door Chevrolet Blazers and pickup trucks built at the plant, announced that they would shut it by 2004. The announcement came a month after Ford Motor Company announced plans to close its nearby Edison plant and lop off 3,000 jobs. The announcements dealt a body blow to the state's industrial midriff. 
At the G.M. plant, the announcement meant an immediate cutback to one shift from two. This meant the loss of 1,200 of the plant's 3,000 jobs almost immediately. Among the plant's major problems, union and company officials said, was its age and that its per-unit costs were inflated by its distance from many of the Midwestern parts suppliers that the company used. 
But five months later, taking note of an uptick in the demand for the plant's products and amid pleas and promised incentives from the administration of Gov. James E. McGreevey, the company extended the life of the Linden plant one year, to 2005.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE DIRECTORS; 
Calls Grow fora Board With Fewer Ties to Wall St.

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
With a void at the top of the New York Stock Exchange, ideas on how to govern it are popping up from inside and outside. But a recurring theme is that securities industry members should have a much smaller role, if not be eliminated altogether.
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., who runs Goldman Sachs and serves on the exchange's board, is suggesting that brokerage firms like his be dropped altogether from board membership. 
 Among outsiders, several are calling for more board members who have no direct commercial interest in the success of the stock exchange. 
"New independent directors, not associated with the industry and not C.E.O.'s of listed companies, should be a majority," said David S. Ruder, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a professor at the Northwestern University School of Law.
The president of California's state pension plan, the largest fund in the nation, echoed the point, saying that half of a new board should be investors.
"I mean a component that represents the true people who own stocks -- the working people of America who use the capital markets to fund their present, their future retirements and their kids' college education," said Sean Harrigan, president of the pension plan, the California Public Employees Retirement System.
Andrew H. Brooks, head of equity investing at T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, said the latest problems challenge the notion that the exchange is "about investor confidence, serving investors and protecting investors."
H. Carl McCall, the interim chairman of the exchange, said yesterday afternoon that the board committee on corporate governance would make its recommendations to the full board on Oct. 2. He listed a number of issues that would be covered, including compensation, the composition of the board, the involvement of investors, the role of leadership and the disclosure policies of the exchange. 
He said the recommendations would address the timing of a possible proposal for the exchange to sell stock and go public. And he said the committee would consider splitting the job of chairman and chief executive, roles held simultaneously by Richard A. Grasso, who resigned under pressure on Wednesday after criticism of a $140 million pay package.
"From today on, the New York Stock Exchange will be operated differently," Mr. McCall said. But he did not describe what kind of changes would be made, only that many options would be considered.
Mr. McCall added that the "the board is responsible for the actions that have gone on here." Asked if confidence in the exchange could be restored without a major change in board membership, he said, "That is a good question, and that is something the board will have to wrestle with."
There are 27 slots on the board: 12 from the securities industry, 12 who are called public directors and the 3 top executives of the exchange. In fact, most of the directors are from the brokerage industry and from companies that have their shares listed on the exchange.
Mr. Brooks of T. Rowe Price said the suggestion that exchange board members did not know the full extent of Mr. Grasso's compensation "leaves us all shaking our heads."
Scott C. Newquist, president of Board Governance Services Inc., a company that works to improve the relationships between corporate boards and management, said, "That is a little amazing to me."
During the directors' meeting held by phone on Wednesday that resulted in Mr. Grasso's departure, Mr. Paulson brought up his outline for changes in governance of the exchange, according to directors.
In previous conversations with directors, he had broached the idea that after the current board deals with governance changes, the brokerage firm representatives should leave the board. This would reduce what appears to be a significant conflict, since those overseeing the exchange are also subject to its regulation.
Then he said an outside advisory board should be established, including brokerage firm representatives, to make recommendations on market structure and market reform, which will be major issues in the future as competition from electronic trading grows.
Mr. Newquist said that he thought the exchange could retain its regulatory role if all the Wall Street firms were off the board.
Mr. Ruder noted that the exchange recommends that its listed companies have a majority of independent members on their boards. Of course, determining independence can be tricky.
"The voting power should be vested in a group that is independent," he said. "I think that the corporate scandals of the last three or four years have created doubts about the way the economics of our market-based system works; about whether we can trust corporations and the way their stocks are traded. And this furor over Richard Grasso has increased this distrust." 
As for being a regulator, he said the exchange should give up that role. There is an inherent conflict, he said, because the chairman of the exchange "has to worry about regulation and the economic viability of the exchange."

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, incensed by France's demands for greater United Nations oversight in Iraq, is working to isolate France and win a majority at the United Nations Security Council for the American approach, administration officials said today.
 In an echo of a tactic the administration tried earlier this year, without notable success, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is stepping up his efforts to enlist the support of Russia, Germany and other nations for American control over the occupation and transition to self-rule in Iraq, even though many of them sided with France in opposing the war. 
 Last winter, in the face of a threat by France to wield its veto power, the United States tried to line up 9 of the 15 Security Council votes to pass a resolution authorizing the use of force to overthrow Saddam Hussein. American officials said that if they had won the votes, France might have abandoned its veto threat. 
President Bush then maintained that the United States did not need the resolution to go to war. 
The big difference this time is that even French officials say France will not veto a new resolution. 
"Powell is upset about the French, but the fact is they are not in a combative mood on this," a senior European diplomat said. "Behind closed doors, the French are saying they would never dream of vetoing. There is no fighting spirit here." 
Next week, Mr. Bush will press other nations to back the American approach on Iraq when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Powell is to spend the entire week at the United Nations.
The secretary has pointed out repeatedly that all it takes is nine votes to pass a resolution, and that he is sure he has them.
The French-American rift is over a French proposal for the United Nations to supplant the United States as the leading player overseeing Iraq's transition to democracy as well as a more rapid turnover of sovereignty to Iraqis, perhaps in as little as a month. The administration argues that the Iraqis are not ready.
Today, appearing at Camp David with King Abdullah of Jordan, Mr. Bush said he did not expect to have a draft of a proposed resolution on Iraq until next week. Administration officials have circulated a draft that would keep American control over military forces and the transition to self-rule but are they incorporating some suggestions of other nations.
American officials discussing the strategy of trying to isolate France said it reflected mounting concern among administration officials that in their view, virtually every policy adopted by France in recent months has seemed to try to thwart American policies in Iraq and elsewhere.
"There are just a lot of bad feelings toward the French," an administration official said. "Every time they talk about multilateralism, we know that it's nothing more than a euphemism for constraining the United States."
Earlier this year, the administration was surprised when Russia sided with France over the war resolution. Germany's opposition had been well known. The other surprise was the American failure to enlist African and Latin American nations.
After that diplomatic setback, the administration adopted a policy of punishing France in symbolic ways.
In effect, administration officials say, the policy now is to enlist the Germans in negotiating a possible compromise resolution and to offer Russia a chance to take part in Iraq's reconstruction -- as well as get a share of the lucrative contracts to be offered. Mr. Powell has repeatedly praised Russia and Germany for trying to work out a compromise.
A diplomat familiar with administration thinking summarized the American policy as "talk to the Germans, buy off the Russians and isolate the French."
Another was less polite, saying Condoleezza Rice, the White House national security adviser, had characterized the approach as "ignore, reward and punish."
The new administration strategy is unsettling the Germans and the British, European and American officials said. A German official met this week with Ms. Rice and told her that it would be counterproductive to confront France now, an official said.
By all accounts, Germany is trying to be conciliatory, signaling that although it does not want to send troops to Iraq, it is willing to help with reconstruction.
In an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times to be published Friday, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany said there was "no point" in continuing the argument of earlier this year over Iraq, and that Germany would provide relief, economic help for reconstruction and assistance in training Iraqi security forces. But Mr. Schroder, lending some support to the French demands, also said the United Nations had to play "a central role" in Iraq's future. The administration prefers to say it wants the United Nations to play merely a "vital" role, leaving the administration in charge.
In Berlin today, Mr. Schroder met with the French president, Jacques Chirac, in what German officials said was an effort to get Paris to be more conciliatory to Washington. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain is to meet with Mr. Schroder and Mr. Chirac this weekend, also in an effort to avoid a new confrontation over Iraq at the United Nations.
In comments in recent days, Mr. Powell showed increasing exasperation with the French position, especially over what American officials consider a condescending French view that the United States is in love with being an occupying power. He called the French view "nonsense." In private, he was said to have used somewhat stronger language.
The French response, however, is that France does not enjoy being "the bad kid on the block," as one official put it, but that it is simply trying to make the occupation of Iraq more acceptable to Iraqis and to other nations, which are being asked to supply troops and aid.
"We are not demanding," said a French official. "We are advising. We aren't saying that the United States has to give all the keys to all the ministries to Iraqis tomorrow. But you have to send a political signal that Iraqis represent the sovereignty of their country."
French officials say it almost does not matter whether a resolution passes that suits the Americans or the French. What matters, they say, is whether the resolution leads to greater aid, security and legitimacy for the Iraqi government. This will be decided not at the United Nations, but by the world at large, they say.
But American officials are not in a compromising mood. They assert that if the Iraqis take over too quickly, the beneficiaries will be the former exiles, a group that has the least support among Iraqis.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE NEXT PHASE; 
2 U.S. Fronts: Quick Wars, but Bloody Peace

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN and DEXTER FILKINS; Amy Waldman reported from Gardez, Afghanistan, and Dexter Filkins reported from Ramadi, Iraq. 

 BODY:
The United States' military base in Gardez, Afghanistan -- its perimeter marked by a small woodshed with the words Crack House painted over but still visible -- straddles the smooth asphalt main road that leads southeast. 
 For the Americans, blocking the road helps create a "safe" radius around their base. For Afghans, however, it creates an inconvenient detour. When the main road is rejoined, it soon offers up the "customs inspectors" of a renegade Afghan commander taxing all new cars that pass. The Americans do nothing about this, local residents say. 
 Two years after the Bush administration vowed to fight terrorism worldwide, the American presence in the heavily Pashtun area of southern Afghanistan has mostly come down to this: two obstacles on the road, one imposed by the Americans, the other ignored by them, and neither, as Afghans see it, benefiting their country. 
Not for a long time has the United States embarked on two such ambitious projects as the simultaneous pacification and rebuilding of Afghanistan and Iraq. The administration argues that progress has been significant in both countries -- the removal of the Taliban and its ally Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the overthrow of the Baathists in Iraq, the liberation of millions of people in each country from oppressive governments, the taking of the fight to terrorists on the soil where they found havens.
But even American officials in Afghanistan concede that the sense of alienation and disappointment may be helping to nourish the boldest regrouping yet by supporters of the Taliban, the regime the United States toppled in 2001. The Gardez base has been attacked twice this month; in the area, bands of Taliban are roaming, harassing local men who do not grow beards.
In Iraq, there are daily attacks on American soldiers, including one that killed three yesterday, and they may not be just the work of foreign fighters or Saddam Hussein loyalists. Defense Department officials warned this week that ordinary Iraqis increasingly hostile to the American occupation might soon constitute the most formidable foe.
In both countries, an apparently rapid military victory has been followed by a murkier, bloodier peace. Militant Islamic extremism,in its Afghan and Iraqi guises, is proving, for now, to be an ideology that can be contained but not defeated.
The Bush administration is now struggling to respond. Aid to Afghanistan is being doubled, and the cost of the occupation of both countries over the next year is now put at $87 billion. In neither country does any exit for American troops appear feasible in the foreseeable future. 
This month, President Bush vowed to stay the course. Noting that "America has done this kind of work before" in Germany and Japan after World War II, he made clear that the United States would not cut and run.
It took four years to hold the first elections in Germany after the war ended in 1945, and 54 years to win the wider struggle against Communism engaged there.
"Now and in the future," Mr. Bush said in his nationally televised address before the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, "we will support our troops and we will keep our word to the more than 50 million people of Afghanistan and Iraq." 
Keeping that word will be expensive and arduous, but administration officials see an even wider objective: the engagement of a struggle to remake the Middle East as a region of possibility and democracy rather than a place where frustrations seethe under authoritarian governments, breeding anti-American violence. 
But such broad ambitions seem far from America's reach for now. In both countries, militants are mounting attacks on Americans and American-backed locals in the tried and tested guerrilla style.
They are staging nighttime attacks on police posts and hit-and-run assaults on American convoys. The guerrillas are killing international and local aid workers, chasing away the very people trying to rebuild their shattered countries.
"We're easy targets," said Staff Sgt. Paul Anderson, who is part of a team the Americans have fielded in southeast Afghanistan in a bid to win hearts and minds. "If they really want to get us they can."

Central Iraq
American Occupation, Guerrilla Resistance
Americans in both countries have already learned one lesson: good intentions are not always rewarded. This is clear in the perilous Ramadi-Falluja region of central Iraq, some 70 miles west of Baghdad. 
Early in September, a five-ton American truck was blown off the road by a homemade bomb, probably set off by an Iraqi soldier hiding in the tall grass. An American soldier lay in the road, his clothing in bloody shreds. 
As an American troop carrier lifted the ruined vehicle from the roadside, the Iraqis who had gathered nearby cheered. Farmers and shopkeepers, parents with children, all of them threw their arms into the air as the troop carrier rumbled past. 
"Death to America!" the Iraqis cried, some holding up the bloody shreds of an American uniform. "God is great! The American Army will collapse here in Iraq!" 
Remote-controlled bombs explode regularly next to American troops. The American camp in Ramadi is bombarded almost nightly by mortars and artillery. In four months, 19 American solders have been killed and more than 100 wounded.
"One day after another, it's bang, boom, pow," said Specialist Ferdinand Frizarry, walking in a foot patrol along River Road, where American soldiers have been ambushed by remote-controlled bombs repeatedly in recent days. Bomb craters lined a two-mile stretch of road. "You could hide a bomb anywhere in there," he said. 
The precise source of these anti-American attacks remains unclear. But officials say there is growing evidence that the country is now seen as the epicenter of a struggle between the West and Islam. Fundamentalist Islamic warriors, or jihadists, are being drawn to the country, fighting alongside or perhaps in conjunction with loyalists of the fallen government of Saddam Hussein. 
Responding to the violence, the Bush administration has returned to the United Nations -- a body spurned in the buildup to the war in Iraq -- to try to secure a mandate that would encourage other countries to send troops to help in the battles and tasks that lie ahead. It also seeking to speed up the transfer of security duties and political responsibility to Iraqis.
Ramadi probably amounts to the worst that Iraq can offer. To the south, the country's Shiite Muslim majority remains relatively tolerant of their American occupiers, while in the north, the Kurds are the Americans' most stalwart supporters. 
But if most of Iraq is proving largely amenable to the occupation, the guerrilla war being waged in the central part of the country serves as a measure of how far the American project in Iraq must go before its architects can claim success. 
In Afghanistan, too, success still seems elusive. Striking differences exist between the countries, not least the larger scale of the resistance in Iraq. In Afghanistan an international coalition forged before the war has held, with countries like Germany and Canada still sending troops, while in Iraq the Americans are laboring largely alone.
In Afghanistan, an American-backed administration, led by President Hamid Karzai, has been in office for more than 18 months. Iraqis are still governed mainly by an American civilian administrator, L. Paul Bremer III. 
But a hardening of attitudes often seems evident in both countries. After the bombing of the truck in the Ramadi area in Iraq, an American tank dispatched to the scene sprayed a field of tall grass with heavy machine gunfire, killing no one, for there was no one there to kill. 
Even the jokes have turned. In the American military headquarters in Gardez, a soldier scrawled out the word "FUN" vertically on a blackboard, then wrote out sentences to follow each letter: F is for the fire that burns through downtown; U is Uranium bombs; and N is for No Survivors in Al Ramadi. 
"I know they hate my guts, but they can't say so because I've got a gun," an American soldier said the other night, standing guard outside the base. "Kind of funny, isn't it?"

Afghanistan
Faltering Progress, Security Fears
Much as 30 years of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party rule altered the culture and social structures of Iraq, 23 years of war had the same effect in Afghanistan.
Everything was destroyed, from schools to roads to hospitals to the most basic of government services, whether tax collection or policing. Thousands of warlords were empowered and cannot now be dislodged. Factionalism colors everything.
Most of Afghanistan's citizens are now illiterate. The country's human capacity is "beyond words," said Khwaja Sultan, who heads a consulting team working on economic management. "Very, very low."
Most Afghans live miles from even minimal health care, and many parts of the country lack phones, electricity, drinking water and decent roads. Children support families by herding goats or filling in potholes in the road. Old men do harsh physical labor until they drop. Women bear children until they die, often by age 43.
Afghanistan's mountainous geography is much more challenging than that of Iraq. The four northern provinces that Germany is proposing to cover with a provincial reconstruction team of 300 to 400 soldiers are equivalent to 20 percent ofGerman territory.
The United States, too, came to Afghanistan with what is referred to as a "light footprint." The mission was to capture or kill Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. So while the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan are roughly equivalent, America has 127,000 troops in Iraq, and 9,800 in Afghanistan.
That smaller Afghan force is now stretched. The signs that the Taliban may be resurgent in the Pashtun south are multiplying -- in the form of attacks on pro-government Afghans and spreading disaffection.
So, two years after the war, America is not scaling back its effort but ramping up.
It is encouraging the possible expansion outside of Kabul of an international peacekeeping force now under NATO's command; investing more in building a national army and police force; and having some soldiers work as they have in Iraq, fixing wells, setting up mobile clinics, settling disputes and otherwise trying to imprint this notion on Afghan minds: America does good.
The needs in one of the world's poorest countries are arguably far greater than in Iraq. If Iraq suffered from an excess of the state, one that spied on all its citizens, Afghanistan has suffered from the lack of one.
"This is a country that has not thought about its own development for 25 years," said Filippo Grandi, the chief of mission for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
America is now thinking about that development but facing an increasingly sullen population. Afghans had expected that America, the world's superpower, which had announced its intentions to bring peace and reconstruction to Afghanistan, would act quickly and effectively.
Instead, as of May, according to a study by the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, only $191 million in reconstruction projects had been completed. A critical artery of the country -- the Kabul-Kandahar road -- is still far from complete, a potholed mess in many sections.
This faltering progress has prompted some Afghans to say that the Americans have already lost the battle for the Pashtun south, which gave rise to the Taliban and does not feel represented in the postwar government.
"We are scared, because they started rebuilding very late," said one Afghan security official from the southeast. "Most people will say the Americans aren't doing anything." 
At the same time, Americans have generated anger by searching homes and wrongly arresting people, said Hajji Azrat Khan, an elder of the Ahmadzai tribe who lives not far from the American base in Gardez. This problem -- offended local sensibilities -- also exists in Iraq.
"They take someone to Bagram" -- the American base near Kabul -- "for two or three months, then release them and say, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry,' " he said , as if testing the words before spitting them out.
The task of reversing this kind of sentiment quickly has fallen to a Provincial Reconstruction Team, essentially a civil affairs unit of about 60 American soldiers whose focus is less on capturing terrorists than on winning public support.
While aiding the military mission by gathering intelligence as they work, they have focused on reconstruction. In Gardez, the team has 29 projects under way, most involving the building or fixing of schools.
They have had at least some effect. One Ahmadzai elder, Abdul Hanam, said the Americans had built three schools in his district, Ahmadabad, including a girls' school to be opened soon, and conducted mobile clinics. "People are very happy with the Americans," he said.
Paktia Province's new governor, AsadullahWafa, said the Provincial Reconstruction Team was now doing much of the rebuilding in his province, as nongovernment groups have pulled back because of security fears.
Critics note that even school-building can be more about symbolism than substance. Barnett R. Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University, said Afghanistan had a $600 million deficit in its recurrent expenditures trust fund, used for, among other things, government salaries. 
"What is the point of building schools," he asked, "when there is no money for teachers?". 
The American soldiers' role, they said, comes down to this: to fire back when someone fires at them, and to serve as de facto bodyguards for the reconstruction team. 
This, they said, was a job better done by the military police, who are heavily deployed in Iraq, but absent in Afghanistan. 
As they waited, they talked about recent American casualties in Shkin, near the Pakistani border: two killed, one wounded.
They knew it could be them. With almost no direct contact with the population, they tried to read faces, and they did not like what they saw. "The children like us," one 10th Mountain Division soldier said. "That's pretty much it."

Rebuilding
Repairing Dams, Winning Few Friends
In Ramadi, too, Americans' efforts to rebuild are taking them deep into the mundane details of engineering and public administration.
Lt. Christopher Rauch, a 24-year-old Army civil affairs officer, spent a day last week inspecting the half dozen dams standing inside the Euphrates River. Over the past several weeks, Lieutenant Rauch has spent tens of thousands of dollars to repair the dams, some of which are a half-century old.
Only six months ago, he was working as a clerk for the State of South Carolina, processing applications for unemployment insurance. But he was an army reservist, too, a college graduate with a degree in agriculture, and suddenly he found himself presiding over engineering projects about which he had received no formal training. 
"I'm not an engineer," said Lieutenant Rauch. "But I understand pretty well how things work." Over time, he said, he has developed a close rapport with his Iraqi counterpart, Hussein Alawi, the minister for dams for Al Anbar Province, which stretches west of Baghdad to the Syrian border.
Through an Arabic translator, Lieutenant Rauch listened intently and offered advice. Mr. Alawi proclaimed him an expert. "When it comes to engineering, the Americans know what they are doing," Mr. Alawi said. But beyond that Mr. Alawi would not go.
Asked about the Americans and their occupation, Mr. Alawi shook his head. "I am cooperating with the Americans for the sake of my country," Mr. Alwai said. "It's the nature of the Iraqi people to be proud and nationalistic, more than most people. We want to evict them." 
American commanders still express confidence in the institutions they are helping to build in Iraq, including local councils, police and fire departments and highway patrols. In some parts of the country, these efforts are beginning to yield results.
In Ramadi, though, it is less clear that these American-inspired institutions are working, or even that the beneficiaries of the new government endorse them.
One day last week, a group of new officers from the Iraqi Highway Patrol lounged beneath a highway overpass. Asked about the Americans, they responded with scorn.
"I hate the Americans," said Muhammad Khobaeir Waeel, a new officer. "They don't respect us. They throw us to the ground and put their boots on the backs of our heads."
With such friends, America may scarcely need enemies as it tries to govern two countries that are very different from post-1945 Germany and Japan. Those who work with the Americans do so at risk.
In Gardez, one Afghan interpreter for the military said that when he went on raids, he wore a hood over his head so no one could identify him. He had heard that interpreters working with the Americans had a bounty on their head. "People blame us for giving the Americans information," he said.
Getting accurate information has been perhaps the greatest challenge for the Americans in places like Paktia Province in the southeast. Local tribal leaders and government officials sketch a picture of an American military trying to follow trails in the sand on a windy day.
Perhaps that is not a bad image for the current state of the American efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Masood Karokhail, a program officer for the Gardez area for the aid group Swisspeace, said American soldiers had sometimes become pawns in feuds dating back generations, with scores settled by passing often false information to the Americans.
One American Special Operations soldier at the local base insisted that intelligence was solid, and mistakes few. "Our house searches are always based on good information," he said. 
But an Afghan security official, a Pashtun and supporter of the American presence, was blunt in his assessment of American actions. "Unfortunately they don't have faithful Afghan friends," he said. "That is very dangerous for them."

HEADLINE: G.M. Accord Finishes Talks For U.A.W. 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jacqueline Marino contributed to this report. 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union concluded its contract negotiations with the Big Three and two major suppliers today after granting its most significant concessions in two decades.
 The deals, which will result in thousands of job cuts as roughly a dozen plants are closed or sold, reflect the broad competitive struggles of domestic manufacturers, and the union's effort to balance the desires of its members with the shrinking market share and profits of the automakers. 
 This morning, the U.A.W. announced it had reached deals with General Motors and Delphi, the world's largest auto parts company, which G.M. spun off in 1999.
The agreements came three days after the U.A.W. reached tentative agreements with the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, as well as with Visteon, the parts subsidiary spun off by Ford in 2000.
"Since the start of these negotiations, one of our goals has been to bring this industry together," said Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W. president, at a news conference this morning. 
Rick Wagoner, the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said the agreement "will enable us to work together effectively to address what is pretty clearly a challenging set of competitors."
The factories to be closed include Chrysler parts plants in Detroit and Indianapolis, and Ford assembly plants in Edison, N.J.; Dearborn, Mich.; and two in the Cleveland area. Reuters also reported today that G.M. would close a plant in Baltimore that makes midsize vans.
For the companies' workers, the annual increases in wages and pension benefits will be scaled back. But their health care benefits will remain largely intact, save for modest increases in co-payments for brand-name prescription drugs for active workers and for future, but not current, retirees.
Among concessions granted to the U.A.W. by DaimlerChrysler was an agreement that permits the union to hold a card check at a Mercedes plant in Vance, Ala. In a card check, workers sign cards designating that they want to belong to the union, rather than vote in more formal balloting at their factory.
In the past, Mercedes had resisted union efforts to organize the factory. The union has never organized a plant solely owned by a foreign automaker, but it has leverage over Mercedes because DaimlerChrysler owns it as well as Chrysler.
The talks were wrapped up with unprecedented speed, just four days after contracts covering more than 700,000 autoworkers and retirees expired.
"In the last five days, we have successfully concluded negotiations with five of the largest manufacturers in the world," Mr. Gettelfinger said this morning. "That's five for five."
With both sides remarking on the professionalism of the other, the tenor of the negotiations reflected the difficult competitive realities that have domestic manufacturers and their labor unions fighting for survival against tough rivals.
The generous terms of the last contracts were set in 1999, when the Big Three were riding high on profits generated by their domination of the market for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
As the talks were reaching a climax, industry sales figures for August showed Toyota had passed Chrysler in monthly sales for the first time, while the Big Three companies' market share slipped to just 57.9 percent, a record low. And imports are making inroads in full-size S.U.V.'s and pickups.
"You sort of have the Big Four -- G.M., Ford, Chrysler and the U.A.W. -- and they're all sinking," said James P. Womack, an industry analyst and the co-author of "The Machine That Changed The World," among the first books to warn of foreign companies' threat to Detroit. "Therefore, they discover they've got more in common than not.
"It's a sort of sober realization that the future isn't like the past," he added. But he questioned how much the deal would help the Big Three and the suppliers.
"If you look at the total magnitude of problems and the total short-term benefit, you have to ask if there's really a match," he said.
Among the most surprising developments this week was Ford's decision to keep open a plant in Hazelwood, Mo., in the St. Louis area, that it had said must close as part of its corporate turnaround plan.
Instead, it will close the plant in Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland, which is smaller. Ford will also keep its assembly plant in the Atlanta area open, people close to the contract negotiations said.
"All those candles we lit must have made the difference," said Patrick McKeehan, project director of a task force assembled by the city of Hazelwood to save the plant, which produces the Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer S.U.V.'s. 
In Lorain, workers heard the news in media reports today that their assembly plant, which produces 15-passenger vans for Ford, would be closed. "You read in the paper that we have a contract," said Chuck Clark, 52, a 30-year veteran at the plant. "Now we hear we're going to lose the plant. Its shocking.
"I'd hate to see it go," he added. "It's all Lorain has." When plants are closed, union members are generally offered transfers, given generous buyouts, and have their benefits protected.
Workers will see small increases in their wages and pension benefits. Instead of annual increases of 3 percent, on top of cost-of-living adjustments, workers will receive lump sums in the first two years, a 2 percent raise in the third year and a 3 percent raise in the fourth.
Lump-sum payments are attractive to automakers because percentage increases inflate the base salary, which is used to calculate overtime, pension payments and future wages. 
The complex formula that determines cost-of-living adjustments will also be changed to reduce payments. And rules regarding absenteeism will be toughened.
New workers at Delphi and Visteon will receive lower wages than current employees, more in line with other suppliers. But the details of lowering those wages will be negotiated over three months after the deals are ratified.
Details of the agreements with each company will not be officially released until the deals are ratified by the workers.
The union fell short in its attempt to settle all the contracts at once by the expiration of the previous pacts on Sunday night. Even so, never in recent memory have the unions and the companies wrapped up all their negotiations so early or so closely grouped together. Traditionally, the U.A.W. picks a lead company to shape an agreement, then follows up with the others after the first pact is approved by members.
The three-way deal appeared largely set Sunday evening, but last-minute complications arose.
Mr. Gettelfinger was pushing G.M. to guarantee more business to Delphi, the world's biggest parts supplier, according to someone close to the discussions. That conflicted with the determination of J. T. Battenberg, Delphi's chief executive and a longtime industry executive. While Delphi would welcome the business, the company did not want to continue paying newly hired workers wages comparable to those paid by its old parent, G.M. Suppliers typically pay far lower wages. Delphi did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Since taking charge at Delphi in 1992, when it was still part of G.M., Mr. Battenberg has closed struggling plants and shifted production to Mexico and, lately, to China. Last year, he said, only 30 percent of Delphi's parts were made by U.A.W. members. 
For a union that traditionally prides itself on rarely giving back any gains, the concessions were notable, industry experts said. They were the most significant since a deep industry recession and a near-bankruptcy at Chrysler prompted the U.A.W. to reopen contracts at G.M. and Ford in 1982.

HEADLINE: China Insistent on Bolstering Currency 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 18 

 BODY:
The head of China's central bank tonight defended his country's determination to hold its currency at the current level against the dollar and to maintain controls on large flows of money across China's borders.
 When the United States Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, visited Beijing two weeks ago, Chinese officials sought to allay American concerns that China's currency might be undervalued -- giving its exports a competitive advantage -- and promised a series of limited measures. But these officials carefully avoided setting any timetable for fundamental changes to the management of China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, or to the system for controlling capital flows. 
 In his first broad policy address since then, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, spelled out here a series of reasons why Chinese officials do not agree with the criticisms that the Bush administration and Western economists have raised. 
Mr. Zhou was very diplomatic in his remarks, never mentioning the United States or American officials at all and volunteering several times that he was simply providing information and not expressing personal opinions. Nonetheless, he made clear his leeriness of any sharp policy shifts.
"There is no strong reason to have any kind of sudden changes," Mr. Zhou said, while quickly adding that in the long term, "we're always going forward, making new changes."
China's central bank has kept the yuan pegged at 8.28 to the dollar by printing hundreds of billions of yuan to buy the tens of billions of dollars a year now flowing into the country each year. The central bank has tried to control the potential inflationary effects of this expansion of the money supply by borrowing back much of the extra yuan, but this policy has become less and less effective.
Chinese banks, awash with funds, lent more in the first seven months of this year than in all of last year, triggering a frenzy of investment and speculation, especially in real estate projects in big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority was the host of tonight's speech, and the authority's chief executive, Joseph Yam, turned to Mr. Zhou after his speech this evening and, with uncharacteristic bluntness to a top central banker speaking in public, told him, "It looks as if you're running out of options."
Mr. Zhou denied this, saying that the central bank could still stabilize the domestic economy and money supply through administrative methods, like discouraging banks from lending to speculative projects, and by requiring domestic banks to deposit more of their assets with the central bank instead of lending them out. "I am really confident that there is not a serious problem for stabilization," he said.
The International Monetary Fund warned recently that countries holding extremely large reserves of foreign currencies could be forgoing some extra economic growth that the money could promote were it productively invested at home. But Mr. Zhou defended his country's fast-growing reserves, which hit $346.5 billion in June.
Measured in terms of foreign exchange reserves per inhabitant, China, with its enormous population, ranks between Indonesia and Thailand, he pointed out. And if China wants to be cautious and have reserves equal to six months of imports, plus half of its external debt, plus three years of dividends on foreign direct investments then it would need $370 billion in foreign exchange reserves, Mr. Zhou said. 
Generally, however, countries set one of these measurements as a goal, rather than add all three together.
Far from favoring any relaxation of capital controls, Mr. Zhou expressed irritation several times at recent signs that speculators, especially Chinese companies and citizens who used to send money secretly out of the country, are now bringing foreign currency back into the country and converting it into yuan in the hope of a quick profit if the central bank allows the currency to appreciate.
"We will be very cautious in the capital account to observe and to check any short-term capital inflow," he said, noting that China encouraged long-term foreign direct investment while liberalizing its rules for certain kinds of capital outflows.
Mr. Zhou also questioned whether China's modestsurplus in overall trade would endure.
China's soaring surplus with the United States has produced anger in manufacturing states, where cheap Chinese goods have been blamed for job losses. But China also runs deficits with Persian Gulf countries, from which it buys growing quantities of oil, and with some Asian neighbors, from whom it buys machinery and sophisticated components that Chinese exporters cannot produce for themselves.
Credit rating agencies have somewhat varied views regarding the hazards of currency appreciation and a removal of capital controls. Standard & Poor's essentially agreed on Monday with Beijing's position, saying that a revaluation of the yuan or a partial lifting of capital controls could harm China's credit rating. Moody's and Fitch Ratings are a little less concerned, taking the position that an appreciation of the yuan would not necessarily hurt China's credit rating by itself, and that while a sudden lifting of capital controls might be more risky, China is unlikely to do this.
Appearing on tonight's panel with Mr. Zhou and Mr. Yam was E. Gerald Corrigan, the former president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who is now a managing director at Goldman, Sachs. Mr. Corrigan backed Mr. Zhou's positions on practically every point, saying that China faced such serious problems that it was understandable that Chinese officials would want to control capital flows and retain very large foreign currency reserves.
China's dependence on rapid economic growth to maintain political and social stability, coupled with a fragile banking system laboring under an extremely heavy burden of nonperforming loans, means that any change should be gradual, Mr. Corrigan said. Citing his experience since the 1970's with other countries undergoing significant economic transitions, Mr. Corrigan added that, "A pell-mell rush to open the capital account and float the currency can be a recipe for financial instability on a large scale."

HEADLINE: Rethinking Health Care as a Haven for Investors 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom has it that health care is a defensive investment. When the overall economy weakens, people still take their medicine and go to the hospital for surgery, so investors tend to favor the stocks of drug companies and hospital chains. But several mutual fund managers say the experience of the last economic downturn has made them question their previous assumptions.
 The most recent information from Medicare -- showing that billings from hospitals dropped nearly 4 percent in August compared with the year earlier -- is adding to investors' concerns that hospitals' volumes, and therefore revenues, are not impervious to the ebbs and flows of the economy. 
 While Medicare billings are not an exact predictor of hospital use, some analysts and investors consider them a good way of measuring hospital volume. Kris H. Jenner, a doctor who manages the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund, said he had watched the weak demand for hospital visits, outpatient procedures, prescription drugs and items like glucose monitors, and had concluded that the conventional wisdom might not be right.
"It's clear to me that several of these trends are connected to changes in the economy," Dr. Jenner said. While he still says that health care is more immune than other industries to economic cycles, he thinks evidence is emerging that a softer economy can lead to softer demand for some health care services.
Other money managers and analysts agree, saying the increased link to the economy could be a result of consumers' having to shoulder more of the costs of their own health care in the form of increased co-payments and deductibles.
"There are more questions about consumers driving health care, at the margins," said Linda Miller, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds.
Some health economists scoff at the idea, saying the relatively steady increase in health care costs demonstrates the independence of the sector from the overall economy. "It really looks to me like more of the same," said Mark Pauly, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, who said there was not enough evidence to conclude otherwise.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, also dismissed the notion that health care has become sensitive to economic cycles. "It's clearly not true," he said. There may have been fewer people using hospitals because there were fewer cases of flu or for other reasons, he said. And he said that prescription volumes were returning to more normal levels from the 1990's, when they were helped by greater insurance coverage for drugs.
Mr. Reinhardt also argued that expectations for the sector had been overblown in recent years, with some investors counting on double-digit growth. "You're in an industry that is mature," he said, although he added that it continued to grow faster than the overall economy.
No one factor explains the performance of drug or hospital stocks, which are affected by investors' concern over such things as government regulation, heightened competition or the dearth of new products. But some portfolio managers say there has been a shift in degree, if not in kind, as to how immune these stocks are to the overall economic cycle, with certain areas of health care appearing to react more to the ups and downs of the economy than they have in the past.
"It had been black and white," said Jordan Schreiber, who manages the Merrill Lynch Healthcare Fund. "Now it's shades of gray."
Portfolio managers like Mr. Schreiber are more careful, for example, about which hospital stocks they own. Many are favoring companies that focus on hospitals in rural areas -- hospitals that face less competition and seem poised for growth.
Mr. Schreiber owns shares of Triad Hospitals, for example, a chain based in Plano, Tex. Triad is among the hospitals that could benefit from the increases in Medicare payments being discussed in Congress as part of the overall bill authorizing a prescription drug benefit.
And while Mr. Schreiber is increasingly wary of the impact of the economy on his holdings, he still views these stocks as ones that offer some level of protection if the economy heads south. As pessimistic as he is about the prospects of some drug makers, for example, he says they may look good relative to other companies hit harder by a slumping economy. Among the drug company stocks he now owns are Roche and Wyeth.
"I may be more defensive looking down the road," he said.
Over all, drug companies have already suffered more than some people expected. Prescription volumes in the United States have been softer than anticipated since 2001, according to Richard T. Evans, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, who said the weak economy appeared to be contributing to the weak volumes, particularly for drugs that treat chronic diseases that are not immediately life-threatening like those taken to lower cholesterol.
Some companies seem to be better positioned than others to withstand an economic downturn, Mr. Evans said. Companies that rely heavily on sales of drugs that focus on long-term prevention of what Mr. Evans describes as silent diseases like high cholesterol are more likely to feel a drop in demand than companies that make a drug like Zyprexa, the Eli Lilly medicine for schizophrenia and acute bipolar mania, which is necessary for people to function, he said. "Your product mix matters," Mr. Evans said.
A result is that drug stocks are no longer treated the same way by investors who once viewed them as a haven when times get tough. "The stocks don't trade defensively any more," Mr. Evans said.
Mr. Evans says investors should now focus on the merits of individual companies because what drives earnings varies so much from company to company.
Analysts and portfolio managers say they are looking for drug companies that offer patients the most value, like new life-saving treatments, and many managers are turning to biotechnology companies. Ms. Miller of John Hancock also said generic drugs offered economic value. Ms. Miller owns shares in several generic drug companies, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Mylan Laboratories, Watson Pharmaceuticals and Barr Laboratories.
"Those stocks have done very, very well," she said.
But investors should be careful not to generalize too much about how consumers are likely to behave, Ms. Miller added. She had assumed, for example, that a weak economy would have an effect on procedures and drugs associated with cosmetic surgery, like Botox. But Botox sales have been strong, she said.
"The consumer is not so simplistic," said Ms. Miller, who owns shares in Allergan, which makes Botox.
But she says she is investing less than before in hospital stocks at the moment, noting that few people really want to be in the hospital.

HEADLINE: CURRENCIES; 
U.S. to Ask Group of 7 to Shift Its Policy on Exchange Rates

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said yesterday that he would ask the Group of 7 industrialized nations to change its policy for the first time in more than six years and back "flexible" currency exchange rates.
 Mr. Snow will use six hours of talks on the global economy this weekend in Dubai to seek support for his campaign against governments that manipulate the value of their currencies to bolster growth, like China and Japan. The United States wants the idea that markets should determine exchange rates mentioned in the group's post-meeting statement. 
 "The world trading system works best under a regime of market-based exchange rates," Mr. Snow told reporters as he left Pakistan for the United Arab Emirates. "It would be useful if the communique expressed support for flexible exchange rates."
While Mr. Snow said he was not asking the ministers to "single out" specific nations for criticism, analysts said his sights were focused on China's eight-year-old currency peg to the dollar and Japan's recent record sales of yen.
Mr. Snow's remarks echoed comments made yesterday by a Group of 7 official from Europe, who said the organization might call on countries to let the market set foreign-exchange rates. Those comments helped push the yen to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years.
In New York, the dollar settled at 114.29 yen, down from 115.34 on Thursday. The euro also gained, trading at $1.1368, up from $1.1242.
The current version of the group's statement says market forces should set foreign-exchange levels, said the official.
"In the context of exchange rates, we will strengthen the dialogue with other major economic areas to promote a smooth adjustment of international imbalances, based on market mechanisms," the draft statement reads, according to the official.
The Group of 7, whose finance ministers typically gather four times a year, is made up of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Any mention of "flexible" exchange rates in their statement would be a policy change.
The group's collective view on currencies was adopted in 1997, when the ministers declared a "major misalignment" in foreign exchange markets had ended and that "excess volatility is undesirable," signaling that the industrial nations did not want the dollar to rise further.
At that meeting, they adopted a stock phrase about the need to monitor exchange rate movements closely and "cooperate as appropriate." That language was used until the ministers' last meeting in May, when the statement did not mention currencies.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Jobless Rate Hits a 6-Year High 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
Mexico's base unemployment rate rose more than expected in August, according to government figures released today, hitting a six-year high as a manufacturing slump held back economic growth.
 The National Statistics Institute said the base jobless rate rose to 3.96 percent in August, up from the five-year high of 3.52 percent recorded in July. 
 The August figure was the highest since July 1997 when the rate was 4.09 percent.
Economic growth has been dragged down by weak manufacturing that has resulted from poor demand in the United States, though a leading business group said today that it saw signs of hope for Mexico's recovery.
Maquiladoras, which are factories making low-price goods for export to the United States, have been badly hurt as buyers in the United States have looked to China for cheaper products.
Industry leaders say 250,000 people have lost jobs with theclosing of more than 340 maquiladora companies in the last two years.
"The maquiladora industry has touched bottom," said Daniel Romero, head of an exporters' association, in Monterrey.

HEADLINE: Clark Explains Statement on Authorization for Iraq War 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
On the third day of his campaign, Gen. Wesley K. Clark struggled today to clarify his statement on Thursday that he would "probably" have voted for the Congressional resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq. 
 General Clark, a former NATO commander who has retired from the Army, never denied making the statement in an interview with four reporters on his chartered plane. But he seemed stunned by the headlines that it generated, as supporters worried that he had undercut his position as an antiwar candidate with military bona fides. 
 "I never would have voted for war," he said here this afternoon in an interview and in response to a question after a lecture at the University of Iowa. "What I would have voted for is leverage. Leverage for the United States to avoid a war. That's what we needed to avoid a war."
Speaking about the resolution on Thursday, General Clark said, "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question."
He then added: "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways, because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position. On balance, I probably would have voted for it."
His clarification, along with a slapped-together schedule in which he met few voters and offered no specifics on domestic issues, seemed to reflect the inexperience of the first-time candidate and disorganization in his nascent campaign. 
His debut day in Iowa, whose early caucus is crucial to the Democratic Party's nomination process, was barely a toe touch, with a brief diner stop and a pageant of 10-minute news media interviews crammed between private receptions surrounding the long-scheduled nonpolitical lecture, for which a foundation paid $25,000. General Clark receives 80 percent.
Despite his disappointment with reports of his airborne interview, including one in The New York Times, General Clark seemed as comfortable as could be in his new role as candidate, stopping frequently to slapshoulders as he strode across the university campus. 
Although he considered a presidential race for a month, he balked at most questions, saying he would spend this weekend at home in Little Rock, Ark., working on policy positions. Among the issues he told voters he was not ready to discuss in detail were health care, education, employment, AIDS in Africa, the USA Patriot Act and medical marijuana. In interviews this afternoon, he referred to a talking-point tip sheet on the hot local issues of ethanol and farm subsidies.
"I don't know enough to give you a comprehensive answer at this point," he said in response to a voter's question about universal health insurance. "I know enough not to give you a comprehensive answer at this point." 
Regarding a complicated proposal about financing AIDS research and prevention abroad, he said, "I'm not committing anything right now to anything, until I've got my economic facts and figures in order."
What he did say, over and over, was how happy he was to be in Iowa. He exulted over the egg white omelette a waitress put in front of him. "Now this is an Iowa breakfast!" the candidate said. 
He also complimented a woman's overalls, saying, "That's a real Iowa outfit!"
He also said, "Some of my best friends from the military are from Iowa."
"I've been dying to get back to Iowa," General Clark said in the Hamburg Inn, which was packed with 50 supporters, many carrying "Draft Clark" placards edited to say "Elect Clark." "I want to learn this state and meet the people here, because I think you're the very heart of America."
With his competitors counting down the 122 days until the Jan. 19 caucuses here, General Clark has a long chase in the Iowa ground game.
He has missed the summer trifecta of local Democratic politics: visiting the butter cow at the Iowa State Fair, marching in the Labor Day Parade in Des Moines and appearing at Senator Tom Harkin's annual steak fry in a balloon field. 
Former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont has visited 79 of the 99 counties since he started campaigning in the state in February 2002. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri has virtually been a regular presence since 1988, when he won the Iowa caucuses in his first campaign for the White House. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts has 12 field offices adorned with endorsements from 18 state legislators and 71 labor leaders.
Today was barely an Iowa introduction, with nary a town hall meeting or a house party. 
"He didn't say very much," said Hyman Joseph, who bore his bias on his shirt in the form of a Dean button. "Any of the other candidates would have taken 10 or 15 minutes of questions. Some people who are for Dean will give him a look. But I don't know how long that look will be."
Robert Bork and Sally Mills, art historians who live in Iowa City, said they signed up with General Clark last week because he has the right combination of characteristics -- "progressive and macho," Mr. Bork, 36, said -- to beat President Bush.
"We were looking for a candidate who could stand out of the pack," Ms. Mills, 47, said. 
"We think highly of Dean," Mr. Bork said. "We think highly of Kerry. We don't think they can bring the pain to Bush."
Late starting or not, General Clark showed a natural knack for retail politics, holding long onto each shaken hand, complete with elbow grab, as he listened to concerns. The main event was a 45-minute lecture, sponsored by the law school.
He won several standing ovations and earned easy laughter for his quips about adjusting to retirement after having at his disposal a fleetof security guards with machine guns, along with military helicopters and a jet. 
About Iraq, he said "There was never an imminent threat," and called the war "a major blunder."
"We're not the sort of 'you're with us or against' kind of people," he said.
"We're a come-and-join-with-us kind of people," he told a crowd of 1,000 in the main lounge of the Iowa Memorial Union. "Americans know in their hearts that you don't make our country safer by erecting walls to keep others out. You make us safer by building bridges to reach out. 
"We also have to recognize that force should be used only as a last resort, when all other means have failed."

HEADLINE: Capitol Dispute Threatens To Shut Much of F.A.A. 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
A dispute on whether the government should be permitted to contract out air-traffic-control jobs at dozens more airports has left Congress deadlocked over reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration. The result may be an unpaid furlough for thousands of the agency's employees, and a tax holiday for millions of air travelers.
 The law authorizing the F.A.A. does not appropriate any money to it but provides it the authority to collect various taxes, pay most salaries and make grants to airports for construction projects. That law expires on Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. 
 But the White House, seeking to cut the size of the government's work force, has threatened to veto any reauthorization measure that includes language preventing the agency from contracting out the work of hundreds of air traffic controllers at 69 specifically designated airports around the country. 
The House and Senate versions of the measure both originally included such language. But, acting under the veto threat, a conference committee removed it. That in turn has prompted the controllers' supporters, especially in the Senate, to try to block passage.
With 11 days left to break the deadlock before the fiscal year ends, the agency is preparing to furlough nonessential employees. Functions essential to public safety, like controlling airplanes, would continue, but many others would not.
"We see ourselves on the brink of closing the doors," Marion C. Blakey, the agency's administrator, said this week.
Like most other federal agencies, the F.A.A. last furloughed workers in 1995, when Congress and the White House could not agree on a budget; about a third of the aviation agency's employees were sent home then.
But since then, Congress has enacted a law putting more strictures on the agency if its authorization lapses. One is loss of its authority to collect taxes. 
For travelers, that would mean an end to the 7.5 percent ticket tax, the $3 fee per flight segment and the $13.40 tax on international arrivals and departures. Taxes on air freight, and on aviation fuel for airliners and private planes alike, would also lapse. Together, these taxes, which support F.A.A. operations and grants to airports, raised about $9 billion last year.
Airport construction projects for which contracts have already been let would continue in the event of a shutdown, but no others would be undertaken. The F.A.A. personnel who review applications for airport improvement grants would stop working, and that would slow the pace of new grants if the shutdown continued for more than a few days. 
On the other hand, agency employees who oversee pilot certification would probably not be furloughed, Ms. Blakey said.
Nor would the controllers, a circumstance that has made for some bitterness in the aviation industry. Airline executives have generally sided with the agency in its drive to be able to contract out more jobs, and some of them see an injustice in the fact that the controllers, whom they blame for the impasse, would continue working through any shutdown.
For its part, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose member unions include the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has declared that the agency's reauthorization is being held hostage by the White House.
The aviation agency says the government would save money by hiring private companies to do the controllers' jobs at additional airports. It already contracts out those jobs at 219 airports, a result of an efficiency campaign begun during the Clinton administration.
The controllers' union disputes that money is saved in this approach, though it also contends that these "contract towers" pay less and employ fewer controllers than does the F.A.A.
Ms. Blakey said that giving her the authority to contract out the jobs should not be so controversial a step, because, she said, there are no immediate plans to actually seek bids on the work. 
To that point, Ruth Marlin, a vice president of the controllers' union, said, "It is astounding to me that they would be willing to push so far on the issue, particularly when they have said hundreds of times they have no intention of contracting out these towers."
Democrats in Congress have proposed a stopgap. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia introduced a bill to extend the current authorization law, which says nothing about the privatizing of controllers' jobs, until the end of March. 
But Republicans oppose it. "I'm not going to ask for an extension, because I am right on this legislation," Representative Don Young of Alaska, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a recent television appearance.
Mr. Young, who generally favors contract towers, points to a study by the Transportation Department's inspector general that found them safe and economical. The idea, he said, has been "misrepresented by interest groups."
The bill as reported out by the House-Senate conference committee, while allowing contracting out at the 69 airports, some of them among the nation's busiest, would forbid doing so with any other controllers' jobs for five years.
"For the first time ever," Ms. Blakey said, "it protects 94 percent of the air traffic control work force by statute." 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 26, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a deadlock over legislation to renew the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration to accept and spend money referred incorrectly to the status of aviation taxes after Oct. 1. While the F.A.A. could no longer receive various taxes without a renewal of the law, they would continue to be paid to the federal treasury; the taxes would not cease entirely.

Example of Patience by Absent England

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
AT some point, the time will be right for professional women's soccer, in a country where the game is booming at the grass-roots level and where the national team has developed a rabid rooting core.
 If that time is not now, so be it. If that sounds cold, so be it. 
 Oh, I am not talking about the United States, or the suspended Women's United Soccer Association. I am referring to the cradle of the game, where women's matches were all the rage as far back as World War I. I am talking about England, missing once again from the lineup of the Women's World Cup, which kicks off today in Philadelphia. 
 Missing, but narrowly, as Bev Ward, the women's marketing manager of the Football Association, or F.A., said by telephone from across the Atlantic.
 "Five teams qualify from Europe, which is the most competitive region, and we were sixth," she said. "It came down to us and France, two-game goal aggregate, and we lost, 2-nil."
 England will wait until 2007, hope the momentum of the last few years leads to its own Brandi Chastain moment and, yes, a professional league for the ponytailed masses in England and elsewhere to shoot for.
 It would have to be a league along the lines of the Women's National Basketball Association, Ward said, launched on the shoulders of Big Brother, using the infrastructure of its culturally rooted men's clubs.
 "To be honest, it did come as a bit of a shock," Ward said of W.U.S.A.'s shutdown, which was announced Monday. "We understand that the television networks and the sponsors weren't supporting it, but if we could average what W.U.S.A. did -- 6,500 or 7,000 fans a game -- we would be honored."
 Better yet, based on preliminary calculations, such attendance would make a women's F.A. pro league entirely viable.
 In this regard, it makes you wonder what W.U.S.A. organizers were thinking, what made them believe they could succeed with a stand-alone operation and so little corporate sponsorship.
 "There is a difference between people being with you in sports and in ways that matter economically," Val Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president, said after the W.U.S.A. announcement. Lucky for Ackerman, one of her "people" is David Stern, the N.B.A commissioner, a muscular advocate of his seven-year-old women's wing. If the N.B.A. were a true democracy, the W.N.B.A might already be gone, like its former rival, the American Basketball League.
 Is the W.U.S.A. really out of business? Depends on whom you talk to. "I'm optimistic," a person who has strong ties to the league told me the other day on condition of anonymity. "Calls are coming now from major companies. They're saying, 'What can we do for you?"'
 If this was a contrived last cry for help, if corporations most closely associated with sports and the marketing of athletes are shamed into a worthwhile rescue operation, the W.U.S.A. will finally be able to claim that it did something smart.
 If not, once again, so be it. It may be a concussive blow to the women's game in the United States, but it is hardly critical to the women's sports movement. Title IX says nothing about a pro career and a Nike contract.
 If only those in the news media now lamenting the bad news would have paid half as much attention to the W.U.S.A. as they have, say, to the college athletics scandal du jour. But it is a conundrum for us, as it is for the sports industry as a whole. There is what is wholesome, and there is what sells.
 Women's sports advocates complain bitterly about the lack of attention from the news media, about being banished to the worst time slots and locations in the expanding cable universe, and they are right. The problems also go beyond what people aren't doing for them. Women's recreational sports have been growing in leaps and bounds, but as a mature spectator and consumer market, it has barely begun to crawl.
 After generations of inequality and neglect, it is going to take another generation or three. Let all these girls in Mia Hamm jerseys who have grown up with sports as an entitlement raise their own daughters; then, maybe, we can make more appropriate value judgments. 
 The World Cup in 1999 was a great coming-out party, but it was, with regards to salability, as much a celebration of nationalism, the kind we are not alone in reveling in.
 In England, where the F.A. responded to the popularity of women's soccer during World War I by banning member clubs from sanctioning women's games for 50 years, 14,000 fans attended a World Cup qualifier against Germany. The average crowd for a national team game is 8,000, quite remarkable in a country where soccer has long been considered the male birthright and where you couldn't find a mention of Mia in 1999. I know; I was there at the time, watching tennis.
 Now, according to Ward, most clubs field an unpaid women's side, including Sheffield -- at 146, the world's oldest -- which not long ago barred women from its annual dinner. There are almost 1,000 women's teams in England, and the number of girls' teams, 4,800, has doubled in the last year.
 After the 1999 World Cup, the F.A. began to explore its own pro league but found that premature. "There's no timetable," Ward said. "Only when it can be sustained."
In other words, when it makes sound business sense. Meanwhile, there are still games to find, goals to achieve. Play on, ladies. Let the World Cup begin.

HEADLINE: In Glare of Politics, Bush Weighs Fate Of Tariffs on Steel 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 

 BODY:
With the loss of manufacturing jobs shaping up as a crucial election issue, President Bush received two midterm reports tonight that will help him decide whether to continue tariffs he imposed to help the American steel industry or to bow to other industries opposed to them.
 It will take trade and industry experts days to analyze the data, but the findings offered a counterpoint to growing complaints from small- and medium-size American manufacturing companies that use steel. They say the tariffs, or safeguards, have raised their costs, cut their profits and forced them to delay expansion and lay off employees. 
 One report, however, concluded that many companies "had difficulty distinguishing between the effects of the safeguard measures and other changes in market conditions." 
While overall employment of steel-consuming industries generally fell or remained flat in the year after the tariffs were imposed, compared with the two previous years, according to the report, "in many cases employment fell by a greater amount (and percentage) in the year before the safeguard measures were implemented than in the first year after they were implemented."
As for maintaining the tariffs, "a majority of steel-consuming firms indicated that neither continuation or termination of the safeguard measures would change employment, international competitiveness, or capital investment," the report said.
The report noted that results varied by industry and that companies in the the auto parts and steel fabrication businesses reported a greater effect from the measures.
The two reports were prepared by the International Trade Commission. One was on the effect of the tariffs on the American steel industry, as required by law, and the other studied the effects of the tariffs on industries using steel to make products, as requested by Congress.
The tariffs of up to 30 percent on imported steel were originally meant to give the ailing steel industry a three-year respite to consolidate and gain a stronger, competitive foothold in the volatile global marketplace. The steel industry has streamlined, with smaller companies either going into bankruptcy or being bought by larger companies.
Mr. Bush is expected to try to appease each side in the dispute, perhaps by continuing the tariffs but expanding the number of exceptions to them, thereby holding down steel prices.
Administration officials, however, said it would be some time before the president makes his decision.
"We will begin a thorough review and analysis of these reports today and will use them as a part of our ongoing review of developments in the steel industry, and the economy more generally, since the imposition of the steel safeguard measures," said Richard Mills, a spokesman for Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative.
Even before the reports were released, some economists said that the tariffs had, in fact, resulted in more jobs lost to overseas competition than they saved.
The industries that use steel said that as many as 100,000 jobs had disappeared because of the tariffs.
The steel industry and trade unions call that figure an exaggeration and say that the increase in steel prices caused by the tariffs has been temporary.
In the heightened political climate, both sides may be exaggerating.
"On balance, the greater economic effect was more negative than positive," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. "But the numbers are fairly small and don't begin to justify the complaints you hear."
Politicians representing companies on each side of the issue have been lobbying the White House for months, touching off a fierce debate over the political implications of the tariffs for Mr. Bush's re-election as much as their effect on the economy.
"These tariffs have hurt the president's political base," said Representative Joe Knollenberg, Republican of Michigan, who represents many of the smaller industries that want the tariffs repealed.
Politics could easily trump economic arguments. 
Several states in the Rust Belt -- Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- will be pivotal in next year's presidential election.
The question will be whether the steel industry and steel unions are considered more important for victory than the far more numerous but smaller companies that use steel.
Democratic candidates for president have seized on the loss of manufacturing jobs as an issue to use against Mr. Bush, but few responded today to requests for their opinion on the steel tariffs. 
An exception was Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, who has won support from some unions.
"Repealing or modifying the steel industry relief program will only further jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of workers in the steel industry," he said.
To further complicate the issue, the United States lost a case at the World Trade Organization this year that had been brought by Europe contending that the steel tariffs went beyond the legal provisions allowed under international trading rules to protect against a surge in imports.
The United States could face millions of dollars in penalties by the end of the year. But Europe appears reluctant to pursue such a course at the risk of fueling a trans-Atlantic trade war.
Nao Matsukata, a trade lawyer who worked for Mr. Zoellick when the steel tariffs were imposed, said that he could see little reason for a repeal. 
"The administration has already taken the hit on steel both domestically and internationally," he said. "If there are enough economic gains, there are no political reasons to reverse trends that are in the right direction."
Steel industry officials say that the major transformation the industry is undergoing would have been impossible without the tariffs and will require the three-year period to be completed. 
Without the tariffs, said Thomas Usher, chief executive of U.S. Steel, "no one would have had the access to the financial markets or the abilityto do this type of restructuring.
"All these companies went out into the debt market, borrowed money and are now going through the difficult job of integrating these companies together," he added in a phone conference with reporters.

HEADLINE: For Spring Lines, Colors and Retailers Return 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
As the last swan-necked model walked her spiky walk down a runway in New York yesterday, ending another Fashion Week, retailers from around the country rejoiced that designers -- at last -- had given American merchants what they had been pleading for: high-fashion gaiety and department-store saleability.
 "In every collection, there was more energy, more color, more frivolity than I have seen since 9/11," said Evelyn Gorman, who owns Mix, a Houston boutique. "No. 1 is wearability. None of my customers is going to write a check for $2,000 for something they can't wear." 
 The indications are that spring 2004 is a commercial hit, that the designers "weren't putting a product down the runway that would never see the light of day," as Joan Kaner, Neiman Marcus's fashion director, put it. Jeffrey Kalinsky, the owner of Jeffrey, high-fashion boutiques in Atlanta and New York's meatpacking district, said he planned to spend more -- "a good deal more" -- on labels like Zac Posen, Narciso Rodriguez and Tuleh, whose clothes are to begin arriving in stores next February and March. 
The NPD Group, which compiles confidential sales information from stores nationwide, said that during the last three years, when merchants complained that expensive designer clothes were too boring or too outrageous to sell, only about 10 percent of the samples paraded on New York runways were ever produced.
For next spring, according to NPD estimates, double that figure -- 20 percent -- will be made and will appear on some chrome rack somewhere, with pieces as diverse as a $250 citrus-hued T-shirt by Michael Kors and a $3,000 Calvin Klein pink chiffon dress pleated like a window blind.
The season's clothes are feminine, pretty and anything but solid black, the dominant color of many earlier seasons. The designers have kissed the micromini goodbye. One flowing chiffon dress followed another on catwalks last week. "These clothes are prettier than they have been in a long time," Ms. Kaner said.
Buyers for stores certainly have made mistakes before. The sales of spring merchandise won't be tallied for months. But Stephen Lasker, a partner in Steam on Sunset, a high-priced specialty shop in Miami, is bullish: he predicted a 20 percent increase in his business in spring 2004. "Last spring, there were more dressy dresses that could only be worn in the evening for special occasions," he said. "These collections were full of crossover items, like satin blouses that can be worn during the day with jeans, and then at night over a skirt."
The volume of orders directly attributable to Fashion Week is likely to rise from $360 million a year ago to $400 million, calculated in retail dollars, said Marshal Cohen, a senior analyst at NPD. This encompasses the total that will be spent on women's apparel in New York showrooms this week and during the next two weeks, not just on the designer collections shown on the catwalks but also on other, lower-priced lines as well.
"The retailers have been begging the designers for something fresh, something different, and this spring they have delivered," Mr. Cohen said. Although runway couture accounts for less than 1 percent of the $90 billion American women's clothing market, the look of the designer collections filters down to lower-priced lines bought by most women.
The contrast between fashions now in stores and the coming spring's was noticeable at the tent shows in Bryant Park in Midtown. At Mr. Kors's show Wednesday morning, Melanie Griffith sat in the front row wearing an outfit from this season's Kors line that made her look like a biker chick, all black leather and bristling studs. In front of her strode models in the Capri-influenced collection of tangerine nylon skirts, string bags and cobalt-blue geometric prints.
"I looked at her and I said: 'Whoa! What's she wearing?' I had to remember I had designed it for what is actually the current season," Mr. Kors said. "Six months ago is a lifetime in the fashion industry." 
The consensus among merchants was that designers, after years of department store declines (sales dropped an average of 2.3 percent last year) had rediscovered the American woman.
H. Frank Doroff, the general merchandise manager for Bloomingdale's, said he would be buying "significantly more" than he did for last spring. Why? "Color, femininity, attention to details," he said. 
Designers, who often consider themselves creative types first, brushed off questions about whether they changed their styles to sell them. But retailers said the season's accessible looks had a lot to do with hearing from shoppers who are troubled by the economy, anxious about the war in Iraq and bored with clothes that all looked alike.
"The customer told us all," said Denise Filchner, vice president for fashion merchandising for Federated Department Stores, which includes Macy's and Bloomingdale's. "She wanted to dress her age, not too bare. The whole mod thing sold in some pockets but not in others."
"The designers went back to their roots," Ms. Filchner added. "Michael Kors was Michael Kors again. The young people -- Tracy Reese, for one -- did their look the way they should for the young, impulse buyers. Everyone filled their niche, so you didn't have high-end designers doing things for clientele who couldn't pull off the look."
Retailers cited personal runway favorites that they intended to buy: a long black and white tennis-sweater dress by Ralph Lauren; a pink charmeuse dress by Zac Posen; a carnation-print strapless dress by Derek Lam; a natural linen sculptured dress by Narciso Rodriguez; an orange suede trench coat by Michael Kors; a chiffon minicaftan in an ethnic print by Matthew Williamson; and a copper-colored satin and chiffon scarf dress and parchment-colored jacket by Donna Karan.
Retailers had mixed reactions to the highly anticipated Calvin Klein collection, now under a new designer, Francisco Costa. Two buyers from major department stores, who did not want to be identified for fear of displeasing Mr. Klein, said they would not buy the collection this season or would purchase much less than they had previously. For her part, Ms. Kaner of Neiman Marcus called it "a good first effort." 
Starting Monday, retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman's will send their buyers into designers' showrooms, the workaday offices on and around Seventh Avenue that contrast sharply with the glamorous realm of the Bryant Park tents and the Chelsea lofts. The buyers will work out the details of the picture painted by stores' top executives who attended the runway shows, seated in the front rows with the movie stars and leading fashion editors, although farther away from the packs of paparazzi. Two weeks from now, virtually all the orders for the American spring 2004 collections will be placed. 
On Wednesday, Suzanne Patneaude, Nordstrom's executive vice president in charge of designer apparel, who will travel to London, Milan and Paris for more shows after New York, was noncommittal about whether her 91-store chain would spend more than it did last year on American designers. Like most merchants and buyers interviewed, she declined to divulge her budget, explaining that that would give away secrets to the competition.
By Friday, Ms. Patneaude was ebullient. Still guarded about exact figures, she said she would definitely spend more than she had planned, including a passel on some new names. "There were some real surprises among the new designers," she said. "When we thought of the top level of designers, we may have thought of the big names. But now we find we must broaden our definition of top level. We're reassessing, we're opening the pocketbook." The newcomers she cited included Ms. Reese, Nanette Lepore and Jennifer Nicholson, Jack Nicholson's daughter.
Mr. Doroff of Bloomingdale's also said he would do business with newcomers he had not previously ordered from. Besides Ralph Lauren and Marc Jacobs, whose collections he called extraordinary, he said he would buy from Zac Posen and Derek Lam, a veteran of Mr. Kors's design team who showed his first runway collection. 
After Ms. Karan's show yesterday afternoon, the last major show of Fashion Week, the audience's standing ovation seemed to sum up hopes for the coming shopping season. "American women are tired of the drab economy, and they're trying to feel their way out," said Mr. Lasker of Steam on Sunset. 
The buyers are betting that these clothes, flirty and fluid, with the colors of a high-priced parrot, will lead them out of the darkness.

 BODY:
 EVE IN THE CITY
By Thomas Rayfiel.
274 pp. New York:
Ballantine Books. $23.95.
 IN his wonderful previous novel, "Colony Girl," Thomas Rayfiel introduced Eve, a 15-year-old quite unsupplied with any provisional notion of herself, or rather -- brought up in, and breaking out of, a fundamentalist Christian commune in the Midwest -- with one so peculiar and contradictory as to amount to none. She was, like her Edenic namesake, new, naked and trackless.
Skirting and maneuvering among the commune members and their complicated guru, and going on to try out her unfledged notions with the Iowa townspeople outside, Eve was the classic teenage wanderer and cogitator -- one of the company of Huck Finn, and worthy of belonging. At the end she lights out for the territory. Hers is New York.
"Eve in the City" is a sequel of sorts, and in adolescent bust-out literature sequels can be tricky. Mark Twain wrote a couple of dismal outcroppings to "Tom Sawyer"; fortunately, he let Huck go west unfollowed.
Eve retains some of the sudden glowworm quality she displayed in the obscure confines of her Iowa upbringing. Here in Manhattan, though, she is a glowworm under klieg lights. In many ways she is quite as splendid as in the first book, and this gives "Eve in the City" moments of acute, astonished delight. And certainly Rayfiel has a grittily haunting feel for New York. Here it is at 5 a.m.:
"They say the city never sleeps. It does. Just before dawn you can hear it snore. Light hangs in the air, directionless, not yet pressed into rays. The smell of a hidden sea soaks through stone. The streets themselves have that booming emptiness of a shell held to the ear."
Despite such passages, the author can be as lost in New York as his character is. The adventures that test her and the people she comes up against have an artificially constructed quality; they are willed wonders.
Nearly 17 now, Eve has found a job as a hot-pants-clad hostess in an after-hours bar run by Viktor, a barrel-shaped immigrant from Mingrelia (part of Georgia, he explains near the end, grudgingly doling out one or two of his particulars).
Despite its sleazy come-on air, the bar is relatively innocuous; after the 5 a.m. closing, Viktor makes a point of driving Eve and the three other hostesses -- waifs like her, though older and brassier -- home. He wants to make sure they are safe, he says, while making a mildly pressuring move on whoever gets out last.
As with her venture as a teenage stripper at a bar near the Iowa commune, Eve works Viktor's place, more or less (Ben Jonson's phrase) in safety of her innocence. When Viktor recruits her after noticing her scanning the help-wanted ads in a coffee shop, their exchange gives a flavor of the book's better qualities -- at once pungent and lighter than air.
"What do I have to do?" she asks.
"Nothing you don't want."
"How do you know what I want?"
"I said nothing you don't want. What you want is another area with which I am not concerned."
Innocent doesn't mean uncalculating. Eve calculates continually, on the basis of no previously acquired information. Her New York algebra is computed with a homemade alphabet.
Rayfiel has tried to conceive how the city might register on the imagination of a juicily budding young woman brought up on Mars or, in this case, on a fundamentalist commune where last names aren't used because the Bible doesn't use them, and where photographs, for example, are sinful. It is not that Eve clings to these principles; it is simply that they are the rock she stands on and, both staid and wild, ventures waveringly to step off from.
She is wary and instantly susceptible. At an art opening she meets a tall, etiolated painter who melts her by the particularly soft texture of his hair and the aroma of his sandalwood soap, and by standing extremely close. There is a series of bumbled meetings, which end with what she hopes will be a seduction but becomes, instead, an occasion for the artist -- not even ruthless; flaccidly opportunist, rather -- to get her naked so he can paint her.
There is a middle-aged black detective, husky and with a buzz cut, whose quasi-paternal attentions alternately attract and repel her. "I liked his skin," she muses. "There was so much of it, with that shaved head."
Neither of them have fictional substance of their own. Nor does a woman artist who takes photographs of her vagina (doesn't it fog the lens? Eve wants to know), blows them up poster-size, hangs them in the subway to attract graffiti and exhibits the results to represent themale gaze.
The elaborate complications that whirl these figures about manage only to turn them into fantastical doodles, Wonderland figures serving to befuddle Eve's Alice. So do a couple of splashy hyperplots: an apparent sidewalk rape and murder that Eve witnesses and that turns out to be something quite different; and her entanglement with an immensely rich old man working spidery manipulations from his penthouse.
Viktor is portrayed much more vividly. His speech, with its growled offbeat stresses, is nevertheless too precise to be anything but foreign. "He used English like a scalpel, like it wasn't part of him, so he could make it do what he wanted," she notes. "Nothing ever just came from his mouth. It always had a purpose."
Amiably bearlike, but subject to sudden deflations, brutally practical and tearfully passionate, he insists that Eve marry him so he can get a green card. A formality, he tells her, but allows that "there are other considerations." Offended by the green card, Eve swoons over those other considerations; finally, though, she is repelled.
Rayfiel gives his heroine a hopeful ending that is intolerably pat (it must be a quarter-century since getting a job at Bloomingdale's could qualify). When he manages to connect his Eve to his Manhattan, it is not through her garish encounters and adventures but through odd moments: when she finds a tiny walk-up apartment, for instance: "One day I looked up and the city wasn't a maze anymore. It was an island. The streets ended in sky."
Or when she thinks of the coffee shop she frequents as a church, recalling the peaceable security she remembers from back home. "Thank you, Jesus," she blurts out when the waiter brings her a cup of coffee to rouse her from a spell of woolgathering. "No problem," he says.

HEADLINE: Waiting for the Messiah of Eastern Parkway 

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Mahler; Jonathan Mahler is writing a book about New York and baseball in the 70's. His last article for the magazine was on white-collar unemployment.

 BODY:
The synagogue in the basement of the Lubavitch headquarters at 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is the closest thing to holy ground for the Hasidic movement, though with its peeling paint, dirty linoleum floors, wooden benches and unidentifiable odor, it feels more like a junior-high-school cafeteria than your average Jewish sanctuary. But at a little before 10 p.m. on a recent Friday night, the place is thick with spirituality. Small clusters of bearded men bob furiously in prayer, while a smattering of women watch from behind the plexiglass in the balcony above.
 In the center of the room, a group of about 25 men are dancing hypnotically in a circle. A few bounce little boys on their shoulders as they chant a single phrase over and over: Yechi adonenu morenu verabbenu melech hamoshiach leolam voed. 
 A middle-aged man standing near me catches my eye. Like everyone else here, he's wearing the Lubavitch uniform -- black wool suit, white shirt and black fedora. When he opens his mouth to speak, I expect his words to come out coated in Yiddish. Instead, they're pure Brooklyn. 
"That's the No. 1 hit in Crown Heights," he says, stroking his big red beard and grinning.
It looks almost like a rain dance, only instead of precipitation, these Lubavitchers are trying to hasten the arrival of the messiah. There's just one problem. The words of the accompanying song -- "May our master, teacher and rabbi, the king messiah, live forever" -- refer specifically to a man who died nine years ago: Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the grand rabbi and spiritual leader of the Lubavitch movement from 1951 until 1994. The Yechi, as it is known, is sung as a demonstration of faith that their beloved rebbe will be back soon -- rising from the great beyond in a manner more befitting Jesus Christ than the savior of the Jewish people.
So if Yechi -- "May he live" -- is a demonstration of faith to some, it borders on a profane outburst to others. A swath of Lubavitchers are not only unwilling to utter the Yechi; they also refuse to be present in synagogues or at gatherings where it is chanted. To understand the concern of these so-called anti-messianists, consider that only a few men in Jewish history have been revered as the messiah after their deaths. One was Jesus. Another was Sabbatai Zevi, who won hundreds of thousands of followers across Palestine and Eastern Europe after publicly declaring himself the messiah in 1665. (Zevi's death was, relatively speaking, a small challenge to his adherents, who had already chosen to stick by him after his conversion to Islam.)
For the anti-messianists, their messianic brethren present a public-relations disaster of epic proportions. They worry that their Hasidic movement, which is 300 years old and has survived pogroms, Communism and the Holocaust, will become confused with a cult. What's more, they can hardly ignore the obvious Christian overtones of messianism: what kind of Jews believe in a second coming?
Lubavitch is insignificant in terms of the global Jewish population, accounting for just a couple hundred thousand people, but it plays an outsize role in worldwide Jewish life. Unlike other, insular Hasidic movements, the Lubavitch credo, articulated repeatedly by Rebbe Schneerson himself, calls for encouraging secular Jews to become more observant. Between its emissaries and far-flung outposts (last year alone, Lubavitch opened 34 Jewish schools around the world), the movement has almost certainly done more to promote the growth of Judaism than any other organization. It is this last fact that makes the dispute between messianists and anti-messianists more than a communal squabble. "What people have not yet grasped is that this is a watershed event in the history of Judaism," says David Berger, a professor of Jewish history at Brooklyn College and the author of an unusually vitriolic academic book attacking Lubavitch messianism. "People will eventually come to see this moment in apocalyptic terms."
Chaim Meyer Lieberman, a tall man with a long, graying beard, traces his roots back to the beginning of the Hasidic movement in 18th-century Poland. When World War II broke out, his parents headed for Russia, figuring the climate would be less hostile to Orthodox Jews. By 1949, when Lieberman was born, they had been fortunate enough to survive the Holocaust and find their way to a displaced-persons camp in France.
In 1954, shortly after Rebbe Schneerson was named grand rabbi, the Liebermans joined the nascent Lubavitch community in New York. Although Schneerson's predecessor had escaped to Brooklyn during World War II, many of his followers had been trapped in Europe. This meant that the rebbe inherited a movement decimated by Hitler and Stalin.
In the 1950's, Schneerson set about rebuilding Lubavitch in a small section of Crown Heights. Lieberman came of age as the movement was being reborn. By the time he was a teenager, there were thousands of Lubavitchers living in Crown Heights, and thousands more coming every week to hear Schneerson's stirring sermons. The rebbe himself rarely left Brooklyn, but he sent emissaries, a sort of Jewish Peace Corps, into the darkest corners of the world to rekindle the embers of Judaism.
Schneerson's reputation soon transcended the movement, yet even as his fame grew and it became almost impossible to get an audience with him, Lieberman felt a close connection to his rebbe. "He took a personal interest in my life," he tells me one recent afternoon in his grand if slightly rundown Tudor house on Eastern Parkway, less than a block away from 770. His wife has set out pistachio nuts and sunflower seeds on the oversize dining table. The youngest of his 17 children, a 4-year-old, is doing laps around the room and shrieking. 
In 1968, Lieberman participated in the building of the synagogue in the basement of 770, which was formerly a medical clinic. Today Lieberman refuses to pray there during the Sabbath, when the messianism reaches its most fevered pitch, opting instead for one of the community's nonmessianic synagogues. "It's such an abomination," he says in disgust. "My blood pressure goes through the roof when I walk in there."
When the rebbe was alive, just about every Lubavitcher, Lieberman included, was confident he was the messiah. Because all Lubavitchers consider the messianic era to be imminent, it stands to reason that every generation would believe that its particular rebbe might be the messiah. Even given this predisposition, though, the movement's faith in the messianic potential of Schneerson, who was childless, was always uncommonly strong. This was partly a matter of historical context. When the rebbe took the reins of the movement, the Jewish people had just survived the worst calamity in their 3,000-year history -- a propitious moment for them to be delivered from the sufferings of their exile.
As the years passed, the Lubavitch community became increasingly convinced that their rebbe met all of the requirements, laid out by Maimonides, to be the Jewish messiah. Most significant was his emphasis on outreach. "Maimonides said the messiah would be a Jewish leader who will 'repair the breaches,"' one messianic rabbi, Eli Cohen, told me, "or fix that which is missing in Jewish observance, and that's what the rebbe did." World events -- specifically the fall of the Soviet Union, which had suppressed the practice of Judaism, and the struggle over Israel -- fanned the community's messianic flames.
But that consensus was ruptured on the night of June 12, 1994. Lieberman remembers hearing the blare of the horn used to signal the end of the Sabbath. Only the Sabbath had ended hours earlier. The rebbe had suffered a stroke a few months before, and Lieberman correctly feared the worst.
Hustling over to 770, he saw hundreds of Lubavitchers converging outside. Some wept; others, however, were gleeful, downing vodka, dancing and singing Yechi. Lieberman was stunned. As his grief turned to anger, he spoke to a prominent rabbi in the community, who stood near him. "How can you stand by here when you see this display," he remembers saying to the rabbi, "and not open up your mouth?" 
Though he'd been sick for years, the rebbe's death came as a shock to the community. Some Lubavitchers, like Lieberman, started the process of accepting the reality that their messiah in waiting was gone. "Sure I felt disappointment, but you have to move on," Lieberman says. "What can one say other than that life is not always what you want it to be?" But many clung stubbornly to their faith, insisting that the rebbe never really died or that the process of redemption was under way and that the rebbe would soon return and be revealed as the messiah. "Exactly how this is going to come about we really don't know," Rabbi Cohen says. "What we do know is that if you open your eyes, you can see that bit by bit it's coming to pass."
What started as a fissure between the community's messianists and anti-messianists has gradually opened into a canyon, with each side insisting that it is the true heir to the rebbe's vision. Over the years, the conflict between the two factions has also become one of propaganda, with rival publishing houses, magazines and bookstores. There are also endless semantic distinctions between the two factions, the most common of which is that anti-messianists write "Of Blessed Memory" after the rebbe's name, while messianists insist on "Long Live King Messiah." There is even a Lubavitch version of the school-prayer debate, over whether the yeshivas should encourage students to sing Yechi. (Some do, some don't.)
The messianists, who say they believe they can hasten the rebbe's return by persuading as many people as possible that he is the messiah, promote their agenda in the streets, proselytizing regularly in non-Lubavitch neighborhoods, approaching strangers and prodding them to recite Yechi. Their calls are echoed by two messianic talk-radio shows, "Living With Moshiach" (the Hebrew word for messiah) and "Moshiach in the Air."
The messianists are clearly straying from Jewish norms with their belief in a resurrected messiah. And yet, they are also reclaiming an abandoned element of the religion; Judaism, after all, was the original Western messianic faith. Still, for most Jews today, observant and secular alike, the very concept of a messiah has become, at most, a metaphorical one. And the idea of one Jew trying to persuade another one that a deceased Brooklyn rabbi is the messiah is repellent. "I'm embarrassed to tell you some of the things I've seen," Lieberman says. About a year ago, he watched in humiliation as the police were called in to confront a group of Lubavitchers who were camped out in front of a synagogue in Borough Park, Brooklyn, trying to persuade members of another Hasidic community to accept the rebbe as their messiah. 
Nowhere is the divide between messianists and anti-messianists more visible than at the hallowed 770, a site holy enough to have inspired an exact replica in Israel. Not only have the messianists assumed ownership of the synagogue, hanging messianic banners inside and in several instances physically attacking anti-messianists who tried to remove them; they have also vandalized the dedication plaque on the building's facade, scratching out the Hebrew acronym for "Of Blessed Memory" after the rebbe's name.
Though there are no numerical breakdowns of the two factions, during the weeks I spent in and around Crown Heights, it seemed as if the majority of the community is messianic. Nevertheless, in addition to the anti-messianists, there are plenty of messianists who worry that aggressively advertising their message will push people away from Judaism altogether and are thus reluctant to directly address the question. "There are definitely disagreements about publicizing it," one especially outspoken (or "hot") messianist told me, "but I think everybody agrees that the rebbe is moshiach." Whether or not this is true, there is a practical concern here: Lubavitch raises hundreds of millions of dollars a year from non-Hasidic Jewish philanthropists like Ronald Perelman and Ronald Lauder.
Perhaps for these reasons, perhaps because it is difficult to campaign about not believing in something, the anti-messianists, rather than battling it out shout-for-shout in the streets, are focusing primarily on image control. Long term, of course, the anti-messianists would like to win over as many people inside the movement as possible. But in the short term, there are perceptions to manage, which means convincing the outside world that the epidemic has at least been contained. 
Locally, this means trying to quietly urge messianists to take down the huge yellow banners emblazoned with a crown -- the symbol of "King Messiah" -- that hang from many of their windows, and to stop plastering their cars with messianic bumper stickers. (A popular one features the rebbe's crinkled face -- the fluffy white beard and piercing blue eyes -- alongside the word "Yechi.") Outside the community, the anti-messianists spin. A P.R. contact for the movement was eager to set me up with a few Lubavitchers who were quick to play down the presence of the messianists. 
Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the anti-messianists are fighting for control of the various Lubavitch institutions. "It has to be done without making a big commotion in the community," Lieberman says, pointing out that the New York Lubavitch youth committee has recently marginalized a few of the more aggressive messianists, including Rabbi Cohen, who is no longer in charge of student outreach at New York University. "N.Y.U. is a major university," Lieberman says. "We can't make fools out of ourselves there." (For his part, Rabbi Cohen says he is working with his successor, who also is a messianist.)
Lieberman watches his son for a moment and then looks back at me and sighs. "It's a very difficult time," he says. "I feel bad for my children. They won't have what I had. I worry for them."
In a sense, the Lubavitch movement today is stronger than ever. Its 2002 budget was close to $1 billion, and it continues to open new schools, synagogues and Jewish outreach centers all over the world. But there is no question that the continuing messianism has the potential to cause significant attrition among the next generation. It is difficult enough to keep young people in a small enclave in the heart of Brooklyn insulated from the temptations of the secular world without also asking them to believe that a man who died nine years ago is about to return and redeem them.
As one 20-something ex-Lubavitcher wrote me in an e-mail message: "Lubavitch is in trouble. They socialized their children to live according to premises that include that the rebbe is moshiach, which gave him authority over issues such as college, secular literature, etc. If people begin thinking the way I did/do and consider the possibility that the rebbe is human, they will no longer be able to explain why they shouldn't go to college et cetera. Uprooting these premises will jeopardize the entire value system."
Thirty-five years old and skinny, with long kinky black hair and a Frank Zappa goatee, Baruch Thaler left the Lubavitch movement several years ago, but his mother, stepfather and five siblings are all still very much a part of it. Making one of his occasional trips to Crown Heights on a recent afternoon, Thaler takes me to meet his mother. "This is what a messianic house looks like," he says, ushering me into the living room of his family's semiattached home. He is wearing a white shirt, untucked, black jeans and sneakers and a black knitted yarmulke that he has put on for the occasion.
On the bookshelf is a stack of Beis Moshiach magazines, the local messianic weekly, as well as the Igros Kodesh, a collection of the rebbe's letters that messianists use for guidance by flipping to a random page and reading the rebbe's words as an answer to something about which they need advice. 
Thaler's mother, Rachel, 57, with blue eyes and braces on her teeth, comes down the stairs in traditional Orthodox garb -- a brown wig and ankle-length skirt -- and takes a seat next to her son on the couch. It is one of the peculiarities of the movement that for every Lieberman, an Old World Hasid, there is a New Age seeker like Rachel Thaler, who was a lapsed Jew living on a macrobiotic commune in upstate New York when she discovered Lubavitch in the early 1970's.
As with many fundamentalist faiths, whose most zealous practitioners tend to be converts, the most ardent messianists were not born into Hasidism but are rather ba'al teshuvah, or returnees to the faith, like Rachel. "God recreates the world every second," she says, explaining her messianic faith to me. "It's like a movie -- every frame can be totally different."
If Rachel's messianic hopes were not deflated by the rebbe's death, her son's certainly were. A promising student in the local yeshivas, he had been on track to spread the rebbe's teachings as a Lubavitch emissary when he found himself among the throngs outside 770 on the day after the rebbe's death. Forcing his way to the front of the crowd, Thaler, who was 25 at the time, managed to grab the rebbe's coffin as it was being carried out of the building and into the car that would transport it to a graveyard in Queens. Because Jewish law requires that corpses be returned to the earth and most New York cemeteries mandate that dead bodies be fully enclosed, some Jewish coffins are made with a thin wood panel on the bottom that slides out when they are lowered into the ground. Reaching up to lift the coffin, Thaler found himself pushing directly up into that layer of plywood. As he shuffled toward the street, he could feel the shifting weight of the dead rebbe pressing into his bare hands. "Later, people would insist that the casket was empty," he says. "But this was total reality -- physical-touch confirmation."
After the rebbe was buried, Thaler pulled away from the movement. He was, as the expression goes, "frying out," a term adapted from the word "frei," Yiddish for free. He spent the rest of his 20's and early 30's enjoying an overdue adolescence -- listening to reggae, having sex, traveling in Southeast Asia, discovering Burning Man. He now lives on the Upper West Side, where he's getting an undergraduate degree at Columbia while doing Yiddish translation on the side. While he's no longer observant, he retains a sentimental attachment to the movement. "It isn't my interest to give up the positive elements of Lubavitch that I still love," Thaler says, "the music, the literature, the congenial spirit of Hasidism. That can live on forever."
This is not enough to satisfy Thaler's mother. "He should be at peace with his relationship with the rebbe," she tells me as Thaler clutches at his yarmulke, which had slipped off, and places it precariously back on top of his head. "I don't think he is now."
Later I ask Thaler about his mother's messianism. "Does believing in a man hanging on a cross make any more sense?" he replies. "Once you're in that mind-set, it's not a great wonder that you have people like my mother who seek the answers to life's crucial decisions based on opening a book."
As a little girl, Malkie Schwartz, who is now 22, lined up with the masses most Sundays to receive a blessing and a dollar bill from the rebbe, as was the custom in his later years. After the rebbe's death, she attended Lubavitch camps where she and her fellow campers sang songs beseeching him to return and redeem them.
For a while, the rebbe's physical absence made her spiritual yearning for him that much greater. "I believed full-heartedly that he was moshiach," Schwartz says one morning in early August outside a Starbucks on Astor Place. "I longed for him."
Over time, though, Schwartz began to have doubts -- doubts that she had a hard time sharing with her fervently messianic parents. In the fall of 2000, at age 19, she sat down at the kitchen table with her mother and father, picked up a yellow highlighter and a blank piece of paper and drew a box and three stick figures. Two were inside the box and one was outside.
"See," she said, pointing to the drawing. "You're inside the box. You believe the Torah is divine and the rebbe is moshiach. I'm outside the box."
Her father cut her off before she could elaborate. "But the Torah is divine," he said, "and the rebbe is moshiach."
Two weeks later, Schwartz, who had been the valedictorian of her Crown Heights yeshiva, moved out of her parents' house and into Manhattan. That the hardest part of leaving was not abandoning her family and friends but turning her back on the rebbe, underscores the power of messianism's hold on many Lubavitchers. "Even when I left I knew the rebbe was always right -- I knew I was messing up," she says.
Now a senior at Hunter College, Schwartz is starting a nonprofit for members of ultrareligious communities who are trying to make inroads into the secular world. Since leaving Lubavitch, she has forged a strained peace with her parents, but at the same time her feelings of guilt toward the rebbe have curdled into resentment. She doesn't doubt his worthy intentions, but she does feel almost personally betrayed by his failure to anticipate the problems that the messianism he tacitly encouraged would one day cause. "If you're going to have people waiting on line for hours to see you . . . he had to have seen how enthralled everyone was," she says. "What he was thinking? Where did he think this would go?"
At the heart of the struggle between the anti-messianists and messianists, of course, is the question of what the rebbe wanted. Each side insists that they are the true interpreters of his teachings, and because the rebbe named neither a successor nor even a governing body to act in his absence, no one has the authority to resolve the dispute.
For anti-messianists, the biggest worry is the prospect that their beloved leader will be remembered as a false messiah. As the executors of the rebbe's will, they at least retain control over his personal notebooks and can edit and publish them with an eye toward de-emphasizing any statements that might encourage the messianists.
The biggest difficulty in trying to figure out what the rebbe really wanted is that he, too, was aware of his movement's image and thus sent different signals to those inside and outside the community. This was more than a mere P.R. gesture. The rebbe seemed to believe that bringing secular Jews back into the fold was a critical part of the process of redemption and was thus understandably wary of scaring people off with messianic zealotry.
What does seem clear is that the rebbe was, for many years, eager to quell the tide of messianism when it began to rise. But as he grew older, he became more reluctant to do so. Among the messianists' abiding articles of faith are two videotapes of the rebbe in his later years. One shows him smiling as a crowd of Lubavitchers sing Yechi around him; in the other, he is accepting a petition signed by thousands that identifies him as the messiah.
In the late 80's and early 90's, the rebbe, no doubt increasingly aware of his approaching mortality as well as of his lack of progeny, began speaking more and more frequently about the messiah -- not explicitly nominating himself but nonetheless encouraging a messianic urgency among his followers and even occasionally hinting that the messianic era had already begun. 
Max Kohanzad was a teenager in the Lubavitch yeshivas during those critical years. He and his classmates spent four hours a day poring over the rebbe's messianic discourses. In the aftermath of the rebbe's death, he was among the jubilant messianic Lubavitchers whose behavior so appalled Lieberman. "I spent the entire day with the other yeshiva students singing Yechi and anticipating the actual redemption," says Kohanzad. "What was understood was that this was the day utopia was going to begin."
Unfazed when it didn't, Kohanzad and his fellow messianists soon started putting out their first underground publications, contending that the rebbe's death didn't diminish his legitimacy as messiah and pointing to Jewish sources that allow for a second coming. Kohanzad continued to dig deeper into the rebbe's messianic philosophy at various Lubavitch yeshivas. As he did, he felt a growing sense of discomfort with the rebbe's messianic rhetoric, which he thought clashed with traditional Jewish orthodoxy. Kohanzad, who left the movement in 2000 but is now completing a Jewish studies dissertation on the rebbe's messianic theology, has come to think that the messianists and anti-messianists are, to a degree, both correct. "The rebbe himself was purposefully ambiguous with regard to his messianic statements, which leaves room for the two interpretations," he says. 
In this context, it's possible to see the rebbe as a postmodern religious leader, one who intended for his followers to make their own decisions about his identity as the messiah. This would be in keeping with the tradition of Hasidism, which itself began as a populist effort to wrest Judaism from the grip of an elite group of Talmudic scholars. "I think the rebbe wanted to dismantle his movement in a way," Max says. "He realized that in order for people to be redeemed, they have to redeem themselves. The current mess is part of the rebbe's attempt to empower people."
Or maybe there's another way of looking at it. Perhaps the rebbe was trying to walk the fine line between discouraging cultlike fanaticism among his followers and wanting to avoid shattering their hopes for imminent redemption.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 9-21-03: THE ETHICIST; 
Take This Job

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen

 BODY:
I was downsized from my job in January. Recently I was offered a new position, but it's work that I loathe. If I accept, I will be miserable, just biding time till I find something better. My wife insists I need feel no compunction about taking a job I have no intention of keeping. She says it's better to stiff an employer (who may have no qualms about laying me off) than to subject my family to the rigors of reduced income. Should I take it? Mark Di Lucido, Scottsdale, Ariz.
 Take the rotten job. And when you clock in, you must perform an honest day's work for an honest day's pay; but you need not have the company logo tattooed on your chest. If there were a taboo against taking a job you didn't love, half the country would be out of work, except those few who enjoy slogging away in cubicles or on cuticles (or both if the office includes an on-site manicurist). 
 There's nothing discreditable about working to support yourself and your family -- people have to make a living -- and moving on if something better presents itself. Should you get lucky enough in today's grim economy to find a job you love, you must of course give your resented employer reasonable notice, but to do so is not to "stiff" him. Were he determined to retain you, he'd be free to offer you a contract. If he doesn't, he's electing to keep his -- and your -- options open.
RANDY REBUFFED UPDATE: After much thought, Di Lucido declined the loathsome job. He continued looking for work, a tough experience: "I was a first-timer. I always thought downsizing happened to some $30-an-hour union guy at a steel mill back east." After a month or two, he found a job in Tucson that he genuinely likes. He and his family intend to relocate. In retrospect, he says, "it was the right decision."
I'm pleased Di Lucido found a good job, but a desirable outcome does not necessarily confirm the theory that led to it. Every now and then I pick a winning horse out of a hat. (Not the actual horse, of course, just its name.) And while he had the right to forsake the first job, he had no obligation to do so.
My supervisor, a co-worker and I were driving home from a business conference when my supervisor was pulled over for speeding. After sitting in silence for some time, he bluntly asked us to share the cost of the ticket since he was only speeding to get us home quicker. Are we responsible to share that cost? We didn't ask him to drive or to speed. Anonymous, New York
You're lucky he didn't shoot up a liquor store to steal a bottle of gin for the three of you: by his logic, you'd all be sharing a prison cell.
He was driving, he was speeding, he pays the ticket. I might feel otherwise if you'd urged him to greater and greater speed to get you home in time for TV's lovable "Friends" or for the sheer thrill of velocity. But you didn't. And while you might have encouraged him to drive more prudently, ultimately the responsibility to drive lawfully is the driver's.
His conduct is all the worse because he is your supervisor, making it awkward for you to criticize his driving, and tough for you to decline his demand that you share the cost of his ticket.
I have argued previously that an employer should shoulder legitimate on-the-job expenses, as indeed he should, but a speeding ticket is not a legitimate expense; it's a penalty for lawbreaking, and one your supervisor should pay himself.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
How to Improvise in Afghanistan? Don't Ask

BYLINE:  By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
WHEN directors talk about their most valued crew members, "our fixer" is not usually on the list. But an anonymous fixer is a central figure when Michael Winterbottom describes filming "In This World," an exceptionally realistic fiction about two Afghan refugees living in Pakistan who try to make their way to England. The adolescent Jamal and his older cousin Enayatullah are played by nonactors -- real-life refugees also named Jamal and Enayatullah -- and getting them from Pakistan to the film's many locations and back again involved hair-raising, quasi-legal maneuvers.
 "Our fixer took them to Kabul to get an Afghan passport" at first, Mr. Winterbottom said. "It was very complicated to work out whether they should try and get an Afghan passport or they should just get a fake Pakistani passport. But we certainly wanted to be as legal as possible." 
 Sometimes that was possible, sometimes not. Technically, he said, getting a legitimate passport meant smuggling them into Kabul because the border was closed: "So we got them across to Kabul. They got passports there. It wasn't really clear to us how they got passports or where they got passports from." As the production traveled through Iran and on to Turkey, France and England, there were bribes and more documents whose origins were better left unknown. 
It takes no time at all to get this information because Michael Winterbottom talks really really fast. Apart from Martin Scorsese, he may be the fastest-talking director in the English-speaking world. And this is on a day last month when, he admits, "I'm slightly sleepy."
The past four days had taken him from the Venice International Film Festival home to London, then this brief afternoon stop in New York on his way to the Toronto International Film Festival, where his two latest works would be shown: "In This World" (which won the Golden Bear this year in Berlin and opened in theaters on Friday) and "Code 46" (to be released next year), a love story set in an Orwellian future, in which Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton have an affair that actually violates the law.
He does look as if he's just awakened from a nap when he answers the door to a hotel room in bare feet and a gray T-shirt, but there's no place to nap in this bleak room set up for a meeting. As he sits at a table with his head on his hand, it's 3 p.m. in New York, 8 p.m. in London, and even he can't tell what time on his body clock. "Last week was a very bizarre week because most nights I got no sleep at all," he said. "My body clock is just waiting."
This pace helps explain how he has made 11 films in eight years, but it doesn't hint at the artistic richness and stylistic range of his work. At 42, he is one of the most accomplished and adventurous directors of his generation. If he is not as well known as he should be, that is partly bad marketing -- his films play so much better than descriptions make them sound -- and partly because it's easier to peg a director who has a signature style. Mr. Winterbottom's work has ranged from a Thomas Hardy adaptation ("Jude," 1996) to a harrowing drama about journalists covering the Bosnian war ("Welcome to Sarajevo," 1997) to the exuberantly hilarious "24-Hour Party People" (2002), about 80's Manchester bands.
His most inventive and by far his most comic film, "24-Hour Party People" is a true word-of-mouth movie. It sounds obscure, yet it works even for an audience with no interest in post-punk bands and no knowledge of figures who are better known in England: Tony Wilson, the impresario of Factory records, and Steve Coogan, the comedian who plays him. As Wilson postures self-importantly for the camera, mock-documentary style, the satire is howlingly funny. And Mr. Winterbottom slyly suggests how the era has already been mythologized.
If he has a signature style, it is an emotional restraint that made earlier films like "Jude" too cold but lends immense power to more recent ones like "The Claim" (2000). Transplanting Hardy's "Mayor of Casterbridge" to the California gold rush sounds like a stunt, but "The Claim" is one of Mr. Winterbottom's strongest works. Peter Mullan (now known as the director of "The Magdalene Sisters") conveys deeply buried feelings as a man who sold his wife and child for a gold claim and is tortured by secret guilt when they reappear.
Such restraint is carefully orchestrated. That becomes evident when Mr. Winterbottom discusses another subject entirely: music in his films. Michael Nyman composed a lush score for "Wonderland" (1999), an exquisitely observed story that follows three grown sisters through a weekend of the ordinary events -- dating, marital spats -- that define a life. Mr. Winterbottom said: "I didn't want any of the characters to ever express their emotions in dialogue. That is, they would talk to each other like people normally talk to each other. But I thought perhaps the music could give you access to their emotions."
Yet even this emotional calibration does not provide a simple signature. Instead, there is a web of connections among Winterbottom films. A quasi-documentary style is used sparingly in "Welcome to Sarajevo," which dramatizes everyday violence with terrifying immediacy: members of a wedding party are shot by snipers as they walk down the street, all the time filmed by the movie's fictional journalists.
That super-realism -- fiction with a documentary feel -- entirely shapes "In This World," which gives viewers intimate access to a journey that is usually no more than an abstraction or a headline. Mr. Winterbottom and the screenwriter, Tony Grisoni, provided a skeleton story, but the film was largely improvised by its cast of nonprofessionals, and was shot with a bare-bones crew of a digital cameraman and a sound person.
"The idea was not to get nonprofessionals to act," Mr. Winterbottom said. "It was to get people to sort of be themselves in the film, especially with Jamal and Enayatullah. We tried to never tell them what to do, never told them they had to say this or that, or that they had to be happy or sad or whatever. We just told them, get on the bus or get in the lorry or sit in your room. That was the limit of the directing."
Playing down his role -- crediting the composer, the casting director, the fixer -- quickly emerges as one of Mr. Winterbottom's traits. But it's not that easy to get people to behave naturally on camera, and "In This World" is astonishingly naturalistic, as the streetwise Jamal tells jokes and bribes authorities. Later he and Enayatullah are crammed into an airless storage container with other refugees for a 40-hour trip by sea.
Mr. Winterbottom said: "The shop you see Enayatullah working in is the shop that he works in, the family that you see is his family. When Jamal says goodbye to his little brother, it is his little brother and so on." But he emphasized: "It is fiction. The journey is organized."
The film was inspired by his belief that economic refugees and political refugees should be treated alike. He said: "People who come to try and seek asylum are obviously driven by the need to get away from where they are. All the people we met who'd done it, none of them were there doing it because they liked the pop music or they liked the culture or the clothes or the freedom. It was because they couldn't really survive where they were." Yet nothing in his manner suggests a political firebrand. As in his work, in conversation his passion and energy are understated.
And he refuses to see his nonstop moviemaking as extraordinary. "It's not hard to make a film a year," he says. He has a regular group of collaborators, including the writer Frank Cottrell Boyce. With his producing partner, Andrew Eaton, he has a company, Revolution Films, whose streamlined approach gives him freedom. He said, "We decided O.K., let's not try to look for too much money and let's not bother working with stars and that will make it a lot simpler." The system isn't perfect. He had been planning to direct "Freedomland," from the Richard Price novel, for the producer Scott Rudin. But, Mr. Winterbottom said, "we couldn't agree on the casting."
That glitch has not created the gap it would for most directors. By November, he hopes to be making his next film in the Arctic. Along the way he has somehow found time for a life that includes two small daughters. And later this week he is scheduled to be in Spain at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, where a Winterbottom retrospective will include the first film he ever directed, a television documentary about Ingmar Bergman. That project inspired him to make films simply and fast. He said: "When I started working on the documentary I thought I'd seen a lot of Bergman films because I'd seen maybe a dozen. But then you immediately realize, this is a guy who made 50 films. And besides doing 50 films, he also wrote them and he co-produced 300 or 400 plays and he ran a major theater company. So this was someone who was really busy."

3 Airlines Find Room For First-Class Seating

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THE economy may be having a hard time taking off, but first-class seating, which has been diminishing with the rise of no-frills carriers, junior jets and the resurgence of turboprops, is an important part of plans by one domestic airline to improve efficiency and by two others to attract more high-fare customers.
 On its shuttles between New York and both Boston and Washington, US Airways will convert its Airbus 319's, which now have 124 coach seats, to a configuration with 12 first-class seats and 108 coach seats. The first reconfigured shuttle will fly Oct. 6 between La Guardia and Boston, and all US Airways shuttle aircraft should be converted by Oct. 26, the airline said. 
 The airline already offers first class on its shuttles that fly direct between Boston and Reagan Airport near Washington. 
 While US Airways will sell first-class seats for a premium, which has yet to be established, tweaking extra revenue from people willing to pay for firstclass is not the reason for the change, said David Castelveter, an airline spokesman. Most of the first-class seats, he said, are used by frequent fliers. The airline wants the flexibility of being able to switch planes on the shuttle runs with others in its fleet. The word "Shuttle," painted prominently on the fuselage of 15 planes, may eventually disappear. The change will also allow a switch to Airbus 320 and 321 planes, which have more seats, when demand is high.
 Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, said he doubted that first-class seating would enable US Airways to cut into the market share of Delta and American Eagle, which also operate Northeast Corridor shuttles. "This is about synchronizing their fleet, not another of the costly shuttle wars we have seen in the past in an attempt to win customers," he said.
 Neither Delta nor American Eagle plans any change in its service as a result of the US Airways decision to add first class, spokesmen for the carriers said.
 On the West Coast, Alaska Airlines has decided to keep first class in most of its fleet of 108 planes, which fly primarily to cities between Alaska and Baja California. It also flies from Seattle to six East Coast airports: Boston, Newark, Washington-Dulles, Reagan, Orlando and Miami.
 In June the airline studied how to lower costs per seat mile to compete with discount airlines Southwest, JetBlue and America West. Tom Romary, Alaska Airlines vice president for marketing, said the study showed that first class inspires loyalty among its most frequent fliers. 
 "We think it is really important to keep first class and we are finding ways to make it more effective without damaging relationships with our most important customers," he said. "But we also recognize that we need to find ways to generate higher average prices for seats in the first-class cabin, so we are making some changes."
 The plan is to focus upgrades on frequent fliers who pay the highest fares, he said. Travelers on deeply discounted fares, even in its top frequent-flier tier, will not be offered immediate upgrades when they book flights. Only about one in 10 customers in first class pays the premium fare, he said, and the airline wants frequent fliers paying either full coach or only slightly discounted fares to get more of the first-class seats.
 Alaska Airlines hopes that keeping first class, and meal service on longer flights, should help it against discount competitors America West, JetBlue and especially Southwest.
 America West, which is based in Phoenix, is the only carrier offering first class on junior, or regional, jets -- on 16 of its 34 Canadair Regional Jets, which typically are all coach with two seats on each side of the aisle. The first-class section consists of two rows with two seats on one side and one on the other. The planes seat 64 or 80 passengers in all.
 "We offer first class on longer regional jet routes, from Phoenix to Long Beach, Calif., El Paso, Des Moines, San Antonio and Memphis," said Amber Heule, a spokeswoman. "We are catering to our business travelers, lots of whom look for first-class service."
 She said that the airline uses the regional jets in some places to develop markets that it hopes it can convert to larger planes, and in other cases to add service during off-peak hours, where the availability of first class builds loyalty among business customers who need to work while flying. 
 Its Canadair first-class seats are 20 inches wide. Most airlines list their Canadair Regional Jet coach seats as a smidgen more than 17 inches wide.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Airlines Sold On Selling Food

BYLINE:  By BARRY ESTABROOK; BARRY ESTABROOK contributes frequently to the Travel section.

 BODY:
JOSH DICKEY, who lives in Brooklyn, took an early evening Northwest Airlines flight this summer from New York to Minneapolis. While he sat in the boarding area, the gate attendant announced that meal service would be available on the three-hour flight -- for $7. To Mr. Dickey, it sounded like a better option than wolfing down a hot dog from a vendor in the terminal.
 "It didn't faze me to have to pay for it," he said. "I know airlines are struggling and have to find ways to stop losing money." 
 But Mr. Dickey was seated about three-quarters of the way back in the plane, and after serving passengers directly in front of him, the attendant announced apologetically that the meals had run out. 
 "I just shoved my wallet back in my pocket in disgust," Mr. Dickey said. "But some of the passengers behind me became quite vocal. There was almost a mutinous feeling."
 Airline officials and industry watchers say that buying meals on airplanes is here to stay, but as Mr. Dickey's experience shows, the concept is very much a work in progress.
 "The airlines are walking along a narrow ledge," said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a consumer group based in Washington. "The question is whether it's going to be economically feasible for the airlines and the caterers. Therehas to be enough food on the flight to satisfy those who want meals, but if you have a lot of food left over, you have to toss it out at the end of the flight."
 The difficulty of maintaining the balance between too much and too little food has kept buy-on-board meals grounded at some airlines. America West tested the idea in January and February, but has yet to decide whether to roll out the program. Wide swings in the percentage of passengers on a given flight who bought meals -- anywhere between 8 and 80 percent -- made it difficult to determine how much to have aboard, according to Janice Monahan, a spokeswoman for the company. 
 "We do not want to have a situation where we run out of food and cause passengers to complain," she said. 

A Tempting Idea
 But to most airlines, strapped and besieged by complaints from hungry customers, the idea of selling food is too tempting to resist. 
 On July 1, US Airways became the first major airline to sell meals in coach class on most flights over 700 miles -- about a quarter of its departures. Song, the discount carrier operated by Delta, offers the service on all its flights, and Midwest Airlines has been doing so on most since April. On July 16, Northwest expanded a trial program to 135 of its domestic flights, from 64.
 Most of the other major airlines and some commuter airlines are conducting trials of selling food, with the notable exception of Continental, where meals are still offered free. 
 Selling food on board was first explored in late 2002 by LSG Sky Chefs, the large airline caterer. The company commissioned a study of 450 frequent fliers and found that 73 percent said they would be willing to buy a quality meal on a plane if a free one was not offered. 
 "Most of our domestic carriers had pulled food off short-haul flights -- less than three or four hours," said Dalene Nichols, LSG's vice president for corporate communications for the Americas. "We were seeing that passengers were not happy. They were on a plane for three hours and all they got was peanuts." 
 The first tests were conducted in January. Ms. Nichols said that LSG's food is for sale on 500 domestic flights a day.
 In August, US Airways' In-flight Cafe offered two choices, both for $10. The Club Mex Sandwich -- smoked turkey with pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomatoes on a challah roll with ancho chili lime mayonnaise -- came with a tomato, artichoke and mozzarella salad, potato chips, a chocolate truffle cookie and spring water. The Classic Chicken Caesar Salad -- strips of rosemary chicken on a bed of romaine lettuce topped with tomatoes, shredded parmesan cheese and sourdough croutons -- was served with Asiago herb flat bread, the same cookie and water. The $7 breakfast consisted of coffee crumb cake, honeydew and mandarin orange salad, yogurt with granola and spring water.
 Passengers with special needs, however, were left to fend for themselves. In-Flight Cafe offered no kosher, low-sodium or vegetarian options in coach class. And on Sept. 4, Continental discontinued serving special meals on non-transcontinental flights within the United States and Canada and on flights to and from Caribbean and Latin American resort destinations. 

Enlisting Familiar Names
 To differentiate the new meals from those passengers used to get free, LSG entered into licensing agreements with such high-profile food purveyors as Einstein Bros, D'Amico & Sons, T.G.I. Friday's and Wolfgang Puck Express. But while a dish on a flight might carry a familiar brand name, it is prepared by LSG cooks in LSG kitchens,and is not exactly the same as in a restaurant. 
 "We were very aware of the quality issue, and worked closely with LSG's research and development department," said Greg Powell, vice president for business development for New World Restaurant Group, which owns Einstein Bros, a deli-style chain. In-flight Cafe meals aboard US Airways carry the Einstein name. 
 "They have some of the same components as the dishes we sell," Mr. Powell said. "But LSG knows the palates of the customer on an airplane."
How good is the food? The answer varies. 
 "We tested the In-flight Cafe concept in a couple of markets in early March and the feedback was very favorable," said Sherry Groff, vice president for in-flight operations at US Airways.
 Each In-flight Cafe customer also receives a survey in the box containing the meal. Ms. Nichols of LSG said that 90 percent of respondents rated their meals good or very good and that 65 percent said they would buy one again.
 Although random comments on Web sites can make no claim of scientific validity, the opinions expressed on www.airlinemeals.net are not so cheery. The two reviews of US Airways In-flight Cafe service on the site the last week of August were decidedly cool, with one passenger reporting that his meal was "better suited to a low-budget picnic." 
 Greg Rosenthal, who has sampled In-flight Cafe service on several US Airways flights between Philadelphia and Fort Lauderdale, said: "It's edible, but there's not a lot of it. At $10, it's a rip-off." 
 Long-haul fliers need to eat something, as Mr. Rosenthal, a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder, discovered when he found himself on a flight from Philadelphia to Denver with nothing to eat but a bag of pretzels from the drink cart. He now makes it a point to eat before he boards a plane. 
 "In Philly, there's a nice fast-food restaurant in the terminal." he said. "If I'm flying coach, I just go there and get myself a pretty good meal -- for about 6 bucks."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Northern Vermont

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS; MARIAN BURROS is a food columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
Sometime between mid-September and mid-October Vermont's short but brilliant foliage season brings the leaf peepers, a name given to us flatlanders who come to marvel at nature's last great performance of the year. 
 I've been watching summer turn into fall for almost a decade in northern Vermont, and I'm partial to it because so much of the region is uninhabited; on a clear day from Jay Peak, just a few miles from the Canadian border, you can see all the way to Montreal. The timing is a bit tricky: foliage season does not start at the same time every year, and some seasons last longer than others. But, whenever it is, www.vermontvacation.com and (800) 837-6668 can provide up-to-date information. 
 The trees in northern areas and at the highest elevations are the earliest to change and should peak in late September, early October. The area northeast of Burlington offers some of the most spectacular viewing away from crowds. Farms and cows still outnumber houses, and you can go for miles on two-lane roads, paved and dirt, before passing much more than a general store. There are no fancy hotels, just enough charming B&B's to rest your head, and delightful country restaurants. 
This summer I spent several weekends crisscrossing the top of the state from the hamlet of Lowell, not quite in the middle of the northern reaches, west to Isle La Motte, part of the chain of islands in Lake Champlain. And beyond the incomparable Jay Peak vistas, you can hardly go wrong no matter where you travel.
For example, from Lowell, Route 58 runs northwest on nine miles of dirt route through the blaze of glory known as Hazen's Notch and a spectacular allee of trees on the way to Montgomery Village. From there, heading northwest on Route 118 to East Berkshire and Route 105 through Enosburg Falls takes you through the kind of countryside for which Vermont is renowned: acres of grazing land, complete with black and white cows, and blazing mountains in the distance, the evergreens a counterpoint to the yellows of birches and beeches, the reds of maples and white ash. 

Events
The Apple Fest and Craft Show, Oct. 11 and 12, on Grand Isle in South Hero, (802) 372-8400, is quintessential Vermont with crafts, a flea market, petting zoo, cider-pressing contest and plenty of food, especially apples; there will be antiques and collectibles, plants and gift certificates for shops and events at the Grand Isle Rotary Auction. 
Spinning, weaving, shearing, sheep-dog-herding skills and a llama obstacle course will be demonstrated at the Sheep and Wool Festival; also on hand will be alpacas, angora rabbits and 60 craftspeople; Oct. 4 and 5 at the Champlain Valley Exposition, on Route 15 in Essex Junction, just outside Burlington; (802) 446-3325; www.vermontsheep.org; $5; $1 for children.
The Exposition in Essex will also be the site of the Vermont Foliage Antiques Show and Sale Oct. 4 and 5 with more than 50 dealers. Admission: $5; children under 16 free.
The Vermont Symphony Orchestra Masterworks Series begins Oct. 11 at the Flynn Center in Burlington with Jaime Laredo conducting and performing as soloist in the Rorem Violin Concerto; the program also includes the Ravel Piano Concerto for Left Hand with Gary Grafmann as soloist. Ticket information: (802) 863-5966 or www.vso.org; $6 to $42. 
From Oct. 16 to 20, the Vermont International Film Festival presents socially conscious independent films at various places in Burlington; (802) 660-2600; www.vtiff.org. Tickets are $7 to $10. 
The Essex Fall Craft and Fine Arts show will be held at the Champlain Valley Exposition Oct. 24 to 26; www.vtcrafts.com. Admission: $7; children under 12, $2.

Sightseeing
Take the tram to the top of 3,800-foot Jay Peak for an incomparable view, on a very clear day, of Montreal, Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks, Franconia Notch and Mount Washington in New Hampshire and Mount Mansfield in Stowe, Vt. The flaming orange-red of the sugar bushes (maples) seems particularly intense up there. Jay Peak Tram Rides, Route 242, Jay, (800) 451-4449; www.jaypeakresort.com. The tram runs daily through Oct. 13, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., weather permitting; $10; $6 for ages 14 and under.
On the way to Jay Peak from Burlington, along Route 15 between Jeffersonville and Johnson, there are enough antiques stores to keep you busy for several hours, and if maple syrup is more to your taste, the Vermont Maple Outlet is on Route 15 a mile west of Jeffersonville; (802) 644-5482; www.vermontmapleoutlet.com. A pint is $5.50 to $7.95 depending on the grade; for the most intense maple flavor, choose grade B or dark amber. 
Also on the way to Jay Peak, along Route 109, there are five covered bridges between Waterville and Belvidere Center. If that whets your appetite for these symbols of New England, there are seven more covered bridges just outside Montgomery Village; a map pinpointing them can be found at the historical society at Pratt Hall in the village, open on weekends; the maps are free.
Another choice route takes you through the islands of Lake Champlain. The foliage color is not as intense as at higher altitudes, but the views from the water's edge are spectacular. Along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge, 371 North River Street (Route 78), in Swanton, (802) 868-4781, www. northeast.fws.gov, encompassing 6,600 acres of wetlands, offers hunting, fishing, boating and nature trails. It is home to bald eagles, osprey and kingfishers. From early October into November, the refuge is along the migration route of 25,000 birds and waterfowl. National Wildlife Refuge Week is Oct. 12 to 18, with refuge tours and birding programs. 
Hyde Log Cabin (circa 1783), Route 2, Grand Isle, thought to be one of the oldest log cabins in America, is filled with artifacts. It is open Thursday to Monday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., until Oct. 12; information (802) 828-3051.
For a more solitary view of fall foliage, get out on the lake. Narrated cruises are operated by Lake Champlain Shoreline Cruises from Burlington Boat House, College Street; (802) 862-8300; www.soea.com. Ninety-minute cruises leave every two hours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. until Oct. 19; $9.95 a person. And Winds of Ireland conducts sailing cruises until Oct. 15 from the Community Boat House on College Street; (800) 458-9301; www.windsofireland.net. A two-hour sail is $30 a person.
You can take a side trip to Isle La Motte and the Samuel de Champlain statue and St. Anne's Shrine, site of the first European settlement in Vermont, or try kayaking on the lake from Grand Isle. Mountain Lake Expeditions, North Hero House, Route 2 on Grand Isle, offers kayaking with a guide at $50 for half day or $25 a person unaccompanied; (802) 777-7646. 
The brand-new ECHO at the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain, 1 College Street on the lake in Burlington, (802) 864-1848, www.echovermont.org, features an aquarium and an interactive science center that is marvelous for children. Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $9; $6 for children.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
On the Big Island, Hilo Is the Perfect Rainy-Day Place

BYLINE:  By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
BEFORE I arrived in Hilo, Hawaii, I considered myself to be a connoisseur of rain. I figured I had seen just about every sort of wet weather on my travels, from warm afternoon thundershowers in the Caribbean to ankle-deep monsoon downpours in Bangkok and damp chilly drafts of London in March.
 But in Hilo, the rain is amazing. It comes and goes, the weather sometimes changing from wet to dry within seconds. In July, during four days there, I woke up one morning to a depressing overhead canvas of gray and white clouds stretching across the sky. A persistent drizzle played percussion on the windshield of my rental car. 
 Say goodbye to the scenic drive, hello to museums and thrift shopping for hula girl lamps and Hawaiian shirts, right? Wrong. Forty minutes later, the sky was azure, the sun ferocious. 
 The small, old-fashioned city of Hilo is on the east coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, in a perfect position to catch the clouds that form when the warm, moist Pacific Ocean trade winds hit the long, cool slopes of Mauna Loa. The accordionlike folds and grooves of the jewel-green slopes and the uneven coastline and fluctuating ocean temperatures ensure that clouds meander around Hilo as unpredictably as ghost spirits. One day, around noon, I was walking down a sunny street in Hilo, worried because I'd left the sunscreen back in the room. Then I glanced across the street: the other side was shady and bathed in a vaporous mist.
 I soon grew to love Hilo rain. It is a reason this city of around 50,000 has remained largely untouched since the days when it was the thriving center of the Big Island's plantation economy in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Kona area, on the west coast of the Big Island, has become a major Hawaiian tourist draw, Hilo remains sleepy and mostly condo-free -- few are enticed to build in an area that typically receives measurable rain 278 days of the year. 
 As for resorts, Hilo doesn't have any; only a handful of somewhat faded old Holiday Inn-type hotels. (The one I spent a night in, the Hilo Hawaiian, had 70's-style lamps fit for eBay, and a kitschy plastic doorknob sign: "Maid, Please Have This Room Made Up Wiki-Wiki").
 Hilo's walkable downtown, with its Art Deco buildings and renovated five-and-dime-store facades housing Salvation Army and independent thrift shops, is a time capsule of pre-World War II Hawaiiana. At the Pacific Tsunami Museum, you can see in the old gray and sepia-toned photographs illustrating the exhibits about the tsunami that devastated Hilo in 1946 that the main street doesn't look much different from the actual street outside; only the cars have changed. The Tsunami Museum is a good place to start exploring the city, to get a sense of the precariousness of life in a place where 50-foot waves have been known to roll in and sweep entire neighborhoods away. (The last tsunami hit Hilo in 1960; a sophisticated warning system now keeps the city's residents relatively safe from disaster.)
 I rolled into Hilo from the airport on a Thursday afternoon and almost immediately had a little adventure, the first of many, big and small. Losing my way going to my motel in a confusion of one-way streets, I passed a grand old building with enormous two-story windows, in which I could see people sitting at linen-covered tables eating.
 The idea of a leisurely lunch hit all my buttons. I finally found my motel, the Dolphin Bay Hotel, nearby, dropped my gear in the room (which was big, a bit dark, but had a kitchenette with a fridge and stove), and walked to the restaurant. 
 At 2:30, they were still serving lunch -- and what a lunch. I had stumbled into Kaikodo, an outpost of fine dining with an award-winning chef opened just two months before by Howard and Mary Ann Rogers, who are also New York art dealers. The eclectic, Orient-inspired decor included one of those Chinese wooden bed chambers with a roof and walls, so I ordered the most Asian-sounding things on the pan-Pacific menu of the chef Mike Fennelly. 
 The spring rolls, stuffed with big fresh chunks of white mahi-mahi, were crisp and light. A main course called Szechuan chicken turned out to be a Hawaiian interpretation, tangy and sweet rather than fiery, with toasted macadamia nuts replacing peanuts, and a side of coconut rice adding tropical sweetness. 
 The best part of the meal was the hot lava cake dessert, a tribute to the nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, with its lava flows. On the plate, a miniature warm flourless chocolate tort was accompanied by a side of white "smoke" -- coconut ice cream -- and a drizzle of red "lava" -- raspberry sauce. A fine lunch, in Hilo, came to $37, including two glasses of wine.
 The small adventure of eating a volcano was a teaser for the larger adventure of actually visiting one. The Hilo area's most popular local attraction is Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, a 40-minute drive from the city. At the park, the parade begins at Chain of Craters Road, a narrow lane that abruptly ends about a mile and a half shy of the lava flow.
 I parked alongside about 100 other cars at the end of the road, and headed down the path about an hour before dusk, the time the rangers recommend for the best lava viewing. After about a half mile the path ends, and you must begin walking inland across what is surely one of the bleakest landscapes on earth: a graphite black, bubbly mound of rocks stretching in all directions. Approaching this field, a smell of sulfurous emissions assaults the throat and tear ducts, while ominous plumes of smoke rise in the distance. 
 Park rangers are everywhere, to make sure that visitors follow the marked path and don't wander astray on the lava field. (I'd prepared for the mile hike across the field as instructed in the visitors' guide, wearing hiking boots and carrying a liter of water, and was shocked to see that most of my fellow walkers were wearing light trainers, and that some were carrying small infants in backpacks).
 At the end of this infernal trail, thepayoff was a view, from about 150 yards distant, of narrow rivers of orange lava -- I counted five -- bursting from black rock like the streams of a waterfall. I watched it, transfixed, until the smoke and fumes became too much.
 My home base in Hilo changed every night, because I had accidentally chosen one of Hilo's busiest weekends to visit, during the town's annual Big Island Music Festival (formerly the Slack Key Music Festival). But each of my Hilo hosts whose inns were full hospitably helped me find a lodging for the following night in the city's network of terrific bed-and-breakfast operations, with rooms costing an average of $95 a night. Private homes, like the Bay House Bed and Breakfast, have been built to house overnight guests, with enormous rooms, designer furniture, private baths -- and in the case of my room at Bay House, a private balcony overlooking Hilo Bay.
 The next night I ended up at the Inn at Kulaniapia Falls, another large home with a huge property that includes a river and two waterfalls (my room, decorated in Chinese antiques, overlooked the larger one). 
 The temptation was to just hang out in my splendid Hilo accommodations, watching the rain come and go, contemplating waterfalls or seascapes from my balcony, heading out for meals at Kaikodo or to the excellent sushi bar I discovered in the Nihon Restaurant and Cultural Center. But there was more to see. 
 Early one morning, I set out on a driving expedition north of Hilo, along the section of coastline known as Hamakua, until quite recently a string of sugar plantations. The small settlements along the 45-mile stretch of coastal highway (dubbed the Hamakua Heritage Coast) have the feel of company towns, with their one-stop, wooden-fronted general stores, tiny low cottages and plantation manager's "mansions."
 Near the start of the route, which ends precipitously at a cliff overlooking the broad, green Waipio Valley, is one of the lushest, most beautiful tropical botanical gardens I have ever visited. The Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden in Papaikou, at $15 admission, is also one of the most expensive, but worth it for its dizzying collection of palms and orchids, and thickets of rich red hanging heliconia. The jungle paths descend to black rocks and crashing ocean. Lucky visitors (I wasn't) catch glimpses of turtles cavorting on the shore.
 HONOKAA, the largest town on the route, felt full of ghosts, with its Wild West-style wooden storefronts. Most of them now house antiques and collectibles stores, rather than the dry goods and food supplies that met the needs of Honokaa's original population of migrant Japanese, Filipino and Puerto Rican workers in plantation days. Yet the everyday Japanese household items in the shops, from porcelain tea pots to ivory chopsticks, hinted at the past. And shortly after lunching at an "Italian" restaurant where the cook spoke Spanish and played salsa tapes of Celia Cruz, who had died the day before, I walked on Honokaa's main street and saw a man with a bata drum decorated with a red, blue and white Puerto Rican flag.
 On my last afternoon in Hilo, I went to the music festival at Hilo's civic center, which resembles a high school gym. Sitting in the bleachers, I leaned back with the locals, eating my $1 bento box lunch (sold at a booth alongside hamburgers and fried poi balls), and listening to Big Island musicians pluck the gentle guitar sounds of what may be the most mellow music in America. As the guitarists played, their music mingled with the soft fall of a passing rain: perfect. 
 I enjoyed the Hilo moment, because I knew that any minute now the weather would change.

The bottom line
 I spent an average of $144.60 a day on lodging, food and activities during four days and nights in Hilo in July.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Bedford-Stuyvesant; 
Brownstones by the Tree-Lined Block

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
TWO colonial villages, Bedford and Stuyvesant, long ago merged to form one Brooklyn neighborhood, but in some ways, the place that took both villages' names remains two communities, represented by $500,000 brownstones to the south and public housing towers in the north.
 It is a neighborhood with 200 block associations and more than a dozen well-attended churches, but the crime rate, though having dropped dramatically, continues to be higher than in most of the rest of the city. And most of the neighborhood's schools perform below citywide averages. 
 "Bedford-Stuyvesant is like a tale of two cities in itself," said City Councilman Albert Vann, a lifelong resident whose district takes in most of the neighborhood. "You have college graduates and professors, and people of low income and the indices that they impact: health, lack of educational achievement, unemployment and so forth." 
Bedford Stuyvesant's most exclusive blocks, tree-lined rows of century-old brownstones, contrast with Gates Avenue in the middle of the area, which is lined with decades-old low-income housing. "Bedford-Stuyvesant is both middle-income and very poor, depending on what part you happen to experience," Councilman Vann said. 
In recent years, the neighborhood's desirable blocks have attracted homebuyers who say they feel that the area has an unduly negative image. "The reputation was that it was a rough area," said Rondai Evans, 32, an ophthalmologist who bought a Decatur Street brownstone a year ago, "but when you actually walk around and actually know people, it's mostly families and homeowners, families who have owned homes for years and years."
The neighborhood's tough reputation stems in part from street crime. While 16 felony assaults were reported for each 10,000 people in New York City this year as of Sept. 7, 41 were reported for each 10,000 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to a comparison of data from the Police Department with 2000 census population figures for the neighborhood. While the reports of more serious crimes such as murder, rape and robbery are statistically low and have generally been declining, all have been reported twice as often in Bedford-Stuyvesant as in the city as a whole this year. 
The number of major street crimes reported in the 79th police precinct, which covers the portion of the neighborhood west of Marcus Garvey Boulevard, has dropped 66 percent since 1993, while those reported in the 81st Precinct, to the east, have declined by 61 percent during that time.
With the drop in crime and rising housing prices all over the city, outsiders are looking more closely at the neighborhood. "Bedford-Stuyvesant has been rediscovered by both black and white folks who are looking to purchase and/or rehabilitate," Councilman Vann said. "The trend has always been for people who do well to move out to Queens, Long Island, Staten Island. But for the last 10 years or less, the trend has been reversed."
Among the draws are well-preserved brownstones that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars less than similar ones closer to Manhattan. Along many long blocks of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the three- and four-story row houses -- sometimes with limestone or brick facades -- seem to continue forever.
Bedford-Stuyvesant's working- and middle-class history makes it more desirable for some. "The Upper East Side went through an affluent change," said Everett H. Ortner, a Park Slope resident who is chairman of the Brownstone Revival Coalition, a preservationist group. "They could afford to modernize the brownstones there, which means gut them and make palazzos out of them. You see so many of them that have been destroyed."
But Bedford-Stuyvesant never had an alteration boom. "The houses have substantially stayed the same," Mr. Ortner said. "Where there are good streets, the houses are really first-quality."
Many blocks in the south of the neighborhood, including those in and near the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District, have well-preserved rows of brownstones similar to those in Fort Greene, Park Slope or Boerum Hill. Farther to the north, scattered fully-intact brownstone blocks are interspersed among blocks with fewer brownstones and a greater number of smaller buildings, vacant lots, vinyl-sided buildings and one-story commercial structures or garages.
The brownstones are generally three or four stories tall and were built between 1880 and 1910 as single-family homes, said Brenda Fryson, the president of Brownstoners of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Most have been converted into two- to four-family buildings, with owners most often taking the parlor level and basement and renting out the upper floors. And some have been converted to apartment houses with eight rental units.
ORIGINAL detailing is an important factor in determining the price of a brownstone. The more of it, everything from wainscoting to the detailing and quality of the facade, the more expensive the house, said Irsa Greene, who worked for the Corcoran Group in Bedford-Stuyvesant for three years before starting her own company, Broadband Realty, on Halsey Street. Even more important to price is the extent to which the building needs renovation.
Brownstones that do not need work dominate the high end of the market. Two-family buildings can cost $400,000 to the high $500,000's, while three- or four-family brownstones can bring $650,000. Ms. Greene said fixer-uppers usually ranged from $300,000 to $350,000. 
"Occasionally you'll find a house that's been abandoned that could sell for $100,000," said Edward C. Atwell, an agent at Atwell Realty on Stuyvesant Avenue. "But you'll probably find it on the market again soon," he added, renovated and priced higher. 
Two-bedroom rentals, typically in brownstones that have been converted to multifamily dwellings, have stagnated in the last year at just over $1,000, said Charles Atwell, owner of the agency, while one-bedroom rentals most often bring $850 to $900.
Real estate agents say that buildings are often sold by word of mouth. "The market is a seller's market," said Edmund Anthony Sadio, owner of Century 21 Achievers in East Flatbush, "but people are holding on. The listings are few and far between." 
That can mean long searches for outsiders seeking a brownstone. Dr. Evans and his wife, Cora Daniels, 31, a writer for Fortune magazine, spent more than a year searching for the right house. They started out looking for a fixer-upper, but eventually settled on an 1890 two-family brownstone in move-in condition for $540,000.
"We had a lot of deals fall through," Dr. Evans said, "so we closed on it quickly."
For area residents with children, finding the right school can take time. "Parents who are aggressive and can devote time to it can certainly find a good school in Bedford-Stuyvesant," said Clara Hemphill, the director of insideschools.org, which rates New York City public schools.
At only one of the neighborhood's 16 public elementary schools, Public School 21 on Chauncey Street, do students perform above the citywide average on math and English standardized tests.
"The neighborhood schools are uneven," Ms. Hemphill said, "but there are options if your child passes an exam to get into a gifted program -- and at middle school and high school the options broaden." There are seven middle schools, all of which reported scores below the citywide averages, but one of the three combined elementary and middle schools, P.S./I.S. 308 on Quincy Street, reported test scores above the citywide average. Neighborhood children most frequently attend Boys and Girls High School on Fulton Street or the Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development in Clinton Hill, Ms. Hemphill said.
The neighborhood also has a number of parochial schools, including St. John the Baptist, a Catholic school serving 525 students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade for a tuition that ranges between $980 and $3,000 per year; Bridge Street Preparatory School, which has 64 students in kindergarten through sixth grade and tuition of $3,000 per year; and the Concord Baptist Elementary School, which has 55 students and serves children up to the sixth grade with tuition of $3,000 per year.
For all the charm of the brownstones, many neighborhood residents say that Bedford-Stuyvesant's friendliness and strong community ties are a greater asset.
Monique Greenwood, 43, a former editor of Essence magazine who moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant from Fort Greene in 1989 and now owns a bed and breakfast on MacDonough Street, described a place where neighbors say hello on the way to work.
"It's almost like a Norman Rockwell picture," she said. "You have kids talking in the street, church bells ringing every hour. The lady across the street is like a grandmother to my daughter."
Ms. Greenwood and her husband, Glenn Pogue, bought a two-family brownstone on Macon Street for $125,000. Two years later, they bought a second brownstone around the corner for a similar price, and sold it this year for $375,000.
Most people consider the neighborhood's boundaries to coincide with those of the area served by Brooklyn Community Board 3, which is defined by Classon Avenue on the west, Atlantic Avenue on the south, Saratoga Avenue on the east and Broadway and Flushing Avenue on the north.
There are 11 public housing projects in the neighborhood, all but one north of Monroe Street. They house about 22,000 people, according to the New York City Housing Authority, or about 15 percent of Bedford-Stuyvesant's overall population.
The neighborhood's hyphenated name, which came to be commonly used by the 1940's, comes from its history, said Pamela Green, executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History, which operates a museum and seeks to teach people about the centuries of African-American history in Brooklyn. The village of Stuyvesant, toward the east of the neighborhood, was more affluent, while the village of Bedford to the west was a larger but less prosperous enclave, she said.
The neighborhood became primarily black during the 1930's and 1940's, Ms. Green said, but there were free black communities in the area dating to the 1700's. The Civil War draft riots, in which blacks were attacked in many parts of Manhattan, were a seminal point in the area's history.
"People came to Brooklyn for safe haven," she said. "That automatically implies that within Brooklyn there were communities of African-Americans that were established enough that people knew they would be safe if they came here."
Now, Bedford-Stuyvesant is the most populous predominantly black neighborhood in the five boroughs. Ms. Greene, the real estate agent, said her white clients sometimes sheepishly asked her how neighbors would feel if they moved in. "There will always be someone who's against it," she said she tells them, "but for the most part you'll find warmth."
As more people seek housing in the neighborhood, many hope that it will shed its tarnished image. "A lot of people rely on very old negative stereotypes of Bedford-Stuyvesant," said Ms. Greenwood, the B&B owner, "and it's so far from that."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Lower Manhattan; 
Underused Office Towers Are Becoming Apartments

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE cycle has turned again. With demand for office space soft in Lower Manhattan and with little prospect of a major improvement soon, developers are busy on projects to convert office towers into residential buildings, aided by tax-free financing provided by the federal government.
 The last time this happened was in the mid-1990's, when the shift of some major financial institutions from downtown to Mid-town left some venerable office buildings vacant. Some real estate executives, pronouncing them "functionally obsolete," said their only future was as residences. 
 As the demand for office space increased toward the end of the decade, some of them did not look as obsolete as before, and some planned conversions were rehabilitated as offices.
The attack of 9/11 drove more finance industry and other companies out of the area, leaving entire buildings vacant. The continuing demand for housing in Manhattan, combined with favorable government financing and incentive programs in the wake of the attack, has encouraged another wave of conversions and new construction.
According to a list compiled by Scott R. Latham, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company, projects under way would add 2,395 housing units to the 16,800 already in the Lower Manhattan area. And projects in the proposal stage would add 3,020 more units. Virtually all the new units would be rentals, as opposed to condominiums or co-ops, as a result of the terms of the federal financing.
In the process, locations like Wall Street, once the symbol of capitalistic commerce, would be turned into mixed-use neighborhoods. The building at 45 Wall Street was converted in the mid-90's to residential use and the one at 55 Wall has become a hotel. Current projects include buildings at 23 and 63 Wall Street.
Nearby John Street is about 75 percent residential now, said Bruce Surry, an executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis, a brokerage and services company. And the tower of the Woolworth Building at 233 Broadway, once the world's tallest office building, is to be converted into 145 residential units by the developer Steven C. Witkoff.
"The office market is soft now, with high vacancies, so residential is more attractive," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. "When the rents for office space increase, as they inevitably will, the pace of conversions will slow."
But he said the success of prior conversions demonstrated that people were willing to live in an area that was once almost completely occupied by businesses. "In 1960, there probably were fewer people living in Lower Manhattan than in 1800," Mr. Weisbrod said. Since then, the residential population has increased, due in part to the proximity to the office buildings.
"Thirty-five percent of the people living in Lower Manhattan walk to work," Mr. Weisbrod said.
Converting office buildings to residential use is an expensive proposition, involving a lot of plumbing, since each apartment needs a kitchen and a bathroom. Mr. Latham estimated the cost to be about $100 to $150 a square foot, compared to the $35 a square foot a landlord might contribute to revamping interior office space. "Not until after 9/11 were there significant incentives to justify development," he said.
The most important of these was federal legislation in 2002 authorizing the issuance of $8 billion in triple-tax-free Liberty Bonds for residential, commercial and utility projects intended to help revive the city's economy in the wake of the attack. Of that, $1.6 billion was set aside for residential construction.
Because they are tax-exempt and the projects they finance are guaranteed by major financial institutions, they pay a lower rate of interest than riskier bonds whose interest payments are subject to taxation.
With the interest and other charges added in, a developer would pay 4 to 4.5 percent for Liberty Bond financing, compared with 6 percent or more for conventional financing, said Ruth Barone, a senior vice president of Carlton Advisory Services, a financial services company. In addition some city real estate taxes can be avoided or delayed as a result of the terms of the financing, Ms. Barone said, increasing the savings.
So far the state has approved about $350 million in Liberty Bonds and the city about $250 million, said Richard Bassuk, president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, another financial services company. The total includes $82 million to convert the old Bank of New York building at 90 Washington Street into 398 apartment units.
The program has proved so popular that "there are enough projects starting their way through the process to use all the remaining bonds," Mr. Bassuk said. Because there has been less demand for the $2 billion in bonds allocated for commercial development outside Lower Manhattan and because the whole Liberty Bond program expires at the end of next year, there have been suggestions that the deadline be extended and some of the commercial allocation be redirected to residential. But that would require a change in the federal law.
And competition for the commercial bonds has heated up. State and local officials have approved $400 million in bonds to help rebuild 7 World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the attack, and $113 million to build an office building in Brooklyn for the Bank of New York, whose operations were also affected by the attack.
More recently, the Bank of America has requested $650 million in Liberty Band financing for a 2.1-million-square-foot tower at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas with the developer Douglas Durst. And Forest City Ratner, another developer, has asked for $400 million in bonds for a 52-story tower it is planning on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Street in partnership with The New York Times Company.
State and city officials have not yet ruled on the requests, but if they are approved there would be a lot less money left for housing.
ALTHOUGH Mr. Weisbrod said it was likely that Lower Manhattan would remain primarily a business district -- "'We are not interested in becoming the Upper East Side," he said -- he added that additional housing would add vitality to an area that was once almost deserted after business hours.
"Each project moves downtown closer to becoming a 24/7 town," said Mr. Latham, who nevertheless questioned whether much of the area had the services, like grocery stores and cleaners, needed by a residential population. "The only pocket of Lower Manhattan that has the infrastructure," he said, "is Battery Park City."
He said the area would be most attractive to "price sensitive" renters fleeing higher rents in other parts of Manhattan. 
As a result, many of the developments have been designed for young, first-time renters, Ms. Barone said, with a large proportion of studio and one-bedroom apartments.
Retail services will develop to meet the needs of residents, Mr. Weisbrod said. "Retail is driven by demand," he said, noting that the largest assemblage of stores in the area was in the now-destroyed World Trade Center complex and that in a nearby neighborhood, "there is a strong restaurant sector in TriBeCa that has been hurt by the loss of workers who were at the Trade Center."

HEADLINE: Space-Age Garages That Save Space 

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
IT lumbered and thudded into existence -- three years late, some still-debated but hefty amount over budget -- but the Hoboken municipal parking garage that opened its robotically controlled doors last year displays a stunning agility. It lifts and carries cars about on computer-controlled steel pallets as if they were delicate ballerinas, moving with precision and speed inside a structure that is remarkably compact.
 While performance tests are still going on, the garage is limited to operating at two-thirds of its full capacity. When all systems are go, however, it will park 324 cars on just a 100-by-100-foot lot. The seven-level garage is 56 feet high, not much higher than the four-story row houses that are its neighbors. 
 "This is amazingly proficient use of space," commented Darius Sollohub, a New Jersey Institute of Technology professor who studies parking and urban land use. "It may provide one of the solutions to the most important conflict in urban design: where do you put all the cars in environments where car volume is high and space is at a premium?" 
Although an automated garage is more expensive to build it typically takes only about half as much precious real estate as a conventional ramped garage to handle the same number of cars, or even more. That is why in European and Asian cities, the automatic garage was long ago anointed as the best solution, Mr. Sollohub said.
The Hoboken structure, designed by Gerhard Haag, an engineer and architect born in Germany, where ramped garages are rare and automatic garages common, is a first-of-its-kind in the United States. There are other automated garages in the country, some dating from the 1950's. But the Hoboken garage -- and another smaller one designed by a different company in a Washington apartment building -- belong to a new generation of fully automated garages that parking industry specialists say is generating new interest. Indeed, Mr. Haag said, there are 67 American cities, including Manhattan, where his company is currently discussing proposals. 
Hoboken's Garden Street Garage is completely computerized, with two identical elevator systems that are able to move simultaneously in both vertical and horizontal directions and communicate with each other by wireless transmitters. The garage's computer figures out which of the hundreds of spaces in the building a vehicle should occupy, and then delivers it there untouched by human hands. 
A monthly parker pulls into one of four driveways at the red-brick building on Garden Street, which on the outside looks pretty much like a group of Hoboken row houses. The driver powers the car forward a few yards onto a steel pallet, maneuvering the wheels between guardrails as instructions appear on an L.E.D. signboard about correct alignment, then turns off the engine and gets out. 
After locking the car, the parker swipes a card in front of a magnetic reader, and while the sign on the wall is flashing a reminder to step back, automatic elevator doors close around the car and it is whisked to a computer-assigned slot.
The computer factors in the vehicle's size when making an assignment, putting larger S.U.V.'s on lower levels. It also takes into account the driver's schedule on previous visits, putting vehicles whose owners enter and exit frequently in the slots that the system can most easily access. 
When the owner returns for the car and swipes the card again, the process begins in reverse. Within seconds, another electronic sign announces at which bay the car will appear, still on the pallet where the parker placed it. In its first year of operation, according to the computer records, the average wait to retrieve a car was 2.5 minutes. 
THE key breakthrough with his type of design, according to Mr. Haag, is that the mechanized system is "truly redundant." With older automated designs, said Mr. Haag, all three movements a car elevator can make -- in and out, up and down, side to side -- are powered by one central unit. If any single part fails, the garage becomes inoperable.
Mr. Haag's patented design has dual systems, so that its two elevators can move separately and independently, and the three types of movements they make are each powered by separate motors. Furthermore, each individual motor has a backup. There are twin motors powering the rollers under the pallets, for example, each working at less than half capacity and programmed to take over if the other should fail.
Besides increasing reliability, notes Dale F. Denda of PMRC, a national parking market research company, the fully automatic garage means "throughput" is enhanced -- parking lingo for shortening the time it takes to store cars and retrieve them.
The one other fully automatic garage in the United States is set beneath the Summit Grand Parc, an apartment building two blocks from the White House in Washington that incorporates both a new apartment tower and historic structure that was once home to the United Mineworkers. Designed by the Spacesaver Parking Company, a division of the Mid-American Elevator Company, and using equipment manufactured by a German concern, Wohr, the garage parks just 74 cars, and has only one automated elevator system.
"But without the automated system," said Michael A. Underwood, a senior vice president of the project's developer, Summit Properties, "we wouldn't have had parking at all. For the kind of luxury apartments we provide, we had to have parking -- but this was a narrow lot between existing buildings, and with a conventional garage, we found ourselves hamstrung by site constraints. Automation provided an option."
Urban land use specialists say that this sort of situation will continue to occur in congested American cities, and that automated parking could become a widely used option. Tomorrow, in fact, a seminar on automated parking is scheduled at the Urban Land Institute, a Washington research institute, using the Summit Grand Parc as a case study.
The Spacesaver company has another 99-car automatic garage that has been approved in Aspen. The company reports additional interest in various Northeastern metropolitan areas, and a spokeswoman said it also had a project under discussion in New York City, although she would not provide details about the site.
The Manhattan site that Mr. Haag is eyeing would involve tearing down an old building and constructing a privately operated 300-car fully automatic garage. 
Monthly rates for parkers would be competitive with those at a conventional garage, said Mr. Haag, "or else the market wouldn't exist." In Hoboken, a standard municipal fee of $200 per month applies, at the automated garage and all others. In Washington, Summit Grand Parc residents pay $225 monthly, and for S.U.V. size spots, $250.
Until very recently, the American way has been to indulge a cultural passion for driving, even in a parking structure, observed Shannon Sanders McDonald, an architect and scholar who is writing two books on the history of parking garages and land use -- one of them with Mr. Haag.
"People love their cars in this country," Ms. McDonald said. "and the car-loving culture is the main reason for the garage typology."
In Europe and Asia, the development history, traffic patterns, and parking "culture" are different, she said, and cities simply are not built to accommodate the hulking presence of a typical ramped structure. There are roughly 5,000 automated garages on those two continents -- including dozens that are fully computerized and robotically operated like the ones in Hoboken and Washington.
Ramped garages are actually very unpopular with many Americans -- "ignored at best," Ms. McDonald said, "hated by many." Why would people loathe a parking garage? Let her count the ways: "They are perceived to be ugly, grimy, scary places where muggers are waiting to snatch purses and wallets, you will probably get your car paint scratched or your fender bent, and you are more than likely to get trapped in a long line of cars spewing exhaust when you're trying to get to the exit." 
Ms. McDonald, an architect who currently serves as an adjunct professor of architecture at North Dakota State University in Fargo, says garages have been made a "scapegoat for urban ills." Yet she and others in the emergent field of scholarly research on parking -- along with entrepreneurs like Mr. Haag -- make a case that automatic garages actually help alleviate some of what ails modern cities, by eliminating the dirty-and-scary factor, and by maximizing land use.
"The main advantage of automated garages," said Mr. Denda, who is the research director for PMRC, which is based in McLean, Va., "is that they can be built on sites that are too small or irregular for the construction of conventional garages." 
Of course, the cost of construction and operation also figure in heavily to a developer's decision to build an automated garage.
IN Baltimore, Ashbourne Properties is considering Mr. Haag's Robotic Parking system for a proposed three-building apartment complex that has street access only 60 feet wide. "It is the only way we could provide on-site parking -- and we are happy to have the option," said Ashbourne's president, Crispin Etherington. 
"The price we have been quoted is $22,000 per space, when conventional parking costs about $15,000 per space. We are studying the economics of our project, and the Baltimore market before deciding which way to go."
Another developer, David Barry of the Applied Companies in Jersey City, said his company recently decided against automated parking for a 12-story apartment structure going up in that city based on cost, and also the general reluctance of lenders to underwrite "something so new, and untested."
Mr. Haag also noted that being on the cutting edge can cause problems for conservative lenders. In his view, the ongoing tests of the structural strength and reliability of the Hoboken garage being done to satisfy the construction bonding company are "really overdoing it." 
But as developers in many metropolitan areas find themselves scrapping over sites they would have considered unbuildable even a year or two ago, Mr. Denda said, automatic parking garage proposals are increasingly coming into play -- and familiarity with the issues they raise will rise.
The four-level automatic garage in Washington, beneath the Summit Grand Parc, occupies a space measuring 60 by 106 feet -- smaller than many suburban yards. It is 32 feet floor-to-ceiling -- shorter than many power poles. 
The Hoboken garage is situated in the middle of a block on a narrow street with metered spaces on both sides and is built on land that required considerable environmental cleanup. 
Mr. Haag said that if a ramped garage could even have been built on the Hoboken site -- which is questionable in his view -- it would have provided only 95 spaces, compared with 324, and construction costs would have run close to $30,000 per space, compared with $20,000.
Precisely what the Hoboken garage cost, and how long it took to build, remain touchy issues in the city -- with the mayor having recently abolished the parking authority after an investigation into how it handled the project, and Mr. Haag's Florida-based company, Robotic Parking Inc., and Belcor -- the company that acted as general contractor -- still locked in legal battle over which one was responsible for construction issues that caused delays.
But Mr. Denda from the parking research company said none of that was particularly surprising. "That's the construction industry," he shrugged, "and in Hoboken, the municipality was involved, which only adds to the complications." 
Seymour Gage, a veteran parking garage engineer from Manhattan, said he finds it difficult to believe one of the new fully automated garages will ever be built in New York.
Mr. Gage, 83, designed two automated garages in the 1950's that are still working today -- as is he. The Showbiz Parking structure in the Manhattan theater district, off Eighth Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets, was built in 1957, Mr. Gage said, using an elevator-on-wheels system devised by an Iowa inventor, Virgil Bowser, and Mr. Gage's engineering know-how. Like other mechanized garages of the era, it requires a staff -- 8 to 10 people during peak hours -- with valets stationed on each floor. 
The new robotic computerized garages are "a totally different animal" from that one, Mr. Gage said. He is currently working as a consultant on construction of a fully automatic garage in Moscow, "which is becoming a hotbed of parking," he said, with hundreds of buildings going up, all with automatic parking structures beneath. 
"Other companies are building in Beijing," Mr. Gage said, "and in Europe, right now a company called Klaus is putting up about 30 -- very similar to the one in Hoboken." 
"We Americans," he added, "are way behind on this, absolutely."
The additional cost of constructing an automated garage is one of the reasons for that, Mr. Gage said. "There is no question that the fully automatic garage is more expensive to build -- maybe 50 to 75 percent more for a small one, 60 spaces or less," he said. 
On the other hand, Mr. Gage said he was recently asked to consult on a proposal for building a large underground automated garage being contemplated in Brooklyn. In that case, he said, a robotic garage would be cheaper -- by 20 percent.
"The main reason is it would be underground," he said. "That is more costly in general. But below ground, automated parking beats self-parking, because of savings on construction. You don't have to go as deep, or as horizontally."
AN industry group formed two years ago in Los Angeles -- the Automated and Mechanical Parking Association -- said the $20,000-per-space cost of an automated garage is a "disadvantage" planners have to consider. On the other hand, Mr. Haag insists that if the cost of land is figured in, an automated garage for 60 cars or more is always less expensive to build than one with the same capacity with ramps.
"Also, when comparing costs, many times it is forgotten," he said, "that our price includes a closed facade, a sprinkler system and a valet parking service." Automatic garages do not require a ventilation system, he pointed out, since the car engine is never running while the car is inside, and no exhaust fumes are generated. No pedestrian elevators, fire doors or emergency staircases are needed either. 
An automated system uses more electrical power, he pointed out -- but is much less labor-intensive. In Hoboken, there are just two young men running the show -- Mr. Haag's son, Constantin, and Filipe Sousa, who oversees the computer system, watching blinking lights on his screen track the movement of cars through the garage, and receiving messages when any motor reaches one million revolutions and needs a maintenance check.
"It's really the garage doing all the work," Mr. Sousa said with a laugh. "We're just along for the ride."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 21 about garages in which cars are parked by automated equipment misstated the type of street parking available near the robotic facility in Hoboken. One side of the street is reserved for residents with permits; on the other side parking is allowed for up to four hours. There are no parking meters on the street.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: Alec Baldwin; 
Living Paycheck to Paycheck (All of Them Big)

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
WHEN Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger married in 1993, they did not sign a prenuptial agreement. "My ex-wife was someone I could never imagine getting divorced from," Mr. Baldwin recalled. "My advisers all told me to get a prenup," he said, but "I thought it was forever. We were very naive."
 The couple divorced last year and are now resolving financial and custody disputes. Mr. Baldwin, the square-jawed, handsome actor who can be unusually combative, said this divorce was one battle he could have skipped. 
 Mr. Baldwin's marital problems have convinced him that all engaged couples need prenuptial agreements, especially when they have significant amounts of money that can become the focus of conflict. He has added that rule to others he tries to follow when he considers his finances, he said. 
Though Mr. Baldwin would not be specific, he has accumulated a large amount of money: perhaps $20 million to $23 million, with about $14 million of that in real estate, according to real estate agents and people close to him. 
Mr. Baldwin built such a fortune without ever reaching megastar heights. A well-respected actor, he is still best known for his role in "The Hunt for Red October," the 1990 film. His other film credits include "Malice," "The Edge," with Anthony Hopkins, and "Glengarry Glen Ross." In recent years, he has attracted attention as an outspoken political liberal as well as for several public outbursts. 
The divorce disputes with Ms. Basinger have also received press attention. Mr. Baldwin is convinced that a prenup would have calmed the waters. "Having a prenup is not about segregating assets," Mr. Baldwin said during an interview at his Art Deco-style office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The office is in the same building where he owns an apartment that is his primary residence. "'It is about: while you and I respect one another, why don't we hammer out this agreement pragmatically," said Mr. Baldwin, dressed in slacks and a white sports shirt. "In divorce the goal is to change partners and dance. A prenup helps people move on."
Without a prenup, Mr. Baldwin may soon pay Ms. Basinger several million dollars, according to people close to him. Still, he appears to be disciplined about holding on to a decent chunk of what he earns.
Mr. Baldwin has a crucial piece of advice for actors: Set aside your money for taxes so you don't make what he calls I.R.S. movies. "You get paid a gross amount; it's up to you to manage your withholding account," he said. Otherwise, he added, "by the fall, you've spent everything you have earned, and you are chasing money to pay the I.R.S." The same principle applies to anyone who is self-employed, he said.
Cash problems can leave performers prey to whatever project comes along. "If the only movie you can get to do is bad, it may be the last movie you make," Mr. Baldwin said. 
He is leery of assuming that the amount of money he makes in a particular year is what he will continue to make. "Actors get on a path where they make $250,000 and then $500,000 and then $1 million and they get seduced into thinking they are going to have that growth," he said. "People start living like they are going to make more money and they don't."
TO handle his own money, Mr. Baldwin talks regularly with Stephen Smith, an accountant who heads his own firm and oversees Mr. Baldwin's financial affairs, including taxes, budgeting and writing checks. Mr. Smith also monitors Mr. Baldwin's various sources of income, including residuals, the amounts paid when older films reach certain revenue goals. 
Occasionally, Mr. Baldwin has picked stocks, but generally with poor results.
"I bought a lot of Global Crossing," he said, because a colleague knew a lot of people who worked for the company, which eventually filed for bankruptcy protection. "All the buys that were based on ideas from friends of mine have not done well," he said.
Mr. Smith discourages investment autonomy for Mr. Baldwin. "If he came to me after Sept. 11 about buying a railroad stock, I would say to him: 'Shut up and go do a voiceover,' " Mr. Smith said. "Creative people should not be picking stocks." 
Fortunately for Mr. Baldwin, his main focus has been New York real estate. He paid about $2.5 million for his two Manhattan apartments in the early 1990's, and they are now valued by a Manhattan real estate agent at about $6.5 million.
He also has a sprawling gray-shingled home on eight acres in Amagansett, N.Y., on Long Island. He paid $1.8 million for the property in 1994 and has invested an additional $3 million in it. It is worth about $8 million to $10 million, according to several real estate agents in the area.
The balance of Mr. Baldwin's money is 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds (some municipals and some Treasury bills). The money management firm Neuberger Berman oversees the portfolios.
Mr. Baldwin, 45, grew up in a poor family in Massapequa on Long Island. "We always worried about money," he said. He was the second oldest of six siblings, four of whom are actors. His late father, also named Alec, who died in 1983, was a schoolteacher and football coach.
"I am somebody who was woefully concerned about my economic insecurity," Mr. Baldwin said. "I was not in soup lines, but there was the wolf at the door all the time. My parents were fighting about money. The fights were about which bills to pay." 
MR. BALDWIN attended George Washington University in Washington, where he majored in political science, but on a dare from a friend, he auditioned for New York University's drama program and was accepted. In 1981, he landed a role in "The Doctors," the television soap opera. That led to a three-year stint on the prime-time "Knots Landing." A series of film roles brought him to the attention of Paramount Pictures, which cast him in the lead role in Tom Clancy's "Hunt for Red October." 
But his difficult temperament took its toll. He turned down the lead in the Clancy sequel, "Patriot Games," for the lead in the Broadway revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire." Thoughhe wanted the creative challenge, that decision -- just as his career was taking off -- might have hurt him.
"In Hollywood, you have to do 'one for them,' " he said, referring to nonchallenging roles, "and 'one for me,' " he said of more difficult roles. "I was too quick to take the 'one for me,' " he conceded. 
Several associates say he was difficult with studio executives, and sometimes his temper burst into public view. In 1995, Mr. Baldwin punched a celebrity photographer who was trying to take pictures of Ms. Basinger and the couple's newborn daughter. Mr. Baldwin said he had acted in self-defense. He was acquitted by a jury of misdemeanor battery charges in a criminal case, but was ordered to pay the photographer $4,500 in a civil case. 
Still, by 1996, Mr. Baldwin could command millions for a movie. He was paid $7.5 million, for example, for "The Edge." 
Mr. Baldwin remembers being on the road and calling his business manager and saying, "Listen: I've got to get my hands on a fast million," he said. "You chase the money because your lifestyle gets more expansive. You get on the money train. You want money, money, money. You want your house. You want to go to Europe. You want to take care of your parents," he said, referring to his widowed mother. 
In Hollywood, as success escalates, "there comes a time when, if someone is going to pay you $5 million for a movie, you go: 'What, they are going to pay me a lousy $5 million?' " Mr. Baldwin said.
"Then you turn around and if your career devolves a little bit, $1 million or $2 million is looking pretty good," he added. "It's breathtaking, the kind of leaps you can make in a 12-month period."
Mr. Baldwin credits Ron Meyer, a founding partner at the Creative Artists Agency, with much of his financial success. Mr. Meyer represented him from 1991 to 1995. 
"Ron was my agent and that was when I made the most money," Mr. Baldwin said. "He said to me: 'They are not all going to be "The Godfather." You throw spaghetti against the wall and see if it sticks. Just make movies.' " Mr. Meyer is now chairman of Universal Studios.
But Mr. Meyer could not ensure that Mr. Baldwin's films would become hits. When some of them fizzled at the box office and his squabbles grabbed headlines, his reputation suffered. "I don't make as much money as I did five or six years ago," he conceded. 
Today, Mr. Baldwin "dabbles in studio films and makes independent films," as he describes his career. He exhibits a certain contempt for mainstream Hollywood films.
"You hold your nose and do them," he said. "They are like potato chips. They aren't very nutritious." 
He works steadily. "If I want to send the signal that I want to work a lot, I can, and I am doing that now," he said.
He has the lead role in "The Cooler," which opens in November and is produced by Edward R. Pressman Content Film. For that work he could receive at least $650,000, and more depending on the film's success. He just finished playing Juan Trippe, the longtime chief executive of Pan American Airways, in "The Aviator," the Martin Scorsese film about the life of Howard Hughes. He does voiceovers on commercials for companies including Chevrolet, Mutual of Omaha and General Electric. 
But Mr. Baldwin seems somewhat ambivalent about his current earnings level. "I was not willing to do the things to make more money," he said. "But I am taken more seriously as an actor as a result of the things I did and the choices I made. I make less, but I can't complain. I am happy. If I did better, maybe I would be happier. " 
WHENEVER he works, he says, he reads the fine print in his contracts and tries to learn as much as possible about people with whom he does business.
"I don't mean to sound sexist," he said. "But don't be some girl who is dating a leading man on the movie set and they are in bed one day and the leading man says, 'Hey, you ought to go with my business manager.' "
Mr. Baldwin said he had not always been so skillful at judging business associates. Several years ago, he agreed to produce and take a small role in "The Devil and Daniel Webster." He contends that he was never paid the fees he was promised because the producer David Glasser had not raised enough money to complete the film although he indicated that he had. 
"Somebody in that organization knew that he didn't have all the money," Mr. Baldwin said. "We finishing shooting the film, but he did not have the money for post-production." Mr. Baldwin is waiting to see if the movie is distributed before suing for the money he is owed, he said.
Mr. Glasser said that Mr. Baldwin's allegations "are simply untrue."
"He knew that a couple of investors fell out and he knew everything that was happening all along the way," Mr. Glasser added.
FOR his part, Mr. Baldwin is cynical about the industry. "So much of the movie business is this pathetic quasi-friendship thing," he said. "I have had people say: 'I can pay you $500,000 for a movie, but I can't pay it now. I will pay you $350,000 and defer $150,000.' But we are friends and we are partners on this movie. Your cleaner does not walk up to you and say: 'I couldn't get the stains out of the shirt, but we are friends, aren't we?' "
Of course, it is too late for Mr. Baldwin to adhere to another rule, the need for a prenup, and that is likely to cost him, both psychologically and financially. "Divorce is like death," he said. "It is the most debilitating experience of my life," Mr. Baldwin said. 
Mr. Baldwin maintains that he was shocked by the news that his wife wanted to end the marriage. "My wife was my whole world," he said. Neither has remarried.
Lawyers for Mr. Baldwin and Ms. Basinger have been haggling over a financial settlement and custody of the couple's daughter. 
If the arguments over money and custody have been rough, he said, he does not blame his wife. He said he believed that the lawyers aggravated the conflict. "If she said she wanted $10 million, they would say: make it $15 million. Shakespeare was right: kill the lawyers." Ms. Basinger declined to comment. 
But the lawyers are alive and well. Ms. Basinger lives in California, and under California law, the assets earned during a marriage are divided equally. That could mean Mr. Baldwin would have to pay her several million. 
Despite the unpredictability of his income, Mr. Baldwin continues to make charitable contributions. This year he gave $250,000 to the East Hampton Day Care Center.
If his wealth reaches $40 million, he said, he might stop making movies. "I have said to my friends, there are people like Hanks and Cruise," he said, referring to the famous Toms. "They get $20 million a movie. If I got that, I would make two movies and never make another movie as long as I lived.
"There are other things I want to do," he said.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: PROSPECT PARK; 
Fewer Patrols, More Fear

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 BODY:
EVERY fall as the weather turns colder, the Police Department thins the ranks of officers who patrol Prospect Park. But after a daylight attack there two weeks ago that left a 33-year-old woman hospitalized, nearby residents are anxious about this routine seasonal shift and the overall level of park safety.
 On Tuesday, more than 80 people gathered at the park's Picnic House for a sometimes stormy debate with officials over these issues. On Oct. 14, as many of them knew, the number of officers who patrol the park will drop to its regular detail of 11 from its summer detail of 26. 
 That fact was of special interest to residents because the attack earlier this month was thwarted by a passing officer, who arrested a suspect. 
 But the residents' worries about park dangers extended beyond the recent crime. They complained about trash overflow, a dearth of emergency telephones in the park, and camping, drugs and prostitution in the shrubbery. 
 "There are people urinating, defecating, making love," said Martin Haber, who lives near Bartel Pritchard Square, at the westernmost edge of the park. "They're drunk and stoned every day, and I have a 10-year-old and I have to walk her by that every day."
 Susan Kramer, a Park Slope resident, said that a park path near Fifth and Sixth Streets was so overgrown and garbage-strewn that she now avoided it, even when with her Rottweiler. "I used to be able to walk up and down this area without hesitation," she said. 
 Deputy Inspector Edward Mullen of the 78th Precinct said that the police have stepped up efforts to remove people from Bartel Pritchard Square, and that park crime was down this year over last. 
 "The violent attack two weeks ago, that was the only serious assault since I've been here," said Inspector Mullen, who has been at the precinct for two and a half years. The only other assault this year was a groping incident. "But," he added, "one assault is too many." 
 Some people expressed concern that the city's economic woes were undermining security. "Going back 10 years, it had gotten better," said Tim O'Dea, one resident. "But this summer there was an influx of new people who came, drinking, sleeping in the park."
 Still, said Tupper W. Thomas, the park's administrator, "When you consider that there are 7 million visitors a year, two incidents is amazing."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN/LITTLE ITALY; 
Hangout for the Courtroom Crowd Succumbs to Economic Laws

BYLINE:  By STEVE KURUTZ

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH legal arguments have long echoed down the austere halls of the Criminal Court building on Centre Street, many spirited lawyerly discussions also occurred a few blocks east, in a dim, shoebox-sized Italian restaurant named Giambone. Now, as workers at Centre Street and other nearby courthouses dig into their fall workload, they are discovering that this neighborhood fixture is gone. 
 Located on a narrow stretch of Mulberry Street two blocks south of Canal, Giambone, a virtual clubhouse for lawyers, judges, cops and defendants with a history as rich as its clam sauce, closed its doors in June. It was a victim of 9/11 and the sluggish economy, which all but eliminated the evening dinner crowd. 
Originally housed in a marble-floored basement, which served it well during Prohibition, the restaurant was opened in 1914 by a strapping fellow named Italo Susi, who went by the nickname Giambone. In 1935, after the upstairs tenant, a Western Union office, left, Italo moved his eatery aboveground and, along with his son Tony, built the place into a bustling, neighborhood joint. 
 Within a stone's throw of various courthouses, Giambone was a natural choice for people who worked at the courthouse or merely visited it from time to time, like the mobster John Gotti. Tony Susi, now 82, still remembers his introduction to the once-Teflon don. 
 "The goons came over and said, 'Would you accept John Gotti?' I said, 'Of course.' Then they said, 'Would you wait on him personally?' So I waited on him. We got along pretty well, too. I spoke to him in Italian." Mr. Gotti ordered the calamari and left a $125 tip. 
 Over the years, other celebrities passed through, including the comedian Pat Cooper, who wanted to kiss Mr. Susi upon tasting his linguini alla Sinatra, a house specialty, and John F. Kennedy Jr., who nursed his wounds at Giambone after failing the bar exam for the second time.
 But the true lure of Giambone remained its homey ambiance. The decor -- rickety tables, taxidermied fish on the wall -- was as unfashionable as your grandfather's basement, and nearly as dusty. The menu was varied but never fancy. And Mr. Susi, by all accounts a gracious host, presided over a cast of regulars that included a fellow named Louie Beans, a struggling lounge singer named Detie Baxter, and Louis Martine, a big, garrulous prankster. 
 Asked about the many stunts he pulled at Giambone, Mr. Martine, a retired lawyer, fondly recalled the sweltering day he sent two colleagues on a goose chase in search of a Chinese tailor rumored to sell cheap suits. "By the time the guys got back, they were walking swimming pools," he said with a laugh. "They were mad as hell."
 There is another reason to mourn Giambone. Except for a half-Italian, half-Chinese place next door, it was the last Italian restaurant on Mulberry Street below Canal.
 Next month the space will reopen as a Chinese furniture store, furthering the Asian dominance of an area that, according to Mr. Susi, once housed seven Italian restaurants. 
 Mr. Susi retired in 1990, selling the restaurant to a man named Joseph Elias. Bob Jenny, a spokesman for NewYork City Management, the owner of the building, said that Mr. Elias informed the company last spring that he was closing the struggling business. Mr. Elias could not be reached for comment. 
 For its many former customers, the bottom line is that the restaurant will be missed. "It's left a hole in the neighborhood,"' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney and a longtime regular. "Now, we go to Odeon or Forlini's."

As California Goes, So Goes the Country?

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
MORE than 60 years ago, the columnist Westbrook Pegler, noting California's penchant for political experimentation and social turmoil, proposed that a guardian should be appointed and the state declared incompetent to manage its own affairs. Last week, California's recall election drama led the columnist George F. Will to call it "the sick man of the Republic."
 It has always been easy for the rest of the country to bash California, and to dismiss its self-conscious Left Coast exceptionalism as just that. In fact, California has a state constitution and a long cultural tradition that allow for an unusual degree of political volatility, through citizen referendums, ballot initiatives and, yes, electoral recall. 
 But the plain truth is that the same germs that have made California the Fabulous Invalid of national politics -- a sluggish economy, high unemployment, budget shortfalls, a shaky electrical grid and an abiding distrust in politicians' ability to do much of anything about such problems -- are pulsing through the bloodstream of American democracy more broadly.
Anyone who thought the 2000 presidential recount was a once-in-a-lifetime experience may well have been wrong, as the courts re-enacted the topsy-turvy election last week. On Friday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District in San Francisco announced that it would reconsider the decision of its three-judge panel to postpone the California recall on the grounds that the planned Oct. 7 balloting did not give several counties with large minority populations enough time to replace punch-card voting machines of the type that wrought havoc in Florida. 
"You can make the usual jokes about the colorful candidates and so on," said Kevin Starr, a history professor at the University of Southern California and author of a multi-volume social history of the state. "But if one probes deeper, and says, 'Are state governments becoming increasingly out of sync with the governed,' then you could look at the situation in California as yet another instance in which California gets there first, because it's larger, less disciplined, less tradition-minded, and the function that it so often seems to fill in national life is of acting out things."
At a minimum, the California mess, in which the experienced but hugely unpopular Democratic governor, Gray Davis, faces recall just a year after Republicans nearly defeated him with a novice candidate, suggests the degree to which Americans are now willing to regard every election -- and every political decision -- as contestable. Electoral and political procedures devised in the 18th century to produce a clockwork of checks and balances fare less well in the white-hot, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-week glare of the 21st century.
In Texas, where Republicans swept to power in the State Legislature last year for the first time in a century, Democratic lawmakers fled twice to neighboring states this year in an effort to thwart passage of a Republican-drawn Congressional redistricting plan that would replace the one imposed by a court when the Democratic-controlled legislature failed to act after the 2000 census. In Nevada, the Republican governor, Kenny Guinn, is facing a nascent recall movement over his support for raising taxes. 
"There is a national dissatisfaction," said Curtis B. Gans, the director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate in Washington. "I see it most clearly in things like registration figures, in which over the last 30 years, Democratic Party registration has declined from the mid-40's of the eligible electorate down to the low 30's, and Republican registration has increased in the South but declined elsewhere. The electorate is very deeply and partisanly polarized, and there is a dissatisfaction with this type of politics, which yields very little but inaction on a whole series of relevant issues."
There is reason to doubt the extent of California's power as a trendsetter. Proposition 13, which capped property taxes in 1978, helped inspire similar tax-cutting measures in more than 40 states, but few so radical. Proposition 209, which banned the use of racial preferences in college admissions, state employment and contracting in 1996, tapped into widespread anti-affirmative action sentiment but hardly inspired a nationwide movement.
And certainly, some circumstances paving the way for the recall are peculiar to California, including the state's increasing reliance, since Proposition 13, on a raft of ballot initiatives. Voters, increasingly frustrated at their elected representatives' unwillingness to tackle what they see as tough problems, have passed measures that make it just that much harder for politicians to tackle tough problems.
And voters are specifically angry at the administration of Gray Davis. "I think Gray Davis is the issue there," said Michael K. Deaver, the former aide to Ronald Reagan. On the issues Californians are angry about -- illegal immigration, power failures and budget deficits -- "Gray Davis symbolizes all that," he said.
But in many ways, California looks like the country, if in the extreme. By its sheer size, California carries special weight. "If the Pilgrims had landed in Santa Monica Bay, there'd be something like 13 states in California," Dr. Starr said.
And Californians -- like the rest of the country, only maybe a little bit more so -- want it all, all the time: lower taxes and smaller classrooms; tighter pollution controls and bigger S.U.V.'s; cheap labor and fresh produce but tighter limits on immigration and provision of social services. Under Republican and Democratic governors alike over the past 50 years, they have grown used to getting such bounty, especially during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's. Now, the state budget faces a steadily growing deficit that Republicans accused Mr. Davis of failing to acknowledge as he campaigned. Mr. Davis won re-election by just five percentage points last fall, in an election that drew just over 35 percent of eligible voters -- the lowest turnout ever in a California general election. 
But with its particularly broad powers of referendum, California provides the rest of the country with examples of what can happen when voters get their way, unfiltered by politicians or legislators.
"Voters aren't provided real choices," said Alan Ehrenhalt, the executive editor of Governing magazine. "They are asked, would you like ice cream one year, and then the next year, would you like cake? It doesn't ask of voters to make responsible choices from limited alternatives."
D. J. Waldie, the author of "Holy Land, A Suburban Memoir," put it another way. "The initiative, as it's practiced, is the heroin of democracy." 
Lou Cannon, the California journalist and biographer of Ronald Reagan, sees at least some rays of hope in the recall, even though he opposes it. It has sparked new voter registration and led California's local television stations -- famously inattentive to politics for years -- to explore issues like the state budget with sudden vigor. And in that way, Mr. Cannon suggests, the state might be fixing a national ill: apathy and distrust of the political process.
"To me, the great threat to American democracy is not Howard Dean or the religious right," Mr. Cannon said. "It's that more and more people are opting out of it."

Stocks Rise Along With Company Earnings

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks climbed again last week, as the market's rally moved into its seventh month. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average has risen in 21 of the last 28 weeks. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been in the black for 20 out of 28 weeks, while the Nasdaq composite has climbed in 19 of the 28. 
 Corporate earnings have been improving. More investors appear to believe that Federal Reserve policy makers, who left their benchmark interest rate at 1 percent after their meeting last week, will keep rates low well into next year.
 The S.& P.'s telecom sector index has surged 46 percent since the 2003 market low on March 11. The consumer discretionary sector has also jumped 38 percent.
 For the week, the Nasdaq climbed 50.67 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,905.70. The Dow was up 173.27, or 1.8 percent, to 9,644.82, while the S.& P. 500 index rose 17.67 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,036.30.
 Prices of Treasury notes and bonds climbed, and yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the 10-year note declined to 4.17 percent from 4.25 percent a week earlier. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

HEADLINE: Mismatched Conditions In the U.S. Economy 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Good Economy. Bad Job Market. Huh?" (Economic View, Sept. 14) suggested that technological improvements, as well as employers' squeezing more work from existing workers, are possible root causes of the current economic phenomenon of increasing productivity and declining demand. 
 But the most important cause is the rapid "offshoring" of large numbers of skilled and service jobs like those in programming, telephone customer service and accounting. These jobs have joined the manufacturing positions already lost to countries where companies can hire such labor for a small fraction of what American workers would be paid. This directly increases productivity, which is measured as output per dollar spent on labor.
While offshoring dramatically decreases corporate costs, it also eliminates the domestic salaries that provide the greatest demand for these companies' products. Unfortunately, this makes less realistic the idea that increased demand will come from companies' profit-taking shareholders.

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
Finding Freedom In the Corporate Life

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

 BODY:
DURING the spring, J. Robert Carr was running a boutique law firm specializing in employment and labor law when he was offered a senior position at a trade association. His law practice was satisfying, he said, but the offer was just too good to pass up. So, in May, he became a vice president of the association, the Society for Human Resource Management. 
 At a time when tens of thousands of workers are starting out on their own, some seasoned entrepreneurs are finding that the independent life, while rewarding, can be too difficult. Whether it is the limited support staff, the rising cost of employee benefits or the difficulty of getting work from cost-cutting companies, life for some entrepreneurs -- or lawyers or doctors in private practice -- is more stressful than it has been in years. As a result, some are deciding that the corporate world looks more appealing. 
 John Gramer, director of the New York branch of Spherion Professional Recruiting, says corporate positions can offer greater income and job security than entrepreneurial jobs, in which the loss of a client or two can have a crippling effect. It is not uncommon, he said, for managers who went out on their own after the job cuts following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to be returning to the corporate world now that some companies seem to be hiring again.
 Many executive clients of Deborah Brown-Volkman, a career coach in Long Beach, N.Y., find corporate jobs more rewarding than self-employment, she said. "Taking a corporate position can actually give managers more freedom," Ms. Brown-Volkman said. "Before, they had less control because they were handling problems all day. Now they can make plans for their departments and implement them with fewer distractions."
 Executives returning to corporate life are also looking for more free time, she said. "Business owners have very little of it," she added.
 Mr. Carr started his law practice in January 2002 after leaving AARP, the retirees' lobbying group, where he was the director of human resources. But when the opportunity for his new job, at the trade association, came along in May, he decided that it would allow him to make more of a difference.
 His current position, he said, "gives him the leverage to impact a couple hundred thousand human resource professionals trying to affect other people's lives."
 "I can focus on my expertise in a way that running my own practice, where I had to be a jack of all trades, did not allow me to," he added.
 Some entrepreneurs and independent professionals are considering corporate jobs because the continuing weakness in the economy makes their independent livelihood more precarious. Michael Russell was senior director of investor relations for the VTEL Corporation, a videoconferencing company in Austin, Tex., from 1998 to 2001. When VTEL reorganized in May 2001, he left to start his own investor relations firm, the StreetSmart Company. 
 Within a year, however, he said he felt limited by the scale of his firm, and was unsure what the impending recession might mean for its future. When Pierpont Communications, a public relations firm in Austin, approached him with the offer of an executive position, he had to make a decision. "I had just struck the mother lode and landed a lucrative contract in the insurance industry," Mr. Russell said, but he decided to join Pierpont and take his clients with him.
 Tom Thomasson of Atlanta has lived through other problems that arise in small entrepreneurial ventures. Mr. Thomasson spent 20 years in the health care industry, rising to director of sales for MAG Mutual Insurance Company in Atlanta. "I think everyone who's been in industry long enough wants to try their hand at having their own business, realizing their own dream," he said. "I saw a whole new niche in the market to fulfill."
 In 1999, he left to start his own health care insurance agency, the Landers & Creel Southeastern Group, with a partner. But the working relationship deteriorated, and the two men are now in a legal dispute over their original contract. In addition, Mr. Thomasson decided that his business model was not producing cash flow when he needed it.
 In July, he accepted a position as director of admissions at the OmniTech Institute, a technology and medical vocational school in Atlanta.
 DESPITE the pitfalls of entrepreneurial work, many executives can thrive on the challenges. But even they sometimes tire of the grueling schedule. For Mark Scott, 56, now a lawyer at Callahan, McCune & Willis in San Francisco, running his own law firm when his children were growing up provided flexibility he would not have had in a large law firm, he said.
 He could take cases in Hawaii that lasted almost a summer and bring his son and daughter with him, and he could usually schedule depositions around his children's lives as well.
 "It was a wonderful way of life," he said. "Once I brought my children to Manhattan when I worked on a six-week case involving a large securities firm, and my 3-year-old daughter learned how to hail a cab," he said. His wife went on the trips, too, he said, and they found baby sitters at the hotels where they stayed.
 By the time his children were grown, however, the sole proprietorship had served its purpose, he said. He sought the benefits a large law firm could offer, like support from otherlawyers on cases. "Once I hit 50, the amount of flying I was doing was grueling, too," he said. Two years ago, he joined Callahan, McCune & Willis. 
 More than half the workers who responded to a recent survey sponsored by Spherion said that they would like to change jobs. Roughly the same number said they were confident that they could earn a living "outside the conventional work structure." But a number of managers who have been self-employed give their new positions in the corporate structure positive marks. 
 Mr. Carr, of the Society for Human Resource Management, said, "even if you're asked to do the work of three people in the corporate world these days, when you're self-employed you might be doing the work of five." He said of his previous job: "I was only chief executive 5 or 10 percent of the time. Many days I was the mail clerk, the graphics artist and the reprographics department."

As Interest Rates Climb, Must Bank Stocks Fall?

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
BANK shares have been among the most resilient investments of the last three years. But because of the sudden rebound in long-term interest rates, many analysts are warning that the sector risks succumbing to history as well as gravity.
 For decades, returns on bank stocks have correlated strongly with yields on government bonds; as yields rise, bank shares fall, and vice versa. After dropping in June to their lowest levels in years, bond yields staged an energetic reversal, surging by more than one percentage point over two months. 
 The move came as American and European bank shares traded near multiyear highs, relative to the overall stock market. That represented a major shift from their valuations in the summer of 2000, near the top of the dot-com boom At the time, American bank shares lagged so much that a representative portfolio bought at the start of 1982 would have been worth nearly 60 percent less than the same amount invested in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morgan Stanley. Banks closed the gap to about 10 percent last year, but it has since widened to about 20 percent. European banks have performed similarly in recent years. 
 If the historical pattern holds, bank stocks should be acutely vulnerable to the climb in yields. But while the stocks have pulled back, the decline has not been severe. Many analysts, waiting for the other shoe to drop, are encouraging shareholders to sell.
 "The biggest correlation for the performance of banks in the long term is the direction of the bond market," said Richard Davidson, European equity strategist for Morgan Stanley in London, in a note to clients. "Major turns in the bond market have preceded turns in banks' relative performance by one to three months, and the bond market made a significant turn, as we've seen, in mid-June. Our view is that yields will move higher over the next 12 months and that sentiment will move towards short-rate hikes by year-end, both negative developments for banks."
 The American model stock portfolio, or list of recommended stocks, from Morgan Stanley is lightly invested in banks and other financial services companies: 17 percent versus a 20.5 percent weighting for the sector in the S. &P. 500. The model portfolio for Europe allocates 16.1 percent to financial services, versus its 21.1 percent weighting in the market. 
 Professional investors have come to agree with Mr. Davidson. European fund managers polled by Merrill Lynch in early August were heavily invested in banks, but they cut their exposure substantially over the next month to a slight underweighting. In the survey in early August, American managers were extremely light in banks, and they became even more so during the next month.
 American financial stocks are especially vulnerable to rising yields on American government bonds and lag behind their foreign peers when yields rise, said David Bowers, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch in London. He said in a report to clients that global equity managers interested in taking a big bet on economic recovery and rising bond yields "might consider selling U.S. financial stocks."
 Bond yields relate to bank stocks in several ways. Rising yields reflect economic optimism. When investors are in such a mood, they often sell stocks in defensive industries like banks and put the money to work in industries like energy and airlines thatare likely to benefit most from economic recovery.
 There is also a more direct impact. Typically, as long-term interest rates rise, including rates on bank loans, new lending shrinks and the value of a bank's existing loan book falls.
 "When bond yields rise, future loan activity will slow down," Teun Draaisma, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said in an interview. "At the moment, that impact can be huge."
 Mr. Draaisma and others pointed out, though, that there are banks and then there are banks. Some institutions, including specialists in investment banking, asset management and credit card issuance, suffer few direct effects from rising interest rates and can benefit from a pickup in economic activity. Banks that engage heavily in commercial and mortgage lending are hurt the most, while diversified banks, including the industry giants, fall somewhere in between.
 American banks could be two-time losers from rising bond yields. Many economists say the United States has the brightest prospects for recovery among the major world regions, making cyclical stocks particularly appealing. And American banks have done comparatively more mortgage lending, especially refinancing, so they are suffering from a more acute decline in new lending.
 "Mortgage refinancing is clearly more of an issue in the United States," said David Miller, head of asset allocation at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in London. "Banks are being hurt by the falloff caused by higher rates, and this is clearly a factor in their performance."
 But even for big lenders, he said, rising rates can produce benefits as well, particularly by enhancing their ability to take advantage of spreads in interest rates between financial instruments of different maturities. "Rising yields provide a headwind for the banking sector but also a tailwind," Mr. Miller said. "If we have a steepening of the yield curve, with 10-year bonds rising and short-term rates staying the same because central banks are keeping those rates down, it allows banks to borrow short and lend long." He added that "banks are also beneficiaries of better economic growth," because bad debts shrink.
 Mr. Miller said he thinks European bank stocks may have already fallen enough to reflect the weakening bond market. Simon Melluish, head of United States equities for Gartmore Global Investments in Conshohocken, Pa., made the same argument for American bank stocks, but he suggested that the bond market's condition might not be as poor as others suppose.
 He is betting that most of the selling is over, both in bonds and bank stocks. "We do not expect interest rates to rise very rapidly because we do not see the economy rising at 6 percent to 7 percent in 2004," he said of the American economy. "The bond markets probably overshot on the way down, and we have seen them snap back. The bond market was spelling out economic Armageddon. We never felt that was going to happen."
 Mr. Melluish said that Gartmore has been underweight in American banks, in line with its assumption earlier this year -- a wrong one, as it turned out -- that spreads between long-term and short-term interest rates would narrow. But in a reflection of his sanguine outlook for long-term rates, the stocks Gartmore owns tend to be most heavily leveraged to bond yields and mortgage activity, including Washington Mutual and Bank of America. Gartmore also holds Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, and smaller banks like North Fork, on Long Island. 
 Simon Moss, another Gartmore fund manager, said that most of the picks, big and small, sharedcertain virtues, including managements that execute corporate strategies effectively and keep costs down. Mr. Moss described Citigroup as "one of our core holdings, with a particularly good mixture of businesses, including investment banking, which makes it more of a geared play than straightforward banks," meaning that it can better take advantage of a revival in investment markets.
 As for North Fork, he said, "over time, it has proven itself to have executed well, it has continued to open branches in New Jersey and New York, and it has very good control of costs."
 "We're looking for a pickup in loan demand and think they'll do very well," he added.
 J.P. Morgan Chase is unlike Gartmore's other choices, he said. "It's more a recovery play after management got battered on Latin American loans and venture capital," he said. The bank also lost favor with investors when its large exposure to Enron was disclosed.
 "There is a question mark over its management, compared to Citigroup," Mr. Moss said. "But the stock has fallen so much that we felt the risk of further upsets was all discounted in the price."
 CITIGROUP is also a part of Morgan Stanley's American model portfolio, as is J.P. Morgan Chase, Fifth Third Bancorp and Merrill Lynch. Its European portfolio includes Allied Irish; HSBC and Lloyds TSB in Britain; BNP Paribas in France; Credit Suisse in Switzerland; and IntesaBci in Italy.
 Citigroup Smith Barney, Citigroup's American research arm, compiles a global model portfolio, which includes Bank of America and Wells Fargo among its favored American banks and Royal Bank of Scotland and UniCredito Italiano in Europe. It makes a distinction between banks, which are underrepresented in the portfolio, and "diversified financials," which it overweights. Choices in that category include J.P. Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and UBS of Switzerland.
 Mr. Miller's European portfolios are heavily invested in banks. He prefers British ones like Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Barclays. On the Continent, he said, his choices are "the usual suspects that are still the powerhouses of the industry," including Deutsche Bank in Germany and Credit Suisse. 
 "European banks have come through the current cycle in good shape because they are better managed this time around than in past cycles," he said. "They are in a position to benefit from economic recovery rather than just repair their balance sheets. We think the good news outweighs the bad news."
 Mr. Draaisma, at Morgan Stanley, plugs in the same facts but derives the opposite conclusion. Banks, he suggested, could be victims of their own recent success. Surviving the sluggish economy with their earnings and assets in such good shape, he said, means that there is less room for growth.
 "During recessions, banks have earnings recessions," he said. "That's why they're so leveraged in an economic recovery. Banks' earnings rise massively. But not this time around. That leverage isn't there anymore. There has been 20 fantastic years where loans and earnings growth have been high. Now the market will grow more than the banks, so banks will underperform."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: David L. King; 
Putnam New Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
DAVID L. KING, lead manager of the $1.2 billion Putnam New Value fund, describes his style as "earnings power investing" -- finding companies that are cheap based on his estimates of their future earnings power.
 Bargain prices aren't enough. "Besides a depressed stock price," Mr. King said from his office in Boston, "we look for reasons for future stock price increases." These can be catalysts like cyclical industry changes, new products or markets, or changes in management. 
 The fund returned 1.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through August, adjusted for its maximum load, or sales charge, of 5.75 percent. Its peer group of funds that buy large value stocks lost 3.3 percent, annualized, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.4 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.
 The fund returned 7.7 percent in the 12 months through August, adjusted for the load, compared with 7.8 percent for its group and 12.1 percent for the index.
 Mr. King, 46, is managing director of Putnam Investment Management, the fund's investment adviser; his co-manager is Michael J. Abata, 35, senior vice president of the adviser. The average market capitalization of the portfolio companies is $26.4 billion, versus $18.8 billion for the S.&P. 500.
 In choosing stocks, Mr. King looks at market cap as a combination of factors, including "the real size of the business plus people's impressions of the business." Typically, he picks the fund's roughly 70 stocks from companies that have been in business for at least a decade and have generated at least $1 billion in revenue during the last 12 months. He identifies the cheapest half of that universe based primarily on ratios of price to cash flow and price to earnings.
 Next, he ranks the companies by various factors, including earnings quality. A company with poor earnings quality, he said, would be one that reports strong earnings but low cash flow because of high depreciation or other accounting differences.
 He also looks at what he calls indications of "signaling" -- generally insider buying and short-selling. And he examines a company's price-to-earnings ratio, adjusted for its expected growth rate.
 Another factor is the company's estimated fair value, based on its discounted cash flow and prepared with the help of about 50 global equity research analysts.
 Mr. King then looks at the top 40 percent of companies on his resulting list and searches for catalysts that might reverse a company's stock price decline. "Often, in really down-and-out companies that may have no earnings," he said, "we can pick up clues about the company's future in its balance sheet." Those include improvements in liquidity or upgrades in credit ratings.
 He aims to hold shares about two to five years, on average, and he sells a stock when it approaches what he considers fair value.
 In June, Mr. King began buying shares of the Chubb Corporation, the insurer based in Warren, N.J. Property and casualty insurance premiums have risen after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said, adding, "Chubb has been a bit of a laggard during the positive insurance cycle."
 He expects Chubb to catch up, partly because the chief executive, John D. Finnegan, who came from GMAC late last year, "is not a traditional insurance guy" and "takes more of a financial services view."
 Chubb's high-end business in homeowners' insurance is also appealing, Mr. King said. He paid $60.14, on average, for the entire position; the stock now trades at $64.66. 
 MR. KING began buying shares of Dow Chemical in October 2002 and paid $30.51, on average; they now trade at $33.55. He called Dow "the premier commercial chemical company in the world but highly cyclical." 
 Industry conditions are near bottom because of the global economic slowdown, he said, and should improve as the North American and European economies rebound. Moreover, Dow recently brought back its former chief executive, William Stavropoulos, "giving us confidence in management," he said.
 Another holding, Southern Union, based in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., is primarily a natural-gas distributor. Mr. King called it "a cheap stock that's pretty boring" but said the company had been overlooked because, unlike most utilities, it pays no dividend. Besides benefiting from high natural-gas prices, he said, Southern Union will profit from its acquisition this year of Panhandle Eastern, which broadens its business.
 "I think this will be a transforming acquisition," he said, "raising the company's profile and earnings power." 
 He began buying shares in July, paying $15.31, on average; they are now at $17.79.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
Uncertainty Inside Emergency Rooms

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A MIDDLE-AGED woman arrived at the Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, Calif., this summer with a large abscess in her neck. Dr. Lawrence Stock, an emergency-room physician on duty, ordered a CAT scan and antibiotics, but the woman needed a head-and-neck surgeon to drain the abscess. Antelope Valley doesn't have such a surgeon on call, so Dr. Stock transferred the patient to a hospital that does. 
 Two days later, the woman, who lacked insurance, ended up back at Antelope Valley. Dr. Stock said she told him that after spending two days on a gurney virtually untreated at the second hospital, in Los Angeles, about 100 miles away, she decided to come home. The head-and-neck staff surgeon at Antelope Valley then operated on the woman, even though the hospital did not have an on-call arrangement with him. 
 "You'd think a hospital of our size would have specialist backup 24/7," Dr. Stock said. "But sometimes we have to transfer patients 10 times a day." The problem, he said, is likely to become worse. "We're living the future here," Dr. Stock said.
 It's a future that may leave us longing for the good old days. In 1986, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act -- often called the "patient anti-dumping statute" -- was passed to prevent hospitals from refusing to treat patients or from transferring them based on ability to pay. Emergency rooms became a safe harbor, where anyone could go for care anytime. 
 But budget problems and other financial issues have forced more than 500 hospital emergency departments to close since 1990, according to the American Hospital Association. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates that emergency-room patient visits rose about 20 percent from 1992 to 2001. 
 Two out of every three hospitals sometimes reroute ambulances away from their emergency departments because of overcrowding, according to the General Accounting Office. Many specialists, meanwhile, unhappy with low payment rates for treating poor and uninsured patients, have left hospital staff jobs for specialty clinics or private practice, where call duty isn't required.
 Now emergency care may be further compromised by a new regulation, effective Nov. 10, that eases requirements for on-call specialty coverage. The regulation, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, gives hospitals discretion, based on patient needs, the hospitals' capabilities and the availability of on-call physicians, to provide on-call coverage as they see fit.
 "The rule will provide hospitals flexibility in how they organize their coverage," said Maureen Mudron, counsel for the American Hospital Association.
 But emergency-department physicians are worried that there will be many more scenes like the one in Antelope Valley. "There will be a lot more patients, especially indigent patients, falling through the cracks," said Dr. Loren Johnson, chief medical officer of Sutter Emergency Medical Associates, a group of 50 full-time emergency physicians in Sacramento.
 Not only indigent patients will be affected by the new regulation. From 1996 to 2001, emergency-room visits by people with private insurance jumped 24 percent, accounting for a majority of the overall increase in visits those years, according to a report scheduled for release this fall by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
 "People are reporting they're having trouble getting in to see their regular doctors," said Peter J. Cunningham, a senior researcher at the center and a co-author of the report. "The emergency department becomes the place they go when they can't get an appointment."
 Jesse Perrin, 31, a software engineer, said he ended up in the emergency department at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan one morning in July, after suffering severe dizziness. Mr. Perrin, who had just joined an Aetna plan,said that he had called doctors but that they would not see him because he had not yet chosen a primary care physician. "It wasn't a dire emergency, but I did feel I wanted to see a doctor that day," he said. 
 He was fortunate: he said he waited just 15 minutes before being taken in for tests and a consultation with a neurologist at the emergency room. 
 Many aren't so lucky. When Arthur Ulrich, 79, hurt his leg picking beans a few weeks ago in his garden in East Alton, Ill., near St. Louis, his doctor sent him to the emergency department at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis to see a specialist in vascular surgery. Mr. Ulrich said his leg was painfully swollen and black and blue from groin to ankle. He said he waited five hours to be seen by the main specialist and have tests performed. By then, he said, "my leg was hurting so bad I was crying." Mr. Ulrich said he waited an additional three hours or so before X-rays were taken. The diagnosis was a blood clot in his thigh muscle, for which the treatment was rest and a bandage. 
 Sharon O'Keefe, the hospital's chief operating officer, said that she could not comment on the specifics of Mr. Ulrich's care, but said that during the several hours he was at the hospital, he received extensive lab and radiologic tests and was seen by at least three specialists. Such an extensive work-up, she said, takes time to arrange and to perform.
 THERE is no easy fix, but one thing the system clearly needs is money. The 1986 law requires that hospitals and doctors provide emergency care to everyone, though it doesn't provide the means to do so. It's an unfunded mandate. 
 In an American Medical Association study, emergency physicians, on average, reported $138,300 of uncollectable payments for providing care under the law in 2000. 
 If the Bush administration is serious about improving emergency services, it should look for ways to give the system a financial shot in the arm, instead of tinkering with on-call specialist requirements.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Prospecting For Nuggets In Tobacco Stocks

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
TOBACCO companies have many reasons to feel besieged. The number of smokers hasn't changed much since 1990, but shipment volumes are sliding. Tax increases have pushed prices up at a much faster rate than inflation. Deep discount brands are taking a big piece of the market. And operating profits are falling, in some cases precipitously. Last week, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said it would lay off 40 percent of its work force to cut $1 billion in costs over the next two years. 
 Martin Feldman, a tobacco industry analyst at Merrill Lynch, talked about the business last week. Following are excerpts from the conversation. 

Q. How much have volumes shrunk in the past few years?

A. Last year, the industry shipped 391 billion cigarettes in the United States. In 1998 that figure was 461 billion. This year, I estimate that shipments will be 372 billion. And for the foreseeable future, industry volumes are likely to decline by 2 percent to 3 percent annually.
 Combined with falling volumes, in the last five years there has been significant growth in the deep-discount segment of the market. In 1997, they represented about 1.5 percent of sales. At present, I estimate that deep-discount brands represent about 13 percent of the overall market.

Q. Why are deep discounters taking so much market share?

A. In November 1998, the Big Four manufacturers settled claims the 50 individual states had against the industry. As a result, the cost per pack to each of those producers was raised by about 50 cents. For a very small proportion of their volumes, little manufacturers are exempted in perpetuity from that cost. On the majority on which they do make payments, those payments are about 15 cents less per pack than big manufacturers.
 They have also benefited from the fact that since 1998 the big manufacturers, led by Philip Morris USA, raised prices particularly aggressively to try to compensate for the settlement with the states. 
 Finally, the economy has been weakening since early in 2000, and that has hurt smokers, whose average household income is $35,000. Consumers who are economically challenged but who smoke have no choice but to trade down. 
 At present, I estimate the average price per pack of the legal discount brands is about $1.95. That is a huge difference from the average price of $3.40 for Camel or Marlboro.

Q. What did you make of the announcement from RJR about layoffs?

A. The problem with RJR is that while it is doing an admirable job in trying to control its costs, of its four big brands it is having success with just one, Camel. And I think that with cuts of this size it will be a challenge for the company to maintain its relationships with wholesalers, retailers and smokers while continuing to produce a high-quality product.

Q. How serious are the companies' legal problems?

A. The single most important determinant of tobacco company valuations is the litigation environment. And while some serious challenges remain, the risk from litigation is materially less today than it was five years ago. In short, even though profitability has deteriorated substantially, there is still significant room for multiple expansion and an increase in returns to shareholders if the litigation environment continues to improve.

Q. What legal hurdles remain?

A. In the late 1990's, there were six types of claims against the industry. Today, there are only two cases of major importance: the class-action suit in Illinois, which is ongoing, and the Justice Department's lawsuit, where only one claim remains intact.
 I would expect both cases to be resolved over the next 12 to 36 months.

Q. What can investors expect for the companies if these legal problems, and their corresponding potential liabilities go away?

A. I think you will see the companies grow returns to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and buyback programs. And, in the case of Altria, you may see a significant corporate restructuring. I would expect the company will completely spin off its Kraft food unit, forcing the market to put a real valuation on the tobacco business.

Q. Given your outlook, which of these stocks do you like?

A. The potential restructuring of Altria makes it the most interesting company to own over the next 36 months.
 British American Tobacco is also attractive because of its significant exposure to the third world, where there is still margin expansion, consumers are trading up to more expensive brands, excise taxes are still low, and industry volumes in many markets are still rising. 
 From a purely fundamental perspective, I like BAT. But for pure capital appreciation over the next three years, I think Altria is the stock to own.

Counting the Ways to Count Corporate Earnings

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
CORPORATE earnings are expected to rise 17 percent this year. Earnings are also considered likely to surge 61 percent for 2003. Another forecast puts the gain at 78 percent. 
 All these forecasts were provided by the same firm, Standard & Poor's, for the same stock index, the S.&P. 500. 
 Earnings reports and forecasts have often been confusing -- and misleading. Companies have been known to manipulate the numbers to enhance their performance and their prospects. So analysts at firms like S.&P. have come up with a variety of filters for corporate earnings. But sometimes they seem to make the picture murkier. 
 "It is difficult for the professional to figure it out," lamented Jim Floyd, senior analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. Still, Mr. Floyd says that after sorting the various earnings forecasts, he has concluded that the earnings outlook this year has really improved substantially.
 But first, let's make some sense of those numbers.
 S.&P.'s forecast of a 17 percent increase this year is based on a measure known as operating earnings. Most companies and many Wall Street analysts use this figure because it allows companies to put their best foot forward. Operating earnings exclude so-called one-time write-offs and other special charges that can reduce earnings. Those who use them say operating earnings give a clearer -- and smoother -- picture of earnings over time.
 For this reason, operating earnings suffered the least after the market crash, the recession and the sluggish growth that has followed. Twelve-month operating earnings for the S.&P. 500 index fell 31.6 percent from the third quarter of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2001.
 By contrast, the second S.&P. earnings measure, reported earnings, plunged 54 percent in the same period. S.&P. says that reported earnings are expected to rise 61 percent this year. Reported earnings follow generally accepted accounting practices, or GAAP, and therefore are more volatile because one-time events are not excluded.
 The newest S.&P. yardstick is called core earnings, which are forecast to rise 78 percent this year. This measure is designed to account for the cost of stock options, which became a popular form of compensation during the technology boom. Companies have excluded stock options from the group of expenses that would reduce earnings; the core earnings measure restores them. Core earnings also remove another accounting gimmick that inflates corporate earnings. When bond and stock market returns on a pension fund's investments exceed the expected return, a company can add the excess return to earnings. Core earnings exclude this add-on. 
 Despite the wide disparity among these three earnings forecasts, actual earnings performance this year provides a positive underpinning for this year's stock market rally, during which the S.&P. 500 has climbed 17.8 percent. And while it may further confuse matters, a fourth, much broader, measure of corporate profits, based on the gross domestic product, is also giving good signals. Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, is predicting that G.D.P. corporate profits will rise 25 percent this year. 
 In an effort to make sense of all of these forecasts, Mr. Floyd of the Leuthold Group has complicated the picture even further. He ignores core earnings because they are too new to have a good historical context. Because both reported and operating earnings can be off the mark, Mr. Floyd likes to average the two. Then he averages this adjusted earnings number for five years, using the numbers for the previous four years as well as the forecast for the next year to smooth the impact of the economic cycle. In the end, Mr. Floyd said he came up with a forecast of an increase of 5.1 percent this year, a tiny amount compared with all of the S.&P. calculations.
 But he has tortured the numbers enough that this confession of only modest earnings growth gives him reason to be positive about the stock market.

More Bumps in the Road to Retirement

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
What a difference five years makes. In 1998, a Merrill Lynch survey showed that 90 percent of Americans felt that they were cruising toward retirement, many even envisioning it by 62. 
 Then the economy hit a few nasty bumps, smashing those golf-filled dreams. In Merrill's latest survey, just 47 percent feel that they have saved enough, with a third now expecting to labor past 65. And 15 percent don't bother to save at all -- mainly people in the lower brackets, but even some with high incomes, too. 
 In fact, many Americans are going deeper in debt, and of those who seek relief in "debt management" plans, those nearing retirement are in the biggest hole. In this group, women over 50 owe half their income, men nearly two-thirds. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: With a Big Victory, Japanese Premier Gains Momentum 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was re-elected leader of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party today in a decisive victory that could give him renewed momentum to push through reforms in the world's second largest economy and to keep nudging the country toward a more muscular role internationally.
 Buoyed by his personal popularity, Mr. Koizumi was chosen in the first round by party lawmakers and members, many of whom disagree with his reformist policies but need him as a standard-bearer in general elections. The prime minister, who won with more than 60 percent of the votes against three other challengers, said he would reshuffle his cabinet on Monday. 
 With the party's grip on Parliament, the victory almost certainly means Mr. Koizumi will win a second term as prime minister, in a general election likely to be held in November. Today's victory by Mr. Koizumi, 61, comes at a pivotal point for Japan, both domestically and internationally.
Mr. Koizumi has pledged to press ahead with the economic and political reforms undertaken since he became prime minister in April 2001. The reforms have met strong resistance from conservative members of his own party, including the three who ran against him.
"This election for party leader was an election for the L.D.P. to truly become the party of the people and the party of reform," Mr. Koizumi said in a short speech at the party's headquarters here.
At a news conference later, he pledged to "move ahead with the structural reforms that have been tackled thus far to revitalize the economy."
Under Mr. Koizumi, who has supported the Bush administration's war in Iraq and has sought to make Japan's military more assertive despite popular opposition and constitutional restrictions, Parliament passed a law in July authorizing the sending of 1,000 troops to Iraq. The government postponed initial plans to dispatch the troops by the end of this year after the bombing of the United Nations' headquarters in Baghdad.
American officials have been pressing Japan to send the troops quickly and to commit money to Iraq's reconstruction. President Bush is expected to focus on these points during his scheduled visit here on Oct. 17.
"Bush wants Koizumi to send troops right now," said Aiji Tanaka, a professor of politics at Waseda University here. "But Koizumi knows that sending troops right now would hurt him in the general elections in November. So Koizumi will probably wait until the general elections are over, and using the popularity he enjoys, he will probably send troops to Iraq."
Although sending troops to Iraq, which might place Japanese soldiers in combat for the first time since World War II, is of limited military significance, it would carry great symbolic significance for both the Bush administration and Japan.
At home, today's strong backing from his own party could embolden Mr. Koizumi's efforts to push through painful economic measures by cutting public spending, reforming the bank industry, letting weak companies fail and privatizing the postal service and road maintenance companies. His own party members especially have resisted the privatization plans, which would bring an end to appointed government jobs that have traditionally been used to reward party faithful. 
To win today, Mr. Koizumi secured the backing of several conservative power brokers inside the party, most notably Mikio Aoki, the leader of the lower house of Japan's Parliament. Mr. Akio, who has been one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Koizumi's reforms, clearly needs the prime minister's support in upper house elections next July. 
A test of how forcefully Mr. Koizumi plans to push ahead with reforms, or whether he is beholden to conservatives like Mr. Aoki, might come on Monday, when the prime minister reshuffles his cabinet. What happens to reformers like Heizo Takenaka, the economics and financial services minister who has been the focal point of conservative anger, will send out strong signals. 
Since it was formed in 1955, the Liberal Democratic Party has been divided into factions headed by powerful figures. The factions have been the traditional conduit for patronage, power and corruption, but have been weakened in recent years because of political reforms and Mr. Koizumi's policies.
Perhaps signaling the end of the party's factional system, lawmakers who hope to ride Mr. Koizumi's coattails in the coming general election revolted against their faction leaders to support Mr. Koizumi in today's vote. While not as wildly popular as he was when he was first elected in 2001, Mr. Koizumi still has a 50 percent approval rating, according to recent polls.
In today's party election, 357 lawmakers cast one vote each, and 300 votes were compiled from the party's 1.4 million members nationwide. Mr. Koizumi won 399 out of 657 votes, or almost 61 percent. 
Yasunori Sone, a professor of politics at Keio University here, said that Mr. Koizumi's support was especially strong among the party members nationwide, suggesting broad acceptance of his policies, even though his spending cuts and other reforms during his first term had hurt them most.
Mr. Koizumi will have a strong mandate to push through reforms, especially after upper house elections next July, Mr. Sone said. "There won't be any elections for three years after that," he added, "so he'll be able to do anything he wants."
Shizuka Kamei, 66, a former party policy chief, came in second in today's poll with 139 votes; Masahiko Komura, 61, a former foreign minister, received 54 votes; Takao Fujii, 60, a former transportation minister who, as the candidate of the biggest Liberal Democratic faction, would have normally been the winner in the past, won 65 votes. All three had advocated more public spending to revive the economy.
The collapse of the factions coincides with new challenges the party is facing from the decision by the two opposition parties, the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, to merge. The Democratic Party has had electoral successes in recent parliamentary by-elections, especially in urban areas and among young voters. The Liberal Democratic Party still draws strong support in rural areas and among older voters.
"Now, the next real choice: whether all the people and the voters really agree to maintain the Koizumi government or they want a change in power," Naoto Kan, the leader of the newly merged Democratic Party, said in a television interview after today's results.
Experts predict that Mr. Koizumi's party will hold on to power in the coming elections. But, in 2006, when term limits would force Mr. Koizumi to retire, it could lose its grip if no attractive successor emerges within the party, they say.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Bans Foreign Aid Workers From Embattled Province 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
The province of Aceh, where the United Nations estimates that 100,000 people have been displaced as a result of fighting there, is without any foreign aid workers because Indonesia has refused to give them permits, say officials with the United Nations and other organizations. 
 A World Health Organization worker, who left Aceh on Friday because his permit was about to expire, was the last international aid worker in the province, United Nations officials said. 
 The Indonesian government has justified the virtual ban by saying that foreigners are in danger of being kidnapped by the separatist rebels of the Free Aceh Movement. 
The government insists that it is capable of distributing food and health supplies to civilians who have fled their homes. Many are living in government camps.
The United States Agency for International Development, which ran a small program in Aceh, no longer has any American workers in the province, an American official said. 
The International Committee for the Red Cross has suspended its efforts to visit detainees held by both sides in the conflict after the government refused to issue permits to Red Cross workers that would allow them to travel in the province. 
The government's closed door is relatively unusual in a country that has received substantial development aid over many years from leading donors -- the United States, the European Union, Japan, the United Nations and the World Bank.
Soon after the government imposed martial law in Aceh in May, the secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, issued a statement urging Indonesia to ensure the safety of aid workers and ensure their access to people in need. Martial law continues. 
But Indonesia has ignored Mr. Annan's warning, and the question of foreign aid workers has become so urgent that it is likely to be raised with the Indonesian president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, when she visits the United Nations next week, senior United Nations officials said. 
The decision to keep foreign aid workers out of the province is enforced by a Ministry of Justice decree issued after the start of the army offensive on May 16. It sets up a special visa system for Aceh. 
United Nations officials said they requested 13 special visas for foreign staff workers in Aceh. Two were granted, and those have now expired, they said.
A Human Rights Watch report issued on Friday said that because of scant information it was difficult to assess precisely how the population of 4.2 million, most of whom live outside the two main cities, was surviving. But it was known that more than 500 schools had been burned down. The International Organization for Migration, a United Nations body, said 100,000 people had been displaced by the fighting, although many had since managed to return to their homes. 
The Indonesian government reacted angrily to the Human Rights Watch report. "It's very arrogant for an agency like Human Rights Watch to think that because they can't get access to certain places like Aceh, because they don't have eyes and ears and mouths, therefore the situation there is closed and there must be rights abuses," said the spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, Marty Natalegawa. 
Kontras, an Indonesian nongovernmental human rights group based in Jakarta, has been forced to work underground in Aceh, the group's director, Usman Hamid, said today.

HEADLINE: Divorce in South Korea: Striking a New Attitude 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Only a decade ago, Sunoo, one of South Korea's largest matchmaking services, had no divorced clients. Few Koreans divorced anyway, and deep social prejudice forced those who did to resign themselves to a life of solitude.
 Today, with a surging divorce rate that now ranks among the world's highest, divorced clients account for 15 percent of Sunoo's membership. But as with other agencies that match people looking to marry, Sunoo keeps its divorced members in a largely separate category. 
 "South Korea is in a transition," said Lee Woong Jin, 38, the agency's chief executive. "It's a reality that divorce is rising and will probably continue to rise. At the same time, we are adhering to traditional values." 
Rapidly changing attitudes toward divorce -- as well as such other issues as marriage, childbearing and cohabitation -- show a South Korea in the throes of a social transformation. Still anchored in Confucian values of family and patriarchy, South Korea is fast becoming an open, Westernized society -- with the world's highest concentration of Internet broadband users, a pop culture that has recently been breaking taboos left and right, and living patterns increasingly focusing on individual satisfaction.
Social changes that took decades in the West or Japan, sociologists here like to point out, are occurring here in a matter of years. In the last decade, South Korea's divorce rate swelled 250 percent, in keeping with women's rising social status. But it shot up even more after the economic crisis of 1997, which caused widespread unemployment and shook men's basic standing in the society and family, said Hwang Hee Bong, a deputy director at the Korea National Statistical Office.
"I personally feel a big change compared with five years ago," said Lee Yoon Jung, 33, who initiated divorce proceedings in 1998 after concluding that she and her husband could not resolve their personality conflicts. "People would say, 'How could you divorce? You absolutely cannot divorce.' Now, people say, 'If you aren't a good match, you don't necessarily have to stay together.' "
"I have a job and money," added Ms. Lee, who works for a shipping company. "If there is a good person, I'd like to get remarried. But I don't want to get restricted in a bad situation."
The divorce rate last year was 3 cases for every 1,000 people, government statistics show, up from 2 in 1997. 
In 2001, the rate was 2.8, which was above the European Union's average of 1.8 and Japan's 2.3, though below the United States' rate of 4.
"I think this overall trend will keep on rising," Mr. Hwang said.
Also, the marriage rate -- lower than the United States' and higher than Europe's and Japan's -- has been declining. People are marrying later and having fewer children. Last year, the birth rate was 1.17 children per woman, even lower than Japan's 1.32.
In addition, more young couples are defying a longtime taboo against living together, though they largely keep the fact hidden from their parents and co-workers. Moving in together has become such a phenomenon that a recent television series, "A Cat in the Rooftop Room," became a hit by tackling the issue. 
South Korean popular culture, perhaps like America's in the 1970's, is overflowing with taboo-shattering shows. Another hit television show, "The Woman Next Door" -- which has been called the Korean "Sex and the City" -- focuses on the marriages and extramarital affairs of three women in their 30's. The show describes a radical departure, social critics have pointed out, from the days when men engaged in affairs and wives endured in silence.
The longest-running of these shows, "Love and War," was the first to deal with divorce when it appeared four years ago and has consistently ranked in the top 10. It recreates stories of troubled marriages based on real cases, after which viewers vote on whether the couple should divorce. (The vote is for divorce in 80 percent of the episodes.)
Jang Seong Hwan, 46, the show's executive producer, said he created it after the spike in divorce in the wake of the 1997 economic crisis. "We wanted to bring on television issues that were never discussed in public, in part to stop the divorce rate from rising," Mr. Jang said. But some viewers have accused the show of encouraging divorce by giving the issue such prominence, he added.
Still, the program also shows the boundaries of social change. While it calls itself a reality-based show, only actors appear. "It's impossible to ask real couples to come," Mr. Jang said. "They would not want to reveal their faces and names."
Divorce, once almost nonexistent, first appeared in significant numbers in the 1970's, as Koreans moved from rural areas into cities, said Kwak Bae Hee, an expert on divorce and the president of the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations, a partly government-financed organization that counsels couples. Apartment-dwelling couples no longer living with their relatives felt less pressure to stay together.
Over the years, divorce laws that discriminated against women were also changed, Ms. Kwak said. But the surge in divorce in the 1990's, she said, came as women became better educated and more of them held jobs. Now women are more likely to feel that they are entitled to seek personal happiness, she said. The majority of divorces are initiated by women, and personality conflict is the reason cited most often.
"Men found the political and economic changes difficult to adapt to, but they thought that the family would at least stay the same," Ms. Kwak said. "But the fact is that of all the institutions in Korean society, the family may be the one that has undergone the biggest change."
Lee Ji Yong, 38, a civil engineer who earned his master's degree in the United States, married about a decade ago. His wife, a flight attendant with Northwest Airlines, chose to keep working after marrying. They have two daughters.
"There was a conflict from the start,"Mr. Lee said. "After work, I wanted her in the house, with her apron, preparing a hot meal for me. But she wanted her career."
His wife asked for a divorce, said Mr. Lee, and after consulting with his parents, he agreed. After their divorce last year, Mr. Lee joined Sunoo's remarriage section and became engaged to a divorced woman.
With a growing pool of divorced people, the chances of remarrying have increased, even though lingering prejudices confine the choices largely to other divorced people.
For the foreseeable future, matchmaking services, said Sunoo's Mr. Lee, will continue to introduce divorced people largely to one another. (Though in this youth-obsessed culture, women ages 32 and over are now confined to Sunoo's registry of the divorced.)
Yoo Hae Ok, 44, said she never expected to remarry after divorcing her husband 10 years ago, especially as a single mother of two boys. But with her children now in college, Ms. Yoo, who has been working as a remarriage adviser for a matchmaking service called Piery for the last five years, married a divorced man last year and is happy.
Yet she is aware that society still looks askance at divorced women, often labeling them promiscuous or heavy drinkers. 
"I'm very cautious about the way I behave at social gatherings," Ms. Yoo said. "If I make a mistake, people will say that's why I was divorced."
Talking openly about one's divorce is something Koreans still seldom do, and doing so brought tears to Ms. Yoo's eyes. "My husband was irresponsible toward the family," she said. "I was hoping that he would change -- he is my children's father, after all."
"Society has changed a lot," she added. "In the past, if men had affairs or neglected the family, our mothers and grandmothers would have tolerated that. Now women don't want to tolerate that kind of situation."

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM INDIANAPOLIS; 
With Respect, a State Pauses (Even Its Politicians)

BYLINE:  By Monica Davey

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
This is the time of year when the legislators have gone home and the Indiana Capitol stands mostly empty and silent.
 On Thursday, large crowds returned, passing through the oversize wood doors and down the long, creamy marble halls all day and late into the evening. But the normal hubbub of workaday government, all clicking heels and purposeful chatter, did not. 
 Instead, there was a hush. The people who filtered in beneath the line of ornate chandeliers took gentle steps, somberly processing past three wooden panels covered in photographs of Frank L. O'Bannon. 
Mr. O'Bannon, who died last weekend from a stroke, was governor -- and in many cases boss -- to the lawyers and bureaucrats, staffers and flacks, officials and regular people filing by. But in their whispers, they spoke of him more like a grandfather, someone who had never seemed quite scary enough to be chief executive.
Here was Mr. O'Bannon as a gangly high schooler, suited up for his basketball squad, the 1946 Corydon Panthers. There was Mr. O'Bannon dancing with his wife, Judy. Mr. O'Bannon fishing. Mr. O'Bannon surrounded by his family in their Christmas card. Mr. O'Bannon with his signature twinkling grin and reassuring thumbs up.
Farther down the hall, in the vast rotunda, Mr. O'Bannon's official portrait was flanked by two state police officers, who wore full dress uniforms and stood rigidly at attention. They made oddly formal companions to the friendly-looking fellow in the picture.
Tyree Coleman, a bailiff in the county court here, moved slowly and grim-faced through the images. He used to cut the governor's grass. "It's rare when you find a politician who isn't a politician," said Mr. Coleman, 23. "He was truly a down-home individual."
Perhaps not surprisingly, all politicking stopped in Indianapolis this week -- the result of good manners, of course, but also affection.
The sorrowful pause, in a state with a raging governor's race, has been almost as awkward for Mr. O'Bannon's friends as it has been for his enemies. As partisan competition went on hold, people mourned and tried to sort out what an appropriate memorial break might be in a case like this. As one politician here pointed out unhappily this week, there is no rule book on such things.
The battle for Mr. O'Bannon's job grew fierce long before Mr. O'Bannon's stroke -- and, in some cases, even before the 2000 presidential election votes were counted in Florida. Mr. O'Bannon, a Democrat and a powerful veteran of the state's party, could not have run again. State term limits would have required him to leave office in 16 months, at the end of his second four years. And the crowd of politicians who aspired to run for governor in 2004 knew that an open seat would be easier to win. 
By the time Mr. O'Bannon was hospitalized less than two weeks ago, the campaign had reached a rolling boil with the election still more than a year away. A few weeks before, the Democrats had held a straw poll for their candidates in French Lick. And earlier this month, President Bush appeared here with the most prominent Republican contender, the former White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. He called him "my man Mitch."
Sometime soon -- probably next week -- the politicking will resume. Political operatives here have already begun privately trying to sort out what exactly Governor O'Bannon's death may mean for the race now.
It is never easy to run against the record of a likable person, as some O'Bannon opponents acknowledged they learned years ago. Crass as it may sound, it is only that much harder to run against the record of a likable person who has just died.
Still, Mr. O'Bannon's overall ratings had dipped significantly in the past few years, mostly because of the economic downturn that pounded Indiana even harder than other states. The state, which has a strong manufacturing base, lost thousands of jobs. Foreclosures and bankruptcies soared. State revenues sank. 
So the next governor's challenge had seemed obvious: find a way to turn things around by bringing in new jobs, retraining workers, growing state coffers or cutting costs. And Republicans saw their chance to retake the governor's job after 16 years, in a state that has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964.
But now, running against the O'Bannon record suddenly looks far less palatable. 
"There may be less use of the word 'O'Bannon,' " Luke Messer, the executive director of the state's Republican Party, acknowledged the other day in an interview in the party's headquarters, a few blocks from the Capitol. "I think there will still be describing of the Democratic leadership, more generally, over the past 16 years." 
That could be a tricky line to walk. 
Mr. Daniels, one of four Republican candidates, said this week that he had always "admired and praised" the governor as a person, and would miss him a lot. "I never did and never would have anything critical to say about him," he said. "I am campaigning against the decline of our state."
Another question has emerged that will nag at all the candidates, Republican or Democrat. With Mr. O'Bannon's death, Lt. Gov. Joseph E. Kernan, his longtime Democratic running mate and his close friend, was sworn in as governor.
Mr. Kernan, a former South Bend mayor and a P.O.W. in Vietnam, had once been seen as the likeliest Democrat to replace Mr. O'Bannon, but he announced last year that he would not run. He said he was thinking about going home to South Bend, and maybe helping to buy the minor league baseball team there.
Democrats -- who had seen Mr. Kernan as their strongest candidate -- are now likely to urge him to reconsider, particularly since he would have the potent advantage of incumbency.
Mr. Kernan has been asked about it a lot the past few weeks. On a recent afternoon, he seemed weary of the question. "As I have said, nothing that's happened in the last 10 days has caused me to change my mind," he said. 
Some here -- particularly some among the current candidates, who would be most affected by the threat of Mr. Kernan -- say they feel certain he will not run. One candidate, Joe Andrew, the former national Democratic chairman, said he was "completely convinced" of that. 
But others wonder, perhaps hopefully, if Mr. Kernan might step in one of these days and make a fiery race even more of a fight.
On Friday afternoon, thousands poured onto the mall outside the Capitol, where Mr. O'Bannon had held his first inaugural, to which he had invited all of the state's fourth graders.
Indiana people, the new governor told those at the memorial, have been arguing for years about the word "Hoosier," the nickname for state residents. "I think we know what the definition is," Mr. Kernan said. "It's Frank O'Bannon."
A group of children played "Back Home Again in Indiana" as Mrs. O'Bannon sang along. A pack of doves was released. An honor guard set off a 19-round artillery salute, breaking the quiet and sending a puff of white smoke into the sky over the Capitol.

HEADLINE: State Gives Museum $5 Million 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
ARENOVATION and expansion plan that would more than double the size of the New Britain Museum of American Art took a giant step toward reality last week when Connecticut donated $5 million for the project.
 The announcement of the financing was made last Wednesday by Gov. John G. Rowland, who appeared at the museum at a ceremony attended by trustees, donors and volunteers. 
 "As the Governor said, this really turbocharges our campaign," said Douglas Hyland, director of the museum. "Everyone is just enthused and revitalized by this news."
Individual and corporate donors have already raised $11 million for the project, which is expected to cost $25 million. This is the first capital campaign for the institution, which has an extensive collection of American art, including canvases by painters of the Hudson River School, and murals by Thomas Hart Benton. The museum is celebrating its centennial this year.
The project is a bold move in a fragile economy when other cultural institutions in the area are reconsidering construction plans.
The larger and better-known Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, for instance, has decided to forego its planned $80 million expansion and renovation plan and may pursue a more modest goal. But Mr. Hyland said the time was right for New Britain.
"The impetus is the ever-growing influence of the museum in this region," said Mr. Hyland, who left the San Antonio Museum of Art to become director here four years ago.
Mr. Hyland said museum visitors reflected the city's diversity. "We've become a hub for a variety of different community groups," he said.
The museum certainly needs more space. It is housed in a circa 1903 house, with room for just 4 percent of the 5,000 works in the collection to be on view. The current museum is 25,000 square feet. The renovated building, with the additions, would be 53,000 square feet.
The main house of the existing museum, which has a 15-year-old addition, includes galleries with fireplaces, wood floors that creak underfoot and library tables topped with art books and fresh flowers. A visitor wandering through the rooms feels a bit like a very lucky guest at a party in a grand house whose owners have exquisite taste. Mr. Hyland said he wanted the new museum to retain elements of that charm.
The plan was designed by Ann Beha, a Boston architect. In addition to new galleries, it calls for a new lobby, program space, auditorium, studios and gift shop.
To rise to the expectations of today's museumgoers, the project will also include an amenity the museum does not have -- a cafe. It will overlook Walnut Hill Park, a Frederick Law Olmsted design whose tree-dotted hills cause viewers to double-take from canvas to window in the gallery of American Impressionists.
The renovation will also address some mundane but essential needs. A recently purchased adjacent half-acre of land will become a parking lot; on-street parking is the only current choice.
Construction is expected to begin next summer and to take two years. The museum will not close during construction, but its hours may be abbreviated.

Loving the Landscape That We Call Home

BYLINE:  By HELEN A. HARRISON

 BODY:
LONG Island landscape painting celebrates its bicentenary this year, and exhibitions in Setauket and East Hampton prove that the local landscape continues to inspire contemporary artists. 
 The earliest known example of landscape painting here is an 1803 watercolor by Elizabeth Sleight of Sag Harbor. As the United States's first port of entry, Sag Harbor was a center of maritime commerce, especially in the early 19th century. Ms. Sleight's charming view of the village's harbor, a copy of which is in Sag Harbor's John Jermain Library, shows the port at the dawn of its heyday, with the wharves, warehouses and other amenities for the cargo ships and whaling vessels that linked the East End to New England and the wider world. 
 But the landscape tradition did not really take root here until the mid 19th century, after the Hudson River School painters had established a taste for scenic vistas. William Sidney Mount, a Setauket native, was among the first to exploit this new enthusiasm, painting studies of the Island's rural life that combined human interest with lovingly rendered views of the environment.
After 1845, as the expanding railroad simplified travel to and from New York City, more people were drawn to the East End's rustic villages and unspoiled maritime scenery. Paintings of shingled cottages, jaunty sailboats, ocean bathers and lighthouses began to appear in the city's galleries.
 Even then, there was nostalgia for the simple pleasures of country living, which lured artists and tourists alike. In 1852, the East Hampton novelist Cornelia Huntington wrote that the area's reputation had already encouraged "troops of seekers after change to explore all the sweet secluded nooks and shady retreats" and "take possession by right of discovery."
 The work of contemporary landscape artists shares Mount's reverence for the vistas of rural Long Island, but is also occasionally tinged with the ambivalence expressed in Ms. Huntington's observation. 
 At Lizan-Tops Gallery in East Hampton, the 10th annual Long Island landscape exhibition focuses on "Preserving the Landscape." The theme highlights issues raised by the town's proposal for a plan on growth. Whether implicitly or directly, much of the art depicts an environment threatened by development and the loss of agricultural and maritime enterprises. 
 Among the most poignant images are Joan Baren's drawings of old East End farmhouses and outbuildings, shown falling into disrepair and surrounded by neglected gardens and fallow fields. Her delicate, feathery line technique weaves together natural and man-made forms, stressing the harmony of the structures and their surroundings, but also their fragility.
 The farms in Ralph Carpentier's paintings look more substantial, with occasional humans and animals to indicate active use. Countering the area's reputation as a summer resort, he includes a couple of snow scenes that emphasize the low density of agricultural settlement, with a few clustered buildings surrounded by open fields.
 In "Harvest," a 1983 canvas, Robert Dash focuses on the land's richness. In the image, lush foliage creates patterns of dappled sunlight on the freshly turned earth.
 The shoreline is another favorite subject for local landscapists, among them Mr. Carpentier, Jane Freilicher, Mike Solomon, Cynthia Knott and Christian Brechneff.
 Mr. Solomon's watercolor sketches of deserted ocean beaches -- diaristic observations by an avid surfer -- sensitively record specific times and weather conditions, while Ms. Freilicher's oil, "The Beginning of Summer," documents the view from the artist's Water Mill studio. Her earliest paintings of this subject showed an uninterrupted vista to the pond and dunes beyond, but now the land is punctuated by beach houses, the area's primary cash crop.
 Janet Jennings's studies of tidal inlets highlight the interaction of land and water. In her "Pond of Pines" paintings, glowing reflections contrast with the earthy tones of marsh grass and surrounding woods.
 In Setauket, Gallery North's annual "Local Color" exhibition is similar in content, although less pointed in its references to change and potential loss.
Doug Reina's bright, sunny beach scenes, with old-fashioned summer cottages up on stilts at the water's edge, celebrate the unpretentious type of waterfront development that has been supplanted by McMansions on the dunes. The warm glow of afternoon creates a cozy feeling in Marion McManus' "Salt Air," with its distant view of shoreline cottages seen across a grassy field. Both artists suggest that smaller is better, more in tune with the natural environment.
 Wooden boats staked to the shore in Dominick DiLorenzo's "Mooring on Hallock's Bay" affirm the joys of rowing and sailing -- no noisy, oily outboard motors for the purists who own these pleasure craft. The tranquil scene, with water gently lapping against an unpaved launching ramp, is an homage to the "sweet secluded nooks" that are so abundant on the coast. Carlina Valenti's lovingly rendered still lifes of farm stand produce are reminders that agriculture continues to be a mainstay of the local economy, even if the market is increasingly tied to tourism. But that trend has a long history. Looking back over the Island's landscape painting tradition, one can see the evidence that people have come here "to rusticate and rest," as Huntington put it, for the better part of two centuries.
 "Preserving the Landscape" is at Lizan-Tops Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton, (631)324-3424, through Sept. 28. "Local Color" is at Gallery North, 90 North Country Road, Setauket, (631)751-2676, through Sept. 24.

A Corner Transformed, and Jobs Created

BYLINE:  By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
ON a busy day this summer, it was standing room only in Fortunoff's cramped human resources office on East Post Road. 
 The reason for the anxious hordes was simple: The company received 9,000 resumes of applicants for the 700 new jobs at its new store here. If you're a company hiring 700 new employees in a little more than four months, you have got to interview at least eight people for each one you hire, according to Norman Goldberg, a former chief executive officer who was invited back by the Fortunoff family to supervise marketing and advertising for the new store. 
 Fortunoff, the family-owned jewelry and home furnishings store, opened a new 185,000-square-foot store in White Plains this week, and began hiring employees on May 17. Since then, Mr. Goldberg and his staff have interviewed 4,800 people. During July, the peak hiring season, Fortunoff was interviewing between 140 and 160 people a day, Mr. Goldberg said. 
"There are people out there who need work, and we have work," he said. Mr. Goldberg, who always comes to work dressed in a suit and tie, said that he conducted at least two interviews a day himself, "because I don't want to walk into the store and say, 'Did I hire these people?"'
Since early summer, Fortunoff has hired about 650 employees between the ages of 18 and 72. Half live in Westchester County, and half are full-time workers, Mr. Goldberg said. The company is still hiring, with a special effort to recruit on nearby college campuses, with a goal of 750 employees by the end of this month, which will make Fortunoff among the top 25 largest private sector employers in Westchester.
After spending 20 years trying to find a suitable location in Westchester, Louis Fortunoff, executive vice president, said he is ecstatic that the store is built and open for customers, and "we're ready to show Westchester what we're all about."
Eighty years ago, Mr. Fortunoff's grandparents opened a store on Livonia Avenue in Brooklyn that sold just pots and pans. In time, the early Fortunoff included seven shops in New York City, with the first suburban store opening in Westbury on Long Island in 1964. Today, still a privately held family business, it is run by nine family members, all executive vice presidents, including Mr. Fortunoff's mother, Helene, who started Fortunoff's jewelry department in 1957.
The White Plains store is the sixth in the chain, which is based in Uniondale on Long Island. (Other locations are on Long Island, in New Jersey and Manhattan.) The new store is in a newly built four-story building on a somewhat neglected corner of White Plains, just opposite The Westchester mall and down the road from the Westchester Pavilion. The top three floors will house Fortunoff. There, customers will have a choice of 5,000 watches, 10,000 pairs of earrings, 15,000 Christmas ornaments and decorations, 1,500 clocks, 70 decorated beds and even 15 imported bathroom sinks.
The street-level floor will include two restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory, a national chain based in Calabasas Hills, Calif., which is now open, and Morton's, the Steakhouse. The steakhouse and Whole Foods Market, an outpost of a grocery store chain from Austin, Tex., are both set to open in spring of 2004.
This combination, of Fortunoff merchandise along with two successful restaurant chains and an organic food market, is a smart marketing move, said Howard Davidowitz, owner of Davidowitz & Associates Inc., a national retail consulting firm in New York City
"First, Fortunoff married jewelry and home furnishing, and now they've added food to generate footsteps," he said, adding that "the place will be an extravaganza."
Despite the struggling national economy, Mr. Fortunoff said he expects the store to do at least $86 million in sales during the first year. "Westchester is the most resilient of all the regions in the metropolitan New York area, and has the lowest unemployment," he said. 
The six-acre site, at the corner of Maple Avenue and Bloomingdale Road, had been occupied by Saks Fifth Avenue for 50 years, and was sold to Fortunoff in 2001 for $14 million. Mr. Fortunoff said the company spent $66 million on construction, $12 million on legal and other fees and $12 million on interior design and fixtures. 
The 265,000-square-foot development was financed by a $72 million taxable bond issued by the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency and backed by a letter of credit from a five-member bank group, led by Buffalo-based M & T Bank, Mr. Fortunoff said. 
Issuing a taxable bond for a retail business was highly unusual for Westchester's Industrial Development Agency, said Theresa G. Waivada, the agency's executive director. But the Fortunoff project was eligible because it was adjacent to a census tract with a high poverty and unemployment rate, and because it was part of a White Plains downtown revitalization, she explained.
The project was important for the city and the county, she said, "so that this prime piece of property would not remain vacant, and because it will generate a great deal of sales tax." 
Ms. Waivada's agency also gave Fortunoff a sales tax exemption on construction costs worth $1 million. 
The county's foregone tax revenue and other aid to the project will bring substantial returns, Ms. Waivada said. The development "will generate multiple visits, and people who work there will shop in downtown White Plains," she said, adding that "everything sold in that complex is subject to sales tax."
Mr. Fortunoff estimated that the complex should bring in about $9.9 million in city, county and state tax revenues the first year, about $6.7 million of that from Fortunoff alone. 
The birth of the new Fortunoff store has many county officials as proud as new parents of quadruplets. "It provides a central marketplace for Westchester and the surrounding area," said the County Executive Andrew J. Spano. "There's a certain panache about Fortunoff." 
Because Fortunoff is privately owned and does not disclose financial statements, the company's profits and operating costs are not made available to stock analysts. "There are very few private companies in America of Fortunoff's size where the family is still running it," Mr. Davidowitz said. But with a financial investment as large as the one in the new White Plains store, he said, "the family is playing 'You Bet Your Life,' and their lives are on the line."
One of the lucky new employees is Bernard Danuff of Syosset on Long Island, who at 72 has been in the jewelry business for 50 years, and has also been a Fortunoff customer. After he was hired, he took about 200 hours of training before he began to sell fine watches in White Plains this week.
Not so lucky was Russell Brod, 60, of White Plains, who was interviewed twice for a job in store design and display, and spent four days working at several Fortunoff stores rearranging rooms of furniture. "I was a little disappointed, but I can't be angry with someone who doesn't hire me," he said. Though he didn't get the job, he still got four days of pay.

HEADLINE: Hospital Cuts Ties to St. Agnes 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
WHEN Westchester Medical Center decided to abandon the former St. Agnes Hospital not long ago, only five months after a rather hasty but much-praised marriage, questions were raised immediately about what had caused the sudden split.
 Depending on who is answering, several reasons for the split may be given, and all of them seem to relate to money. The medical center in Valhalla took over St. Agnes after it gave up its medical license in April under crushing debt. Just two months ago, everybody from the chief executive of the medical center to the creditors of St. Agnes, a small Catholic hospital in White Plains, seemed optimistic about the union. Then, suddenly, a little more than a week ago, Westchester Medical said it would end the partnership in early October at the close of a six-month trial period. 
 Mary de Barros, a spokeswoman for the former St. Agnes, said the cause was $36 million in debt that St. Agnes had accrued in a loan from the New York State Dormitory Authority in 2001. 
Whoever runs St. Agnes will need to pay close to $3 million annually on the debt to the Dormitory Authority, said the authority's spokeswoman, Claudia Hutton. The medical center didn't make debt payments in the six-month trial period, by agreement with the dormitory authority, and it didn't settle on a permanent repayment plan before it took over St. Agnes.
Gene Capello, the chairman of the medical center's board, said the split was the result of conclusions drawn in a recent consultant report commissioned by the medical center. 
"The report says that we will lose $7 million a year by operating the St. Agnes campus," said Mr. Capello, who received the report earlier this month. "We haven't even considered the Dormitory Authority debt."
The consultant's report said the medical center as a whole lost $58 million on $500 million of revenue in 2002, before St. Agnes was even in the picture, Mr. Capello said. In July, Edward Stolzenberg, the medical center's chief executive, told reporters that the medical center's loss for 2002 was more than $10 million and less than $15 million. 
Craig Kornett, an analyst at Fitch Ratings who specializes in the health care industry, said that the large loss incurred last year at the medical center is unusual even among cash-strapped hospitals, but that the hospital is not yet in any danger of closing.
Both Mr. Capello and Carin Grossman, a hospital spokeswoman, said this week that Mr. Stolzenberg, 57, is going to retire at the end of this year because of heart problems. Ms. Grossman said that decision and the financial troubles of the medical center are not related. Through Ms. Grossman, Mr. Stolzenberg declined to comment for this article.
Richard L. Brodsky, the state assemblyman from Greenburgh who leads an Assembly committee overseeing the Dormitory Authority, blames the state agency.
"We had asked the Dormitory Authority to work out a financial plan with St. Agnes and Westchester Medical Center so they aren't losing so much money," Mr. Brodsky said, "but the agency refused to do it."
Ms. Hutton said the Dormitory Authority, which issues bonds on Wall Street, cannot restructure debt payments since money is paid to bondholders periodically.

HEADLINE: Group of 7's Economic Officials Urge Reopening of Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
On a day that included discussions ranging from terrorist financing to disclosures of questionable uses of public funds by the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, representatives of the Group of Seven richest nations called for the resumption of world trade talks and a global commitment to market-based exchange rates for currencies.
 In a communique released this evening, the Group of 7 said it "reaffirms that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals," a statement that was a barely disguised criticism of the currency policies of China and Japan. Central bankers around the globe have routinely criticized both countries for intervening in currency markets to keep their currencies artificially low, policies that also lower their export prices and thus boost their share of international trade. 
 China, which has long protected its currency to guard against the vicissitudes of global economic swings, successfully weathered the currency panics that beset many of its Asian neighbors during the late 1990's and is unlikely to change its policy to appease the Group of 7. Japan, on the other hand, is something of a wild card. Although the yen rose to a two-and-a-half year high against the dollar on Friday in anticipation that the Bank of Japan would start buying yen to comply with the organization's wishes, currency traders may be overestimating how collegial Japan truly is. In the past, Japan has voiced its commitment to Group of 7 directives, only to then turn around and do the exact opposite.
The Group of 7 -- which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States -- gathered during the annual World Bank and International Monetary Fund meeting here.
At a news conference during today's meeting, Karim Nashashibi, the I.M.F.'s representative in the West Bank and Gaza, disclosed an audit of the Palestinian Authority's finances that indicated that, since 1999, Mr. Arafat has channeled about $900 million in public funds into a bank account he controls. The funds were invested in nearly six dozen enterprises in the Palestinian territories and overseas. Mr. Nashashibi said he received the information about Mr. Arafat's accounts from the Palestinian Authority. The authority's finance minister, Salam Fayad, who has called for greater openness in his organization's accounting, attended today's meeting here and won commitments of more than $1 billion in financial aid for the Palestinians from industrialized countries.
It is unclear if any of the funds diverted by Mr. Arafat were misused. Mr. Nashashibi said that a final determination on that point awaits the completion of the audits.
Hanan Ashwari, a Palestinian legislator and onetime Arafat spokeswoman, acknowledged there had been incidents of misuse of funds in the past but that the release of the information was an attempt to discredit the Palestinian leader.
"There is nothing innocent about the timing," she said. "This is a campaign against the president and the authority."
Mr. Snow convened a meeting tonight with finance ministers from most of the major Persian Gulf states -- including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. -- as well as Russia, Indonesia, Pakistan, India and the Philippines, in order to discuss greater global cooperation to counter terrorism and terrorist financing. Financial ministers said that countries are beginning to show a greater willingness to join hands in the effort, but that significant cultural and jurisdictional hurdles remain.

HEADLINE: Hunting for a Sitcom Hit Among the Misses 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
This is what the television comedy desert looks like: a stark, white, fluorescent-lighted writing room in the Billy Wilder building on the Paramount Studios lot. The room, the working quarters for the writers on a new ABC sitcom "It's All Relative," is furnished with nothing more than a long, wooden table, a couple of blackboards and a high stack of blank yellow legal pads, awaiting ideas. Nourishment lies solely with a pile of Polly-O string cheese and bottled water.
 Hollywood manufactures television comedy in drab, institutional rooms like this one every year. But the rooms have not produced a wildly popular sitcom in more than five years, since the debut of "Will & Grace" in 1998. It is one of only three such droughts in television history, a dry spell that has cost the television industry millions upon millions in unrealized profits while prompting dire pronouncements that the network sitcom -- a staple since "I Love Lucy" more than 50 years ago -- is dying. 
 But as the broadcast networks have done every fall for the past half century, they are betting a midsized nation's gross domestic product that they have sitcom hits in their new schedules. The new season officially starts Monday, and the six main broadcast networks are offering a total of 19 new sitcoms. So confident is ABC about "It's All Relative," the network is giving it the coveted time slot before its hit reality show, "The Bachelor," on Wednesday nights, beginning Oct. 1.
With the death of the actor John Ritter raising questions about whether one of ABC's most-watched comedies, "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter," can thrive without him, the network needs "It's All Relative" to succeed more than ever. Sunday's Emmy Awards ceremony only underscores the network's need for popular shows: ABC had the fewest nominations of all of the major broadcast networks this year, and less than a third of HBO's total. 
"It's All Relative" has all the trappings of the traditional sitcom: It is about a soon-to-be-married couple from very different worlds. The producers, however, have come up with a twist -- the woman was raised by highly educated, wealthy gay men, while her fiance is the son of two bigoted Irish Catholic barkeepers.
Other than that contemporary plot complication, they are sticking to all the elements of the shop-worn sitcom -- the laugh track, the stilted, four-camera filming style, standard-issue sets. Success, they say, will not come from blowing up the sitcom form. Instead, smarter execution of the broad-based family-style comedy, from casting to writing, will lead to ratings nirvana.
Yet whatever hopes the ABC executives and the producers might have for the show, the chances of success are as unlikely as the prospective in-laws becoming best friends. It is a mathematical certainty that most new sitcoms fail each fall, even in good times. And as the show's producers grapple with both the supposed staleness of the sitcom and the nation's changing but still unsettled views on gay issues, they still must confront the usual (and often treacherous) creative tensions with network bosses.
That tension was evident on one of the staff's very first days in their new writing room in early July. The first matter on the agenda was a seemingly simple one: the name of the show. But network television is made by committee, and simplicity is often elusive.
The first episode carried the "It's All Relative" title, which the main writer-producer team of Chuck Ranberg and Anne Flett-Giordano believed to be too generic. The writers were lobbying for "Family Outing." ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, though, had settled on "The Out-Laws," Mr. Ranberg told his team, another play on "out of the closet." The news was not taken well.
The writers, venting their frustration with the network, dashed off a list with dozens of other tongue-in-cheek title possibilities, including "Home O' Sexuals" and others that would not be suitable for print.
But Mr. Ranberg and Ms. Flett-Giordano have been through bigger challenges in their careers. Veterans of the sitcom wars, they lived through the travails of their last prime-time effort, "Encore! Encore!" in 1998 -- a significant comedown from their previous jobs on "Frasier" and "Kate and Allie."
With the actor Nathan Lane playing a Lothario opera singer-turned-vineyard owner, "Encore! Encore!" became a punch line for jokes about outlandishly bad television. Upon its debut The New York Observer wrote, "It's the 'Moose Murders' of sitcoms -- it won't be here past Halloween, but the recollection of its awfulness will give you untold delight for years to come."
"I spent three months in bed," Ms. Flett-Giordano said, recalling the experience.
Ultimately that show, Ms. Flett-Giordano said, was thevictim of television bureaucracy. She and Mr. Ranberg wanted the show to have a Broadway theme, while Mr. Lane wanted his character to be a chef. When they decided their differences were irreconcilable it was too late; the studio and the network had expended too much time and energy to landing a big star like Mr. Lane to turn back. The writers and Mr. Lane had to come up with something, quickly, she said, and the womanizing opera singer was born. NBC, which is owned by the General Electric Company, canceled the show by the winter.
"It's All Relative," in contrast, originated with Lloyd Braun, the chairman of ABC Entertainment. Given that corporate imprimatur and direction, everyone involved with the show knew essentially what it was from the start.
To produce the show, Susan Lyne, the president of ABC Entertainment, turned to producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, who had helped make her executive career when she was head of ABC's television movie unit by delivering productions including "Annie" and "Life With Judy Garland." Their idea for the program, she said, had what the others were lacking: a Romeo & Juliet central theme.
Mr. Meron and Mr. Zadan teamed up with Ms. Flett-Giordano and Mr. Ranberg, and the four agreed with ABC executives they would stick with the typical sitcom form, despite its bad name these days.
There are numerous theories about what is behind the drought in new comedies. A war-weary nation is not in the mood to laugh, some say. Others point to ever-larger corporate overlords who are draining the creativity out of television. But the leading theory holds that audiences have become bored with a seemingly tired form, where jokes could be spotted two commercial breaks away and laugh tracks erupt for comic bits that would have turned a packed comedy club silent.
Yet attempts to change the format have largely failed on network television. "The Job," which ABC placed on its schedule in 2001 and 2002, had no laugh track, used one camera instead of the usual four, and had a rogue cop as its central character. Critics loved it; audiences did not. Numerous shows on Fox that tried to revitalize the half-hour comedy, like "Greg the Bunny" (about foul-mouthed puppets) and "The Tick" (about underperforming superheroes), also flamed out in the ratings.
While Fox, which is owned by the News Corporation, is not shunning unconventional sitcoms this television season -- one new show, "Arrested Development," has no laugh track and a wacky central premise revolving around a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation -- ABC has decided to embrace the old style to achieve a ratings renaissance.
"The form has a bad name because a lot of the product has not been good," Mr. Meron said in an interview. "But it's worked from 'I Love Lucy' through 'Mary Tyler Moore' through 'Frasier.' "
"It's all about writing compelling characters that people want to spend time with every week," Ms. Flett-Giordano said. "The magic of 'Cheers' was you wanted to spend time in that bar because you liked those people."
That can mean taking jokes out, she said, even though the current vogue calls for packing as many jokes into a minute as it can hold.
"You can't sacrifice your characters for a good joke," Ms. Flett-Giordano said. "If it hurts your character's character, then you're doing more hurt than good for the laugh of the moment." For example, in one scene of an early episode of "It's All Relative," the groom-to-be complains to his fiancee about her "gay Gestapo" parents. Although the line was a favorite of the writers, the producers and network executives felt the line was too harsh for a likeable character. 
Mr. Meron and Mr. Zadan both said they believe another way to revitalize the sitcom form is by looking for actors from a different milieu, namely the theater. "With a lot of actors the problem is you might find they're funny in a room, but you put them in front of a live audience, they fall flat," Mr. Zadan said. "They don't have the comic timing that comes from acting in a theater."
Although three of the four parents are played by actors with considerable experience on Broadway, the cast member considered crucial to the show's success is Lenny Clarke. Mr. Clarke, a longtime stand-up comedian and player on sitcoms including "Lenny" and "The John Larroquette Show," plays the Irish Catholic father, Mason "Mace" O'Neill.
Mr. Clarke's character, executives said, represents another essential tactic in their attempt to recapture the same sitcom magic Norman Lear had with shows like "All in the Family" and "Maude." Test audiences, executives said, seem to accept insulting and off-color lines from Mr. Clarke that they might not accept from other actors.
So far, the producers and writers said, ABC has granted them leeway in feeding Mr. Clarke's character the controversial lines that will give the show its real seasoning.
But when it comes to content, some realities of big business are insurmountable. During a writing room discussion of a scene to take place at a movie theater Ms. Flett-Giordano noted that the movie the characters are watching cannot be "something in conflict" with Walt Disney, ABC's parent. (The writers have also had to refrain from mentioning brand names on the program so as not to possibly promote the products of competitors to ABC advertisers.)
The network executives do not limit their suggestions -- and to some of the writers, their meddling -- to concerns about corporate positioning. When the group submitted its first script the network deemed it somewhat lacking in character development and in what executives call "emotional threads." In the episode's main plotline, the blue-collar groom-to-be, Bobby, fumbles with the cappuccino machine in the pristine home of his in-laws-to-be and causes an attached pipe to break in the adjoining wall. He has to call his parents to come and help him fix it before his fiancee and her parents come home.
Stephanie Leifer, the ABC executive in charge of comedy development, said she asked the writers to "get beyond the funny of escalating mishaps" in the house.
"I was just making sure that as they're breaking this, it's not just about a pipe breaking," she added. "What is the underlying thing? What is this saying in the end about him? Is this ultimately something between him and Liz?"
She and Ms. Lyne said that if those questions are not addressed, audiences will tune out.
But for all the thought that had gone into accounting for audience reactions, executives had not prepared for any significant backlash over the show's gay theme. And the taping of the second episode in August brought with it an unwelcome surprise.
In one early scene, when the gay fathers kissed goodbye, on the lips, some in the audience groaned loudly.
Still, at the end of the taping the writers were feeling confident about the show's prospects. The taping was over by 11 p.m. Often a badly run show can go into the wee hours of the morning, as the writers traipse back and forth between the writers' room and the studio reworking scenes. And most of the audience stuck around to the end.
Before the audience was sent home, the stagehands brought out a cake with a few birthday candles. It was the birthday of Maggie Lawson, the actress who plays the fiancee, Liz. The audience sang "Happy Birthday" to her, and before she blew out the candles, someone yelled, "Make a wish!" Ms. Flett-Giordano shouted out her own: "Syndication!"

 Stanley Fish ("Colleges Caught in a Vise," Op-Ed, Sept. 18) is right to point out the difficulties faced by colleges and universities,whose costs are rising faster than their ability to collect tuition from parents or subsidies from government. 
 The fact that we have members of Congress so unfamiliar with basic economics that they think they can legislate lower tuition is simply one more illustration of basic and pervasive political failure in Washington.
As our economy becomes more and more dependent upon cheap foreign labor, anything produced wholly within our home economy -- including our system of higher education along with other routine economic functions like infrastructure, building construction and medical care -- will become increasingly unaffordable.
Unless we want to send our kids to college in Brazil or China, we're going to have to quit looking for people to blame and face up to the costs involved.

Doubtless Stanley Fish (Op-Ed, Sept. 18) is correct in his analysis of the economic squeeze facing most major public universities. 
Yet he does not address a major factor that is contributing to the problem. 
 As Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, has emphasized, our colleges are out of touch with the mainstream of American society. Many observers view the faculty as a group of left-leaning obscurantists more concerned with the subtleties of poststructuralism than with providing basic instruction. 
 As with all stereotypes, this perception is at best a partial truth. Yet our universities need to address the issue and, if necessary, make corrections. 
Until this is done, they are likely to find that legislators will continue to be skeptical about the need for more funds. In this they are reflecting the doubts of the public at large.

In the Market for a New Job? Start Packing

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In theory, at least, you might want to move to Atlanta to find a new job. After all, that city and its suburbs have gained more than 47,000 jobs in the last year, while the New York metropolitan area has lost more than 50,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Looking for someplace more exotic? The area around McAllen, Tex., has the fastest-growing job market in the nation, according to the bureau -- though the 6,000 or so jobs it has gained in the last 12 months would barely make a dent in New York's unemployment problem. On the other hand, you can walk to Mexico from McAllen -- and it claims to be one of the cheapest places to live in the entire country. 
 New York State chauvinists might want to consider the Albany area, where, the State Department of Labor reported last week, the private-sector employment base has grown by 2,400 jobs in the 12 months ended August. Government jobs, on the other hand, have been disappearing, leaving the total job count down by 400.
The reverse situation prevails on Long Island, where the total number of jobs has jumped by 3,000, but the number of jobs in the private sector actually declined by 100.
Still, the suburbs -- especially the northern suburbs -- have been chugging along awfully well, economically speaking, even as the city has been sinking. Westchester, for example, added 2,100 jobs in the 12 months ended August, a gain of 0.5 percent; Rockland County added 1,700 jobs, or 1.5 percent.
That may not sound like much, but it is better than the national average -- and a lot better than the situation in the five boroughs. Almost 63,000 jobs have vaporized in the city in the last year, for a decline of 1.4 percent.
And the most recent economic news in New York City is decidedly mixed. The unemployment rate remained at 8.1 percent in August, for the third straight month, down slightly from the high of 8.8 percent of last February, but significantly higher than it has been in years.
In Westchester, by contrast, the jobless rate is only 4 percent, and in Putnam County, it is a measly 3.4 percent.
The number of jobs in the city, which some economists had hoped would stabilize or even rise last month, dropped by more than 12,000, according to Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist for the real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle. Ms. Denham takes government jobs data and adjusts it for seasonal factors.
Why has the city been suffering, economically, so much more than the suburbs? Well, the effects of 9/11 have to be a factor. But there are others.
One is simply the mix of businesses. Investment firms were among the hardest hit businesses in recent years, along with technology companies; both were disproportionately situated in the city and not on Long Island or in the northern suburbs, noted James P. Brown, an analyst with the New York State Department of Labor. "It was called Silicon Alley, not Silicon Beach," he said.
Even the same industry might perform very differently in the city than in the suburbs, he said, pointing to legal services as an example. While in many places the legal business is fueled by real estate work (and the housing market has continued to boom outside the city), legal services in Manhattan are often connected to Wall Street and serve corporations that have been cutting back.
Furthermore, people continue to push out into areas of the suburbs that were farmland not too long ago. And with them come new homes -- and construction jobs. And new stores -- and retailing jobs. And schoolteachers, doctors, nurses, lawyers, dry cleaners, and just about every other kind of service worker that there is.
Growth has been strong all along the Hudson Valley, said Sean P. MacDonald, an associate economist for the Labor Department, but particularly in Orange and Dutchess Counties, she said, "which used to be really rural."
So even a die-hard New York City dweller might want to consider looking outside the boroughs for employment. "Someone from the Bronx might not want to commute to Westchester or New Jersey, but there are jobs there," said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
On the other hand, Mr. Bram said, the most important thing may not be where you live or work, but what you want to do.
Factory work continues to disappear all over the United States, but it has been almost absent from New York City for decades. Jobs in health care, on the other hand, continue to boom, and construction and retailing are showing strength. 
"The best advice," Mr. Bram said, "is to be in an industry that's doing well."

HEADLINE: Clark's Military Record Offers Campaign Clues 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
This was Wesley K. Clark at his best.
 As the senior military negotiator in 1995 at the Bosnia peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, he used a mix of high-tech computer mapping and personal charisma to persuade Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president subsequently indicted for war crimes, to agree to a crucial boundary detail. That helped pave the way for the agreement that ended the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. 
 But four years later, he showed himself at what his critics call his worst. After General Clark successfully led the 19-member NATO military alliance to victory in Kosovo, he was worried that the Russians might threaten the peacekeeping mission. So he issued an order to use American troops to block a runway to prevent the Russians from flying in reinforcements to an airfield they occupied at Pristina. A British subordinate thought the order so foolhardy and dangerous that he refused to carry it out. 
According to several published accounts, the subordinate, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, defiantly told General Clark, "Sir, I'm not starting World War III for you."
These are dual aspects of General Clark, 58, who last week plunged into another kind of theater of combat -- joining nine other candidates for the Democratic nomination for president. They reveal an uncommon potential for leadership but also his unpredictable nature.
It remains to be seen which Wesley Clark will emerge in the campaign ahead. He has no experience on the campaign trail, which is not to say he has no political experience. His fast-track rise to the top of the military, earning his first general's star at the youthful age of 43, attests to his deftness.
"He rose quickly by using his superior intellect and his superior political skills," said Joe Lockhart, who was President Bill Clinton's spokesman at the White House and worked with General Clark. "He's not as much as a neophyte as some would like to paint him."
General Clark's distinguished 32-year active-duty military career is his chief credential for seeking the presidency. It reveals both strengths and shortcomings as it helps to peel back the layers of this man who, for most Americans, is a blank slate.
His career is highlighted by heroics. In Vietnam, he was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart, sustaining four wounds while on patrol one day north of Saigon. 
"I have scars all over my body," he said in a recent interview. 
In Bosnia, when an armored vehicle carrying civilian and military colleagues plunged off a rain-swept road near Sarajevo, he tied a rope to a tree and rappelled down the mountainside in an effort to rescue them.
On a lighter note, he demonstrated a flair for raiding enemy territory when he was a cadet at West Point. On Armed Forces Day in 1964, he said, he and some buddies had cadged an invitation to a party in Manhattan for Navy midshipmen. They crashed the party, which is where Cadet Clark met Gertrude Kingston, an executive assistant on Wall Street and his future wife.
His record also reveals a man who is obsessively competitive, with a drive to win at everything he does, no matter how meaningless.
"He is competitive drinking coffee with you," said a senior State Department official.
With that comes a reputation for arrogance, end-running his bosses and what some perceive to be lapses in judgment, some of which nearly derailed his career, according to former senior Pentagon officials.
In one attention-getting episode in 1994, he had been advised by the State Department not to meet with Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian-Serb general accused of slaughtering hundreds of civilians in pursuit of ethnic cleansing. General Clark met with him anyway.
General Mladic gave General Clark a bottle of plum brandy and an inscribed pistol; then the two swapped hats and posed for pictures that were splashed all over Europe. Privately, administration officials fumed that being buddy-buddy with General Mladic was "like cavorting with Hermann Goering." A Pentagon spokesman was left to explain that there must have been "a breakdown in communications."
Even General Clark has acknowledged in interviews and in his memoirs that some in his own service resented him, and at a critical juncture in his military career, his civilian boss, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, had to intervene to keep his career on track. Mr. Perry said in an interview that he had awarded General Clark his fourth star over the Army's favored candidate for the promotion. Mr. Perry, who has already endorsed Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts for president, said of General Clark, "His intellectual horsepower is very impressive."
General Clark was famous for impressing his bosses throughout his career, and yet, at the pinnacle of his power and influence after the Kosovo war, he was cashiered by his boss, William S. Cohen, the secretary of defense, after openly challenging the Clinton administration's reluctance to use ground troops in the conflict.
"I find him to be a guy who's very clever at determining which way the wind's blowing," said Gen. Paul Funk, who was General Clark's boss in the early 1990's. "Who knows, maybe in the political world that's a good thing."
Fred Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton, said that General Clark was in a precarious position as he stepped out on the political stage, in part because he did not yet have a coherent narrative of his life story. "They have to shape the story, and it's not out there," Mr. Greenstein said. "He's got a record that makes him seem potentially like an Eisenhower or a Powell rather than a Schwarzkopf or Patton or one of these people who don't have mainstream appeal. But he somehow needs to bring that to the fore."
What has puzzled some political professionals is that the general's expertise is supposed to be as a military commander, strong on preparation and organization, and yet he does not seem to have a structure or strategy in place for acampaign.
This was immediately evident last week when he announced his candidacy. He did so before hiring a campaign manager and filling other important slots -- and before he seemed to have thought through his positions. This was apparent as he reversed himself on the issue on which was perceived to have the most credibility -- the war in Iraq.
On Thursday, the day after he announced his candidacy, he said, "I probably would have voted for" the resolution. On Friday, he backtracked, saying, "I never would have voted for war." But last October, according to The Associated Press, he said he supported a Congressional resolution to give President Bush authority to use military force against Iraq. He then spent months as a television commentator criticizing the president's action.
That is all the more remarkable given General Clark's history of unfailing preparation for whatever challenge he has taken on and his laser-like determination to achieve since he graduated at the top of his West Point class in 1966 and went to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, for instance, General Clark, then a one-star officer, was in a rear-echelon job as commander of the Army's national training center in the Mojave Desert, a task that included whipping units of the Georgia National Guard into combat shape.
"My job is to get them ready to pass the ultimate test," he said in an interview just before the air war started, dismissing any misgivings that he would be missing out on front-line action in the gulf to train the citizen soldiers.
By the mid-1990's, General Clark had risen to be the chief political-military officer on the military's Joint Staff. In the run-up to the invasion of Haiti in 1994, he insisted that the military plan not only for a worst-case scenario but also for an unopposed entry, which was the eventual outcome. It was a step that State Department officials said most likely prevented bloodshed.
It was in that job that General Clark first appeared on the international stage, when Richard C. Holbrooke tapped him as his top military adviser during the Dayton peace accords in November 1995. In the marathon three-week negotiations that Mr. Holbrooke brokered, General Clark oversaw the drafting of the military chapter of the agreement that gave free rein to a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
That part of the pact drew criticism from some of General Clark's four-star superiors. But Mr. Holbrooke, who wrote in his book of the tension between General Clark and fellow officers, said in a telephone interview, "Wes ran interference for me with the uniformed services."
After a one-year stint as head of the military's Southern Command, overseeing operations in most of Latin America, General Clark was picked to be the top American commander in Europe and the NATO supreme military chief, one of the most prized jobs in the military.
He seemed perfectly suited for the post, given his experience in the Balkans and his proficiency in Russian. But as he settled into his job, overseeing not only the accord he had help broker for Bosnia but preparing for possible conflict in the Serb province of Kosovo, his strengths also became his weaknesses.
Commanders in Bosnia, and later in Kosovo, complained that General Clark would micromanage from his headquarters in Belgium the tactical details of missions usually left to commanders on the ground.
"It was tenuous at times," said Maj. Gen. David Grange, who is retired now but who headed the First Infantry Division in Bosnia and Kosovo. "He did get into the weeds."
As he struggled to keep the fractious NATO alliance united, he repeatedly clashed with his bosses in Washington -- Mr. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- when he urged the use of American ground troops and Apache attack helicopters after days of bombing alone failed to bring Mr. Milosevic's surrender.
It is unclear how someone so skilled in the political ways of Washington could have put himself in such a precarious position with his civilian masters. Yet when he received word from General Shelton in July 1999 that his command would end earlier than scheduled, General Clark was stunned.
Similarly, despite his months of toying with whether to run for the presidency, he seems ill-prepared. Even if his goal is to be picked as a vice-presidential running mate, he still seems to be short on the fundamentals, like a top-level staff, message and strategy. 
A prominent Democratic fund-raiser said that General Clark seemed bright but that signals from the campaign had not given him confidence.
"You have to worry about a campaign where the theme is so thin that it's based on just 'I can win,' because he's never run before and he's getting an incredibly late start," the fund-raiser said. 
Mr. Lockhart said there was no way to predict how someone, least of all a four-star general, would take to the campaign process. "He's clearly smart enough to do this, he has the communication skills to do this, he has the whole package and the resume," he said. "Now we'll find out whether he can do it."

HEADLINE: Over The Store 

BYLINE:  By William Norwich; William Norwich is the entertaining editor of The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
It sounded like the most fabulous trip in the world, and I blame my mother. Sleep above arguably the best store in the free world, 10 Corso Como.
 The proprietor, Carla Sozzani, a former business partner of Romeo Gigli and sister of Franca Sozzani, who is the editor of Italian Vogue, opened this hipper-than-thou but user-friendly lifestyle emporium in Milan about 10 years ago. Art gallery, bookshop, courtyard tea garden, restaurant and last, but not least, designer fashion and home boutiques are all rolled into one holistic experience and located in an old, ambient warehouse near the Garibaldi train station. Once a renegade section of Milan, like TriBeCa was in New York, it is now the locus of cool in Italy's slender-hipped style capital. 
 In late spring this year, Sozzani opened a deluxe bed-and-breakfast operation called 3Rooms -- there are just three suites -- in a space she renovated atop the complex. 
Why, you might ask, would a man like me want to sleep over a store when he might do better actualizing himself shooting rapids (doesn't your gun get wet?) on a river through dales and canyons?
Well, we took only one sort of vacation when I was a child: shopping. Your people sought out great museums or anthropological destinations? My people looked for stores. For weekend picnics we went to Loehmann's. During one school holiday when I was 10, we drove from Connecticut to West Virginia to buy crystal at the glass factories near Wheeling. But I regress.
Suffice it to say, I tumbled off an Alitalia flight ultrasteerage early one morning a few weeks ago with great expectations.
"La Vita Moda," the Italian fashion life, I explained to a Milanese friend. Not only was I planning on sleeping above the great boutique, but I was also going to visit the celebrated barber at the Dolce & Gabbana men's store and spa in central Milan, have lunch at Giorgio Armani's restaurant -- he hopes to open a hotel himself soon in the city -- visit Gianfranco Ferre's new spa and, well, get the picture: La Vita Moda.
Hidden behind a discreet facade, 10 Corso Como rises like the promise of new clothes. Alas, when I arrived, it was 9 in the morning, and there was no action, shopping or otherwise. The courtyard was as quiet as the Grand Canyon. A banner from the second-story art gallery announced an exhibition of photographs by Helmut Newton. Smaller signs in the direction of the clothing boutiques whispered, "Soldes," meaning "sales."
"Carla's in Paris," explained a pretty young woman named Katja in snug bluejeans and a white shirt.
Of course, in Paris. (Where she and Azzedine Alaia are opening another 3Rooms at his place in the Marais.) What did I think? That Carla Sozzani actually would be there to greet me, like Aunt Bee in Mayberry?
Katja showed me to my suite, a living room, bedroom, dressing room and bath ready for its close-up in Wallpaper.
All the suites, decorated in a late 1960's modern style, are large and generously appointed with Arne Jacobsen and Eero Saarinen chairs, Kris Ruhs paintings, bedspreads by Charles and Ray Eames and more. And, for tech freaks, the television, music and telephone system is thoroughly modern, Bang & Olufsen. And there is a computer with . . . Internet connections.
Like a spokesman for the world-of-tomorrow exhibition at a World's Fair, Katja deftly demonstrated the many technological delights. 
I, meanwhile, was happy to note there was plenty of room for shopping bags and a full-length mirror in the dressing room, as well as an ironing board and high-tech iron that, according to my limited knowledge of the Italian language, offered cold drinks and Visconti videos.
In other words, I was three days at 3Rooms, and only on the second day did I learn how to turn on the television. On the third day I almost figured out how to turn it off.
Katja left me to unpack and plug in.
Time to go shopping? Not yet. This is what you learn with age: Do not shop when you are hungry, lonely, angry or tired. I came to this realization the expensive way. Back in the early 1990's, off the plane one morning in Paris, half in the bag and severely jet-lagged . . . well, the next thing I knew I was buying an outfit at Jean Paul Gaultier. How did I look? Like Pocahontas.
But by Day 2, I was well rested and ready for full-tilt Vita Moda. I had a relaxed, delicious breakfast in my room. I saw the Helmut Newton exhibition, went to Mr. Armani's cafe for a coffee, had lunch (chicken salad with Parmesan cheese) with friends at Dolce & Gabbana's Martini Bar, got a shave and a buzz cut from Dolce & Gabbana's all-star Sicilian barber, Giovanni Pappalardo, and walked barefoot through Gianfranco Ferre's blue-and-gold tiled spa. Fab-u-lous!
Then I went home and went shopping. Gucci, Helmut Lang, Balenciaga, Viktor & Rolf, Paul Smith, Comme des Garcons -- you name it, I tried it on. Pacing myself still, I settled on a V-neck gunmetal gray Prada sweater at half price.
"May I charge this to my room?" I asked the head clerk.
"No," he answered, and laughed. "But we can deliver it."
Mental note for Carla Sozzani: it might be more fun if the shopping could be billed to your room. After all, the new wave in the hotel business is attracting guests with groovy retail opportunities.
Confronted with a near-savage recession in travel, hotels are pulling out all the stops to attract guests, from fashion boutiques to pampering pets with massages and doggy bathrobes. Telephones at the Carlyle Hotel in New York connect guests to Zitomer's, the madcap boutique pharmacy that sells everything from Xanax to mink teddy bears. The Shore Club in Miami features an outpost of the ultratrendy New York boutique Scoop, which offers Juicy Couture, Marc Jacobs and Jil Sanders, among other labels.
According to Women's Wear Daily, Scoop at the Shore Club, like many hotel boutiques, does a booming business.
"Everybody is on holiday or on vacation," Rachel Kahn, the manager of the Scoop store in Miami, told Women's Wear Daily. "People come in half-naked and leave with a bag full of clothes. When they feel good, it makes for a good business day."
Between my happy patronage and the buzzing machinations of so many shopping Japanese tourists, things were looking pretty good for business at 10 Corso Como.
I carried my Prada purchase to my room -- I needed the exercise -- and returned to the courtyard for dinner. Alone again naturally, sure, but the people-watching was terrific, one Vita Moda Milanese person after another, looking as chic as anyone ever did in an Antonioni film.
Later, I spoke with Carla Sozzani on the phone. "So this is La Vita Moda," I said.
"Is it? Shopping was not my only idea," she said. Famously serene and mellow, Carla explained: "But I live with fashion, so it's another story maybe? I don't know. My idea was just to expand what I hope we have at 10 Corso Como, a place where people can come and feel at home."
I told her that a lot like at home, I was unable to get anything electronic to work. Blame it on the jet lag?
Carla laughed.
"Next time we'll get you a tutor."
Wow, a blind date. Now that is fine hotel service.
Rooms at the hotel are not cheap. About 520 euros (around $570) a night. This is about the starting price for a double room at the Principe di Savoia and about $110 less than the same at the Four Seasons in Milan.
Who will stay here? 
3Rooms will appeal to well-heeled hipsters not in a rush. Terry Jones, the editor of i-D magazine and the father of the photographer Matt Jones, stayed at the bed-and-breakfast this summer. The photographer David LaChapelle checked into a suite for nearly two weeks.
"Then there was a woman," Carla said, "a German lady. She checked in in the morning. Went shopping until 9 that night. Ate. And left the next morning. You would have liked her."
Liked her? We're probably related. 

TRAVELING LA VITA MODA

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF STYLE; 
Everywhere, Aesthetics

BYLINE:  By Penelope Green

 BODY:
THE SUBSTANCE OF STYLE
How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.
By Virginia Postrel.
HarperCollins, $24.95.
 TWO weeks ago, my hands stopped working, the result of too many hours spent at a laptop. Proper ergonomics, I soon learned, requires a separate keyboard and mouse. 
 At Digital Society, 60 East 10th Street (Broadway) in Manhattan, there were choices: utilitarian-looking keyboards and mice in beige plastic, and the Apple versions, in this year's signature white, afloat in clear plastic -- deliriously beautiful, and at a premium. The Apple keyboard was $12 more than its beige counterpart; the mouse, $29 more. I waffled for a good 10 minutes. Guess which equipment I bought? 
That looks do matter is a no-brainer. Why they matter has worried big thinkers since Plato. The topic has reached a fever pitch of punditry in the last decade. 
Whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton's hair or a Starbucks coffee shop or a translucent American Express credit card, there's a sweeping aesthetic imperative, to use Virginia Postrel's phrase, roiling everything from politics to grocery chains to financial institutions.
Ms. Postrel, who contributes to the Economic Scene column in The New York Times, is clearly a libertarian. She was an editor at Reason magazine, which advocates liberty and individual choice in all areas of human activity.
These ideas drive "The Substance of Style," in which Ms. Postrel explores the reasons, economic and otherwise, that aesthetics have permeated so many aspects of contemporary life. 
As trade barriers fell in the last decade, goods from all over the world became available, enriching the aesthetic mix. 
In other words, there's more stuff, prices are lower and as a result people have more choices. When good-looking merchandise became available to everybody, a million different ideas about what is aesthetically pleasing were thrown about. Today, anything goes, and that's a good thing. 
People inherently like beautiful things, Ms. Postrel writes, not because they confer status or because a magazine has told them to look a certain way, but because it makes them feel good.
When the novelist Jane Smiley dyed her hair blond, she found herself captivated by the image of her new self in the mirror. "That androgynous, no-nonsense woman that I had been for 30 years turned out to be not quite me," Ms. Postrel quotes her as saying, "or perhaps not simply me." 
And because people have so many choices in areas like hair color and trash cans, they are freer to choose the things that make them happy and express their identity.
This democratization of taste profoundly irritates cultural critics, who argue that things, like an Armani suit or a particular hair style, are either "rich in meaning" or have no meaning at all. 
But people are neither sheep nor morons, Ms. Postrel says, and the meanings they ascribe to their clothing or their hair color are mostly personal: "I like that. I'm like that." 
Whether we dye our hair blue or blond, our intention and hope, she writes, is "to capture and convey identity, to turn our ineffable sense of self into something tangible and authentic."

Fashion, Freedom and Foreign Policy

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
AMERICAN designers, unlike their counterparts in Europe, are not given to making cultural statements with their clothes. They are excellent marketers but, perhaps with innate understanding of what the American public will take seriously from a designer, they confine their message to sex, youth and whatever Gwyneth Paltrow or Nicole Kidman are wearing.
 So it was surprising to see at least a few designers last week at the spring 2004 collections -- that's what all those skinny young women and Town Cars were doing at Bryant Park in Manhattan -- strike a fairly profound chord about America in this post-Sept. 11, post-Iraq war moment. 
 Before you get out a hanky or raise Old Glory, you should know that a wave of optimism usually greets a successful military campaign. After World War II, when the French public was starved for bread as well as luxury, it was expressed most opulently in Dior's New Look. Last summer, at the European men's shows, the runways were awash in American symbols -- from combat fatigues to the sort of wholesome blazers and khaki shorts you'd expect at the Piping Rock Club. As the British dress historian Aileen Ribeiro noted, "What we've got with the early 21st century, with America's 'successful' war, is that everyone wants to be part of the action."
This feel-good sentiment was also evident last week in collections by Marc Jacobs, Peter Som and Patrick Robinson of Perry Ellis, which were conceived before the postwar events in Iraq turned grim. They all showed prairie skirts -- Mr. Jacobs's in worn-looking velvet with white petticoats. These were not the prairie skirts of a Willa Cather novel. Rather, they were the kind that a young woman with clean straight hair and an indifference to underwear would have worn on Long Island in the summer of 1979.
At heart, American fashion embodies a sense of freedom that has always inspired the rest of the world, and it goes beyond upbeat colors and comfortable shapes. It has to do with an attitude, a deeply American sense of optimism that, whether because of the economy or Sept. 11, hasn't been allowed to surface. It may remain suppressed until the situation in Iraq is resolved, but for a moment last week it was glimpsed. CATHY HORYN

HEADLINE: Pakistan, a Troubled Ally 

 BODY:
Pakistan was not directly involved in the events of 9/11, but its international standing and the reputation of its leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, were thoroughly transformed in the wake of the terrorist attacks two years ago. By abruptly switching sides in Afghanistan and letting Washington use Pakistani bases to fight the Taliban, General Musharraf managed, in weeks, to lift Pakistan's status in Washington from pariah to strategic partner. 
 Yet beneath the surface of Washington's new closeness with Islamabad, mutual suspicions continue to fester. Neither country has fully delivered what the other expected, though America's shortcomings and Pakistan's are scarcely equivalent. The Bush administration has withheld trade benefits Pakistan deserves. General Musharraf has failed to sever all links with international terrorism. 
 During the cold war, Pakistan's geography and anti-Communism made it an American favorite. After that, relations began to sour. Washington grew increasingly unhappy over Pakistan's strong support for the Taliban, links with Kashmiri terrorists and covert development of nuclear weapons. Then, in 1999, General Musharraf overthrew a democratically elected government. 
For a brief time after General Musharraf's switch on Afghanistan, there seemed a chance for a healthier relationship. In breaking with the Taliban, the general stood up to some of the most troubling forces in Pakistani society, including military intelligence leaders and Islamic fundamentalists. He promised a timely return to democracy and announced he would expel foreign fundamentalists. His actions fell short of his words. 
In return for his help in Afghanistan, General Musharraf hoped that Washington would grant broad relief from the protectionist American import quotas that stifle Pakistan's textile and apparel industry, the country's largest industrial employer and main exporter to the United States. Instead, only selective bonuses have been offered, many for products Pakistan does not produce in large quantities. Unlike the military aid Washington has offered, freer trade in textiles would benefit Pakistan's weak economy and struggling factory workers.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's behavior has fallen well short of what Americans are entitled to expect from an ally in the war on terrorism. Although it has cooperated in the arrest of some leaders of Al Qaeda, Pakistan has never adequately sealed the Afghan border. That made it possible for key Qaeda fugitives to escape and now allows Pakistani recruits to join a reviving Taliban. Pakistan still provides Kashmiri terrorists with sanctuary and access to areas bordering Indian-ruled territory. Wresting Kashmir away from India remains an open goal of Pakistani policy, with violence considered a legitimate tool.
Pakistan has behaved extremely irresponsibly with respect to nuclear weapons. American experts believe it may have helped both North Korea and Iran develop nuclear weapons technology. Pakistan's own nuclear weapons are thought to be under General Musharraf's control, but in a country whose history has been scarred by repeated military coups, that is not totally reassuring. Democracy remains a distant mirage. 
Pakistan's help in Afghanistan, though less than ideal, is still needed. Now Washington is hoping General Musharraf will contribute Pakistani peacekeeping troops to Iraq. If that can be done under a United Nations flag, it makes sense. Otherwise, America must look for ways to reduce its dependence on General Musharraf. Fighting terrorism effectively requires allies untainted by terror.

The Fight for the Democratic Party

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
CONSIDER, for a moment, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, newly declared candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, as a useful Rorschach test for a conflicted party. What did many Democrats see when they looked at General Clark -- and how did that make them feel?
 They saw a retired military commander who was a critic of the war with Iraq. A decorated hero from the South who could not be dismissed as some outside-the-mainstream, 60's throwback, yet was willing to confront President Bush on foreign policy. A man who was not only right, but maybe, just maybe, electable. And it made them feel . . . happy. 
 General Clark, of course, is a latecomer, largely untested in politics, whose real importance as a candidate will not be clear for several weeks. But this moment captured something important about a party torn between its heart and its head, between its desire to speak, clearly and without apology, about its beliefs, and its desire to defeat President Bush, put together an electoral majority in a polarized nation and return to power. 
It is an old struggle in the Democratic Party, resurfacing with each new generation of activists and strategists since the old New Deal coalition came unstuck in the 1960's. Does the party need to move to the center, muting its liberal edge on cultural issues, economics and foreign policy in order to win? Promise to roll back just part of the tax cut, for example, not the whole thing? 
Or does that lead to a watery "me-tooism," too careful, too calibrated, too uncertain of what it believes to rouse voters or to make a difference if its proponents actually win office?
Let Democrats be Democrats, is the thrust of one argument. Speak to the great American middle, not to each other, is the counter. Hearts and heads at war.
Bill Clinton moved the party to a centrist "third way" in 1992, but that happened only after 12 years out of the White House, when Democrats were really hungry to win. And much of that redefinition did not endure once Mr. Clinton and his formidable political skills left the White House.
Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for Mr. Clinton, says that Democratic primary voters in the decade since 1992 have become "more partisan, more ideological, more secular and more anti-Republican," just as their Republican counterparts have become more religious, conservative and partisan. In other words, the struggle over the right message, and messenger, has to be waged anew for the post-Clinton Democratic Party.
So far, it is largely framed by the powerful anger at the Democratic grassroots -- over the 2000 election and a president elected without a popular vote majority; over three years of staunchly conservative policies and a war unpopular with Democratic voters from the start.
But there was also anger at Congressional Democrats, consigned to minority status, who to some Democrats seemed too reluctant to challenge the Bush administration. Ever since Vietnam, many Democrats have been deeply suspicious of the use of force, even as party leaders struggled to deflect the charge that Democrats are reflexively antiwar. 
All this coalesced around the war with Iraq, which was supported by four of the six Congressional Democrats now running for president.
Many party activists, in short, were ripe for an appealfrom an impassioned, outside insurgent, speaking out against the war and the establishment Democrats who at least initially supported it -- speaking to the activists' hearts. Suddenly, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, who famously declared that he represented "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party," was atop the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. His speeches were bracing affirmations of old-time Democratic values and beliefs; his audiences were moved.
But then, of course, the worried questions began inside the Democratic Party. Is an antiwar governor from a tiny state -- Vermont ranks 49th in population -- really the strongest candidate to defeat Mr. Bush? If not, then who? 
Will rank-and-file Democratic voters give enough thought to the unyielding dictates of the electoral map -- which candidate has the best chance to carry major battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan -- when they cast their ballots? Will they, in other words, use their heads? 
Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant now advising Representative Richard A. Gephardt, describes it as "the age-old question -- some elections, Democrats in the primary cycle vote their passions; some elections, they vote their heads."
Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat and a leader in the Democratic Leadership Council, formed to push the party to the center, worried recently, "The people who go to the caucuses and the conventions tend to be people who are focused first on who's most closely aligned with what they believe in, and only secondarily on who can win in November."
And Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York was one of several Democrats who argued that any successful nominee must pass a credibility test on national security. "I don't think that any Democratic candidate can beat Bush, from Lieberman to Dean and back, unless they have a positive foreign policy, one that states what they would do to defeat terrorism, not just what Bush did that was wrong," Mr. Schumer said.
Senator Evan Bayh, the Indiana Democrat who is currently chairman of the leadership council, recently contended, "We're not going to win on national security," but the party could lose on it unless the nominee is a credible commander in chief.
Such was the backdrop for the Wesley Clark phenomenon, and all the efforts by the other leading candidates to attract a second look from primary voters -- as both impassioned and electable. Many Democrats were touting General Clark as a man who could, by virtue of his resume alone, neutralize the national security issue; realpolitik was in the air last week.
Gordon Fischer, the Iowa Democratic chairman, asserted that beating Mr. Bush was "the No. 1 goal" of party activists. "Even Governor Dean's campaign talks about his skills and advantages as a candidate on the basis of electability," he added.
Predicting electability, of course, is tricky; sometimes when Democrats thought they were voting their heads, they were still badly beaten in the general election. Former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts captured the 1988 Democratic nomination as a moderate, nonideological technocrat -- not a man who stirred his party's passions, but one who seemed, to many Democrats, decent, competent, electable. He lost 40 states that fall. Other traits matter in a candidate, beside his profile and message; sheer passion and political talent can go a long way.
Moreover, there is a fundamental divide in politics now over how best to win the presidency -- by galvanizing the base, or by reaching out to swing voters, which generallymeans a more centrist message.
In the end, many liberals cling to an old dream, of finding a candidate who appeals to both the base and the majority, and rebuilding the old coalition that seemed to shatter 35 years ago, argued Michael Kazin, a political historian at Georgetown University. 
"They think that Americans, in their heart of hearts, really agree with them on education, on the environment, on some kind of national health insurance," Professor Kazin said. "And they feel they're completely right about the war in Iraq." 
So, they want to fall in love with a candidate. And they want to win.

The Deficit Disappeared, but That Was Then

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A decade ago, concern over the country's budget deficits dominated political and economic debates, just as it does now. Many of the same people who now worry that a fiscal disaster is on the horizon envisioned a similar catastrophe in the early 1990's.
 But last time, in the blink of an eye, the deficits disappeared. In 1992, the budget shortfall was a central issue in the presidential election. By 1998, the government was running a surplus. 
 Here is an illustration of how wrong the deficit projections turned out to be. In 1992, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the deficit would be $322 billion in 2000. This was in line with the estimates of the White House budget office and private forecasters. In fact, in 2000, the budget actually ran a surplus of $236 billion, a swing of $558 billion -- more than 30 percent of that year's budget. 
Is there any reason to believe the same turnabout will not happen again in this decade -- that once again the sky will not fall?
The main answer nearly all economists and budget analysts agree, was the unanticipated boom in the economy and the stock market.
"The sun, the moon and the planets were all aligned," said Stanley E. Collender, author of an annual book called "The Guide to the Federal Budget."
And given the serendipity of those events, no one can say with total confidence that a reversal will occur in this decade.
In the last couple of years, the 10-year deficit predicted by the Congressional Budget Office has swung from a cumulative surplus of $5.6 trillion to a total deficit of at least $2.3 trillion -- the result of a sour economy, President Bush's tax cuts and unanticipated spending for war and domestic security.
The last time there was a spike in the federal deficit, it grew out of Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981 and the deep recession in the early 1980's. Over the rest of that decade, politicians in Washington tried various gimmicks to deal with the situation, none of which worked.
Then, in 1990, after a year of wrenching negotiations, President George H. W. Bush and the Democratic Congress struck a deal in which income taxes were increased and rigid rules were imposed that limited spending. Dollar-for-dollar offsets were required for any further tax cut or spending increases in benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. Strict ceilings were placed on other spending. 
The deal proved to be a political disaster for Mr. Bush. The deficit did not immediately fall. The tax increase outraged conservatives. Ross Perot entered the 1992 presidential race charging that the Mr. Bush's fiscal policies were irresponsible. 
The anxiety over the deficit contributed to Bill Clinton's election, and he and his economic advisers, Robert E. Rubin and Leon E. Panetta, took office determined to get the deficit under control. Without a single Republican vote, Mr. Clinton won approval of legislation in 1993 that raised income taxes, mostly on the wealthy, and kept the spending discipline rules that had been enacted in 1990.
In 1994, Republicans won control of Congress, and the battle over the budget between President Clinton and Congress led to a government shutdown without resolving the problem.
Then, unexpectedly, the economy began to soar. Tax revenue surged. Government spending leveled off. All that made it easier for Mr. Clinton and the Republicans in Congress to agree on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The law was supposed to lead to a balanced budget by 2002. In fact, the budget began running a surplus in 1998. (By 2002, it was back in deficit.)
Democrats claim credit, saying they were responsible for the tax increases and spending discipline in the 1990 and 1993 budget deals. Republicans say it was their ability to restrain Democratic tendencies to spend money that caused the deficit to go away. 
Both sides exaggerate the credit they are due. Increased tax revenue and spending restraints certainly contributed. But they were not nearly so important in reducing the deficit, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, as factors over which the politicians had no influence: the big increase in productivity; the rapid growth in executive compensation and capital gains that led to higher tax receipts; and the surprising slowdown in the rise of health spending because of managed care.
"Policy changes mattered," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, "but they were a small part of what happened."
In the five years from 1996 through 2000, economic growth averaged 4 percent a year; personal income rose by 25 percent. And the growth in income was enjoyed disproportionately by those in the highest tax brackets, on whom the Clinton tax increase was imposed.
As a consequence, tax receipts in 2000 were $267 billion higher than the budget office had forecast for that year in 1992. 
Also, spending was $290 billion lower than the forecast. The strong economy meant less money was needed for unemployment insurance and social programs. Projected outlays dropped for Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs. The fall of Communism allowed for less military spending. And low interest rates and reduced debt led to smaller interest payments.
To have a similar rebound, the economy would have to grow much faster than expected. The White House predicts average growth of 3.3 percent a year, well below the 4 percent average of the late 1990's, and the estimate by a consensus of private economists is no higher than the White House forecast.
It would help for some of the president's tax cuts to be repealed, or at least postponed, and for Congress and the president to agree to rigid spending discipline, neither of which seems likely to occur.
In addition, the stock market would have to explode again. Thegiant bonuses and stock-option profits that executives enjoyed in the 1990's would have to reappear. The need for financing the military and domestic security would have to diminish.
"No one foresees that," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. "No one today would forecast a set of circumstances like those of the 1990's." 
But no one foresaw the wave of events in the 1990's either.

Housing From a Box Acquires a New Fan

BYLINE:  By JANE TANNER

 BODY:
WARREN E. BUFFETT'S astute eye for spotting money-making opportunities in the nuts-and-bolts of daily life is no secret.
 In the last three years, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has assembled a profitable collection of companies that flourish by providing mundane but necessary things: bricks, paints, wall covering, roofing, insulation and carpets. 
 Those companies have done well partly because of the strong U.S. housing market. At the same time, Berkshire has become more entrenched at the other end of the business: selling houses. Berkshire's Home Services of America acquired three firms last year and has become one of the largest residential real estate brokerage firms in the country. Now, Mr. Buffett has set his sights on the black-sheep sector of the otherwise prosperous housing industry: manufactured houses. Demand for factory-made housing has been plunging and is now at a four-decade low. Construction capacity has dropped by more than half in the last five years. 
 Despite the grim landscape, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, all but closed a deal this summer to buy one of the industry's most profitable companies, Clayton Homes Inc. of Maryville, Tenn., for $17.5 billion.
 The transaction, however, is not completed, pending a decision in the next few weeks by the Tennessee Supreme Court on whether to hear an appeal by a Clayton institutional investor trying to overturn the deal. 
 During the 1990's, manufactured houses accounted for 20 percent of single-family housing starts, according to Census Bureau tallies. Producing a manufactured house costs 20 percent to 30 percent less than building a house on the site, even after including the expense of trucking the houses to the sites, according to an analysis of the sector produced last year for the Ford Foundation.
 Despite the economic advantages of factory construction, the sector's linchpin is money for loans to homebuyers. Historically, it has been a difficult area for lending because many of the buyers have weak credit histories and, at least in the past, the houses tended to depreciate as cars do, in part because many were placed on leased lots. Too many bad loans in the mid-1990's resulted in hundreds of thousands of houses being repossessed, which limited the demand for building. 
 While lending in this sector is hazardous, a conservative approach seems to bear fruit. "Ultimately, if you do good loans, you are going to be able to make money," said Barbara Allen, housing analyst at Natexis Bleichroeder. 
 Berkshire plans to provide a secure stream of capital to Clayton's mortgage-financing operations; Kevin T. Clayton, the company's president, said those operations require $1 billion a year. 
 Berkshire executives declined to discuss the purchase. 
 Clayton sells the houses in 297 retail outlets and provides mortgages and insurance through a financing subsidiary. Analysts saythe company has a record of conservative underwriting and successful lending.
 John H. Diffendal, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, says Berkshire's entrance may mark the beginning of a rebound. "When Warren E. Buffett puts his stake in the ground, it says it's time for others to take a look at this industry," Mr. Diffendal said.
 Over the years, manufactured housing itself has improved. In the 1950's, boxy units started popping up as companies tried to address housing shortages after World War II. 
 The majority of new factory-built houses are made of multiple sections and average 1,715 square feet. They tend to be similar to modest houses that are built on site. Over all, the average manufactured house sold for $51,300, according to the Census Bureau. And the median household income for the homeowners is $28,900, according to the Foremost Insurance Group.
 TO large house builders, factory construction provides a way to drive down material and labor costs, and to prepare for expected shortages of workers who have building trade skills. 
 "We need to figure out ways to build more units with fewer people," said James P. Zeumer, a spokesman for Pulte Homes Inc., in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which builds houses under the Del Webb brand. 
 This fall, a Pulte operation in Manassas, Va., will begin making shells of houses: precast concrete basements and foundations, floors, walls and roofing. A shell can be built in four to five days versus 20 days at a house site, Mr. Zeumer said.
 Population trends are likely to bode well for manufactured housing. Immigrants, particularly the growing number of Hispanic immigrants, will drive up demand for low-cost starter houses in the next two decades, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.
 Many of those immigrants are in the South and West, where factory-built housing is most established, and retail outlets there are adapting to attract them. The growing ranks of baby boomers' children, now moving into early adulthood, are also increasing demand for entry-level houses.
 "Manufactured housing could not only rebound, but play a very substantial role in affordable housing," Mr. Retsinas said.
 As demand for these entry-level houses rises, some conventional builders will also try to capture the market. 
 "There is no guarantee that manufactured housing will have it all to themselves," Ms. Allen said.

HEADLINE: From Teaneck to the West Bank: a Tale of 2 Emigrants 

BYLINE:  By JOEL RUBIN

 BODY:
LATE on a Tuesday night last spring, Hillel and Chana Schuster stood at the El Al check-in counter at John F. Kennedy International Airport, surrounded by piles of their possessions Close by, their two children slept in strollers.
 For the Schusters, boarding an Israeli-bound plane that night was the culmination of years of planning, waiting and sacrifice. Since they were married six years ago, their lives in Teaneck had revolved around the dream of moving to Israel. 
 And yet the moment did not arrive without many questions and considerable anxiety. 
 In moving , the Schusters turned their backs on a safe and comfortable life in the New Jersey suburbs and chose instead to endure the lifeless Israeli economy while living in a place mired in a bloody conflict with the Palestinians. 
 Still, the young couple believed they would not truly be home until they had arrived in Hashmonaim, a settlement in the West Bank.
 "It has nothing to do with a logic," Mr. Schuster said. "How many generations behind us have been praying to able to live there? As bad as the situation is now, how many Jews who have died dreamed of having a place like Israel? It's not just one or two generations, it's 50 generations."
 Given this sentiment, the Schusters do not understand why so few American Jews make aliyah, the morally infused Hebrew word for immigration that translates literally as "to ascend." 
 In particular, they harbor deep frustrations about the extensive Jewish community in Teaneck that they left behind. It is a community, they say, that suffers from fading passion and dedication to Israel and Judaism.
 "People just don't want to think about it," Mr. Schuster said about many of Teaneck's Jews. "They say, 'Look at my nice house. Look at my beautiful little Jerusalem right here in Teaneck. What do I need in Israel?' And it is true, Teaneck is a fabulous place, but it isn't Israel."
 But American Jews have never bought, en masse, into the Zionist ideal of aliyah that, since the creation of Israel in 1948, has called on world Jewry to return to the homeland it lost in biblical times.
 While 1.3 million Jews flooded into Israel, most from postwar Europe and Arab nations, during the country's first 20 years, only 10,000 arrived from the United States. In total, only 100,000 Americans have made aliyah since 1948, of whom approximately 40 percent eventually decide to return to the United States, according to Chaim Waxman, a sociologist at Rutgers.
 Jeffrey Gurock, a professor of Jewish history at Yeshiva University, said: "It is just too comfortable here. The fleshpots of America are very attractive."
 But the Schusters, with their modern Orthodox upbringing that planted in them both a deep religious belief and a passionate connection to the land of Israel, are very typical of the handful of American Jews actually making aliyah today.
 "It is pure ideology," said Dan Biron, who, as a recent executive director of the Jewish Agency's Aliyah Center, helped organize most American immigration over the past two years. "They have a love of Israel."
 Mr. and Mrs. Schuster, both 30, say the strength of their religious convictions were part of the force that pulled them to their new home. Talk of religion, however, quickly melts into expression of a passionate, almost desperate, desire to contribute to Israel as a country and to be among its people. To the Schusters, the reasons for moving lie not so much in God's commandments as in the soil of Israel. 
 When their daughter, Sarit, was born, they resolved to be in Israel before she turned 6, concerned that if they waited longer it would be difficult forher to adjust. 
 Each year they watched friends move from their humble apartment complex to large homes on the other side of Teaneck. And even though the six-figure salary that Mr. Schuster said he earned at a major investment firm would have allowed them to follow, the Schusters remained in the cramped apartment and made do with a 1987 Honda Civic. They were, Mr. Schuster said, not only intent on saving money to subsidize the inevitable pay cut that would come with a move to Israel , but determined to avoid setting down roots in Teaneck that would make leaving any more complicated.
 "If you don't go and at least give it a shot, you're going to be asking yourself a lot of questions," Mr. Schuster said. "And your kids will be asking, too."
 The Schusters did not simply move to Israel, but to a settlement on the West Bank, and "settlement" is a word loaded with controversy in the Middle East.
 Hashmonaim, the settlement the Schusters now call home, rests just outside the Green Line that marks Israel's pre-1967 border and delineates the West Bank from Israel proper. Roughly 20 miles up the road from Jerusalem and west of the West Bank city of Ramallah, it is home to 500 modern Orthodox families, about 60 percent of whom are immigrants from the United States and Western Europe. A fence runs along the settlement's perimeter, and Israeli soldiers maintain a military checkpoint on its far side. Beyond the checkpoint, three small Palestinian villages Al Midya, Ni'Lin and Deir Qaddis hem in Hashmonaim to the north and east. Every day, from the house they lease on the settlement's outer ring road, the Schusters hear the Muslim call to prayer from the villages' minarets.
 The Schusters chose Hashmonaim because Mr. Schuster wanted to live in a house. They have recently bought property and begun building a home --an affordable undertaking in the West Bank largely because of government subsidies. But equally important, Mr. Schuster said, was that he wanted his family to experience the intense social intimacy fostered by the settlements. 
 The first few months in Hashmonaim have not been without frustrations and anxieties. Most difficult, the Schusters said, was adjusting to the changes in the standard of living that came with the substantial pay cut Mr. Schuster took at his new job with the Israeli branch of an international investment firm. In their old life, Mrs. Schuster said, they did not think twice about buying clothes or taking vacations. Now, however, money is a concern at every turn.
 All in all, though, the couple said that life in the settlement has been what they hoped and that they have already made an impact. "It's a small community," Mr. Schuster said, "and we're important parts of it already. I've given classes and read the Torah in the synagogue. It's been amazing."
 A man whose family moved in the opposite direction from Israel to Bergen County three years ago scoffed at the Schusters' hope of contributing to Israel and bonding with its people. Most Israelis would mock them, said the man, who asked that his name not be used because he did not want to cause controversy in the interwoven Jewish community.
 Mr. Schuster said such sentiment, from a nonreligious Israeli, did not surprise him. "It makes sense," he said, "that people who aren't driven by faith and the laws of the Torah would ask: 'Why would you want to be in Israel during a war? Why would you want to be poorer than you could be?"' And he rejected the idea that most Israelis would mock his family's decision to make aliyah. When Israelis hear "the way we speak about the land of Israel and how much we care for it," Mr. Schuster said, "I have no doubt that our presence here strengthens their presence here."
 BUT the Schusters did more than move. By choosing to live on the far side of the Green Line, they have injected themselves and their children, Sarit, 4, and Max, 2, directly into the passionate debate over the role of the settler population in the bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians. "You would have to totally suspend reality to think the increase in the settler population hasn't contributed to the collapse of the peace process," said Lewis Roth, an assistant executive director at Peace Now, a lobbying group that views the settlements as not only an obstacle to peace, but also as a major burden that Israel should abandon for its own well-being. "Just as Israelis point to the Palestinian terror as a sign that in a land for peace deal the Palestinians are not offering peace, the Palestinians point to this land grab as a sign Israel is not offering land."
 Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, dismisses such arguments. Mr. Klein has contened for years that there will never be peace in the Middle East until people stop obsessing about Jews' right to settle in Judea and Samaria the biblical names for the north and south of the West Bank.
 Referring to the land on both sides of the Green Line, Mr. Klein said in a telephone interview: "Israel is our holy land, given to us by God. We should be making a moral, religious and legal claim that that land is ours." 
 The issue for the Palestinians has never been control of the West Bank, he said.
 "They don't care about a country," Mr. Klein said. "They care about destroying Israel."
 Mr. Schuster makes a distinction between Hashmonaim and what he calls "the hot spots," like the Israeli settlements amid Hebron, where a few hundred Jews live "in the faces" of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. He also sees a distinction between Hashmonaim, with its proximity to the Green Line, and settlements scattered deep in the West Bank, which will have to be dismantled if there is ever to be a contiguous state of Palestine.
 Mr. Schuster admires the passion that the Hebron settlers have for the land, but he cannot accept that the land is worth losing lives over.
 "Giving Judea and Samaria away is crushing, crushing," he said in a conversation before moving. "To have this land in our control, land that God gave us, and to give it back, is terrible. But are suicide bombs less terrible? Is holding down two million people any less terrible?" 
 Mrs. Schuster is significantly more hawkish than her husband, although she says that listening to him over the years has tempered her views. Still, she says she is shocked that the Israeli government has not acted more decisively in its handling of the conflict. 
 When asked what should be done, however, she struggled to find her words and sighed deeply, exasperated by a sense of hopelessness.
 "What's the long-term solution? I don't even see it anymore. I think of the word 'deportation,"' she said of Palestinians, "and that's horrible it brings back connotations of the Holocaust. But we have to defend ourselves and we have to make sure our country continues to exist and we have to go to whatever measure to do that. No other country would tolerate being scared to send their children to school. It's ridiculous."
 With each day, Mr. and Mrs. Schuster said, their family is becoming more rooted in Israel. Each Sabbath and Jewish holiday celebration, they said, reminds them that theyare finally living among their own people. 
 Mr. Schuster added, however, that it is too early to tell whether the family will fulfill his hope of making some lasting, significant contribution to their new country. Mrs. Schuster says she believes it is enough simply to be among Israelis and living in their promised land, but Mr. Schuster disagrees.
 "It is not enough just to live here," he said. "I want us to do something special. The seeds are being planted, but two years from now if I don't see a sapling growing from those seeds, then I'll have to ask whether we're doing enough. But we're not even at the point of asking that yet."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: WHITE HOUSE MEMO; 
A Change of Tone: Pitfalls Emerge in Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
By the standards of a White House that insists that nearly everything at all times is proceeding precisely according to plan, and where misjudgment is typically held to be a stranger, the last few weeks have brought a new, unvarnished tone.
 His plan to bring peace to the Middle East, Mr. Bush acknowledged on Thursday, is "stalled." 
 A few days after Vice President Dick Cheney said the government did not know whether Saddam Hussein had some connection to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, fueling criticism that the administration was still implying a possible link where none appears to exist, Mr. Bush all but contradicted him. Asked by reporters on Wednesday about Mr. Cheney's statement, the president replied, "No, we've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with September the 11th." 
In seeking $87 billion from Congress next year for military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan -- a request that itself could have been taken as an admission of failure in postwar planning -- Mr. Bush told the nation two weeks ago that the terrorist attacks in Iraq "have done great harm," adding a new note to the administration's insistence that great progress is being made there.
The day after the president made the $87 billion request, which includes $20.3 billion for Iraq's reconstruction, a senior administration official was asked whether the United States had underestimated the scale of the work required to rebuild there. The answer was yes. "It is fair to say that the level of decay and underinvestment in Iraqi infrastructure was worse than almost anyone on the outside anticipated," the official said in a conference call with reporters.
As to whether he would be able to persuade other nations to help bring Iraq under control and get its economy going again, Mr. Bush said yes, but then seemed to acknowledge that success was no sure thing. "One of the things I must do and will continue to do" is make the case for why a stable Iraq is in the world's interests, Mr. Bush told reporters at Camp David on Thursday, adding that he would "have a much better feel" for the attitude of the Europeans after meetings at the United Nations when the annual General Assembly gathers in the next few days.
The White House's new forthrightness may be nothing more than a series of coincidental candid comments. In any case, it has its limits. The appearance by Mr. Cheney on "Meet the Press" last Sunday was a detailed and unwavering defense of the administration's Iraq policies. On the domestic front, Mr. Bush remains unyielding in his assertion that his tax cuts will create a rebound in employment, despite nearly three years of steady job losses.
Indeed, the White House said there was nothing new in Mr. Bush's language. "The president has always felt it is important to be up front with the American people about the challenges and threats we face," said Suzy DeFrancis, a spokeswoman for the White House. "He has consistently told the American people the facts as he saw them and urged us to take the actions necessary to prevent terrorist attacks."
To Democrats who have been saying since the 2000 campaign that Mr. Bush has misled the American people, any increase in straight talk from the White House now seems meaningless or self-serving.
"If they said with a straight face that the world was flat or the sky was orange, they would expect people to accept it, and would question the patriotism of those who didn't," said David Sirota, spokesman for the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group.
To some political strategists, the White House's more nuanced new stance on some issues reflects concern about Mr. Bush's credibility with voters, Congress and the rest of the world. 
A poll this week by the Democratic firm of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research conducted for Democracy Corps, a Democratic advocacy group, found that 57 percent of voters said Mr. Bush was honest and trustworthy, and 63 percent said he was a strong leader. The poll gave him an overall approval rating of 53 percent, consistent with his standing in polls done for both parties recently.
But 53 percent of respondents agreed with the statement "I cannot trust what President Bush is saying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq." Forty-six percent agreed with the statement "President Bush misled Americans about the dangers and threats Iraq posed before the war." 
Asked about the statement "President Bush did not sufficiently plan for the postwar situation in Iraq and does not have a plan to win the peace and bring American troops home," 54 percent agreed.
Polling about Mr. Bush's honesty and credibility gives different results when the questions are asked in different ways. But if there are cracks developing in public trust as the economy continues to struggle and the Democratic presidential candidates step up their attacks, Mr. Bush has little choice but to be more forthright, some analysts said.
"I would call it damage control," said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. "They're vulnerable and he knows it, and they're trying to defuse the problem as quickly as possible."
Mr. Thurber said the increasingly evident trouble with the administration's strategy for Iraq had left Mr. Bush open to renewed scrutiny over his justification for the war and in particular to whether he used intelligence information selectively in making a case that Iraq was an imminent threat.
In addition, he said, the administration now needs to build support even among Republicans in Congress for the $87 billion spending request, and to win over skeptical or hostile allies at the United Nations in its efforts to reduce American costs and casualties in Iraq. 
To other observers, shifts in Mr. Bush's language hint at an effort to change course without appearing to do so, to acknowledge reality without giving up the political high ground. Fred I. Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton, described Mr. Bush as a "reluctant pragmatist" who seeks ways to climb down without admitting defeat.
"He'd like to stick with whatever vision thing he has in his head," Mr. Greenstein said, "but when it doesn't work out, he compromises and declares victory."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE ECONOMY; 
Iraq Offering Laws to Spur Investment From Abroad

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Sept. 20 

 BODY:
Iraq, in an effort to jump-start its economy and override security concerns, will announce new laws here on Sunday that remove most hurdles to foreign investment in the struggling country and offer very low tax rates for corporations and individuals, a senior Iraqi official said tonight.
 The Iraqi announcement coincides with an annual meeting here of the world's leading financial ministers and central bankers to discuss global economic matters. 
 The moves are intended to make a stable Iraq, which has the world's second largest pool of known oil reserves, one of the most attractive venues for doing business in the Persian Gulf region. Yet Iraq is far less than stable, and with the pace of reconstruction proceeding much more slowly than the Bush administration anticipated, the announcement by the Iraqi Governing Council's finance minister, Kamel al-Gailani, also seeks to boost parallel efforts by the White House to drum up outside financial support for its efforts there. 
The American treasury secretary, John W. Snow, will meet with Mr. Gailani here Sunday at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund conference.Mr. Snow has been pressing hesitant allies to contribute billions of dollars in aid to help rebuild both Iraq and Afghanistan.
Although Mr. Snow said in an interview here today that the United Nations had not been discussed as a possible conduit for such financing, President Bush is expected to issue a "call to action" in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday for member nations to contribute both troops and money to Iraq and Afghanistan.
In an interview at his hotel here tonight, Mr. Gailani said that Sunday's announcement "is the most important thing we are working on. It's a message for the investors to come invest in our country and help get Iraq back on its feet."
The fact that Iraq appears to be awash in uncertainty, antagonism and violence may not inspire confidence from foreign investors. The Bush administration faces similar hurdles in Afghanistan, where it is trying to introduce a market economy and encourage foreign investment at a time when machine gun nests still bristle from the rooftops of government buildings.
To try to allay safety concerns and provide for rich returns to those willing to risk investing money in a war zone, Mr. Gailani said foreign owners could control as much as 100 percent of any enterprise in which they invest in Iraq; that would be a sharp contrast with most of the Arab world, where foreign ownership of locally based concerns is typically highly restricted. The ownership rule applies to every sector of the economy except natural resources, meaning that the lucrative, but still relatively dormant, oil industry will remain entirely in the hands of Iraqi owners.
The new ownership laws, completed on Friday, allow investors to jump into Iraq immediately, without having to be screened by the government. All profits from such ventures can be fully and immediately remitted overseas, meaning the money does not have to be stored for any period of time with an Iraqi institution. Real estate cannot be owned by foreigners under the new law, but can be leased for up to 40 years.
For companies and individuals who set up shop in Iraq, corporate and personal income tax rates will range from 3 to 15 percent after a tax holiday expires at the end of the year. To boost trade, Iraq will impose a flat tariff of just 5 percent on all imports except for relief supplies.
The Central Bank of Iraq has been made legally and operationally independent, and foreign banks will be allowed to open branches there. The law permits six foreign banks to buy complete control of local banks within the next five years, after which there will be no limits on foreign banks' entry into Iraq. An unlimited number of foreign banks can purchase up to 50 percent of local banks.
The banking law, should it gain traction with outsiders, would introduce competition to a market dominated by just two large Iraqi banks, Rafidain Bank and Rashid Bank. Lending in the country is anemic, and an adviser to Mr. Gailani said he hoped that the law would encourage new banks entering the market to make loans to small businesses, which are seen as a key to future economic growth. 
On Oct. 15, Iraq will introduce a national currency, the new Iraqi dinar. It will be the first single unified currency in Iraq in some time.
All of these moves come in advance of a donors' conference in Madrid in late October, where America will ask allies to contribute funds to Iraq. The United States will hold a similar conference here on Sunday to seek funds for Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
Credit Card Rewards Turn From Nouns to Verbs

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
FOR years, credit card companies have tried to bolster their business by offering rewards programs loaded with things that cardholders can get with membership points -- plane tickets and hotel rooms, fancy luggage and watches, even cash rebates on purchases. But lately the focus has been on experiences over things. 
 For 95,000 rewards points, American Express will send a personal chef to a card holder's home to share some culinary techniques and prepare a meal for nine. For 60,000 points, someone who carries a Citibank Diamond Preferred Rewards card can glide in a hot-air balloon over the vineyards of Napa Valley, before touching down for a catered picnic that offers some of the region's best wines. Last year, a Diners Club member exchanged 90,624 points for a pair of tickets to the annual New Year's Eve gala at the Casino Ballroom on Catalina Island in California. 
 "Experience rewards create excitement, because they're often something new that a person couldn't get on their own, or wouldn't get on their own," said Chris X. Moloney, director for market strategy at Maritz Loyalty Marketing, a consulting firm in Fenton, Mo. 
 The card companies, Mr. Moloney said, get a chance to win over new customers and foster loyalty, and maybe garner some good publicity along the way. "Experiences are something that people like to talk about with anyone at any time, so you create sort of a customer advocate with them," he said. 
 The battle to attract new cardholders is especially fierce these days. Not only are card issuers competing among themselves in an already saturated market, but they are also watching as more consumers bypass credit cards altogether by taking advantage of low interest rates and tapping into the equity of their homes through mortgage refinancing and home equity loans.
 To keep card holders charging, many issuers have been adding rewards programs or revising existing ones. First Annapolis Consulting in Linthicum, Md., estimates that half of all credit cards in circulation are linked to rewards programs. But a study released this summer by Maritz Loyalty Marketing found that only 30 percent of Americans actually belonged to a credit card rewards program. 
 So-called experience rewards are not new. For years, high-end retailers like Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus have been offering special perks like sailing lessons and spa treatments to certain customers who use their cards. Issuers of general-purpose cards, like American Express and Diners Club, have been creating invitation-only events for their top spenders, typically card holders who charge at least $100,000 a year. 
 But lately, Diners Club, American Express, Citibank and a few other card issuers have broadened access to such rewards by offering them to anyone who amasses enough points. In April, American Express introduced its Your Reward loyalty program, which allows cardholders to concoct their own rewards, provided they have enough points. For the past year, Diners Club has promoted a program that gives similar free rein to cardholders who have accumulated at least 100,000 points through its Personalized Rewards program. 
 The companies are offering the experience rewards in addition to the usual merchandise and travel rewards. In most of the programs, a point is earned for each $1 or $2 spent, although the companies often offer promotions that allow cardholders to earn them faster. Each company also has its own system for converting points into purchasing power; a look through an American Express catalog indicates that 10,000 points might be worth around $100 in rewards. 
 EVEN card issuers that do not have made-to-order rewards are emphasizing experiences over things. In July, Citibank began offering its Diamond Preferred cardholders a line of rewards that includes a swim with dolphins in Orlando, Fla., or a snowmobile ride in the Rocky Mountains. The new line, billed as Diamond Preferred Entertainment rewards, includes options like tickets to almost any concert or sporting event a member wants to attend. 
 Entertainment companies are also entering the fray. Universal Studios last year introduced a MasterCard credit card in collaboration with J.P. Morgan Chase, while Disney teamed up with BankOne in January to offer a Visa card. Among the rewards offered through their customer loyalty programs are discounted or free admission to the parks.
 Some programs give cardholders a chance to learn something new. So far this year, Diners Club said, members have used the Personalized Rewards program to take classes at: a cooking school in Rome; the Original Golf School in Crystal River, Fla.; and the University of Illinois. With points earned on their Diamond Preferred cards from Citibank, sports enthusiasts can get a deal toward attending a baseball camp in Scottsdale, Ariz., (10,400 points earns a $100 gift certificate) or a race-car driving school (27,500 points for a $250 certificate). For 198,000 points, they can learn fly-fishing in Idaho and Montana. 
 Some programs provide services. Using 25,000 American Express points, a cardholder from Virginia hired contractors to install carpeting in his father's home last June. In the Citibank program, 5,000 points earn a $50 gift certificate to Merry Maids, the cleaning service. Michael McGowan, 48, a marketing consultant, traded in 170,000 American Express points in July to hire a fitness trainer and to enroll for a year at a health club near his home in Phoenix. He had planned to invest in a fitness regimen anyway, he said, but the package was still an indulgence.
 "It's more upscale than what I would have joined if I were paying right out of my pocket," Mr. McGowan said, explaining that this was the first time he had redeemed rewards points for anything other than merchandise or plane tickets. 
 Cardholders can also reward themselves with a night out. For Randall Young, 47, a Diners Club member from Carrollton, Tex., that meant a Fleetwood Mac concert in San Diego in July with his wife, Pixie, to celebrate their 18th wedding anniversary and a night's stay at a nearby hotel, all for 100,000 points. "Anytime you want to do something, you pretty much can call them and they'll figure it out," Mr. Young, a business consultant, said of the reward program.
 CONNIE MAJURE-RHETT, 50, of Wilmington, N.C., will use 500,000 points from her American Express rewards program to spend four weeks in March traveling through New Zealand in a recreational vehicle. Ms. Majure-Rhett said she had been daydreaming about such a trip since she visited New Zealand in 1993, but she couldn't afford the kind of getaway she was envisioning, including first-class plane tickets.
 "I really believed that one day, someone would come up with a way for me to pay for a camper, and there it was," said Ms. Majure-Rhett, president of the Greater Wilmington Chamber of Commerce. "I had been saving my points for this, to show my husband how beautiful it is."
 Card issuers say that it is too early to gauge the popularity of experience rewards but that many cardholders have expressed excitement about them, especially as they start to understand their flexibility. 
 Brian Karnofsky, 49, for one, says the expanded offerings in the Diners Club program have been an incentive for him to use the card more often in business and at home. Last spring, after accumulating three million points, he took his wife, his two children and a friend of his daughter to Australia. The Diners Club points paid for their air fare, hotel rooms and daily excursions. They climbed to the upper arch of the Sydney Harbor Bridge to watch the sunset, went scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef and took a safari through a nearby rain forest. 
 Mr. Karnofsky, an environmental consultant in Cary, N.C., said he'd spend a million more points on a family getaway. "It really makes a vacation a little more fun," he said. "It's like spending Monopoly money."

HEADLINE: Companies Prepare for New State Taxes 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
PEOPLE'S BANK of Bridgeport is big: $12 billion in assets, 150 branches statewide and 3,800 employees. Imperial Spring Company of Southington, a family-owned manufacturer of industrial parts, is small, with 36 workers and about $3 million in annual revenue.
 Size matters, but not when it comes to the anxiety both share over the three new corporate tax measures, including a 25 percent corporate tax surcharge, that state lawmakers and the governor completed late last month after weeks of bargaining between the two sides to make up the state's nearly $1 billion deficit. 
 The state's 50,000 corporate tax-paying businesses now find themselves liable for filling 15 percent of the budgetary hole, a projected $124 million for calendar year 2004. 
"It sounds like they were careful not to put companies out of business," said Michael Palazzo, Imperial Spring's treasurer. "But it will hurt."
Todd Martin, the chief economist at People's Bank, said: "The increases could have been a lot worse, but this is not the time to hit corporations with additional taxes when really the state needs to get hold of its spending. If you look at the state budget, you have increases for the next two years, and they're not cutting."
"It is the worst time," said Larry Palazzo, Michael's older brother and Imperial Spring's president, whose 49-year-old company founded by his father has dropped nine workers from a staff of 45 three years ago. Since than, annual revenues have fallen $1 million. 
Connecticut businesses will take a hit, large, medium and small companies acknowledged. The questions without easy answers are how significant will the hit be in a time when the economy is stagnant and jobs are still scarce? Will these measures seriously handicap the state's ability to retain businesses, if not attract them and foster their growth?
But the fact is that almost every state is in the same budgetary quagmire, having to resort to squeezing businesses and individuals, said Edward Deak, an economist at FairfieldUniversity.
"Most states today are hard-pressed to offer benefits to attract companies from Connecticut," he said.
Donald Klepper-Smith, an economist with Scillia Dowling & Natarelli, a business services firm in New Haven, said Connecticut's economy had been "flat-lining, and my concern here, net-net, is that some of the underlying assumptions about the economy may prove to be overly optimistic."
The most wide-reaching of the three tax measures -- the 25 percent surcharge in calendar year 2004 -- is projected to affect about 17,000 of the state's 50,000 corporate-tax-paying businesses, some heavily, according to the State Office of Fiscal Analysis. The agency projected $84 million in revenue from this measure.
The second measure is the elimination of the deduction for interest payments in tax-avoidance strategies. In such moves, for example, a company will set up and capitalize an affiliate in another state, usually a tax-free state, then borrow its own money from the affiliate and then pay the affiliate interest. 
The other state will not tax the interest, and the business will take a deduction for the interest in Connecticut, in essence, reducing a tax burden by simply moving its money around.
The Office of Fiscal Analysis predicted that this measure would yield $10 million annually, far less than the estimated $172 million that Connecticut is losing because of such tax sheltering, according to the Multistate Tax Commission's corporate tax sheltering report issued in July. Large multinational or multi-state corporations are the most likely to be effected.
"You're probably talking up to 1,000 companies," said Robert Wysock of the O.F.A.'s revenue section. "Your larger corporations that have a lot of non-Connecticut affiliates, your larger retailers, multi-nationals, maybe some power companies, maybe financial service companies."
The State Department of Revenue Services has not ignored the problem of these type of deductions, said Richard Nicholson, deputy commissioner of the agency.
"Over the past five years, the department has uncovered schemes involving in excess of 100 different corporations that we have audited or addressed in another compliance manner," Mr. Nicholson said. "But I don't think the small and medium-size business should feel any effect from closing this loophole. But they will feel the effect of the 25 percent surcharge, no question about it."
The third tax is a $250,000 fee for multi-affiliate corporations that save $250,000 or more by filing combined tax returns rather than separate returns for each subsidiary. Previously, the fee was capped at $25,000 for companies that saved $25,000 or more by filing combined returns.
The expected take is $30 million a year.
"Somewhere around 120 to 130 companies have at least a tax benefit of $250,000 or greater under the combined reporting we see right now," Mr. Wysock said. "They tend to be larger companies that have 30, 40, or 50 affiliates with a presence in the state, retailers, financial services, large manufacturers, not a lot of companies."
The list includes People's Bank.
"It affects us," Mr. Martin said. The $250,000 "could be maybe five workers you could hire that you might not be able to hire."
People's will continue to expand, Mr. Martin said, "and in and of itself it's not going to change our expansion strategy, but when we're looking at every single penny -- and believe me, we are -- it's going to be another thing to look at."
Regardless, Valerie Carlson, a People's spokeswoman, said the new taxes "will be inconsequential to People's' earnings in2003 and have no negative impact on operations."
Joseph Brennan, vice president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said all three tax measures will slow economic recovery.
"They're only going to make Connecticut a less attractive place to do business," he said. "There's no question about that."
But, Mr. Nicholson said, "Certainly Connecticut is not hanging out there alone attacking corporate loopholes and increasing the large corporations' tax liability in the process. We're talking more of a level playing field."
Other states are not the threat, Mr. Deak of Fairfield University said. "The real problem is whether firms would relocate all or part of their production process outside of the U.S.," he said. "That's the growing national trend."
Connecticut manufacturers have long complained that foreign competitors are unfairly subsidized. Now the state's manufacturers are bemoaning new taxes.
"It's the wrong thing to do at the wrong time," said Frank Johnson, president of the Manufacturing Alliance of Connecticut, citing 29,000 job losses in the last two years, leaving 240,000 workers still employed. 
The new surcharge especially hurts the state's remaining 5,500 manufacturers, Mr. Johnson said.
"Twenty-five percent is substantial," he said. "It reduces their ability to invest in new equipment, new buildings and new hires." 
But Mr. Deak said, "Corporations benefited substantially from earlier tax cuts," -- a corporate tax rate of 7.5 percent, down from 11 percent in the early 1990's -- "and everybody has the obligation to pay their fair share."
Are the new taxes fair? 
"Unfortunately, the corporations don't vote with a ballot," Mr. Deak said. "They vote with their feet."

HEADLINE: University Votes to Support Art Collection's Move Into Philadelphia 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
After weeks of tense negotiations, the Barnes Foundation and its multibillion-dollar collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art are closer than ever to moving from a quiet suburb to downtown Philadelphia, where its neighbors will be the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Rodin Museum and a planned museum devoted to the sculptor Alexander Calder. 
 The board of Lincoln University, the institution that nominates four of the five board members of the Barnes, voted yesterday to support the proposed move. But because moving the art from its home in Merion, Pa., violates the will of the foundation's creator, Albert C. Barnes, it needs the permission of the Montgomery County Orphans' Court. Judge Stanley Ott is expected to consider the foundation's petition in December and make a decision sometime early next year. 
 The Barnes is on the brink of bankruptcy, foundation members say. To rescue it and put it on firm financial footing, 30 local donors and organizations led by three foundations -- the Annenberg Foundation, the Lenfest Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts -- have pledged a total of $150 million to make the move happen. Of that, $100 million is to go toward building a new home for the Barnes on what is being called "miracle museum mile" in downtown Philadelphia and $50 million is for an endowment. City officials have offered the site of the Youth Study Center, between the Free Library and the Rodin Museum. The center is being demolished. 
Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and Attorney General Mike Fisher attended yesterday's meeting, and before the vote, Mr. Rendell addressed the board in support of the plan. 
Frank C. Gihan, president of Lincoln, said that regardless of the vote, the governor pledged his support to Lincoln in the form of a four-to-five-year $50 million plan that includes financing the construction of an international culture center and a building for science and technology. The money will also go toward construction of two other buildings, one an international culture center and the other for science and technology. The money will also go toward renovating several existing campus buildings. The governor also said he would help raise money for Lincoln, which is having financial difficulties of its own and is trying to increase its endowment. 
"This is not a quid pro quo," said John Estey, Mr. Rendell's chief of staff. "The governor has been a champion of the revitalization of downtown Philadelphia. And we want to make the Barnes a valuable resource and more accessible to the region." 
In addition to financial support, students at Lincoln will be able to take classes at the Barnes, something that despite its relationship, they have not been able to do, Mr. Gihan said. There will also be faculty exchanges between the Barnes and the university. 
Rebecca Rimel, president and chief executive of the Pew Charitable Trusts, said she had wanted to help the foundation ever since its president, Bernard C. Watson, asked her for support two years ago. 
"Philadelphia's our home, and we support many cultural programs here," Ms. Rimel said. While she declined to say how much money Pew had promised, she did say that the trust had agreed to what Ms. Rimel called "bridge financing," $3.1 million over two years to help with operating expenses. 
In supporting the plan, Lincoln's board also agreed to give up control of the Barnes Foundation. Under the plan, the Barnes would add 10 members to the board, and Lincoln could nominate only a third of the board. 
A year before his death in 1950, Dr. Barnes, a collector who manufactured patent medicines, entrusted Lincoln University with the power to nominate the majority of the foundation's trustees, even though Lincoln had no reputation for the study of art. 
Under their care is a world-class collection of about 800 paintings and 200 sculptures, including about 170 Renoirs, 55 Cezannes and 20 Picassos. Everything is arranged as Barnes thought art should be seen, in a quirky yet thoroughly original way so that paintings by, say, Matisse, Seurat, Van Gogh and Manet are paired with porcelains, furniture and other objects like antique hardware. 
By moving the art to a new building, many fear the collection will lose its personality. "Barnes spent a lifetime putting the collection together, and no matter who the architect it will pale by comparison," said Nick Tinari, a former Barnes student.
Richard L. Feigen, a New York art dealer who sat on the Lincoln board and an art advisory committee for the Barnes, said the proposed move was "an outright theft of Barnes's legacy." Mr. Feigen also said that allowing the foundation to violate Dr. Barnes's will would set a very bad precedent. 
"Not everything has to be a mega museum," Mr. Feigen added. "There's a place for documenting the history of cultural patronage and for smaller, idiosyncratic museums both here and abroad. Look at the Frick, the Morgan, the Wallace Collection, the Soames Museum." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the effort to move the Barnes Foundation art collection to Philadelphia from Merion, Pa., misstated the name of a London museum cited by an art dealer who has advised the foundation. He said there was a place for "smaller, idiosyncratic museums" like the Barnes and mentioned Sir John Soane's Museum, not Soames.
An article on Dec. 14 about a judge's decision to let the Barnes Foundation move its art holdings from Merion, Pa., to Philadelphia misstated the number of works by Renoir, Cezanne and Picasso in the collection. (Several articles since 1991 have also variously misstated those figures as well as the number of works by Matisse.) There are 181 Renoirs, not 170; 69 Cezannes, not 55; and 46 Picassos, not 20. There are 59 Matisses, not 60. An e-mail message from a reader last week pointed out the errors.

It's Good in Your Bones, Bad in Your Arteries

BYLINE:  By LARRY KATZENSTEIN; Larry Katzenstein is writing a book on heart scanning with Dr. Harvey Hecht.

 BODY:
LAST May, Dave DeBusschere, the former New York Knicks star, collapsed and died from a heart attack at age 62 while walking to lunch in Lower Manhattan. Subsequent reports described him as having appeared fit. An article in The New York Times said that the 6-foot-6 Mr. DeBusschere was "not much over his playing weight of 235 pounds" and had "no apparent symptoms of ill health."
 Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among American men, claiming more than 260,000 lives each year. According to the Framingham Heart Study of the National Institutes of Health, nearly half of all coronary deaths affect people, like Dave DeBusschere, with no history of heart disease symptoms. For them, a fatal heart attack or sudden death is the first and last hint of a problem. 
 One approach to finding the disease at a treatable stage is a test that detects calcium deposits in the walls of coronary arteries. Called calcium heart scanning, the test has been drawing increasing attention. It is noninvasive and painless, but also controversial, enmeshed in a heated debate over the value of body scanning in general. 
Body scanning does not require a doctor's referral. It is frequently done at commercial imaging centers, most of which offer whole-body scans -- of the heart for calcium and of the lungs, abdomen and pelvis for cancer -- costing from $800 to $1,000. A heart scan can be obtained separately for $250 to $600. Clients at these centers are mainly the "worried well," those who have no symptoms but want to be sure they are all right. This preventive type of scanning is rarely reimbursed by health insurance. 
After proliferating rapidly, imaging centers have fallen on hard times recently because of cutthroat competition, a weak economy and vocal opposition, including charges that scanning often yields ambiguous results that scare patients into undergoing expensive and unnecessary follow-up tests. While the criticism has focused mainly on scanning for cancer, calcium heart scanning has not escaped the spotlight.
The procedure takes advantage of the fact that calcium (along with fat and cholesterol) is a major part of plaque, the gunky material that thickens artery walls in the process known as atherosclerosis. Plaque causes heart disease by narrowing coronary arteries so much that they cannot deliver enough blood to nourish the heart muscle.
Some cardiologists contend that scanning the hearts of healthy people can cause harm if insignificant findings prompt invasive and potentially risky tests like coronary angiography and treatments like bypass surgery. But other heart specialists say the procedure saves lives by detecting heart disease early enough to allow intensive therapy -- with cholesterol-lowering drugs, for example -- to keep it in check. 
"Plaque is what causes your heart attack, and the amount of calcium we find with scanning is a measure of how much plaque you have," said Dr. John Rumberger, a cardiologistand a clinical professor of medicine at Ohio State University whose research has helped validate scanning's ability to detect calcium in plaque. His work has involved a scanning method called electron-beam computed tomography (CT). 
Dr. Rumberger's studies have shown there are no "false positive" scans, because calcium deposits turn up in coronary arteries only when they are associated with plaque. "If you have calcium, you have plaque," he said. Clinical studies by Dr. Rumberger and others have shown that the amount of calcium that is detected by scanning, known as the "calcium score," can reliably predict heart-attack risk.
Results from one such trial were published last May in the journal Circulation. More than 5,000 men and women with no symptoms of heart disease underwent calcium scanning, and then were divided into four groups, called quartiles, based on their calcium scores and followed for three years. The likelihood of a heart attack or other coronary "event" during that time correlated with the calcium scores: men in the highest quartile were 2.3 times as likely to suffer a fatal or nonfatal heart attack as were those in the lower three quartiles combined. The men in the highest quartile were also 10.1 times as likely to need angioplasty or bypass surgery. 
Calcium scores range from zero (no detectable plaque) to several thousand (extensive plaque). "A score between 100 and 400 often indicates moderate heart disease," Dr. Rumberger said. "And most of us feel those people need to be worked up thoroughly to search for the causes, such as elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, that we then treat aggressively." 
For scores above 400, he said, "the patient may have obstructive heart disease and not know it." The next step for them may be an exercise stress test to see if the coronary arteries have narrowed to the point where heart function is impaired. An abnormal stress test, he said, may indicate the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery. 
The Circulation study found calcium scans to be a better predictor of coronary events than looking at conventional risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol. 
"The traditional risk factors do a good job, but we have to do better," said Dr. George T. Kondos, the associate chief of cardiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the lead author of the Circulation study. He cites studies showing that up to one-third of those with heart disease have none of the traditional risk factors, and notes that risk factors were derived from studies involving thousands of people and therefore shed more light on populations than on individual patients.
"It's always made intuitive sense to me that by measuring actual disease -- which is what calcium scanning does -- we'd get a better handle on predicting heart-attack risk," Dr. Kondos said.
Some cardiologists, however, are still not convinced that scanning predicts heart-attack risk more reliably than conventional risk factors do, or that it helps patients. "Before embracing a new technology for screening healthy people, you need assurance that it will help them feel better or live longer," said Dr. Rita F. Redberg, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. But, she said, "no studies whatever" show that scans can do that. 
Despite disagreements over the value of calcium screening, Dr. Kondos contends that doctors are moving toward a consensus on how to best use the test. "When I see a patient, I ask myself, 'What is the chance he is going to have a heart attack in the next 10 years?' " Dr. Kondos said. "If you're low risk -- young, no risk factors, no family history of heart disease -- a scan is unnecessary because your 10-year risk for a heart attack is less than 10 percent. The same applies to high-risk people. I don't need a scan to tell me that someone with diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension needs treatment to normalize his risk factors." 
But, he said, "there's an intermediate group -- men over 45 with one or two risk factors, the same for women over 50 -- whose 10-year risk of a heart attack is between 10 and 20 percent." For these intermediate-risk people, who comprise 30 to 40 percent of American adults, he added, "we're finding that calcium scanning can help us in deciding how aggressively we need to treat them."

Taking a Little 'Slice' of Your Heart
BODY scanning uses computed tomography, known as CT, in which computer software translates an X-ray image into a digitized cross-section, or "slice," called a tomogram. Scanning centers use either electron-beam CT, in which electron bursts are converted into X-rays; or helical ( spiral) CT, an X-ray gun that takes images while spinning around the patient. Although most centers use helical CT, electron-beam CT has been evaluated more extensively for heart scanning. 
For the electron-beam scan, which takes about a minute, the patient lies on a table that slides into the scanner. As the table moves incrementally, a beam of electrons bounces off tungsten plates in the scanner and is converted into X-rays. Electrodes attached to the patient's chest allow the scanner to take images between heartbeats, minimizing blur. 
The scanner takes about 35 three-millimeter-thick "slices" across the heart. Any calcium deposits will stand out clearly. After the scan, software analyzes all the images and calculates a cumulative calcium score based on the size and density of the deposits. The results are immediately available. LARRY KATZENSTEIN

HEADLINE: Dying to Kill Us 

BYLINE:  By Robert A. Pape; Robert A. Pape teaches political science at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Suicide terrorism has been on the rise around the world for two decades, but there is great confusion as to why. Since many such attacks -- including, of course, those of Sept. 11, 2001 -- have been perpetrated by Muslim terrorists professing religious motives, it might seem obvious that Islamic fundamentalism is the central cause. This presumption has fueled the belief that future 9/11's can be avoided only by a wholesale transformation of Muslim societies, which in turn was a core reason for broad public support of the invasion of Iraq. 
 However, this presumed connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism is wrongheaded, and it may be encouraging domestic and foreign policies that are likely to worsen America's situation. 
 I have spent a year compiling a database of every suicide bombing and attack around the globe from 1980 to 2001 -- 188 in all. It includes any attack in which at least one terrorist killed himself or herself while attempting to kill others, although I excluded attacks authorized by a national government, such as those by North Korea against the South. The data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any religion for that matter. In fact, the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a Marxist-Leninist group whose members are from Hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion (they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents).
Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist campaigns have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel liberal democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland. Religion is rarely the root cause, although it is often used as a tool by terrorist organizations in recruiting and in other efforts in service of the broader strategic objective.
Three general patterns in the data support my conclusions. First, nearly all suicide terrorist attacks occur as part of organized campaigns, not as isolated or random incidents. Of the 188 separate attacks in the period I studied, 179 could have their roots traced to large, coherent political or military campaigns. 
Second, liberal democracies are uniquely vulnerable to suicide terrorists. The United States, France, India, Israel, Russia, Sri Lanka and Turkey have been the targets of almost every suicide attack of the past two decades, and each country has been a democracy at the time of the incidents.
Third, suicide terrorist campaigns are directed toward a strategic objective. From Lebanon to Israel to Sri Lanka to Kashmir to Chechnya, the sponsors of every campaign have been terrorist groups trying to establish or maintain political self-determination by compelling a democratic power to withdraw from the territories they claim. Even Al Qaeda fits this pattern: although Saudi Arabia is not under American military occupation per se, the initial major objective of Osama bin Laden was the expulsion of American troops from the Persian Gulf.
Most worrisome, my research shows that the raw number of suicide attacks is climbing at an alarming rate, even while the rates of other types of terrorism actually declined. The worldwide annual total of terrorist incidents has fallen almost in half; there were 348 attacks in 2001 as opposed to 666 incidents in 1987. Yet the number of attacks in which the terrorists intend to kill themselves along with their victims has grown from an average of 3 per year in the 1980's, to 10 per year in the 1990's, to more than 25 in both 2000 and 2001. 
And in terms of casualties, suicide attacks are far and way the most efficient form of terrorism. From 1980 to 2001, suicide attacks accounted for only 3 percent of terrorist incidents, but caused almost half of total deaths due to terrorism -- even if one excludes as an aberration the unusually large number of fatalities on 9/11.
How should democracies respond? In the past, they have tended to react with heavy military offensives, only to find that this tends to incite more attacks and to stir public sympathy for the terrorists without hampering their networks (this has clearly been the case in the West Bank and Chechnya). In their frustration, some terrorized countries have then changed tacks, making concessions to political causes supported by terrorists. 
Yet this doesn't work either: one likely reason suicide terrorism has been rising so rapidly in recent years is that terrorist groups have learned that the strategy pays off. Suicide terrorists were thought to compel American and French military forces to abandon Lebanon in 1983, Israeli forces to leave most of Lebanon in 1985, Israeli forces to quit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994 and 1995, and the Turkish government to grant measures of autonomy to the Kurds in the late 1990's. In all but the case of Turkey, the terrorists' political cause made far greater political gains after they resorted to suicide operations. 
When one considers the strategic logic of suicide terrorism, it becomes clear that America's war on terrorism is heading in the wrong direction. The close association between foreign military occupations and the growth of suicide terrorist movements shows the folly of any strategy centering on conquering countries that sponsor terrorism or in trying to transform their political systems. At most, occupying countries will disrupt terrorist operations in the short term. But over time it will simply increase the number of terrorists coming at us. 
Unfortunately, negotiating concessions with the terrorists is also not a solution. The current failure of that approach in Israel is an all-too-common pattern. Concessions are usually incremental and deliberately staggered -- thus they fail to satisfy the nationalist aspirations of the suicide terrorists, yet encourage terrorist leaders to see their enemies as vulnerable to coercion. 
In the end, the best approach for the states under fire is probably to focus on their own domestic security while doing what they can to see that the least militant forces on the terrorists' side build a viable state on their own. Israel, for example, would be well advised to abandon the territory it holds on the West Bank but to go ahead with building the immense wall, 20 feet high and 20 feet wide, to physically separate it from the Palestinian population. This would create real security for Israel and leave the West Bank for a true Palestinian state.
For the United States, especially in light of its growing occupation of the Persian Gulf, it is crucial to immediately step up border and immigration controls. In the medium term, Washington should abandon its visions of empire and allow the United Nations to take over the political and economic institutions in Iraq. And in the long run, America must move toward energy independence, reducing the need for troops in the Persian Gulf. Even if our intentions in Iraq are good, our presence there will continue to help terrorist groups recruit more people willing to blow themselves up in the war against America.

HEADLINE: Europe Fights U.S. Over Passenger Data 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Europe's willingness to cooperate with a security-conscious United States government appears to have reached its limit.
 The union's commissioner in charge of data protection issues, Frits Bolkestein, said that while the European Union continues to stand with America in the war on terrorism, it views the latest demands for information about airline passengers flying into the United States from Europe as going too far. 
 In an example of the privacy issues raised by the Bush administration's aggressive stance on airline security, the American airline JetBlue Airways acknowledged on Friday that it had provided the Pentagon with information on more than one million of its passengers, as part of a program to track down terrorists and other "high risk" passengers. 
Those records, which were turned over in violation of the airline's own privacy policies, were then used to identify the passengers' Social Security numbers, financial histories and occupations. 
The Department of Homeland Security has drawn up a list of 39 items of information about each foreign passenger planning to fly to the United States. The list includes passenger name, date of intended travel, whether the ticket is a return or one-way and luggage tag numbers. 
Those items are among the 19 that do not concern European regulators and politicians. What does bother them are requests for items like all forms of payment information, the passenger's billing address and e-mail address, and some vague catch-all categories like "general remarks."
Under the Aviation and Security Act of 2001, the United States government expects airlines to collect this information before the flight departs, so that Customs officials can check for potential security threats before takeoff. They also want Customs to store the information for up to seven years. If airlines do not comply they face fines or could lose their landing rights in the United States.
"We should shy away from caricatures such as Big Brother, but there is a fear that steadily more data on E.U. citizens, innocent or not, is being stored electronically in Washington, and people don't like that," Mr. Bolkestein said in an interview.
Since March, the union has told airlines to comply with the requests for passenger information from the United States, even though they breach European Union data protection laws.
That was a temporary measure created to avoid putting airlines in an impossible legal situation, Mr. Bolkestein said. Now, he said, the union is trying to hammer out a permanent solution with the United States that will respect European privacy laws, while allowing the United States enough information to help it combat terrorism.
On Monday, he will hold a meeting with Asa Hutchinson, the under secretary for border and transportation security at the Department of Homeland Security. Each side is eager to reach a compromise.
"I am optimistic we will be able to narrow the gap on Monday," Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview. Two days ahead of the meeting, he appeared ready to remove the request for payment information from the list of data to be transferred. 
"Credit card information is not something we are seeking," Mr. Hutchinson said. "We understand there is a need to protect this information. We respect privacy." 
He declined to comment on how he would respond to other privacy concerns of the Europeans. These include the appointment of what they regard as an independent privacy officer to hear complaints from European citizens.
"If the information is incorrect people must have the right of redress," Mr. Bolkestein said.
Over the summer, Homeland Security appointed Nuala O'Connor Kelly to the position of chief privacy officer, partly to address the concerns of the Europeans. But Mr. Bolkestein said that since Ms. O'Connor Kelly reported to the Homeland Security hierarchy, she could not be considered independent. 
United States authorities want to be able to use passenger data to combat more than just terrorism, but Mr. Bolkestein will tell Mr. Hutchinson that access to the information should be limited to anti-terrorism purposes only. 
The American authorities would have to show a connection between one crime, for example, cross-border money laundering, and terrorism to be able to use the passenger information, the commissioner said.
Having made some concessions to the Europeans in the summer, Homeland Security will probably not budge much further, said Christopher Kuner, a lawyer who specializes in data protection issues with the Brussels office of Hunton & Williams. "I can't see the United States giving more ground," he said.
Mr. Bolkestein said he was not convinced he could persuade the United States to change its demands to comply with European privacy laws. He said he expected he would have to try to strike a bilateral agreement between the union and the United States that would allow American authorities an exemption from the union's privacy laws. 
Efforts to complete a bilateral deal would start toward the end of the year, once all hope that the United States would step into line with Europe's privacy laws is extinguished, Mr. Bolkestein said.
This would be an interim approach while seeking a long-term, multinational agreement. "The question about passenger data is an international problem," Mr. Bolkestein said.
Canada, South Korea and Australia are already asking for greater access to passenger information, he said. Some member states of the union including Britain are also looking to use more passenger data to help avert a terrorist attack.

HEADLINE: Caught in the Credit Card Vise 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"I'm still paying for groceries I bought for my family years ago," said Julie Pickett.
 She meant it literally. Mrs. Pickett and her husband, Jerry, of Middletown, Ohio, are trapped in the iron grasp of credit card debt. Except for the fact that no one is threatening to damage their kneecaps, they're in the same dismal position as the classic victim of loan-sharking. 
 People used to get thrown in jail for the very things credit card companies can now do legally. While banks and money markets are paying pittances in interest, it's common for the annual percentage rate on your friendly Visa or Mastercard to approach 30 percent.
This used to be called usury.
Julie Pickett stopped working full time when she had the twins. Jerry Pickett's business hit a downturn at about the same time. The family's credit cards, said Mrs. Pickett, suddenly loomed as "lifelines" to the daily necessities -- food, gas, auto repairs, clothing for the children.
Another child was born and the credit card debt eventually reached $40,000 -- an amount (with its perpetually increasing interest) that the Picketts are unable to pay off.
"We had one card that had about an $8,000 balance," Ms. Pickett said in an interview. "With interest and late fees it's now $18,000. The interest when we started out was like 18 percent. But after a year of not paying, it jumped to 28 percent."
Families like the Picketts are indeed responsible for the payment of their debts. But the credit card companies are engaged in one of the many big-time legalized rackets that are flourishing in this age of deregulation. The Picketts are profiled in a new report, titled "Borrowing to Make Ends Meet," by a nonpartisan public policy group called Demos: A Network for Ideas and Action.
The economy may have boomed in the last half of the 90's. But over the course of that decade, millions of American families sank deeper and deeper into debt, in large part because of the overuse of credit cards.
"Between 1989 and 2001," the report said, "creditcard debt in America almost tripled, from $238 billion to $692 billion. The savings rate steadily declined, and the number of people filing for bankruptcy jumped 125 percent."
Few things are easier than flashing the plastic and saying, "Charge it." And few heads of households, when broke, can resist the urge to use a credit card to buy food for the family or gas up the car to go to work.
In the period studied, the credit card debt of the average family increased by 53 percent. For middle-class families, the increase was 75 percent. For senior citizens, 149 percent. And for very low-income families, with annual incomes below $10,000, the increase was a staggering 184 percent.
The theme of the report is that while credit card use is frequently associated with frivolous consumption, the evidence seems to show that more and more Americans are using credit cards to bridge the difficult gap between household earnings and the cost of essential goods and services. Men and women struggling with such structural problems as job displacement, declining real wages and rising housing and health care costs have been relying on their credit cards as a way of warding off complete disaster.
At the same time the credit card companies have leapt gleefully into an orgy of exploitation. "Late fees," the report said, "have become the fastest growing source of revenue for the industry, jumping from $1.7 billion in 1996 to $7.3 billion in 2002. Late fees now average $29, and most cards have reduced the late payment grace period from 14 days to zero days. In addition to charging late fees, the major credit card companies use the first late payment as an excuse to cancel low, introductory rates -- often making a zero percent card jump to between 22 and 29 percent."
How high can interest rates go? According to Tamara Draut, one of the authors of the study, all of the major credit card issuers are located in states that have no limits on the rate of interest they can charge. (The state where the credit-card holder resides is irrelevant.)
And how crazy has the situation become? The Pickett family, which is absolutely unable to pay off the debt it has now, gets offers in the mail to open new credit card accounts every day.

HEADLINE: Call Centers in Survival Mode In Face of Do-Not-Call Rules 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
The largest telemarketers are desperately searching for a Plan B, now that Plan A -- stopping the federal government from establishing a national do-not-call registry -- has failed.
 As they gathered here for their annual convention, those who sell mortgage services, credit cards and corrugated roofing over the phone say that if they do not change the way they do business immediately, they may follow door-to-door salesmen into commercial extinction. 
 Unless the courts intervene, their crisis begins on Oct. 1, the day the do-not-call registry takes effect. From that day forward, telephone solicitors who call the 48 million phone numbers that Americans have voluntarily placed on the list so far will risk fines of up to $11,000 a violation.
"It's D-Day," said Lisa Scheuerman, who operates a telemarketing center in Baltimore, with 17 callers selling mortgage refinancings in seven states, including Florida and Connecticut. "I could lose my whole business." 
The industry says some two million phone-solicitation jobs could be lost within months.
But federal regulators are skeptical. For one thing, more than two dozen states have set up do-not-call lists without significant effects on jobs, regulators say.
The rules also allow telemarketers to call numbers on the list if the customer and the telemarketer had a business relationship in the prior 18 months or if the customer contacted the telemarketer with an inquiry within the prior three months.
Even so, the do-not-call regulation scares telemarketers enough to cause many to rethink how they do business. Many are planning to increase their solicitations to commercial establishments, which are not allowed to list their numbers on the do-not-call registry, or go to work for charities and other nonprofits that do not fall under the new restrictions. Others are talking about hiring employees and contracting out their call-center operations to serve businesses that need phone-in customer support services.
Already, some companies are spending tens of thousands of dollars to upgrade automated dialing systems to comply with the new rules and are hiring consultants to delete phone numbers on the do-not-call registry from their calling lists.
One result of the regulations, industry executives predict, is that smaller telemarketing operations will close and the larger companies will consolidate. But even big, successful marketers may find telemarketing becoming unprofitable.
Kathleen Thompson, senior vice president for marketing at Bank One, the credit card issuer, said that her company, through its telemarketing subcontractors, currently employs 2,500 agents placing as many as one million calls a month. The callers, she said, bring in 250,000 new accounts annually.
But the federal calling restriction could cut by half the number of people contacted by the bank, said Ms. Thompson, who sits on the board of the American Teleservices Association, the trade group that sponsored the industry meeting here, with representatives of other large telemarketing users like J. P. Morgan Chase, Sears Life, Verizon, GE Financial and Bank of America. "We may have to abandon it altogether," she said.
Another result may well be that people whose phone numbers are not on the registry will get more calls, said Ron Selfe, who operates Keystone Auto Glass, a company in Toledo, Ohio, that sells car windshields through phone solicitations.
Mr. Selfe's employees are trained to start each conversation with the question: "Do you have a crack or chip?" If the answer is no, they call back three months later and ask again.
With the do-not-call list limiting the number of potential customers, Mr. Selfe said his telemarketers would have to call more frequently to those still open to solicitations. "Instead of calling every three months," he said, "we may call every month."
Companies that operate telemarketing centers are now trying to remake their operations for other services. Some say they could convert themselves into customer service centers or focus on placing business-to-business solicitation calls.
Synergy Solutions, a telemarketing company here, is already altering its operations and spending $700,000 to upgrade its automated dialing system to comply with federal rules. 
The call center, housed in a former roller skating rink that has been remodeled into office space, has 220 cubicles for callers who earn around $10 an hour selling newspaper and magazine subscriptions, credit protection insurance and mortgage refinance services for people with credit problems.
During peak hours, 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., the center hums with the voices of solicitors greeting customer after customer with offers on products or asking them merely to agree to listen to a mortgage broker. The callers are turned down about 90 percent of the time, but they press on. The center's automated dialers place 150,000 calls a day, of which 30 to 40 percent result in a conversation between human beings.
Synergy is moving quickly to change its business emphasis. In January, nearly all of its revenue was generated by outbound calls. Since then, it has won customer service contracts with some existing clients, hiring managers to handle this business and retraining its sales staff. The company says it now generates 27 percent of its revenue from new services.
In the cubicles at Synergy, some callers are not worried -- yet. Tina Nagel, 42, a former dental assistant who has been telemarketing 10 years and earns around $18,500 annually, said she did not understand why Americans were so annoyed with people like her.
"What I'm doing is a valuable service," she said. "I'm telling people what their options are in life." Lately, she has been telling them they have the option to pay $9.99 a month for an identity-theft protection service.
The service she sells sends subscribers regular credit reports so they can find out if someone has made inappropriate charges. Ms. Nagel, who said she herself had recently been a victim of identity theft, acknowledged that she does not have the service herself.
Despite a speedy response to the regulations, Tim Searcy, the executive director of the American Teleservices Association, said the industry projected that the number of people currently working as phone marketers -- which it says is 4.1 million -- would be cut by half by Christmas.
Federal labor statistics indicate about 450,000 people work in telemarketing, but the industry says that figure does not include most callers employed directly by larger companies like banks and insurers.
"In recent history, no industry has had to face this kind of instantaneous devastation and of this magnitude," Mr. Searcy said.
He acknowledged that even heavy job losses may not elicit much political sympathy, given that the public placed 23 million phone numbers on the do-not-call list in the first two weeks of the registry's existence.
K. Dane Snowden, the director of consumer and governmental affairs for the Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies that established the federal rules, delivered a keynote speech at the conference. He told the group that the public was saying to the industry: "This is my home, stay out of it. This is my phone, stay off of it." Citing industry figures, he noted that telemarketers placed 104 million calls a day. His message was essentially that the privacy demands of consumers outweighed the economic effect on the industry.
Besides, Mr. Snowden argued, the government is helping telemarketers by providing a list of people who do not want to be called and probably are bad sales prospects anyway. "We've created free market research for the telemarketing industry," he said. "Telemarketers can be more confident the people they reach will be willing listeners."
But telemarketers argue the government has not fairly assessed the economic effect of the rules. And they assert that with $100 billion in sales generated from calls to consumers last year, many Americans clearly respond favorably to phone pitches.
Ms. Scheuerman, who operates A Direct Result, a telemarketing business in Baltimore, said people often thought only about the calls for products they did not want. "They don't realize how much they've purchased over the phone in the last three years," she said.
Federal regulators predict 60 million numbers will eventually be placed on the registry. The F.C.C. and the Federal Trade Commission, the agency charged with overseeing the list, have also issued other telemarketing restrictions. One requires that a live representative be put on the line within two seconds after a person answers the phone. Another rule prohibits telemarketers from hanging up before 15 seconds or four rings on most calls. Both rules are intended to regulate the use of automated dialing systems that allow telemarketers to place tens of millions of calls a day. 
The industry is fighting the regulations in court. A lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver contends that the law restricts free speech rights and fails to consider economic consequences.
As telemarketers pray for a legal reprieve, they seem resigned to a future of lower revenues and expectations. Mr. Searcy likened the do-not-call registry's effect on his industry to a wildfire racing through a forest, leaving charred remains in its wake. "After six months or two years, you'll see growth again," he said, "but what was there before is gone."

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Chides Europe Over Growth 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: DUBAI, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow suggested today that Europe should be "more accommodative" in its monetary policy, but aides said later that he had not intended to interfere in European policy making. 
 In a speech to the International Institute of Finance on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting, Mr. Snow spoke bluntly of what he sees as Europe's shortcomings. 
 "Governments need to take actions to knock out blockages to faster growth," he said. "We also need, in the case of Europe, more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy." 
 But a Treasury spokesman, Rob Nichols, quickly said that Mr. Snow had not intended to say Europe needed to cut interest rates but was simply "encouraging everybody to take steps to grow."
 "Snow was not calling for a change in monetary policy," Mr. Nichols said. "He was simply underscoring the broad idea that you need good monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies to grow." 
 The finance minister of Canada, John Manley, had no qualms about giving Europe advice, saying its performance continued to "languish."
 "In our view, further monetary easing should be considered to reinforce growth prospects," Mr. Manley said in an address tothe I.M.F.'s policy making committee.
 The European Central Bank cut its main lending rate to 2 percent in June, and many economists expect it to remain at this record low rate for some months.
 Euro zone members are constrained from expanding fiscal policy by strict rules capping their deficits at 3 percent of gross domestic product -- a limit France and Germany have broken because of slowing growth, risking hefty fines. 
 Concerned about suggestions they are not doing enough to revive growth, European policy makers have criticized swelling United States trade and budget deficits, warning that they are unsustainable. Mr. Snow appeared to be returning fire at the Europeans.
 He said the pace of growth and the expansion of personal incomes were trailing in Europe and many of the rest of the wealthy nations represented by the Group of Seven -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
 "This is troublesome," he said.

HEADLINE: SOFT ECONOMY AIDS RECRUITING EFFORT, ARMY LEADERS SAY 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: FORT KNOX, Ky., Sept. 16 

 BODY:
The slumping American economy has proved to be a boon to the Army's efforts to recruit the 100,000 enlisted soldiers it says it needs this year to fill its active-duty and reserve ranks, senior Army officials say, so far relieving concerns that the turmoil in Iraq could crimp new enlistments.
 All the armed services say they will meet or exceed their recruiting goals for the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30. 
 But many military personnel experts say the Army's efforts are most vulnerable over time because the Army recruits more active-duty and Reserve troops than all the other services combined -- 73,800 active-duty and 26,400 Reserve soldiers this year -- and it is now fielding about 90 percent of the 180,000 troops in Iraq and Kuwait.
"That's the driver, the economy," said Maj. Gen. Michael D. Rochelle, the head of the Army Recruiting Command here, adding that the chaotic conditions in Iraq have yet to hurt recruiting. 
Army recruiters have always offered educational benefits, job security and training skills to prospective soldiers. But recently they have been armed with more logistical support and a growing arsenal of financial incentives that look even more enticing in a down market.
The Army has raised signing bonuses to as much as $20,000 for badly needed positions like intelligence analysts. It has also increased college aid. And it has nearly doubled its advertising budget, to $227 million, in the last four years, shelving its 20-year-old "Be All You Can Be" slogan in favor of the "Army of One" campaign, aimed at Generation Y youths. It has ramped up a cyberrecruiting operation, with daily online chat rooms in English and Spanish. Next month it is rolling out a 15-month enlistment option (the current minimum length for a tour is two years) aimed at college students, an increasingly important target group.
The sagging economy mostly affects the recruiting of active-duty soldiers. About two-thirds of all enlisted troops resign by the end of their first tour, so the Army needs more than 70,000 new recruits a year to replenish its ranks.
The demographics of the newest Army recruits are shifting slightly. Women make up about 20 percent of this year's recruits; that figure is roughly unchanged over the last three years. But since the 2001 fiscal year, the share of Hispanics signing up has increased to about 13 percent from 11 percent, while the proportion of non-Hispanic whites has increased to about 65 percent from 62 percent. At the same time, the ratio of blacks signing up has declined to 16 percent from nearly 23 percent.
The drop in black recruits may be tied to the Army's increased focus on the college market, military officials say. Nearly one in four recruits now has some college experience, almost double the rate five years ago, General Rochelle said.
Recruiting part-time Army National Guard and Army Reserve troops, who are typically older and have civilian jobs, presents mounting challenges. Military experts warn that recruiting and retaining these citizen soldiers will get more difficult as they are repeatedly called up to serve extended tours in Iraq or Afghanistan as military police, civil affairs specialists, water-purification experts and other jobs.
"How long people will continue to be deployed will ultimately have some effect on retention," said Frank Shaffery, deputy director of Army recruiting operations here. "We're concerned about it."
Those concerns grew this month when the Army announced that 20,000 Reserve and National Guard soldiers would stay in Iraq or Kuwait for as long as 12 months, extending their tours on the ground by several months.
Army National Guard officials said this week that the Guard would probably fall short of its goal of recruiting 62,000 soldiers this year. But because fewer Guard forces will leave this year than had been anticipated, the Guard still expects to maintain its overall troop level at 350,000.
Lt. Col. Michael L. Jones, the Army National Guard's chief of marketing and advertising for recruiting and retention, said the Pentagon must give these troops more certainty. "We need to build in predictability so their families, employers or universities can be told, 'Here's the mobilization date and here's the demobilization date,' " he said.
The Army Recruiting Command is responsible for enlisting new regular Army and Army Reserve soldiers. The Army National Guard in each state recruits its own members, who belong to state militias unless called to active duty.
For active-duty Army and Reserve forces, recruiters are increasingly looking for older recruits with some college experience. These young people are weighing the risks of serving in places like Iraq or Afghanistan against the reality of college costs, and following their pocketbooks as well as their patriotic instincts, General Rochelle said.
"They are seeing the facts and the world situation, as well as the domestic implications of the economy, job opportunities and prospects, and the opportunity for higher education, which are impacted by rising tuition costs," he said.
Recruiting is a volatile business even in the best of times. Success depends on elusive perceptions about the vitality of the armed forces as well as their missions, a fact Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld recently underscored.
"We're still meeting all of the targets and goals for recruiting and retention," Mr. Rumsfeld told a conference in Washington commemorating the 30th anniversary of the all-volunteer military. "We have to watch that because we have to manage that force and recognize that there's a good deal of stress on the force at the present time."
As the presidential campaign heats up and Iraq policy comes under greater scrutiny, Army officials say it will be more critical than ever to reinforce their message with recruits and the people who influence them: parents, coaches and guidance counselors.
For these and other reasons, the Army has moved aggressively to stave off a return to the lean recruiting years of the late 1990's.
In addition to the increased recruiting dollars, the Army spent $321 million this fiscal year on travel, cellphones, laptop computers and other support for recruiters, up from $146 million a decade ago.
Sign-up bonuses for jobs in high demand, like intelligence analysts and helicopter mechanics, are now as high as $20,000, up from $15,000 a few years ago. (Bonuses for most Reserve troops range up to $5,000.) The Army will now pay up to $50,000 in education expenses and repay up to $65,000 in student loans, both sharp increases over past years.
Here at the command's three-story brick headquarters, three dozen cyberrecruiters field 750 e-mail messages daily and run online chat rooms in English and Spanish for 1,200 people a day. Recruiters say the anonymity of the chat rooms has drawn in many recruits who would never set foot in a recruiting station.
"They don't feel pressured into a commitment," said Naomi Gray, 37, a Spanish-speaking recruiter who spent seven years in the Army as a crane operator.
Ms. Gray said most of the questions that she got were about the economic and educational benefits of joining the Army. The uncertainty in Iraq, she said, has proved to be an attraction, not a turnoff, to many recruits who have contacted her.
One row up in the cyberrecruiting office, Dima Almoamin, 27, a Baghdad-born American military recruiter, is enlisting Arabic speakers by e-mail to be reservist translators for the United States military in Iraq.
Under a program started two months ago, the Army has raised its age limit for new recruits to 40 years old from 34, with a goal to attract 250 qualified Arabic translators a year for the next few years. "Eighty percent are Iraqis," Ms. Almoamin said of her recruits. "They want to help."

To the Editor:
Re "World Trade Center Endures. Read the Signs" (Blocks column, front page, Sept. 18): 
 David W. Dunlap rightly notes that no amount of time or development has erased the World Trade Center from our hearts or minds. 
 What began as two tall towers, with questionable aesthetic appeal, grew on New Yorkers and became one of our reference points in Manhattan.
I still persist in using "World Trade Center" when giving directions downtown.
Susan S. Szenasy, the co-director of the Rebuild Downtown Our Town coalition, says: "We keep calling it the trade center but it's not. It can't be."
But apparently, it is and always will be.

To the Editor:
 Re "Following a Trend, Downtown Looks to the Arts" (Arts pages, Sept. 15): 
 As the article states, cities across the nation have successfully revitalized downtowns by attracting new cultural institutions. 
But this success is not dependent solely on new architecture. Economic revitalization through the reuse of existing older buildings as galleries, museums and performance spaces already has a proven track record. 
Unfortunately, this approach has been missing from much of the public discussion about the future of Lower Manhattan. We need to avoid urban renewal plans that would obliterate the sense of place that makes this area our nation's most historic downtown.

HEADLINE: Putin Portrays Yukos Inquiries As an Isolated Criminal Matter 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has portrayed the investigations swirling around Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, as an isolated criminal matter that do not signal a wholesale review of the country's privatization of state assets in the 1990's.
 Making his first direct remarks on the Yukos affair since it erupted in July with the arrest of a major stockholder, Mr. Putin said in an interview with American journalists on Saturday evening that as president he could not interfere with the independence of prosecutors, who he said were simply upholding the law. 
 "Everybody, including business, must become accustomed to obeying the law," he said in the interview, held at his wooded estate outside of Moscow. "Nobody can be free from complying with the law, even those who have amassed billions."
At least eight investigations involving Yukos have begun since the arrest on July 2 of Platon Lebedev, the chairman of Menatep, the financial group that owns 61 percent of Yukos, and a close associate of its chairman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. The cases range from fraud and tax evasion to murder and attempted murder of officials and businessmen who had conflicts with Yukos. 
The affair has led to wide speculation that the privatization itself was under attack and that the Kremlin had a political grudge against Mr. Khodorkovsky because of his support for political parties opposed to Mr. Putin. It also has shaken Russia's stock market and foreign investors. 
In his remarks, however, Mr. Putin dismissed accusations of Kremlin involvement or political interference as "utter nonsense." And he seemed eager to reassure investors about stability in Russia's economy. The Yukos stock price and the broader market have rebounded from the steep drop after Mr. Lebedev's arrest in July. Last month, Russia approved Yukos's merger with Sibneft to create the world's fifth-largest publicly traded oil company.
Mr. Putin expressed hope that the matter would be resolved soon, but he noted that the charges included not only economic crimes but also "assassinations or murders in the merger of companies" that ultimately became Yukos during the 1990's. 
And while he said he could not interfere in a prosecution, he acknowledged for the first time that he had discussed Mr. Lebedev's arrest with Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir V. Ustinov.
Asked why Mr. Lebedev would be held in jail without bail during an investigation involving economic crimes rather than be issued a summons, Mr. Putin said Mr. Ustinov told him that Mr. Lebedev had gone into hiding when first informed of the investigation. He was arrested in a military hospital near Moscow. 
Mr. Putin met with journalists on the eve of a four-day trip to the United States, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly and hold two days of talks with President Bush at Camp David. 
The talks with Mr. Bush are expected to focus on issues like Iraq, Iran and North Korea, but Mr. Putin said that economic issues would also be on the table.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE COST; 
White House Steps Up Bid To Justify Iraq Spending

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The Bush administration plans to make its case before Congress this week that a $20.3 billion request for the reconstruction of Iraq is as important in the campaign against global terrorism as the military portion of the $87 billion being sought over all, senior officials said today.
 The administration accelerated its lobbying effort for the money, with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, inviting Congressional leaders to the Pentagon this evening for informal discussions of the administration's spending request, which President Bush called for on Sept. 7. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bremer, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and Gen. John P. Abizaid, the commander of American forces in the region, are scheduled to appear before Congressional committees this week to support the package. 
"The $20 billion in reconstruction is as critical to the war on terror as every other component in the $87 billion package," said an official of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led administration in Iraq.
"If we walk away now and don't make these critical investments, we could have a situation there that is a real breeding ground for terrorism, and for extremists who would capitalize on any sort of instability," the official said. "These are key to setting Iraq on the path of sustained economic independence and growth."
A senior Democratic legislator, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, said today that he would support the spending request but cautioned that it would have to be supplemented by contributions from allies -- or by a request to Congress and United States taxpayers.
In an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," Mr. Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was asked whether he would vote for the supplemental spending measure, and he replied, "I think we have to."
He said, however, that the total reconstruction cost was estimated at $50 billion to $75 billion over several years, far more than the administration's request for $20.3 billion in the coming year.
"It's going to cost a lot more," Mr. Biden said, adding later: "Somewhere you've got to get another, you know, 35, 40, 55, 60 billion dollars, and we either payor someone else helps us pay it. Or we don't do it."
A Republican who appeared on the same program, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, harshly criticized the Bush administration and the Pentagon for misjudging "what it was going to take to govern Iraq."
"That is just but one of the examples of how this administration did not do a very good job of planning," Mr. Hagel said. But he then added: "We are where we are. We can't lose. We now must move forward. We must be successful in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and bringing peace to the Middle East. All are connected, and you can't deal with any of them in a vacuum."
A senior Pentagon official rejected criticism that the administration underestimated what would be required to stabilize and rebuild Iraq, saying today: "Anybody that would have predicted in March what the needs were going to be in September would have been guessing. We have a much better feel now for the nature of challenges in front of us."
The supplemental request includes $51 billion for military operations in Iraq, $11 billion for military operations in Afghanistan and $4 billion to the Pentagon for domestic security and to support allied efforts.
The $20.3 billion for the provisional authority includes $5.1 billion to enhance security in Iraq, $5.7 for electricity services, $3.7 billion for water and sewer and $2.1 billion to rehabilitate Iraq's oil industry.
One official of the provisional authority said today that Mr. Bremer, in his testimony, would highlight three main areas: why the security issue remained such a high priority, the plans for political and economic transition in Iraq and how the Bush administration planned to expand the contributions of allies, especially at a scheduled conference in Madrid.
As part of the effort, two members of the new Iraqi cabinet, the minister of municipalities and public works and the minister of electricity, are expected to meet with members of Congress this week in Washington.

HEADLINE: Little Chance of Pakistani Troops in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 21 

 BODY:
The president of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said in an interview today that his government needs more military and intelligence help from the United States to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and more political support from Iraqis and the Islamic world before it can send troops to help stabilize Iraq.
 The idea of contributing forces to a multinational contingent authorized by the United Nations in Iraq, General Musharraf said, is extremely unpopular among Pakistanis. "You need to change the domestic viewpoint," he said, adding that this would happen only when "the United Nations, Muslim countries, Arab countries and Iraqis themselves are asking for Muslim troops." 
 The Bush administration returned to the United Nations seeking Security Council authorization for such a force earlier this month in part to make it easier for countries like Pakistan, India and Turkey to offer troops. General Musharraf's request today set the bar higher, calling on groups like the Organization of Islamic Countries and the Iraqi Governing Council, as well as the United Nations, to endorse the idea.
General Musharraf spoke in a one-hour interview with The New York Times after his arrival in New York for the United Nations General Assembly meeting here this week. He reacted testily to criticism that his government had not done enough in the two-year-old campaign against Al Qaeda and the remnants of the former Taliban government of Afghanistan, which had many contacts with elements of the Pakistani government in Islamabad.
He also argued that progress had been made toward controlling the mountainous tribal regions on Pakistan's northwestern border with Afghanistan but said his government needed more resources -- specifically helicopters -- to tighten its control and act on reports of terrorist movements.
"You know, you get the information and you have to react," he said. "How do you react? Can you go on foot? They'll know that you're coming two days before you reach the place. Can you go on vehicles? There are no roads and tracks.
"So therefore obviously you have to have aerial mobility, which means helicopters. Helicopters for transport of troops. Helicopter gunships for attack. O.K.? Pakistan is deficient of both. O.K.? We are trying to get both. And again, U.S. assistance is required. And if there is a delay, let me assure you it is not from our side."
But General Musharraf said there was good coordination with his American partners. Speaking of the vast, mountainous border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said: "You cannot sweep the area with a military operation. Nobody can do that. The U.S. forces are not doing that on the Afghanistan side also, may I say. They select areas where they launch operations, and these operations are launched with our coordination on this side."
And, he said, coordination between the Pakistani and American intelligence agencies is continuing.
The Pakistani president punctuated the wide-ranging interview with frequent pleas for patience and understanding on many fronts, from Islamabad's struggle with India over the disputed region of Kashmir to the transformation of Pakistan -- where General Musharraf took power in a coup four years ago, into a fully democratic state.
Several times, he argued that his critics had failed to understand the "ground realities" of both the war on terror as it is being waged onPakistan's northwestern border and the volatile politics of his nation of more than 150 million people.
He also reiterated his position that Pakistan had full control of its nuclear abilities and was not, to his knowledge, transferring its nuclear technology to Iran or North Korea.
Of the weapons -- or "strategic assets," as he described them -- General Musharraf said: "They are in total custodial control. They are totally safe and secure. And there is no danger of them falling into anybody's hands. And there is a guarantee from our side that there will be no proliferation. In this we don't need assistance."
For the future, he said, "We are very sure that all possible security measures are in place to ensure that no transfer of technology can take place, and no proliferation can take place, and the assets cannot fall into anybody's hands. There are total security arrangements, let me assure you."
When he spoke of the past, General Musharraf hedged this position slightly, saying, "I have absolutely no information that technology or any contact has taken place between Pakistan and North Korea or Pakistan and Iran."
While he said that his government had purchased surface-to-air missiles from North Korea, he added, "there is no proof or evidence of any strategic weapons deals" between Islamabad and North Korea.
Over the past year, General Musharraf's cooperation with the American pursuit of Qaeda and Taliban forces has won him warm words from President Bush and broad international economic support, including the rescheduling of $12.5 billion of its international debts by a group of Western governments known as the Paris Club, the write-off of $1 billion that Pakistan owed to the United States and an increase in American aid, to $3 billion over the next five years. Mr. Bush also welcomed General Musharraf to Camp David this summer.
But the continuing violence against Indians by Muslim separatists in Kashmir remains a sore point in Pakistan's international relations. While condemning the attacks on Indian civilians as "terrorism," General Musharraf said today that any violence against civilians was terrorism, and "every day, civilians are being killed on our side of the border, through Indian shelling."
His government, he said, "did far more than our capacity to defuse tension on the line of control, to take actions which will build confidence with India. But, unfortunately, there is zero return, I repeat, zero return from the Indian side."
He continued: "When the other side does not deliver, what happens? It is the extremists who get strengthened and moderates who get weakened."
Despite the support from Washington, General Musharraf's decision to help Mr. Bush has cost him dearly domestically, as evidenced by the strong showing of Islamic political parties in last fall's parliamentary elections.

HEADLINE: Clintons Anoint Clark 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Clintons decided that the Democratic primary campaign was getting out of hand. Howard Dean was getting all the buzz and too much of the passionate left's money. Word was out that Dean as nominee, owing Clintonites nothing, would quickly dump Terry McAuliffe, through whom Bill and Hillary maintain control of the Democratic National Committee.
 That's when word was leaked of the former president's observation at an intimate dinner party at the Clinton Chappaqua, N.Y., estate that "there are two stars in the Democratic Party -- Hillary and Wes Clark." 
 Meanwhile, the four-star general that Clinton fired for being a publicity hog during the Kosovo liberation has been surrounded by the Clinton-Gore mafia. Lead agent is Mark Fabiani, the impeachment spinmeister; he brought in the rest of the Restoration coterie. When reporters start poking into any defense contracts Clark arranged for clients after his retirement, he will have the lip-zipping services of the Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey.
As expected, fickle media that had been entranced with Dean (Dr. Lose-the-War) dropped the cranky Vermonter like a cold couch potato and are lionizing Clinton's fellow Arkansan and fellow Rhodes Scholar. He's new, handsome, intellectual, a genuine Silver Star Vietnam hero and taught economics at West Point.
I admired Nato Commander Clark's military aggressiveness when the Serbs were slaughtering civilians in Kosovo. He wanted to use Apache helicopter gunships and send in NATO troops, as John McCain urged, but Clinton sided with Pentagon brass fearful of U.S. casualties, and the lengthy air campaign was conducted from 15,000 feet up; thousands of Kosovars died. (Four years later, U.N.-administered Kosovo is still not sovereign, and Clinton was there last week saying "I think we belong here until our job is finished.")
As a boot-in-mouth politician, however, Clark ranks with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He began by claiming to have been pressured to stop his defeatist wartime CNN commentary by someone "around the White House"; challenged, he morphed that source into a Canadian Middle East think tank, equally fuzzy. 
Worse, as his Clinton handlers cringed, he blew his antiwar appeal by telling reporters "I probably would have voted for" the Congressional resolution authorizing Bush to invade Iraq. Next day, the chastised candidate flip-flopped, claiming "I would never have voted for war." 
Clark's strange explanation: "I've said it both ways, because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position." He put himself in the hot-pretzel position -- softly twisted.
Let's assume the Clinton handlers teach him the rudiments of verbal discipline and the Clinton fund-raising machine makes him a viable candidate. To what end? What's in it for the Clintons?
Control. First, control of the Democratic Party machinery, threatened by the sudden emergence of Dean and his antiestablishment troops. Second, control of the Democratic ideological position, making sure it remains on the respectable left of center. 
What if, as Christmas nears, the economy should tank and President Bush becomes far more vulnerable? Hillary would have to announce willingness to accept a draft. Otherwise, should the maverick Dean take the nomination and win, Clinton dreams of a Restoration die. 
Here is where the politically inexperienced Clark comes in. He is the Clintons' most attractive stalking horse, useful in stopping Dean and diluting support for Kerry, Lieberman or Gephardt. If Bush stumbles and the Democratic nomination becomes highly valuable, the Clintons probably think they would be able to get Clark to step aside without splintering the party, rewarding his loyalty with second place on the ticket.
G'wan, you say, the Clintons should be supporting Dean, a likely loser to Bush, thereby ensuring the Clinton Restoration in 2008. But plainly they are not. Their candidate is Clark. Either they arefor him because (altruistic version) they think Clark would best lead the party and country for the next eight years, leaving them applauding on the sidelines, or (Machiavellian version) they think his muddy-the-waters candidacy is their ticket back to the White House in 2004 or 2008.
Which is more like the Clintons?

The Evolution of the Popular Music Machine

BYLINE:  By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
 Since popular music became a big business in the mid-19th century, and as the means of production and distribution have changed, so has the nature of the companies that control the music industry. Popular music has long been a capital-intensive business, favoring big companies that can benefit from economies of scale. But in the Internet era, the 20th-century business model may no longer fit. LISA NAPOLI

1850's
PROMOTING LIVE PERFORMANCE -- When the impresario P.T. Barnum brings the Swedish singer Jenny Lind to the United States for a 93-city tour in 1850, live performance remains the main medium for popular music. Mr. Barnum's marketing tactics help turn Miss Lind into one of the first pop music superstars, with product endorsements including gloves, sofas and pianos bearing the Lind name.

Post-1865
THE RISE OF TIN PAN ALLEY -- After the Civil War, the new stereotype printing process, which makes prints from metal plates, makes it easier to mass-produce sheet music. Families gather around their home pianos for nightly entertainment.

Sheet music publishers from around the country gravitate to Manhattan, on and around West 28th Street, which becomes known as Tin Pan Alley, for the tinny sounds of pianos auditioning the next would-be hits. As publishers become the music industry gatekeepers, one of the first Tin Pan Alley best-sellers is Charles K. Harris's After the Ball, left, which sells two million copies of sheet music in 1892. Tin Pan Alley publishers form the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers, or Ascap, in 1914, and their efforts lead to a sweeping revision of copyright laws.

1870's-1910's
FOR THE RECORD -- After Thomas A. Edison creates the first tinfoil cylinder phonograph in 1877, a frenzy of technological innovation ensues, as competing inventors create a variety of incompatible methods for sound recording and playback. Patent filings and lawsuits eventually result in technical standards and industry consolidation. At first, sheet music publishers regard the recording technologies as a low-quality novelty. But by 1909, as annual sales of recorded discs and cylinders -- the two most popular formats for recorded music -- reach 27 million, publishers cannot ignore rising recording industry powers like the Victor Talking Machine Company and the Columbia Phonograph Company.

1920's
ON THE RADIO -- Westinghouse, a radio manufacturer, begins operating KDKA, the first commercial station, broadcasting live from Pittsburgh in 1920. Although live performance on the air initially prevails, as recording technology improves, economics lead radio executives -- a new type of music gatekeepers -- to begin favoring recorded music. Popular musicians go on strike against the recording studios, until they are promised royalties from record sales.

1930's-1950's
FORMAT FLUX -- The 78-r.p.m. phonograph record gives way to the 12-inch, 33-1/3 r.p.m. long-playing record, which can hold more music on a single disc, and the 45-r.p.m. disc, which become popular for single songs and jukeboxes. Stereo L.P.'s are introduced in 1958. As a result of consolidation, six major record companies now dominate the industry: Capitol, Columbia, Decca, Mercury, MGM and Victor. But the rise of rock 'n' roll spawns dozens of upstart independent record companies.

1960's & 1970's
THE COPYING CONSUMER -- Phillips, in 1963, introduces the cassette tape recorder, which becomes a popular way for consumers to record music from the radio or from records. After initially balking at potential piracy issues, the record industry recognizes that the limited quality of cassette copies poses no true threat. In 1979, Sony introduces a highly portable cassette player, the Walkman, leading to a new cultural habit of private music listening, anywhere, any time.

1980's
DIGITAL DAWN -- The introduction of the recorded digital compact disc in 1982 stimulates music sales, as people buy new albums while also replacing their old records and tapes with the higher-fidelity CD versions. By 1988, sales of the new format are on par with that of L.P.'s. But digital recordings, in theory, can be copied without any loss of sound fidelity. The federal Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 imposes taxes on digital audio-recording devices and media. Fears of the high-quality digital audio tape, the D.A.T., prove unfounded, however, as most consumers ignore the format.

1990's-present
INTERNET UPHEAVAL -- As the Internet evolves from a techie's grapevine to a mass medium, transmitting digital music files in a compressed format known as MP3 high-fidelity and infinitely copyable becomes a popular practice. The Diamond Rio, a portable MP3 player, inspires a lawsuit in 1999 by the Recording Industry Association of America, but the parties settle out of court.

As Napster and other Internet-based music file-swapping systems emerge, the R.I.A.A. continues to press its legal claims, successfully in the case of Napster, but unsuccessfully in the cases of Morpheus and Grokster. Recently, instead of suing the operators of the file-swapping systems, the R.I.A.A. has begun filing suits against individual consumers who swap copyrighted music online.

HEADLINE: For Billions of Birds, an Endangered Haven 

BYLINE:  By JAMES GORMAN

 BODY:
It's autumn, and the vast boreal forest of Canada is spilling birds. Ducks and geese are pouring out of it, and songbirds in the billions.
 Some will winter in Westchester, some in Costa Rica. Some will stop at bird feeders, some will fly directly over hidden hunters. In all, three billion to five billion birds leave the Canadian boreal forest each fall, headed for warmer weather. 
 As the birds fly south, many of the people most involved with the Canadian boreal, which makes up 10 percent of all the earth's forests and 25 percent of the intact, original forests, are heading for Quebec City. 
The 12th World Forestry Congress is convening there this week, and preservation of the boreal forest is a major subject of discussion. Conservationists hope to reach agreement with industry now on how to set aside some parts of the forest and agree on management policies for other areas. 
Three environmental groups -- Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Forest Ethics -- joined together last week to release a brief report on threats to the forest and to demand a moratorium on logging and development in the most endangered parts of the boreal forest until a conservation plan is developed. It is not that the forest is in immediate danger of disappearing. Just the opposite.
But change is occurring fast because of industrial development like logging, mining and drilling for gas and oil. Farming also contributes to forest loss, particularly in western Canada. A study published in Conservation Biology in December 2002, by Keith A. Hobson of the Canadian Wildlife Service calculated that on the southern edge of the boreal in Saskatchewan, the amount of forested land was declining at 0.87 per cent per year, similar to some estimates for loss of tropical rain forest.
Boreal simply means northern -- as in the aurora borealis, the northern lights. The great northern forest, as it is sometimes called, circles the globe, below the polar regions and above the temperate hardwood forests. It is not as familiar as the tropical rain forests, particularly the Amazon and the Congo forest of Central Africa, which includes seven different countries. But the boreal belongs in the same category. These three areas are the last places on earth where vast stretches of intact original forest remain.
Marilyn Heiman, director of the Boreal Songbird Initiative, said the decline of songbirds had been a worry for years, as was loss of wintering grounds.But the nesting grounds are at least as important, she said, and there is a need to "refocus some of the conservation effort" on the boreal forest. 
"It's a forgotten system," said David Pashley, vice president for conservation of the American Bird Conservancy. "It's one that people take for granted. But over the course of the next 50 years it could slip away."
There are no parrots in the boreal to capture public attention, no brightly colored tropical frogs, no monkeys.
What the boreal has are two million square miles of woodland and wetland filled with black spruce, poplars, paper birch, aspen, tamarack and other trees -- and birds, birds and more birds.
The land has different ecosystems, wet and dry, hardwood and evergreen. Particularly in the west, it is riddled with the water that nurses ducks and shorebirds -- "bogs, fens, wetlands, ponds, marshes," Gary Stewart of Ducks Unlimited in Canada said with a tone of awe and appreciation.
Among the migrating birds of the boreal are millions of ducks, 100 million shorebirds, half a billion warblers and a billion sparrows. Dr. Fiona K. A. Schmiegelow, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Alberta, who has been researching the boreal forest for a dozen years, said that in the United States and Canada "one in three land birds owes its existence to the forest." 
It is as if the trees breathe birds, taking them in each spring and sending them back out in the fall spilling down the hemisphere all the way to South America. 
There are chickadees and mergansers, plovers and whooping cranes, scoters, shrikes, yellow rails, flycatchers and warblers and sparrows.
In the East, bird feeders attract the white-throated sparrow and juncos, both boreal migrants. Birders who like a challenge will seek out and try to identify the many different warblers, indistinguishable to the uninitiated. And these are just the birds, not to mention the woodland caribou, the wolves, moose, lynx, the positive effects on the atmosphere of the carbon hungry trees, or the 1.5 million lakes. About 20 percent of the boreal is water.
The new report from Greenpeace, the National Resources Defense Council and Forest Ethics states that since 1975, about 60 million acres have been logged. One step in toward the conservation plan these groups and others are calling for is a "planning framework" being developed by the Canadian Boreal Initiative, a group formed this year. The framework is expected to include a set of conservation principles, as well as actual percentages of land to be preserved and to be managed carefully.
The goal is to have environmental organizations, government, forest product industries, oil and gas companies and the First Nations (Indians that have treaties with Canada) all sign on. 
Oil and gas exploration have become increasingly significant in making incursions into the forest. Mr. Pashley of the bird conservancy said that north of Edmonton, Alberta, oil and gas extraction had had major effects.
"It's kind of a mess," he said. "Not miles and miles of unbroken forest." 
Mr. Pashley said he worried more about those industries than about logging. "The impact of forest products industry is much, much less," he said.
The connection of the Canadian forest to the United States and countries farther south is strong in both ecological and economic terms. A report in December by Dr. Peter Blancher of Bird Studies Canada, one of the many groups dedicated to the boreal, reported that 30 percent of all land birds in the United States and Canada nest in the boreal, some almost exclusively. There are 186 species of land birds that are regularly found in the boreal, and 93 percent of them migrate south for the winter. 
Then there are the aquatic birds. Mr. Stewart of Ducks Unlimited said that the boreal had "huge wetland and water resources" and that "most people don't realize how much." 
In the western parts of the boreal, about a third of the area consists of wetlands of various sorts, where millions of ducks breed. As a waterfowl nursery, the boreal is second only to the United States' prairie pothole region in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Minnesota and Iowa. At least 75 percent of all the black ducks in the world breed in the boreal, Mr. Stewart said.
Birds are one significant connection of the United States to the boreal forest, but, there are others. Lafcadio Cortesi, of a small environmental group, Forest Ethics in San Francisco, said his organization tried to have retailers change purchasing habits to use, for example, more recycled content in the paper that they sell because much of the pulp is from Canadian forests. 
The group has just ended a campaign aimed at Staples. Mr. Cortesi said the company had agreed to change its purchasing practices related to protected forests, and to increase the content of recycled paper in its products. Forest Ethics now intends to go to Office Depot.
He said his group "just sent out a letter to the top 100 catalog companies." Mr. Cortesi said mail order companies sent out 59 catalogs a year for every man, woman and child in the United States. The goal of Forest Ethics is not to stop logging, but to pressure retailers to pay attention to what the forest products companies are doing. 
One company that environmental groups like Canadian Boreal Initiative are working with is Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries, or Al-Pac, which has agreed on a conservation plan for one area with Ducks Unlimited and has concentrated on research in sustainable logging.
The president of Al-Pac, Bill Hunter, said: "We have to have an operation that meets the need of a healthy forest and healthy economy. We're still learning. We will continue to learn. In 10 years, we've invested $25 million in scientific research."
In addition to working with aboriginal people and groups like Ducks Unlimited, Al-Pac has agreements with oil and gas exploration companies that provide economic incentives if the effects of exploration are reduced on land where Al-Pac has logging rights. If a company makes a narrow enough road for its seismic tests, it does not have to pay Al-Pac for the trees they cut down. Otherwise, if the groups that have stakes in the boreal can agree on how to prevent a crisis that is not yet at hand, it would be a rare event in environmental politics. 
Dr. Schmiegelow of the University of Alberta said the most pressing issue now was that "the rate and scale of development is unprecedented."
Although the boreal in Canada is a "relatively pristine system" compared with other forest areas, she said, the mining, oil and gas extraction, as well as logging, put it on the cusp of being radically altered. 
"I don't think people realize how rapidly it's being developed."

HEADLINE: Not Science Fiction: An Elevator to Space 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CHANG

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
With advances toward ultrastrong fibers, the concept of building an elevator 60,000 miles high to carry cargo into space is moving from the realm of science fiction to the fringes of reality. 
 This month, the Los Alamos National Laboratory was a sponsor of a conference to ponder the concept. Yet, the keynote address was by a titan of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke, speaking via satellite from his home in Sri Lanka. "I'm happy that people are taking it more and more seriously," said Mr. Clarke, whose novel "The Fountains of Paradise" (1978) revolved around such a space elevator. 
 The discovery in 1991 of nanotubes, cylindrical molecules of carbon with many times the strength of steel, turned the idea from a fantastical impossibility to an intriguing possibility that could be realized in as little as a decade or two. 
Proponents say the economic and technological advantages of a space elevator over rockets make it inevitable. They predict it will lower the cost of putting a satellite into space from $10,000 a pound to $100.
"As soon as we can build it, we should build it," said Dr. Bryan E. Laubscher, a scientist at Los Alamos who organized the conference. Just as the transcontinental railroad opened the West in the late 1800's, "I feel the space elevator is going to be such a paradigm shift in space access," Dr. Laubscher said.
Easier economical access to space might also make practical other grandiose projects like solar power satellites that could collect sunlight and beam energy down to Earth.
The conference, a three-day session here, drew 60 people, a mix of scientists and engineers who are working on the concept, space enthusiasts who wanted to hear more and dilettantes from nearby Los Alamos laboratory attracted by curiosity.
"The first thought is, Is this really going to work?" said Dr. Steven E. Patamia, a researcher at Los Alamos, who was enlisted into performing space elevator calculations a week before the conference. "When you get into it, it begins to make sense. There are a good number of technical issues. They are probably all 'overcomeable.' "
The original idea of a space elevator is more than a century old. In 1895, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian visionary who devised workable ideas for rocket propulsion and space travel decades before others, proposed a tower thousands of miles high attached to a "celestial castle" in orbit around Earth, with the centrifugal force of the orbiting castle holding up the tower. (Imagine swinging a rope with a rock tied to the end of it.) 
But the idea was fundamentally impossible to build. Steel, then the strongest material known, was too heavy and not strong enough to support that weight.
Other scientists periodically revisited and reinvented Tsiolkovsky's idea, inspiring science fiction writers like Mr. Clarke.
Nanotubes spurred NASA to take a more serious look in 1999. A team of scientists envisioned huge cables of nanotubes and magnetically levitated cars traveling up and down. The structure would be so large that it would require grabbing an asteroid and dragging it into Earth orbit to act as the counterweight for holding up the elevator.
To avoid weather, especially lightning, the NASA scientists envisioned the base station as a tower at least 10 miles high.
"We came out of that workshop saying the space elevator is 50 years away," said David V. Smitherman of the Marshall Space Flight Center, who led the study.
Around that time, Dr. Bradley C. Edwards, who was then a scientist at Los Alamos, read an even more pessimistic assessment, that a space elevator would not be built for at least 300 years.
"But there was no information why it couldn't be built," Dr. Edwards said, and he took that as a challenge.
Dr. Edwards simplified the NASA idea to what he calls "the Wright brothers' version," a single ribbon about three feet wide and thinner than a piece of paper, stretching 60,000 miles from Earth's surface.
He sent a proposal to the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, which provided him $570,000 to flesh out the ideas. His results are described in a book simply titled "The Space Elevator" (Spageo, 2002).
Instead of using magnetic levitation, the apparatus would lift up to 13 tons of cargo by pulling itself upward with a couple of tanklike treads that squeezed tightly onto the ribbon. Up to eight would ascend the ribbon at any one time, powered by lasers on the ground shining on the solar panels on the rising platforms. 
It would take about a week for one to reach geosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles up, where a satellite circles the Earth in exactly one day, continuously hovering over the same spot on the Earth's surface.
The first elevator would go up only. At the top, the platform would simply be added to the counterweight or be discarded into space.
All the necessary underlying technology exists, Dr. Edwards said, except the material for the ribbon. (The longest nanotube to date is just a few feet long.) But he said he expected that scientists would develop a strong enough nanotube-polymer composite in a few years. 
"There's a clear path to building this," said Dr. Edwards, now director of research at the Institute for Scientific Research, an independent organization in Fairmont, W.Va. The institute sponsored the conference with Los Alamos.
Dr. Edwards estimates the cost to build the first elevator at $6.2 billion, although with the uncertainties in forecasting a decade or two of research and development, "doubling this is probably a good first cut." 
"It's gotten to the point," he added, "where we can say it's closer to $6 billion than $600 billion."
Building subsequent elevators would be cheaper, $2 billion each, because the first elevator could lift materials.
By comparison, the estimated cost of building and operating the International Space Station is widely expected to exceed $100 billion.
Dr. Edwards says he has reasonable solutions for other concerns. The elevator base could be a movable ocean platform in the eastern equatorial Pacific, hundreds of miles from commercial airline routes and easy to defend from terrorist attacks. Hurricanes never cross the Equator, and lightning is sparse in that region. By moving the base station, the elevator operators could drag the apparatus around low-orbit space debris. An aluminum coating could be added to parts of the ribbon to combat decay from the reaction of oxygen with carbon atoms in the nanotubes.
More futuristically, Dr. Edwards imagines that additional elevators can be built on the Moon or Mars, vastly simplifying and speeding spaceflight through the solar system.
"What a wonderful idea if you could ever make it work," said Gentry Lee, the chief engineer of planetary flight systems at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who pushed for financing Dr. Edwards's initial studies. "It is plausible. It is not implausible. I think that the idea has so much promise a couple of million dollars a year aimed at the enabling technologies is not too much to ask."
At the conference, scientists presented calculations that examined details. Vibrations in the elevator ribbon, which would act like an extremely long plucked guitar string, appeared manageable. 
Dr. Anders Jorgensen of Los Alamos raised concerns that as the ribbon swung around through the Earth's magnetic field, it would create strong electric currents. Because of the elevator's relatively slow pace, a larger problem could be that any human passengers would receive dangerous doses of radiation as they passed through pockets of high-energy particles trapped in Earth's magnetic field.
The first space elevator would be built to carry only cargo, not people, Dr. Edwards said. The dangers could be reduced on subsequent elevators by speeding them up or providing shielding through magnetic fields.
The logistics of construction "appear to be an interesting problem, as well," said Carey R. Butler, a program manager at the Institute for Scientific Research. The idea is to launch a spacecraft with the initial spools of ribbon into geosynchronous orbit. As the ribbon unspools and falls to the ground, the spacecraft moves higher to keep the center of mass, or balance point, at the same geosynchronous height. By the time the ribbon reaches the ground, the spacecraft has reached an altitude of 50,000 miles.
After the ribbon is attached to the base station, the spacecraft unfurls another 10,000 miles of ribbon. Then a series of about 230 mechanical construction platforms will ascend to stitch on additional ribbon.
While technologically feasible, years of engineering will still be needed. "There's a lot to be done, obviously," Dr. Edwards said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clarke, who came up with the idea of using satellites in geosynchronous orbit for communications long before any were launched, thought that hemight live to see to live this science fiction idea come true, too. 
"I'm 86 now," Mr. Clarke said. "So in 20 years' time, I'll only be 106. So maybe I will see it."

It lowers a thin ribbon toward the ground. Meanwhile, the spacecraft moves outward to keep it from falling, eventually ending at a much higher altitude. When the ribbon reaches Earth, it is tied down to a base station. To strengthen and widen the initial ribbon, a series of mechanical climbers are sent up from the base station to stitch on additional ribbons. After two and a half years, the elevator is complete. The ribbon is about three feet wide and thinner than paper, but strong enough to support climbers carrying 13 tons.

HEADLINE: For Venerable Theater, It's a Body Transplant 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The Biltmore Theater has not so much been renovated as recreated.
 When it reopens next month as an additional home for the Manhattan Theater Club, its ivory-toned and gilt-edged gleam may fool audiences into thinking that the 78-year-old playhouse has had a welcome burnishing. In truth, not much was left to burnish after more than a decade of neglect, vandalism, fire and flooding. 
 "There was a plaster waterfall coming down the stairs," said Andrew Hamingson, development director of the theater club, recalling his first visit to the Biltmore, 261 West 47th Street, in 2000. "Everything was washing away. Most of the beauty was gone. There was three feet of standing water in the mechanical room and rats swimming around it." 
"It reminded me," he said, "of 'The Poseidon Adventure.' "
Time was when the Biltmore reminded people of "Hair," "Barefoot in the Park," "My Sister Eileen" and "Deathtrap"; of George Abbott, a co-owner who used it as a showcase; Jean-Paul Sartre, whose "No Exit" was staged there; and Mae West, whose "Pleasure Man" brought in the police.
This season, as the theater club's third stage -- the other two are at City Center, 131 West 55th Street -- the Biltmore will house "The Violet Hour" by Richard Greenberg, beginning Oct. 16; "Drowning Crow" by Regina Taylor; and "Sight Unseen" by Donald Margulies.
Just how long it will stay the Biltmore remains to be seen. "These things are not only expensive to create but to operate," said Barry Grove, the executive producer. "We're open to a dialogue about naming opportunities."
A new name could be fitting because the theater is new in many respects. There are far fewer seats, more steeply raked floors and a lower stage to foster the intimacy appropriate for theater club productions, which highlight new works and talent. There are ample restrooms and three new lounges, one hewn from bedrock.
But the Biltmore's landmarked features -- from the proscenium arch to a vaulted second-floor gallery to the smallest anthemion leaves -- have been meticulously restored or replicated as part of the $35 million project, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects.
Such an ambitious undertaking had a high price. Literally.
It was made possible by the construction next door of a 51-story apartment tower, also called the Biltmore, by the Jack Parker Corporation and the Moinian Group. Eighteen of those floors, above and beyond what zoning rules would ordinarily allow, were awarded to the developers by the City Planning Commission as a bonus for rehabilitating the theater.
So tall that it can be seen from Hell's Kitchen Park on 10th Avenue, the Biltmore tower has brought 464 new apartments and an influx of wealthier tenants to a corner where abandoned tenements stood. It adds to the growing sense of gigantism along the Eighth Avenue, to which The New York Times Company will contribute with the 776-foot headquarters it plans to build seven blocks to the south.
"It's nice to see the theater rehabbed, but what's the cost?" asked John Fisher of the Clinton Special District Coalition, which opposed the project. Addressing his own question, he cited the displacement of small businesses and affordable apartments, a greater strain on the infrastructure and a loss of daylight. "The Biltmore is yet another example of how they're dismantling the neighborhood, piece by piece," Mr. Fisher said.
Councilwoman Christine Quinn, whose support of the Biltmore project was deemed crucial by advocates and opponents, said, "That building could have been too tall and too large from the get-go without the public getting any artistic or theatrical benefit.
"Given that reality, it seemed reasonable to say, 'Let's let it get bigger' and get a tremendous amount of money dedicated to rehabilitating a landmarked Broadway theater, to take an unused and practically condemned building and make it a beautiful, shining light on Broadway."
As part of its deal with the Manhattan Theater Club, the developers provided $15 million in financing: $10.35 million as an advance on construction costs that is to be paid back with interest and $4.65 million as a contribution. On repaying the advance, the theater club can buy the auditorium for $1.
"When we started the project, we needed somebody to front-end the money," said Peter J. Solomon, chairman of the Manhattan Theater Club. Before donors make good on their pledges, in other words, construction costs have to be met.
With financing in hand, followed by $12 million from the board, $6.4 million from the city and gifts from other foundations and individuals, the theater club was able to reclaim the Biltmore, a goal that had eluded owners and lessees since the 945-seat theater closed in 1987 along with the musical "Stardust." Later that year a fire was set inside the auditorium.
Within a year scavengers and derelicts were entering and leaving the theater with impunity. And with chandeliers and wall fixtures.
The theater club was one of the prospective tenants that decided against the Biltmore in those lean years. "I was concerned that it wouldn't be hospitable to new works," said Lynne Meadow, the artistic director. The auditorium was too long and narrow, with a deep balcony overhang.
What changed things was an idea by Duncan R. Hazard, a principal in the Polshek firm, to move the rear wall closer to the stage by as much as 20 feet and eliminate 295 seats. (His experience at the theater club dates to 1971 when, as an aspiring actor, he appeared in "All Through the House," directed by Ms. Meadow.)
Four broad openings were cut into the central dome. Above them is a network of catwalks supporting the stage lights, eliminating the need for an obtrusive lighting truss suspended in front of the proscenium arch.
And that, in turn, puts the focus on ornament. About 70 percent of the original plaster, including 6,000 feet of molding and 2,500 square feet of ornamental panels and rosettes, was replaced by EverGreene Painting Studios, which employed 18 plasterers for almost a year.
The result is an auditorium whose details would be familiar to Herbert J. Krapp, the original architect, and Irwin S. Chanin, who built it. That is a far cry from the theater club's first home, a three-story rabbit warren on East 73rd Street.
"We'll adjust to what the space demands from us and what we'll demand from the space," Ms. Meadow said. "The theater often tells you what to do, if you listen carefully."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Drop in Response to Dollar's Decline Against Yen

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks sank yesterday after a call from the world's richest nations for more flexible exchange rates led to a sharp drop in the dollar that ignited fears overseas investors would flee United States assets.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 109.41 points, or 1.13 percent, to 9,535.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.48 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,022.82. The Nasdaq composite index sagged 31.08 points, or 1.63 percent, to 1,874.62. 
 Among stocks in the spotlight, Motorola rose after the company said late Friday that its chairman and chief executive, Christopher B. Galvin, would retire. 
The departure of Mr. Galvin, who had clashed with Motorola's board over strategy, ends three generations of family control. Separately, Merrill Lynch said it had raised its investment rating on the company to buy from neutral. Motorola shares rose 97 cents, or 9 percent, to $12.06.
Among decliners, the chip equipment makers Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor were hit after a report in Barron's said their shares were at "extreme bubble valuations." Applied Materials dropped 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $19.67, and KLA-Tencor fell $1.57, or 3 percent, to $55.10.
Shares of TBC reached a high after it agreed to buy the National Tire and Battery unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company for $260 million. TBC shares closed up more than 11 percent, or $2.57, to $25.32 on Nasdaq. Shares of Sears fell 23 cents, to $45.61, on the New York Stock Exchange.
CarMax said its quarterly profit rose 25 percent on strong used-vehicle sales, but its shares fell after it lowered earnings estimates for the current quarter. After trading down as much as 7 percent, CarMax shares recovered and closed down 68 cents, or about 2 percent, at $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
But the focus of the day was on the Group of 7 -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States-- which said over the weekend that a flexible currency rate "is desirable for major countries or economic areas" to iron out global economic imbalances.
The comments caused speculation that Japan would not be as aggressive about selling yen and buying dollars to keep down the value of its currency. While a softer dollar makes United States exports more competitive overseas, it also raises the risk that foreign investors will suffer currency losses on their dollar-denominated assets, making them less attractive.
"The weaker dollar will probably benefit U.S. manufacturing, but the big worry is that we're heavily dependent on foreign capital inflows, and you don't want to see everyone start dumping U.S. investments," said Ozan Akcin, chief market strategist at Puglisi & Company.
The Group of 7 statement was viewed as criticism of persistent intervention by Asian countries to keep their currencies weak to make their exported goods more affordable to consumers, especially to Americans.
The United States has been particularly critical of Japan and China for intentionally weakening their currencies since it puts American goods and services at a disadvantage.
The dollar fell to a near-three year low against the Japanese yen, touching 111.37 yen, before rebounding to 111.96 yen.
The sliding dollar also hurt Treasury prices. By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 15/32, to a price of 100 5/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.22 percent from 4.17 percent on Friday. And the 30-year bond lost 30/32, to 103 17/32. Its yield rose to 5.13 percent from 5.07 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.761	99.489	High Rate	0.935	1.010	Investment Rate	0.953	1.033	Low Rate	0.91%	0.95%	Median Rate	0.93%	1.00%	Total applied for	$40,742,794	$38,674,988	Accepted	$20,962,169	$20,690,418	Noncompetitive	$1,380,192	$1,082,915	

Both issues are dated Sept. 25, 2003. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 26, 2003, and the six-month bills on March 25, 2004.

HEADLINE: On Display at Thrift Shop: Distress; 
In Ozone Park, a Symbol of a Weakened City Economy

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
When the pharmacy between Salvatore's Unisex Barbershop and the Double Fortune Laundromat was replaced last year by a thrift shop, some neighbors saw it as a sign that the commercial strip of 101st Avenue in Ozone Park, once vibrant, was in decline. 
 Since then, New York's economy has slumped further and taxes have skyrocketed. And the thrift store, run by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, has become one of the busiest businesses on the avenue. 
 For some of the people who live, work and do business on this Queens block -- whose diversity mirrors that of the city as a whole -- the shop has been a godsend as they cope with the effects of the city's fiscal problems and a recent round of transit-fare and tax increases.
Inside the shop, those in charge say they have been surprised by a surge in demand for old sofas, used shoes and other secondhand items. They consider it a reflection of just how difficult life has become for some New Yorkers.
City officials have proclaimed the worst of the crisis over, but no one here seems to believe it. 
"This is as difficult as it's been for us in the last 10 years," said John Bittner, executive director of the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a Roman Catholic charity. "Our customer base is made up of people who are most often and immediately affected" by the city's economic problems, he said.
Every day people from this block and the surrounding neighborhood pass through the glass doors and past a statue of St. Vincent de Paul, the patron saint of charities, to shop for the things they cannot afford to buy in stores. A few are prowling for shabby-chic accessories, said Betty Hubert, a South Ozone Park resident who helps run the shop. But most are desperately trying to make ends meet, especially in the weeks since the city's money-raising measures really started to squeeze them. 
"This place used to be just for low-income families who can't shop in Macy's," Mrs. Hubert said. "But now everybody's hurting."
Widespread economic hardship has substantially driven up demand for cheaper used items, especially since the terror attack of 2001. But at the same time, Mr. Bittner said, there is a shortage of used furniture and clothing because the New Yorkers who customarily make the donations are facing greater hardship themselves and are holding onto their goods far longer. 
Another problem, he said, is that donated items tend to be more beaten up than before. Sometimes, furniture has been used so long and so hard that it can no longer be sold or even given away in the shop. 
"That's where some difficult diplomacy comes in," Mr. Bittner said. "The quality of what well-meaning people are giving us is often so suspect that it doesn't help at all." It costs the society time and labor to get rid of goods it cannot sell. As a result, some donations have to be delicately turned down. 
For Miriam Estevez and George Mena, who live with their four children in a three-bedroom apartment around the corner on 103rd Street, the shop has become an essential survival tool.
"Honestly, if it wasn't for the shop we'd probably be sleeping on a mat on the floor," said Mr. Mena, who with his family was profiled in an earlier article in this series. Instead, they were able to buy a queen-size bed at the shop for almost nothing.
Mr. Mena lost his regular job with a trucking company after 9/11, and has been doing some freelance work as a motorcycle mechanic since then. Ms. Estevez is a cashier at a Midtown Manhattan cafeteria whose modest salary is being eaten away by the recent transit-fare increase. 
Over the summer, they disconnected their telephone service to save a few dollars. And they continued to rely on the thrift shop to fill holes in their budget. They bought dressers for three of the children there, and are looking for bunk beds for their two youngest.
"You can't beat it," Mr. Mena said, "but you've got to check it out every day."
Even personal household items, like drinking glasses, tend not to sit long on the shelves anymore. One afternoon, a neighborhood woman who did not want her name published bought six tumblers, saying they were for her brother. She also spent a dollar on an unfashionably wide blue tie for her son, a student at LaGuardia Community College. 
"Things are tight, and he wants to help out by getting a job," she said. "He needs a tie for interviews." 
Mrs. Hubert, who worked for the charity for many years in another location, said she had never seen things worse than they are now. 
"The need is definitely greater," she said. Mrs. Hubert said that she had noticed that more elderly people were stopping by than before, and that the worry on their faces was evident, "especially if they haven't been able to put anything aside."
But the elderly are not the only ones seeking help at the shop. 
Adrian Perez, 36, said he checked out the merchandise once or twice a week. He came to New York from Mexico four years ago and has been working ever since at a deli on 101st Avenue. Because he tries to send as much money as possible back to his wife and three children in Mexico, he has come to rely heavily on bargains at the thrift shop.
He said he had bought shirts, shoes and a television set there. He said he only wished the shop had been open when he needed to buy furniture for his apartment a few years ago. 
"Frankly, I'll tell you, people put things out on the sidewalk and I picked them up," he said. "That's how I got my furniture."
Mr. Bittner said he expected demand for used clothing and furniture to keep rising while donations continue to decline. He is considering other ways of raising inventory, like joining with a clothing manufacturer. The idea would be to offer discounts on new coats to customers who brought in old coats that would be sold in the thrift shop.
"These times have become difficult, yes, but it's not a situation where any of our volunteers or members are giving up," Mr. Bittner said. "We just have to understand that we need to do things more efficiently."

HEADLINE: Rising Costs Prompt States To Reduce Medicaid Further 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Struggling through a third consecutive year of fiscal distress, states have again squeezed Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance program, by scaling back eligibility, cutting benefits, increasing co-payments and freezing or reducing payments to doctors and hospitals.
 Vernon K. Smith, former Medicaid director of Michigan, said today that soaring health costs and plunging state revenues had forced virtually every state to take action to slow the growth of Medicaid, the health program for 51 million Americans. 
 Economists and state officials said the cutbacks indicated the intense pressure on the states as a result of declining tax receipts. 
The outlook for Medicaid remains grim, the officials said, because state revenues are expected to grow much more slowly than the economy, and inflation in health care is not expected to abate in the coming year. 
"The fiscal crisis facing states is far worse than the condition of the nation's economy," said Donald J. Boyd, director of fiscal studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, an arm of the State University of New York. State tax revenue dropped sharply even as the nation's economic output grew at a slow pace in the past year, Dr. Boyd said. 
Mr. Smith interviewed officials in all 50 states in an annual survey conducted for the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a private group created by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
In the 2003 fiscal year, Mr. Smith said, 25 states restricted eligibility for Medicaid, 18 reduced benefits, and 17 increased co-payments. Moreover, he said, 21 states cut payment rates for one or more groups of health care providers.
For example, Mr. Smith said, Medicaid payment rates for doctors were cut in 5 states and frozen in 36, while rates for hospitals were reduced in 9 states and frozen in 22.
The federal government and the states share the costs of Medicaid. Federal Medicaid spending soared 13 percent in the 2002 fiscal year, to $147.5 billion, and has increased again in 2003, though at a slower rate, 9.2 percent, the Congressional Budget Office said.
A sluggish economy and rising unemployment have reduced incomes for millions of families, increasing the number eligible for Medicaid.
Twenty states reported that increased enrollment was the biggest factor driving up the cost of Medicaid. Sixteen cited prescription drug costs as the biggest factor.
John F. Holahan, director of health policy research at the Urban Institute, said increased enrollment of the elderly and the disabled accounted for nearly 60 percent of the growth in Medicaid spending in the past two years.
The Medicaid director in Ohio, Barbara Coulter Edwards, said the recent Medicaid cuts had unquestionably caused hardship for some. But, she said, Congress averted deeper cuts by providing the states $20 billion in temporary fiscal relief, including $10 billion for Medicaid. 
For years, doctors have complained that Medicaid paid them less than most other insurers. Dr. Susan Fleischman, medical director of the Venice Family Clinic in Los Angeles, said payments were so low that many doctors refused to take Medicaid patients.
"We will be issuing Medicaid cards," Dr. Fleischman said, "but it won't mean anything because people cannot get in to see a doctor. In parts of Los Angeles, children have to wait weeks to see an ear, nose and throat doctor, a neurologist or an orthopedist."
Nearly all states reported taking action to rein in prescription drug costs in the past year. Thirty-two expanded the list of medications requiring special approval, known as prior authorization. Fourteen established lists of preferred drugs for certain conditions and discouraged doctors from prescribing other medicines. Four required greater use of low-cost generic drugs. Five imposed monthly limits on the number of prescriptions that could be filled. Fourteen established new or higher co-payments for drugs.
Medicaid officials said they needed to be careful in clamping down on the use of prescription drugs.
Robert Day, the Medicaid director in Kansas, said psychiatric drugs accounted for at least 30 percent of his state's Medicaid drug spending. "Those drugs have been a miracle for people with serious, persistent mental illness," Mr. Day said.
Daniel N. Mendelson, president of Health Strategies Consultancy, said, "Prescription drugs account for 15 percent to 25 percent of total Medicaid spending, and Medicaid drug spending has increased much more rapidly than the rest of the program."

HEADLINE: High Costs Bring Indian Motorcycle to aHalt 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
When the gleaming reincarnations of Indian Motorcycles rolled off the factory floor four years ago, enthusiasts wondered whether the new machines would recapture the glory of the vintage line that had ceased production nearly a half-century earlier.
 Now they have their answer: the Indian Motorcycle Company announced yesterday that it had sputtered to a halt and was stopping production in its factory in Gilroy, Calif. It is laying off about 380 workers, virtually the entire staff. 
 The move means that the Indian brand will once again be relegated to the halcyon memories and oil-stained garages of its many devotees like George Clooney and Jay Leno. No longer will new machines roll off the assembly line, and no longer will the company lose large sums of money as it tries to compete with Harley-Davidson. 
The company said in its announcement yesterday that the halt in production was intended to "conserve cash and preserve its assets."
Frank J. O'Connell, chairman and chief executive, said that while sales had increased steadily since 1999, the company was also plagued by rising costs.
"The board made a decision that we have to go down a different path," Mr. O'Connell said in a phone interview. "Our volume continues to grow and dealers continue to grow, but the cost structure is out of line. It's a stand-alone manufacturing operation that's too expensive."
With the exception of a few sales representatives scattered across the country, the layoffs will all be in Gilroy, a Northern California town of 40,000 that proudly calls itself the Garlic Capital of the World. (Each summer, the town holds the prominent Gilroy Garlic Festival.) The Indian Motorcycle Company owns a 150,000-square-foot factory in the middle of town.
The company said it would keep a skeleton crew of workers to sustain basic operations.
The company is controlled by the Audax Group, a private investment firm based in Boston that injected $45 million into the company in 2001. Mr. O'Connell declined to give any financial numbers but said the company had failed to break even during any of the years since it won the rights to the Indian trademark in November 1998. 
The six-member board made the unanimous decision to stop production, he said, in hopes that the company could raise more capital.
"Costs have increased because we put in a lot of infrastructure to service dealers and parts," Mr. O'Connell said. 
He estimated that 200 dealers sell Indian motorcycles. There are several hundred outstanding orders that will go unfilled, he said.
Sales to dealers have risen steadily, he said, to 3,500 motorcycles last year from 1,000 in 1999.
One former dealer in Indian motorcycles, Steven V. DeStout, said that those numbers might be optimistic. Though it is true that the number of dealers -- and thus sales from the factory floor -- has increased, he said, dealers are not necessarily able to sell the bikes briskly to customers. 
Mr. DeStout said that by the time he retired last year and shut down his company, Staz's American Motorcycles in Las Vegas, the sales of Indian bikes made up only a small part of his revenue, though that was not the main reason for his retirement.
The current Indian line consists of three models: the Chief, Scout and Spirit. Prices range from $25,000 for a high-end Chief to around $17,000 for a Spirit. Last year, the company began making its own motors for the Chief, which had previously used an engine designed for after-market use on Harley-Davidson motorcycles..
The use of the engine meant for the Harley drew skepticism from some enthusiasts of the old Indian motorcycles. Though the Chief had many of the swooping lines of the pre-1953 models, its similarities ended on the most superficial level, they said.
"We called them the Pretendians, which is a little bit mean," said Wilson Plank, owner of American Indian Specialists, a restoration business in Fullerton, Calif. "But the factory never tried to insult us. They were too busy trying to get their act together and keep it going."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: WASHINGTON; 
Bremer Cites Marshall Plan in Bid for Iraqi Aid

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, defended the Bush administration's request for $87 billion on Capitol Hill today with a comparison to the Marshall Plan, saying that without the aid, Iraq would become a global menace.
 "If, after coming this far, we turn our backs and let Iraq lapse into factional chaos, some new tyranny and terrorism, we will have committed a grave error," Mr. Bremer told the Senate Appropriations Committee, which began hearings today on the White House request for military and rebuilding funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 "Not only will we have left the long-suffering Iraqi people to a future of danger and deprivation, we will have sown the dragon's teeth which will sprout more terrorists and eventually cost more American lives." 
The reconstruction of Iraq, which accounts for $20.3 billion of the request, shares the same "grandeur of vision" demonstrated by the United States in rebuilding Europe after World War II, he said.
But skeptical members of the committee seemed more concerned about the price tag. Democratic senators said that the request was probably far smaller than the eventual total would be and that similar rebuilding plans at home were being neglected. 
Republicans questioned why more oil money from Iraq could not be used for reconstruction, and one senior Republican said the administration needed to explain its goals more clearly to the American people.
"The American people ought to hear you regularly explain the plan versus what you've accomplished," Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said. "You call a press conference and you say, 'Here's what we have done or what we have had to change.' You should do that in a way that is factual, forthright, the whole goal being to make this whole reconstruction totally transparent to the American people, who are interested."
About three-fourths of the $87 billion will be used for the occupation of Iraq, and even Democrats said that amount would not be challenged. But the remaining $20.3 billion is likely to draw intense scrutiny by members of the six Congressional committees that will hold hearings on the bill.
In the House, Democratic members of the Budget Committee prepared a study indicating that the full cost of occupying and rebuilding Iraq over the next decade could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more than the $166 billion already requested by the administration this year. 
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, accused the Bush administration of conducting a "snow job" on the public by not providing more information about the need for reconstruction funds. Senator Byrd got into a testy exchange with Mr. Bremer and the chairman, Ted Stevens of Alaska, when he learned that Mr. Bremer would not be returning for another session with the committee.
"You don't have time, and yet you want $20 billion," Mr. Byrd said, recalling that the administration asked for $79 billion for the war last spring. "When it came to the president's last supplemental bill for Iraq, Congress could not get straight answers from the administration on the expected cost or the expected duration of the Iraq operation," Mr. Byrd said. "We cannot afford to settle for evasions this time around."
Mr. Bremer did provide some new details today of how the $20.3 billion would be spent. The plans include $697 million to improve sewer service, $1.2 billion to repair the oil production system, $240 million for road and bridge repair, $100 million for housing -- including 3,500 new housing units -- $400 million for two new prisons of 4,000 beds each, $2 billion for establishing a new Iraqi Army, and $100 million for a witness protection program. 
He talked at length about the $5.7 billion for expanding electrical service, saying progress could never be made in Iraq if it only has 16 hours of power a day.
"As millions of households, including my own, this past week discovered, it is almost impossible to live in the modern world without dependable electricity," Mr. Bremer said, referring to the widespread power failures caused by Hurricane Isabel. "Think of what we would be asking of Iraq were we to suggest they fashion a new economy, a new democracy, while literally in the dark eight hours a day."
Republicans on the committee generally praised the work being done by Mr. Bremer's Coalition Provisional Authority, but several wondered why Iraq could not pay more of the cost itself out of current or future oil revenues.
"Iraq has the second-largest reserves of oil in the world," said Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. "Can't they pay for this in the reconstruction effort?"
Mr. Bremer responded that because of sabotage to the system, it would be two or three years before Iraq would begin generating oil revenues of sufficient size to pay for major improvements. He rejected the idea, being floated among several Congressional Republicans, of making the reconstruction money a loan rather than a grant, saying the country cannot even pay its existing debt of almost $200 billion.
"Mountains of unpayable debt contributed heavily to the instability that paved Hitler's path to power," he said. "The giants of the postwar generation recognized this, and the Marshall Plan assistance was overwhelming in the form of grant aid."

HEADLINE: How Years of Budget Cuts Put New Jersey's Children at Risk 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and RICHARD LEZIN JONES

 BODY:
The admission of government failure could not have been more sweeping. On June 24, New Jersey, under legal attack and amid a storm of public outcry, agreed to grant broad powers over its child welfare system to outside experts.
 By almost every measure, the system was in collapse, often at the brutal cost of children's lives. As many as one in five children in foster care was being abused, and it took years to have imperiled children adopted. New Jersey ranked among the worst in the country, according to child welfare groups, with fully one-quarter of the state's foster children stuck in institutions that national experts have regarded for years as the worst environment. 
 "We recognized that the system is broken in many places," said Kevin Ryan, an aide to Gov. James E. McGreevey who led the negotiations on turning over control of the system, "and it took a long time to make it as broken as it was." 
In explaining how New Jersey's care for its most vulnerable children came to be broken so badly and for so long, experts and government officials consistently point to several critical failures: money, staffing and repeated delays in embracing child welfare practices that had succeeded elsewhere in the country.
Across more than a decade -- involving both Democratic and Republican administrations -- the state engaged in what many claim was a financial retreat involving the kinds of programs deemed by experts to be most essential for protecting children: drug treatment programs for troubled parents, day care for abused children, and a modern computer tracking system that might make it easier for state workers to monitor and manage a growing number of abuse and neglect cases.
At the same time, the state's efforts to keep caseloads down, and to effectively train and support child welfare workers with equipment and expertise, were sporadic and always short-lived.
One administration in Trenton closed the training academy at the Division of Youth and Family Services for six years; another administration cut the number of workers devoted to monitoring the quality of caseworker performance. The State Legislature failed to set limits on the number of cases a worker could be assigned, so that today the average is 41 per worker, as it was a decade ago. Veteran caseworkers say that over the years, the number of staff members assigned to desk jobs has risen, while those assigned to work in the streets and homes where children are at risk are increasingly overwhelmed.
Finally, New Jersey took years to adopt and use what for other states had become obvious answers for handling the growing crisis in child welfare. Among them were requiring that foster homes be formally licensed, and placing foster children with relatives rather than strangers -- a tactic known as kinship care that many experts believed made for safer and more reliable settings for endangered children.
Indeed, the state's track record of programmatic negligence -- in the face of one bad newspaper headline after another and despite multiple expert panel reports -- has been so pronounced that the federal judge who approved the takeover by outside experts in June pledged that he himself would not allow it to happen again.
"What I want to assure the parties on both sides is that for better or for worse, while the political administrations may or may not change, I will be living with this case until it's closed," Judge Stanley R. Chesler said. "I will be going nowhere, and I hope and will do the best I can to make sure that the political will continues to exist to make this settlement become reality, that this is not simply a response to the latest crisis which vanishes when the next crisis appears on the horizon."
Looking back on the failure of New Jersey's foster care, one explanation jumps off the pages of the state's budgets. In the last decade, the number of children under the state's care rose alarmingly, to 58,000 from 40,000. Yet for fiscal year 2003, the state's spending on the child welfare agency had barely budged over the 10 years, up only to $312 million from $275 million.
But that modest rise in spending captures only part of the story. The state, in the fiscal years 1995 through 1999, actually cut spending by $67 million despite some of the most robust economic conditions ever.
And to this day, numerous legislators involved in the budget fights cannot explain the repeated collapse of political will.
State Senator Diane B. Allen, a Republican who pushed unsuccessfully to spend money to reduce social workers' caseloads, said, "I can't exactly say why we weren't able to do it, except that those constituencies that don't vote have less influence than those that do."
The most marked of the cuts occurred during the administration of Christie Whitman, a Republican who served as governor from 1994 through late January 2001, although Democratic administrations also displayed a disinclination to invest in the child welfare system.
While the agency handles nearly 9,000 more cases annually than it did in 1989, the state has only about 300 more workers to manage them, a result of years of layoffs and what union officials and outside experts say has been inadequate hiring.
From 1989 to 1995, the agency lost one out of every six of its caseload-carrying workers, largely because of layoffs initiated by Ms. Whitman and her predecessor, Jim Florio, a Democrat. The move left the agency ill prepared for a four-year period in the mid-1990's when the caseload for most workers rose by more than 13 percent.
The Child Welfare League of America suggests that workers be responsible for no more than 17 cases at one time, a figure that is widely accepted as the national standard. The lower the number of caseloads, experts say, the more time workers can spend with individual children and, in theory, better identify whether they are at risk.
According to state figures, the average caseload for workers in New Jersey is about 41, or more than twice the recommended standard. And, even with Governor McGreevey's promised changes to child welfare under way, officials acknowledge that the number of cases handled by each worker has risen since the beginning of the year.
The cuts, as well, took tools from the hands of the dwindling number of workers, including their cars and cellphones. Even children's car seats were allowed to become scarce.
To those who worked both for and with the agency, the late 1990's, with flush general budgets, were particularly demoralizing because, to them, the cuts seemed entirely without rationale.
"You would hear someone like the governor saying she wanted to help kids," said Bernice L. Manshel, who was the agency's director until 1982 and then watched as DYFS was dismantled in the subsequent decades.
But, she said, "there was no depth of knowledge or real understanding of the needs."
Perhaps the most searing example of a failure to invest in the system concerned what many current and former government officials regard as the tragedy of the agency's computer system.
In the mid-1990's, the federal government passed a series of sweeping foster care reporting requirements that demanded, among other things, that each state have a centralized database to track foster children or risk losing federal matching funds.
With an ancient computer system, and with many agency offices using half-complete paper files to document cases, New Jersey knew it had to allocate money for the new system as early as 1997, when it actually put up $7 million to buy computers.
In fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001, new money to pay for the software and networking for the system was dutifully allocated in the budget. Then, like a slow-motion train wreck, the money was removed at the 11th hour in compromises. The state now says the computers bought in 1997 are out of date anyway.
But for many child welfare workers, and the judges and lawyers who worked with them, almost no budget cut was more counterproductive than the failure to provide the services that might have improved the family conditions for vulnerable children.
The number of residential substance abuse treatment slots specifically for mothers with their children -- drug abuse is one of the most frequent factors in child abuse cases -- has not increased in the last four years, even as the foster care population took off. Parents struggling with substance abuse often wait months to gain admittance to such treatment programs, advocates for the parents say.
Children, then, were frequently removed and placed in an already overtaxed foster care system.
"The situation is quite desperate," said Nancy Goldhill, vice president and assistant general counsel for Legal Services of New Jersey, which represents parents in cases against the state.
Money alone, of course, does not explain the dizzying decline in the quality of the state's services. Mismanagement and neglect also took their toll.
To run an effective child welfare system, said Ms. Manshel, the former agency director, "it takes sustained interest."
"And at the highest levels of policy making," she said, "there was no real interest."
As a result, experts say, New Jersey was often late -- too late -- in adopting some of the most basic case practice innovations in child welfare even as they became common in most other states.
It was only in 2001 that New Jersey agreed, for example, to offer foster care stipends to relatives of foster care children who took them in -- a step long known to be crucial in poor communities.
"New Jersey was late to recognize kinship care," said Rob Geen, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a social policy research group based in Washington. "It really tried to divert kin from any kind of foster care payment, which is discriminatory against relatives. Changes have made for the better, but there are still policies that could be better."
At an even more basic level, officials said, New Jersey went for years without even requiring that foster homes be formally licensed. It was only in 1999, after an astounding amount of abuse was found to be occurring in foster homes, that the state began to do formal certification of homes (it started full licensing in 2002).
To this day, residential facilities are not required to do criminal background checks on their employees. A law mandating such checks is awaiting Governor McGreevey's signature.
In a similar sense, New Jersey's failure to abandon some discredited practices, particularly one known as voluntary placement, also set it apart as a distinctly troubled system. Voluntary placement occurs when parents agree to sign their children over to the foster care system -- in many cases, parental advocates say, because they believe the child will ultimately be taken away anyway. But those children who are turned over to the state under those circumstances are not afforded the lawyers and other safeguards meant to ensure that the state responsibly handles its case and protects them from harm.
A 1992 report by Legal Services found that 75 percent of children in New Jersey's foster care system were there via voluntary placements, a rate far in excess of any other state.
In the ensuing years, the agency passed regulations limiting the length of time children could remain in such placements without judicial review. Still, the practice continues. As of 2001, the last year for which records were available, there were 2,217 voluntary placements into foster care, or close to half the entire population taken in that year.
Gwendolyn L. Harris, the state's Department of Human Services commissioner, has seen the agency's ills as both a social worker in Newark in the mid-1980's and as the cabinet officer charged by Governor McGreevey with oversight of the agency.
Looking back at what went wrong, she said that the politicians and the public never really understood how dire a situation the agency was in.
"I think there was a lack of political understanding of how severe the problem is," she said. "They'd say, 'We've got to be O.K.' People wanted to believe that we fit somewhere in the middle. That we can't be too bad."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Says Afghan Opium Poppy Crops Should Be Destroyed 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund warned today that Afghanistan's opium poppy crops should be destroyed to keep the country from being run by powerful drug traffickers.
 In its first full review of Afghanistan's economy in 12 years, the fund said that opium, made from poppies grown on fertile lands, mainly in the south, made up 40 percent to 50 percent of the Afghan economy. 
 Violence in poppy-growing areas has surged recently. The police blame ousted Taliban rulers eager to keep a grip on what is estimated to be a $2.5 billion export business. 
Adam Bennett, the fund's director for Afghanistan, said there was a broad-based recovery in the Afghan economy last year because of reconstruction and aid after the campaign led by the United States to oust its hard-line Islamist Taliban government.
Next year the economy should expand by a sturdy 20 percent, he predicted.
"The one cloud on the horizon on this growth scenario is the development of the production of opium," Mr. Bennett said. "This is a very significant development in Afghanistan and it does carry great dangers for the stability of the country and of the economy," he told a news conference in Dubai during the annual I.M.F.-World Bank meeting.
Eradicating poppy fields should go hand-in-hand with development of alternative livelihoods for farmers, Mr. Bennett said. Security problems also slowed development, he added.
Mr. Bennett said he had not seen signs of "donor fatigue" with Afghanistan, even though the focus of the donor community was on rebuilding Iraq. "The international community remains fully engaged with Afghanistan and Afghanistan's needs in the period ahead," he said.
Afghan officials said on Sunday after a donors' meeting here that the country had won pledges of more cash. The American treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said he had a "pretty good" chance of persuading countries to match a new $1.2 billion pledge by the United States.
A quarter century of strife has turned opium production into one of the most viable economic activities in Afghanistan, and Mr. Bennett said wiping out the drug trade would need to be coupled with stepped-up development efforts.
The country's opium business boomed in the early 1980's after Turkey, Pakistan and Iran banned its production and pushed up street prices, the fund's report said.
From 1994 to 2000, Afghanistan's production averaged around 3,000 tons a year and covered less than 1 percent of the country's arable land. Output dropped to just 185 tons in 2001 after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers banned production. 
But after Washington waged war on the Taliban and forced them out, production soared to about 3,422 tons in 2002, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has reported.
Despite the problems with opium, Mr. Bennett said there were positive economic signs in Afghanistan. A new currency introduced in January has helped stabilize prices with price inflation since the beginning of the year at about zero. He said there had also been major reforms in improving expenditure transparency and accountability.
The country's budget was mostly financed by donor grants but domestic revenues were increasing, the fund said.
Mr. Bennett said that it was still too early for any significant foreign investment but that, as institutions took root and security improved, investors would start looking for opportunities in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Decision in Rent Dispute Yields Only More Questions 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The residents of Peter Cooper Village know their stabilized rents are about to rise, and they know the increase has something to do with new wiring that was installed four years ago. Beyond that, though, many are baffled.
 Puzzling letters from the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal began to arrive in the mail late last week declaring that residents of the 2,200-unit apartment complex would have to pay an extra $38.35 per room, per month. Not only that, the letter said, but residents would also have to pay as much as $3,000 or $4,000 in retroactive rent increases. 
 The letters sent a tremor through the complex, located on East 20th Street in Manhattan. Some residents said they would have to dip into their savings or spend less on prescription medicine, while others said they would have think twice about spending money to visit their adult children. They said the rent increases could push the more vulnerable residents out of this tree-lined, mythically affordable complex, built after World War II to house returning veterans.
But wait.
Another section of the letter sent to residents -- paragraph VI, subparagraph C, to be precise -- said that under rent stabilization law, rent increases could not exceed 6 percent of a resident's rent. Residents who live in a $1,000 apartment, for instance, would pay an extra $60 per month.
"The majority of people don't have the faintest idea of what this means," said Anita Newman, a longtime resident, as she pored over the letter sent to her. "What are they saying? We don't understand what they're saying."
The increases stem from a $30 million electrical rewiring in 1999. Metropolitan Life Insurance, which owns Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town next door, wanted residents to pay for the work, but the tenants' association protested, saying that MetLife stood to earn millions from a cable company that performed installations at the same time. 
The tenants took their case to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, charging that MetLife had inflated the costs of rewiring the electrical system, had done poor-quality work and had allowed the same work crews to simultaneously install the new wiring and cable lines for the RCN Corporation.
"You have two projects that were merged, that sort of melded into one," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, who lives in Peter Cooper Village. "It was a very, very questionable maneuver."
Under state law, the rewiring is a major capital improvement whose costs can be passed on to tenants. Adding cable or telecommunications lines is not, said Jack Lester, the lawyer for the tenants' association.
The Housing Division's decision, which was issued Wednesday, found that the cable and electric installations were "concurrent and separate" projects. The Housing Division granted MetLife's request for a rent increase, but it lowered the amount by 14 percent, said Peter Moses, a spokesman for the Housing Division.
Jennie Morgan, a spokeswoman for MetLife, said the company was just beginning to review the decision, but it stood by its position that the application for a rent increase due to a major capital improvement was legitimate. 
Tenants have argued that MetLife's entire application should have been rejected because it did not disclose the financial arrangements with RCN, which could bring in millions for MetLife, Mr. Sanders said.
Now, as tenants puzzle over the letters from the Housing Division, the tenants' association is planning to appeal the agency's decision. It will also seek an injunction against any retroactive rent increases stemming from the rewiring, Mr. Lester said. 
Mr. Lester said tenants were planning a meeting for Monday to discuss the decision and rent increases. The topic has already generated quite a buzz beside the complex's playgrounds and along its tree-lined walks.
Some grumbled that the rate increases would not abate when the rewiring was paid for, and they puzzled over when their rents would go up, and by how much. Richard Raymond mused that circuits still blew if he ran the microwave, television and toaster at once.
Others, like Elizabeth Spiegel, said the rent increases felt like a surreptitious tactic to force out residents living on pensions or Social Security and convert their stabilized apartments into market-value homes with new granite counters and $3,000-per-month price tags.
"I'm frantic," Ms. Spiegel said on Sunday afternoon. "They want four college kids in my apartment."

HEADLINE: Energy of Africa Draws the Eyes of Houston 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
When Angola recently opened its only consulate outside New York, few people here were surprised that Houston was chosen. 
 Texas already leads the nation in trade and commerce with Africa. More than 1,000 Houston companies do business there, and 60 have significant subsidiaries on the continent, according to the city of Houston. 
 The city may have a way to go before it becomes a de facto commercial capital to Africa the way Miami is for much of Latin America, but it is becoming increasingly important to African commerce and diplomacy. And the city is becoming a significant starting point for affluent Africans seeking to do business in the United States. 
 The reason is oil. This is the energy capital of the United States, and West African countries like Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria are increasingly important suppliers of oil. They already account for about 14 percent of all American oil imports, and are forecast to supply 20 percent soon.
 That has drawn giant energy corporations like Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco to theregion, as well as midsize companies in related fields, like Bivac International, a company that inspects cargo at ports, and the Hanover Compressor Company, a provider of natural gas compression equipment.
 "We already have a presence in Nigeria, but we want to be in Angola," said Steve Russom, Hanover's vice president for product development and technology. "The domestic oil and gas market is kind of flat, but Houston's still the epicenter for the energy industry, essentially the place where we can put together deals anywhere."
 The interest of energy companies in West Africa is encouraging ventures in a variety of fields. EDI Architecture, like dozens of other companies here, is betting its future on strengthening ties to Africa. It designed the Angolan consulate here, a luxurious corporate suite discreetly decorated with the burgundy and gold colors of the nation's flag.
 The hunger for additional deals is not lost on Houston's leaders. Mayor Lee P. Brown, for instance, led the first trade mission of any American city to Luanda, the Angolan capital, this month. He went with 20 executives interested in reaching business agreements in Angola, a southwestern African country about twice the size of Texas and rich in oil. 
 Mr. Brown also visited neighboring Namibia, a mineral-rich former German colony of two million people. The port of Houston concluded the trip with an agreement to provide consulting advice to the Namibian port of Walvis Bay.
 EDI Architecture was among the more experienced participants, having already built American-style residential compounds in Angola for Exxon Mobil and Angola's national petroleum company. It is currently building a 20-story office tower in Luanda.
 "It's not like there are Wal-Marts or Home Depots in Africa where people with money can consume," said Darcy Garneau, associate principal at EDI, which has opened an office in Luanda. "When we build a residential compound there we bring in everything down to the forks and knives, and that's an opportunity for us."
 Whetting the appetite for more opportunities are expectations that the expansion of West Africa's oil industry is just beginning. It is expected to account for one of every five barrels of growth in global oil production capacity in the next decade, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
 New ventures in smaller countries like Chad, the Congo Republic, Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe, and Niger are expected to account for much of the growth.
 "Conducting business in the region requires a healthy appetite for risk," said Rogers Beall, a businessman here with a contract to help negotiate oil exploration agreements for Guinea-Bissau, a West African country of 1.3 million whose president, Kumba Yala, was ousted in a bloodless coup last week. Mr. Beall said he expected the military officers in charge of the government, led by Gen. Verissimo Correia Seabra, or other transitional leaders to continue to use his advice on moving forward with oil exploration plans.
 Despite such complications along the way, prospects in Africa are drawing many companies in Houston that are not in the energy business but are related to it. Charter airlines, construction companies, port inspectors and transportation companies based here are trying to seize on Africa-related opportunities.
 Among the companies represented in the Angola mission were large energy concerns like Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco and Devon Energy. But so were smaller companies, including Hanover Compressor, Bivac and Houston Express, a new airline that is offering nonstop service from Houston to Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, and to Luanda.
 The airline is backed by Sonair, the aviation subsidiary of Angola's national oil company. The Luanda flights are not cheap, running $3,615 for a round-trip ticket in coach, $5,915 for business class and $8,240 for first class. The airline is clearly focused on business travelers, with its MD-11's outfitted with 12 first-class seats, 78 business-class seats and 21 coach seats.
 There are several other reasons Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, has been quick to establish ties with Africa. Largely because of the need for employees of energy companies to travel back and forth from drilling areas, Houston has some of the nation's best transportation links to Africa, including direct flights to African capitals like Johannesburg and Lagos, Nigeria, as well as the service to Malabo and Luanda.
 At the same time, the port of Houston, the leading American port in terms of foreign tonnage, exported more goods to Africa last year, 33,374 tons, than to Asia, 23,346 tons. Over all, Africa accounted for 5 percent of the port's total trade in 2002, more than the Middle East, Central America and or the Caribbean.
 Influential emigres like Kase L. Lawal, a Nigerian-born businessman and owner of Camac Holdings, a Houston-based oil company with interests in Nigeria and South Africa, are another reason Houston's influence in Africa is growing. There are about 20,000 people from just one country -- Nigeria -- here already, for example. More are attracted each year by Houston's warm climate and its reputation as a relatively easy place to establish a business.
 While the African immigrant community is still dwarfed by the larger communities of Latinos and Asians who poured into Houston in the last 20 years, the Africans are for the most part better educated than other immigrants -- and even native-born Americans in the city. Nearly 35 percent of Africans in Houston have college degrees and 28 percent have postgraduate degrees, compared with 28 percent of American-born whites with college degrees and 16 percent with postgraduate degrees, said Stephen Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University.
 This has allowed some Africans to advance in areas like banking and publishing as well as energy. And that suits Chido Nwangwu, the publisher of USAfrica, the nation's largest African-owned newspaper, just fine.
 "The main problem with the relationship between Houston and Africa is that it is predominantly based on the energy industry," said Mr. Nwangwu, a native of Nigeria who recently created a magazine called Class for affluent Africans in the United States. "We're at risk of becoming too dependent on one area if we don't achieve a wider mix of transactional interchanges."
 To be sure, most of the investments in Africa by companies from Houston are focused on extracting natural resources like oil, gas and timber. Few involve direct investment in factories or manufacturing plants that create jobs and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth.
 Still, such efforts are part of Houston's aspiration to become a global city like New York and Los Angeles. Mr. Klineberg said Houston's best chance of achieving this was through a "realization that our location near depleting oil fields won't cut it anymore."
 "Houston was a biracial city dominated by white men for much of its history," Mr. Klineberg said. "If we're to get beyond that system and capitalize on our diversity, it has to be done by thinking internationally."

HEADLINE: Holders of Argentine Bonds Reject 25% Redemption Offer 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

 BODY:
Argentina's gambit of offering to pay back a quarter of the $94 billion it owes private bondholders worldwide provoked a predictably angry rejection from investors yesterday, and analysts predicted long and painful negotiations.
 Announcing the proposal on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Dubai, the Argentine economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said his country, in the midst of a recession, was in no position to repay bondholders at face value and asked them to accept a 75 percent reduction. 
 Argentina needs to close a deal with tens of thousands of private bondholders worldwide as it tries to put its economy back in order after four years of recession, a huge devaluation of its currency and a moratorium on debt payments in January 2002, which caused the largest sovereign debt default in history. 
 Mr. Lavagna and the finance secretary, Guillermo Nielsen, presented the plan to convert more than 150 bond issues in seven currencies to three types of bonds.
 Though Mr. Nielsen indicated that the Argentine proposal was a starting point in negotiations, private investors were quick to reject it, and some predicted many lawsuits against Argentina in courts around the world.
 "I can't say it was a surprise for us, but it's certainly completely unrealistic," said Stefan Engelsberger, who is representing a lobby of German bondholders in Dubai.
 "I will not give up; I will keep my bonds. I have legal claims, and I will fight for my rights in the courts, and I think most other investors will do the same," Mr. Engelsberger said in a telephone interview.
 Last week, a court in New York gave Argentina 45 days to negotiate with creditors before allowing an American investor, Kenneth Dart, to claim full repayment of his bonds plus interest, worth $700 million. 
 European investors, meanwhile, have tried to freeze Argentine assets abroad, while Japanese bondholders have tried to seize land in Patagonia as a guarantee that they will be paid.
An Italian banker at the talks, Vincenzo Farulla, said a 75 percent "haircut," as the reduction in the bonds' face value is known on the markets, was "unreasonable and not an option."
 Argentina surprised markets two weeks ago by clinching an agreement with the I.M.F. to roll over more than $12 billion it owes the monetary fund for the next three years, without subjecting itself to fiscal targets as stringent as those imposed on other lenders in the region.
 Apparently emboldened by that accord, President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina has said that private bondholders cannot be paid back in full while half of his country's people live in abject poverty, earning him cheers from most Argentines.
 Walter Molano, chief Latin America economist at BCP Securities, said, "The tough talk in Dubai appears to be a ploy by the government to buy time, trim down expectations and feed the populist rhetoric in Argentina." 
 "In the end," Mr. Molano said, "we don't believe the Argentine government will scalp investors."
 Fernando Losada, a Latin America economist at ABN Amro in New York, said, "This is just the first move in what is going to be a prolonged chess game."

MEMO PAD

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
Thanks largely to robust growth among low-fare airlines, the worldwide airline industry is showing clear recovery after two years of dire problems, according to OAG, a British company that publishes data on airline schedules.
 Worldwide scheduled flights are now at the level they were this time last year. 
Among the strongest growth areas: Britain, where low-fare carriers are proliferating; Asia-Pacific routes, which are recovering quickly from the battering taken during last winter's SARS scare; and the Middle East. 
 Scheduled flights within China, where both business and leisure traffic are growing, are up 21 percent in the third quarter compared with the period last year.
 The United States continues to lag, however. Although there are about the same number of domestic flights scheduled this month as September 2002, the number of scheduled domestic flights still remains 12 percent lower than 2001. 
 In Europe, scheduled flights on low-fare airlines are up 62 percent in September, and up 176 percent compared with the levels before 9/11, OAG said.
 In the United States, scheduled flights on low-fare carriers are up 7 percent this month from September 2002, and up 5 percent over levels before 9/11. 
 Accor Hotels says it has had a 60 percent increase in online bookings, mostly at its corporate or individual brands' Web sites, since the start of the year. Web bookings will account for 5.6 percent of hotel revenue this year. 
 The Accor hotels that are most often booked online run a wide range from the Sofitel New York to the Motel 6 Las Vegas Tropicana. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Road Rules for Recovering Alcoholics

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

 BODY:
The first thing John Sugg does after booking a hotel for his next business trip is to log on to CyberSober.com to find the nearest 12-step meeting. Then he prints a map from the site so he will know how to get there. Mr. Sugg is a recovering alcoholic, and he does not want to jeopardize 24 years of sobriety.
 "They've been very good years," said Mr. Sugg, 66, a consultant for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union who lives in Cooper City, Fla., and he travels nationwide to assist union members in running employee assistance programs. One service those programs offer is helping members get treatment for alcohol abuse. 
 Temptations for business travelers in recovery are everywhere. They are offered drinks on the plane, they attend conferences where liquor is flowing and they are invited to meet colleagues in bars before going out to dinner in restaurants with ample wine cellars. 
 "Travel itself is anxiety-producing," said Alan Goodstat, a licensed clinical social worker and administrator with Focus Healthcare, an addiction treatment center in Cooper City.
 If the secret to success in retailing is location, location, location, then for many former problem drinkers, the key to staying sober while out of town is meetings, meetings, meetings. Mr. Sugg and others like him have found Web sites like CyberSober and www.anonymousone.com, which provide listings of 12-step meetings in the United States and other countries, to be godsends for finding support when they travel.
 (A spokesman for Alcoholics Anonymous Worldwide Services said the organization preferred to direct people to local chapters for meeting information rather than list meetings on www.alcoholicsanonymous.com, its Web site).
 Mr. Goodstat counsels those who are newly sober about strategies for traveling. "I tell them to take a meeting list and phone numbers of friends and sponsors back home and to constantly keep in contact," he said. 
 Maria Cordone, an executive with Mr. Sugg's union, said that she advised union members in recovery who do not have online access to go to the library of the town they are in and find the location of an A.A. or other self-help meeting.
 Another step business travelers with alcohol problems can take to avoid temptation is call ahead and ask the hotel to remove alcoholic beverages from the room's minibar, said Eva Leonard, editor in chief of Business Traveler Magazine. And because "excessive free time can be a problem contributing to boredom and anxiety" on the road, she advised setting up activities in advance, like getting tickets to a play.
 Free time almost got Mr. Sugg into trouble on his first business trip after he had stopped drinking. "I was on the fourth floor of a hotel," he said. "There was a bar across the street, and every time the door opened I heard the music inside." He decided to go there and "have a soda." On the elevator ride to the lobby, he met two men carrying a coffee percolator and cups and learned that they were preparing for a 12-step meeting in the hotel the next day. When one of them found out that Mr. Sugg was newly sober, he insisted that he check out of the hotel and spend the night at his home with his family. "He may have saved me," Mr. Sugg said.
 Another chance encounter may have saved him again just a few weeks ago. On a business trip to Meridian, Miss., in July, he could not do his usual advance planning. It was his first time visiting a Lockheed plant, he was not sure where it was, and he did not know what hotels to choose. He decided he would find a hotel after he had driven to the plant. But he did not have his laptop with him so he could not look for a meeting location online after he arrived. Luckily, during his first day he ran into a union member who was a recovering alcoholic and was able to attend a local meeting with him.
 Temptations still dog him occasionally, Mr. Sugg said, as when he sees a beer commercial and watches the top being popped and the beer running down the side. He just cannot help wondering how it would taste. He also sometimes thinks he would like to sample a microbrew beer. "But I know better," he said. "I let the thought go in one ear and out the other."
 The former machinist normally averages one business trip a week, and goes to 12-step meetings almost every day he is on the road. On the first night of a visit to Orlando last month for a professional conference, for example, he went to a meeting on the first night in the conference hotel, to one on the second night in a church and to yet another on the fourth night on the drive back home.
 "There were three newcomers there," he said, "people who've been sober less than 30 days." He tried to make them feel comfortable and give them hope so that they would want to return. That is how he gets support, too, he said. "Like a teacher, you learn by teaching," Mr. Sugg said.
 Yuri Tarnavsky, project director of Friends of Addiction Recovery-New Jersey, an organization in Hamilton that provides recovery-support services, calls himself a "recovered" alcoholic instead of a "recovering" one. "If you no longer have the compulsion, you're not really recovering, although you're never cured," he said. On an early flight to Albuquerque last year, he recalls, he saw passengers drinking vodka and thought to himself, "This is not social drinking." Mr. Tarnavsky said, "I was grateful it wasn't me."
 The realization that if he starts he cannot stop hit home for Mr. Tarnavsky 20 years ago after an evening of sneaking drinks at a wedding party. On the way home in the back seat, he said, he was rocking from side to side and bouncing off the windows. "I never thought of myself as a drunk before that," he said. He went on the wagon a month later.
 Mr. Tarnavsky advises newly sober business travelers to keep candy handy for fending off the urge to drink, to make a "gratitude list" that they can read and reread on how much better their lives have become since they stopped drinking and to take self-help literature on their trips, like the Alcoholics Anonymous primer "Living Sober." 
 Hard-drinking business travelers who do not mend their ways can find themselves in complicated predicaments. Mr. Goodstat, the social worker, tells of a client who started drinking at the airport, had a few more on the plane and arrived at his destination drunk. He blacked out, and was so disoriented that he booked another flight and flew off to another city. When he finally woke up, he had no idea where he was.
 "If people are unable to admit they have an addiction, it doesn't allow them the chance for long-term abstinence," Mr. Goodstat said. "Many of my clients have died, are in jail, are unemployed, or are totally alone. I see careers ruined every day."

HEADLINE: Auto Deal or Bust 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Last week, the United Automobile Workers offered more concessions to the Big Three than it has in the last two decades of contract talks. Then again, concessions have not really been a feature of the last two decades of contract talks in the American auto industry. 
 While auto workers see a contract that extends a lifeline to the struggling Big Three, Wall Street sees baby steps that amount to a glass half-full in some minds and fully empty in others. 
 "Does this make the industry even a little bit more competitive? No," said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst and former executive who ran Priceline.com's automotive division. 
"This contract does nothing to even make a slight dent in the fundamental problems," she added. 
Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, said, "You can say there's something in it for everyone, but you can also be a pessimist and say there's something in it for everyone not to like."
That the talks were wrapped up in unusually speedy fashion, with the union reaching an unprecedented five deals in five days with the Big Three and the supply giants Delphi and Visteon, was taken as a positive. 
Ron Gettelfinger, the union president, said "one of our goals has been to bring this industry together." Auto executives, including the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, praised Mr. Gettelfinger's "professionalism."
The symbolic effect was the image of an industry and union on the same page, ready to tackle problems.
To start, the lucrative United States market is facing overcapacity that is only expected to worsen as foreign competitors continue to build plants here. The Big Three want to close plants, but the last contract had an outright ban on closings, so G.M. started a price war that has kept plants running but sapped Big Three profits and done nothing to stem declines in market share. In August, the Big Three's market share hit a record low.
Profitability has been a particular challenge for the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler. Ford lost $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002 combined and is expecting a slim profit this year; Chrysler lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter but is also expecting a slight profit for the year. 
This "profitless prosperity," as the Goldman Sachs analyst Gary Lapidus calls it, is coming during what is shaping up to be another year of go-go sales. "The agreement does not address the root cause," he wrote in a recent report, adding "we doubt the substance of the agreement is meaningfully positive for investors."
But he and other analysts do see some positives. 
For one, pension increases, a major liability for the Big Three, have been scaled back. Monthly benefits for retirees with 30 years of service will rise more than 10 percent over the four-year life of the contract, to $3,020 from $2,730, according to a summary of the contract with Chrysler provided to workers. That is less than the previous increase of roughly 17 percent. 
Second, instead of the 3 percent annual wage increases of the last contract, negotiated in 1999, workers will receive lump sums of roughly the same value in the first two years of the contract, a 2 percent increase in the third year and 3 percent raise in the fourth year. 
Lump sums are more palatable to management because they do not inflate base salaries, which are used to compute overtime, pension payments and future wage increases. Cost-of-living adjustments will also be reduced. 
On health care, co-payments for brand-name prescription drugs will rise to $10 from $5 for active workers. Co-payments for future retirees will also rise, to $5 from $2 -- but not for current retirees, which is the bulk of the Big Three's soaring health care burden and one not shared by foreign competitors.
"I think it's a rip-off, having to pay money for our prescriptions," said Janet Buice, 40, a worker at a Ford plant in Atlanta. 
Her husband Rick, 46, also works at the plant and did not agree. 
"It looks like a fair agreement, considering the economic times," he said. "I think it's real fair."
Of course, many white-collar workers would love such concessions -- paying $10 for brand name drugs -- or salaries. The average Ford assembly worker made $70,206 in 2002, and the average skilled worker made more than $80,000.
Such high labor costs have been a chief contributor to an exodus of 2.7 million manufacturing jobs over the last three years.
Part of the trade-off is that the union is letting the Big Three close some plants this time. G.M. is expected to close a plant in Baltimore, Chrysler has plans to close or sell seven parts plants, and Ford will close four plants. 
Some analysts do not think the closings are substantial enough. 
"I think Gettelfinger did a great job for his members because he preserved a terrific package of wages and benefits and minimized job losses related to capacity closings," John Casesa, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said. "You could easily make the case that far more capacity should have been eliminated."
For Ken Dearing, the president of U.A.W. local 325 in Hazelwood, Mo., last week was a good one. The union and Ford negotiated a deal that saves Ford's plant in Hazelwood, outside St. Louis, which makes the Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles. Instead, Ford will close a smaller van plant in Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland.
"It bought us four years and a breath of life," he said. "It's a very good contract for the economic times were in."
Ms. Keller said: "It's shocking that Ford is not closing the St. Louis plant. They certainly need to take out a plant with more capacity than Lorain. They probably needed to take both of them down."
Eddie Guidicelli, 63, worked for the Lorain assembly plant for 33 years before retiring in 1996. The blow of closings, in the auto business, is largely not felt by retirees like him, or even current workers, whose benefits are protected and who usually have the option of transferring. 
But it means a loss of future jobs, for the country and the community. 
At the union hall late last week, after hearing the news reports of his old plant's demise, Mr. Guidicelli lamented that his grandson would not be able to work at the plant. 
"I was hoping he'd have a future here, but it's looking slim," he said.

HEADLINE: Schools Get $4 Million to Recruit Principals 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
The Broad Foundation, which gives grants to improve public education, is donating $4 million to a program to recruit and train New York City principals, officials announced yesterday. 
 Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have been working to raise $75 million over three years for the program, called the Leadership Academy, a component of their plan to overhaul the city school system. The new gift brings the money raised to $38.5 million, Mr. Klein's press secretary said, with an additional $11.5 million in pledges. 
 At a news conference at the Rainbow Room, the mayor described the $4 million donation, coupled with more than $5 million the Broad Foundation gave the city schools recently, as "a great vote of confidence in Chancellor Klein and his vision as to how we are going to take the largest public school system in the country and make it better." 
But if the gift was a sign of hope, yesterday's news conference also made clear that New York schools had a long way to go.
The city was not a contender for the Broad Prize for Urban Education, an award recognizing an urban district that shows overall improvement while narrowing achievement gaps along ethnic and economic lines. Instead, the winner of the second annual Broad Prize was the Long Beach Unified School District, in California, which will receive $500,000, intended for college scholarships for its graduates. Four runner-up districts -- Garden Grove, Calif.; Jefferson County, Ky.; Norfolk, Va.; and Boston -- will each get $125,000.
"New York City was not a finalist this year, but I certainly believe, with the outstanding work and progress that's being made, and the team you've put together, you're going to be a finalist soon, if not the winner," said Eli Broad, who started the foundation with his wife.
Then, as an audience that included school officials, educators and Education Secretary Rod Paige chuckled, Mr. Broad presented Mr. Klein and Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott with an oversize check for $500,000, dated 200?. 
In an interview, Mr. Broad, the chairman of SunAmerica Inc., a financial services company, said the $4 million for the Leadership Academy would be used to recruit principals, including those who have left the city schools for higher pay elsewhere.
Dr. Paige praised the foundation as well as the federal No Child Left Behind law, which he said "will revolutionize the education system in our country." The law, among other things, entitles children to transfer out of failing schools that receive federal poverty money.
Last year, the Broad Prize went to the Houston public school system, where Dr. Paige was superintendent before joining the Bush administration. In recent months, Houston has come under scrutiny for understating its dropout rate, but Dr. Paige has defended the overall record of the district under his leadership.

HEADLINE: Studies Say Tax Cuts Now Will Bring BiggerBill Later 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
President Bush's tax cuts will put a trillion dollars in people's pockets over six years, but because the government is spending far more than it is taking in, the president's policies also mean that Americans face a much larger future tax bill -- or equally large cuts in government spending -- to balance the government's books.
 For each dollar of tax cuts, federal borrowing to finance the tax cuts, the war on terror and routine government operations will total $3.60 over six years, Congressional Budget Office data show. 
 From 2001 to 2006, Americans will get tax cuts that average $3,593 a person, while the per capita share of the national debt will increase by $13,000 from 2002 through 2007. About a fourth of this year's record budget deficit, estimated at $480 billion, will finance tax cuts. Money the government borrows must be repaid eventually through either future taxes or cuts in spending, although repayment can be deferred forever through more borrowing. 
As the amount borrowed grows, however, the mounting interest expense squeezes out financing for purposes unless tax revenue grows even faster, just as mortgaging a home to pay for vacations and groceries can eventually result in such large monthly interest expenses that there is no cash to pay for improvements, repairs or electricity.
"The government is basically borrowing $1,000 in your name and then handing you $250 of it," said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed research group in Washington. "The net effect is to leave you deeper and deeper in debt."
The costs and benefits of the cut-taxes-and-borrow policy vary widely depending on how much one makes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. The group's tax calculations are widely respected, even by those who disagree with its assertions that the tax system favors the rich.
In a report to be released this morning, Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that the 26 million taxpayers on the middle rungs of the income ladder, those making $28,000 to $45,000, are especially hard hit by federal borrowing. 
Each dollar of tax savings for this group is accompanied by $6.55 of increased federal debt, it estimates. The debt estimates are adjusted for each income group's share of income and population.
In 2007, interest alone on the additional $24,859 of federal debt owed by eachfamilyin this group will be more than $1,200, which is more than twice their average $578 of tax savings in 2006.
Only the top 1 percent income group comes out ahead, the analysis found.
Each dollar of tax cuts for the top 1 percent is offset by just 77 cents of added federal debt. For this group, the tax cuts over six years are worth $236,266 a person on average, while the share of the extra federal debt averages $182,725. 
Two tax experts at the Heritage Foundation, which has its own widely respected program to model the tax system, said that even though the tax cuts were being financed with borrowed money, it expected the long-term effect would be a significant increase in individual income.
William W. Beach, who developed the Heritage tax model, said his calculations showed that for each dollar of federal debt used to finance tax cuts from 2003 to 2013, disposable income would rise by $4.14. He said his model assumed that the borrowing to finance tax cuts, though not other government operations, would stimulate investment and create jobs.
Both Daniel J. Mitchell, a Heritage tax policy expert, and William G. Gale, a Brookings Institution economist, said that how borrowed money was used was crucial.
Mr. Mitchell said that "if you go into debt to win World War II it is a good thing; if you are going into debt to finance a trip to Las Vegas to blow your pension fund that is a bad purpose."
"The current borrowing is good because we will get long-term investment."
Mr. Gale used the same analogy, but came to a different conclusion. Federal debt "skyrocketed in World War II, but everybody thinks it was for a good reason," he said.
"Now federal debt is rising again and a significant chunk is to finance tax cuts for the very wealthiest families, which in my view is not a good reason."

HEADLINE: Iraq and Ailing Economy Leave Bush Aides on Edge, They Say 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
When George W. Bush addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday as the unapologetic commander in chief, administration officials acknowledge, behind the proud words will be a president in a less potent political position than a year ago because of setbacks in Iraq and the loss of jobs at home.
 People close to the president say that as the 2004 campaign approaches, the mood at the White House is not one of panic, but that Mr. Bush is worried and his top officials are on edge, particularly about the nearly three million jobs lost since Mr. Bush became president and about the so-far jobless recovery. 
 At the same time, Bush advisers acknowledge a high level of anxiety among House Republicans over what they perceive as the White House's inability to communicate its policies on Iraq effectively.
The problems have led to a new sense of urgency at the White House, Republicans say, with much riding on the president's speech to the General Assembly. In words written as much for a domestic audience as for an international one, Mr. Bush is expected to make limited concessions giving the United Nations more control in Baghdad, as the allies would like. But he will keep real authority in American hands.
"There's a feeling that you have to assert that the United States is still in control, if nothing else for domestic concerns," said a senior administration official, who, like most of those interviewed, requested anonymity.
"We're going into an election year and the president has to project an image of power and authority," the official added. "There will be a lot of language implying that we're not going anywhere. We're asking for help, but not for anyone to take over."
Mr. Bush's speech will also serve as a central thrust of a White House communications push intended to show the president as proactive on Iraq and the economy, the areas where White House officials readily concede he is most vulnerable politically. Mr. Bush will continue to travel the nation promoting his tax cuts as a way to create jobs.
"They understand they need to be aggressive in defining the Iraq policy, and they need to show that they have a focus on job creation, and then they need to be forceful in communicating both," said David Winston, a Republican pollster close to the White House. "There's a sense of urgency that things need to be done, and done quickly."
William Kristol, a conservative publisher with close ties to the administration, said that White House officials understood they had made mistakes, and that they had switched tactics.
"Until about two weeks ago they believed their own propaganda that all was well in Iraq and at home," Mr. Kristol said. "But reality has set in, and they're hard-headed in dealing with the problems they face." 
Several nationwide polls show support for Mr. Bush and his policies dropping in important areas. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, conducted over the weekend and released today, found that 50 percent of the public said the war in Iraq was worthwhile, while 48 percent said it was not. In August, the poll found 63 percent of Americans backing the war. 
The poll also found that Mr. Bush's overall approval rating was the lowest since he became president, falling to 50 percent. In August, the poll found that 59 percent of American's approved of his job performance, and in April the figure was 71 percent.
Officially, administration officials say that they had expected the drop in support for the president, and that they were not concerned about the turn of events. "We put out a memo three months ago predicting that this was going to happen," Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said.
But unofficially, some administration officials say they are experiencing the unpleasant sensation of not feeling in control of events. "I think there is a sense of being under assault and not being able to reclaim the upper hand in a way that seemed so effortless in the past," said one Bush adviser.
The new concern began in the summer, one official said, when L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, traveled to Washington to tell Mr. Bush, among others, that the situation was bleak in Baghdad and that he needed billions of additional dollars for the kind of security and reconstruction that would let the administration begin a significant troop withdrawal within a year. Although no administration official says so explicitly, the White House goal is to show substantial improvement in Iraq before next fall's re-election campaign.
For now, Mr. Bush's political aides are largely dismissive of the Democratic presidential candidates, although some Republicans say the White House is more worried than it lets on about the ability of Howard Dean to energize the Democrats. Mr. Bush, in an interview with Fox News broadcast today, said he was playing little attention to the rise of Dr. Dean.
"Occasionally it blips on my radar screen, but not nearly as much as you would think," he said.

HEADLINE: Kerry Attacks Rival Dean Over Protectionism 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Ratcheting up his attacks on his Democratic presidential rivals, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts yesterday accused former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont of playing on the fears of workers and supporting protectionist trade policies that "would send our economy into a tailspin."
 Speaking in Detroit, Mr. Kerry said that Dr. Dean and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who have staked out traditional pro-labor positions on trade, were pandering to unions and advocating a "retreat from the global economy." 
 But Mr. Kerry saved his harshest words for Dr. Dean, aiming at what has been a main thrust of his opponent's appeal to core Democratic voters, tapping into a wellspring of rage at the Bush administration.
"Anger and attacks are all well and good," Mr. Kerry said. "But when it comes to our jobs, we need a president who can build a barn, and not just kick it down." 
"Governor Dean has said repeatedly that America should not trade with countries that haven't reached our own environmental and labor standards," Mr. Kerry told the Detroit Economic Club. "I will assure strong labor and environmental standards. But his approach would mean we couldn't sell a single car anywhere in the developing world."
Mr. Kerry's speech illuminated a quandary facing the Democratic hopefuls on trade: how to attack the president for losses in manufacturing employment, given that many of those positions have been lost to trading partners, without abandoning the Clinton administration's support for open markets.
Mr. Kerry's solution, it seems, was to rail against President Bush for failing to enforce the trade standards on the books, much as opponents of gun-control laws say they prefer to enforce existing laws. 
Mr. Kerry promised to open export markets in Japan and China and to require competitor nations to lower tariffs along with the United States.
"Given this administration's inaction, American manufacturers can be excused for feeling like economic roadkill," he said, accusing the president of "sitting on his hands" as America is abused by its trading partners. "How many jobs do we have to lose until this administration stops waiting?"
On a larger scale, what is playing out in the pre-primary debate is a struggle for the future of the party on a hot-button issue, said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
"What this all amounts to is trying to carry the party back to the Clinton-D.L.C. position on trade, which is for open markets," Mr. Bergsten said, referring to the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group.
"Clinton said to me 10 times if he said it once, one of his biggest disappointments in office was his failure to convince his own party to support globalization and expansion of trade.
"I think what Kerry is enunciating is that position versus the more traditional, skeptical, negative position associated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O."
It is unclear, though, how well Mr. Kerry's argument will sell to Democrats, particularly in states with early primaries like New Hampshire and South Carolina, which have had huge manufacturing losses, as has Michigan, the Dean campaign noted.
"It's clear that Senator Kerry doesn't have a grasp of Michigan and the devastation of the job loss that it's had to experience," a spokesman for Dr. Dean in Michigan, Daren Berringer, said. "We've got to deal with countries where there's an even playing field. If not, we're just encouraging jobs to be sent to other countries."
Erik Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Gephardt, said there was "one clear difference" between him and Mr. Kerry. "Congressman Gephardt," Mr. Smith said, "knows the difference between a good trade treaty and a bad trade treaty. Kerry has been a knee-jerk supporter for any free-trade treaty that comes down the pike, although recently he hasn't sounded like that on the stump."
He said Mr. Kerry seemed to adopt Mr. Gephardt's message on trade until fairly recently, perhaps hoping to eat away at Mr. Gephardt's support from labor unions. "He's been unable to do that," Mr. Smith said, "so now he's going back to where he's more comfortable."

HEADLINE: Clark Calls for a 'New American Patriotism' 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark called today for "a new American patriotism" that would encourage broader public service, respect domestic dissent even in wartime and embrace international organizations like the United Nations.
 General Clark, a former NATO commander and Army officer who last week announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, accused the Bush administration of neglecting economic problems and of pursuing a dangerous go-it-alone foreign policy. 
 But he also used the setting of the Citadel, the military college here, to appeal to about 150 cadets and civilians on the parade grounds to help restore something loftier, a sense of national spirit that he suggested that the administration's campaign against terror had corroded. 
"We've got to have a new kind of patriotism that recognizes that in times of war or peace democracy requires dialogue, disagreement and the courage to speak out," General Clark said. "And those who do it should not be condemned, but be praised."
General Clark made it clear he believed that the administration had unfairly focused on whole classes of immigrants, for fear of a minority within them. 
"Three million Muslims have come to this country from Asia and the Middle East," he said. "They didn't come because they were afraid of our values. They came because they wanted to live under them."
Today was Day 6 of the campaign, and General Clark's 20-minute stump speech at the hastily arranged event here had a few rough patches. 
"Patriotism doesn't consist of following the orders, not, not not when you're not in the chain of command," the general said, stumbling over his words and catching himself before he inadvertently encouraged insubordination in the ranks.
Despite the stumbles, General Clark heard good news in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll that showed he had jumped ahead of the other Democrats. The poll, conducted over the weekend, showed him tying President Bush head to head.
General Clark was invited to speak here by Philip Lader, a visiting professor of political science who is a close friend of former President Bill Clinton. Many former top Clinton aides have roles in his campaign.
General Clark directed his attacks against the administration, never mentioning the other nine Democratic hopefuls. He criticized the Bush team as doing little to stem the job losses and mounting deficits that have weighed on the economy since he retired from the Army in 2000.
"I'm running for president because I could not stand by and watch everything that we fought for, everything our nation had accomplished and become, unravel before our eyes," General Clark said.
He said the administration had failed to shore up health care and education, but he offered no detailed plans. 
"One of the principles we learned in the United States armed forces was the principle of accountability," he said. "Americans today are asking, 'Why did we lose three million jobs over the last three years?' "
He fired the other barrel of his attack at the handling of Iraq and at overall foreign policy, especially given that Mr. Bush is requesting $87 billion from Congress to finance reconstruction and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"What was the strategy?" he asked about Iraq. "What was the purpose? What is the success strategy? How are we going to finish the mission there?"
General Clark did not discuss what are apparently his reversals on the the war. Last October, he said that he would support the Congressional resolution that authorized the use of military force in Iraq and then spent months criticizing the execution of the war. On Thursday, the day after he announced his candidacy, he said, "I probably would have voted for" the resolution. On Friday, he backtracked, saying, "I never would have voted for war."
By coincidence, his aides said, General Clark spoke here nearly four years to the day after George W. Bush, then the governor of Texas, visited the Citadel to lay out his most explicit thinking on military policy.
General Clark did not delve into such detail, but said he would map out a foreign policy, drawing on his experience leading tens of thousands of troops and working at the highest levels of the government, first as a senior general in the Pentagon and later as NATO supreme commander in the 1999 war in Kosovo.
He said his approach was based on three basic pillars. First, his strategy would reach out more aggressively to allies. He said he would also work to improve relations with international organizations like the United Nations, which he said were created decades ago to "to distribute the burdens of leadership, to share the responsibilities and to share the benefits of security."
Finally, he said, he will always support a well-financed military, strong enough to deter or, if necessary, defeat any threat.
After his remarks, General Clark bounded into the audience, shaking hands, signing copies of his memoirs and getting a feel for what life is going to be like in the campaign.
Terry Tranen, 61, a retired aerospace engineer, said General Clark was the Democrat with the best chance of beating Mr. Bush. 
"I think I might send him some money," Mr. Tranen said. "That's the real test, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: Yen Surges On Statement By Ministers 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
A rap on the knuckles, it seems, can sometimes go a long way.
 After finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations urged Japan over the weekend to limit its role in foreign exchange markets, the yen rose to a 33-month high. In Tokyo, the dollar fell as low as 111.37 yen, nearly a 4-yen move from Friday. 
 Though no country was singled out in the group's communique, the call for "market mechanisms" to determine exchange rates was a none-too-subtle hint that the United States and Europe are tiring of Japan's repeated attempts to weaken its currency. Investors now suspect that Japan and, to a lesser degree China, will have a harder time propping up the dollar to slow any rise in their currencies. 
 The pressure on Japan comes at a crucial time for the industrialized world. President Bush, facing election next year, is eager to woo labor and industry, two groups that typically favor a weaker dollar. Trading partners that run surpluses with the United States have in the past been easy campaign-trail targets, and this time is no different. Mr. Bush, who plans to visit Japan next month, will probably reinforce the Group of 7's message.
 "The Japanese will have a tough time intervening before Bush visits in October," said one financial markets analyst at a Japanese bank. "Until then, it's inevitable that the yen will keep rising."
 Europe must dig out of an even deeper hole than the United States. While America's economy is expanding, those of France and Germany are barely growing. A rise in their exports would provide those countries a much-needed lift.
 But Japan has its own concerns. The country is pulling out of its third recession in a decade and wants to keep a lid on the yen's rise to help its exporters, the engine of the economy. Economies and their currencies, of course, often rise in tandem, and for Japan -- now the fastest-growing country in the Group of 7 -- there is nothing too surprising about the yen's 7.6 percent rise since August.
 Yet Japanese policy makers know that the country's manufacturers, including its biggest car and electronics makers, lose money on overseas earnings when the dollar slips below 115 yen. Though they are aware that the yen is poised to keep rising, Japanese finance officials want to slow the process to give exporters time to adjust their finances and to dilute the impact on the economy.
 "If you get a sudden move, it will surprise a lot of people," said Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities, which expects the yen to hit 105 to the dollar by the end of Japan's fiscal year in March 2004. "Realistically, they can only tap on the brakes. They're resigned to smoothing operations."
 A stronger yen could also slow the rally in stocks because foreigners -- the biggest buyers of shares this year -- would have to pay more to buy Japanese assets. The yen's steep gains today sent the Nikkei 225 tumbling 4.2 percent, its largest slide in two years. The benchmark index finished at 10,475.
 Despite the mounting pressure on Japan to curtail its manipulation of the markets, the Japanese will have a hard time resisting the temptation. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, emboldened by the economy's revival this year and his re-election Saturday as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, will probably call nationwide elections in November. The last thing he needs is for the Nikkei to buckle because of a rising yen.
 The economy could be hurt as well, though probably not enough to drive it back into recession. A 10 percent rise in the yen shaves about half a percentage point off Japan's economy over a two-year period, according to HSBC Securities. The yen is up more than 7 percent just in the last month.
 Even before the markets opened today, Toshihiko Fukui, governor of the Bank of Japan, warned that Japan "will take appropriate actions to address excessive currency movements, so market participants need to be aware of that."
 Mr. Fukui should be taken at his word. Japan has already spent a record 9 trillion yen ($80 billion) this year intervening in foreign exchange markets, and Japan can print yen indefinitely to finance its dollar purchases. In a nod to its Group of 7 partners, Japan may wait until the dollar falls near 110 yen before leaping into the market again.
 And that may not be far off. Japan's trade surplus continues to expand, growing a faster-than-expected 23 percent in August compared with the previous year. Exports grew 6.4 percent, almost twice as fast as imports.
 To keep the country's export machine humming, Japanese policy makers will have no choice but to cap the yen's rise whenever possible.
 "If it were not for intervention," said Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, "the currency would appreciate until Japanese exports were nearly shut down, which would destroy the nascent recovery."

HEADLINE: TIAA-CREF Lays Off 8% Of Workers In Overhaul 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
TIAA-CREF, the largest provider of individual pension plans for universities and colleges, said yesterday that it was laying off 8 percent, or 500, of its 6,500 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization intended to improve its efficiency.
 Most of the employees of TIAA-CREF, officially the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund, with more than $280 billion in assets under management, are based in New York, and the company said most of the job cuts are being made there. 
 "We are restructuring to meet the challenges of rapidly changing markets," Herbert M. Allison, the chief executive, said in an e-mail message to employees yesterday morning. "We must build an efficient and effective organization." 
 Mr. Allison, who resigned as president of Merrill Lynch & Company in 1999 after he was told he would not become Merrill's chief executive, took charge of TIAA-CREF in November 2002. Mr. Allison, who declined a request to discuss TIAA-CREF's reorganization, had led a cost-cutting campaign at Merrill.
 Having Mr. Allison at TIAA-CREF "definitely reflects more of a bottom-line orientation" for the company, said Andrew S. Kligerman, an analyst at UBS Securities.
 For several years, TIAA-CREF, a nonprofit organization founded with a $10,000 donation from Andrew Carnegie 85 years ago, has been struggling against profit-seeking competitors encroaching on its customers. "It's a big concern," John H. Biggs, the previous chief executive, said in an interview three years ago.
 TIAA-CREF is also the leading manager of college savings funds offered by many states, but in August it lost the management of the New York state plan to a competitor that offered lower costs.
 Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for TIAA-CREF, said the loss of the New York account was "reaffirmation of the fact that we have to bring our costs more in line." But he said a six-month study on the reorganization was under way before then.
 Until a 1997 ruling by the Internal Revenue Service, most of TIAA-CREF's operations were tax exempt. After the change in tax status, TIAA-CREF began offering investment products to the public instead of focusing exclusively on universities, research institutions and hospitals.
 As part of its reorganization, Mr. Goldstein said, TIAA-CREF for the first time will open store-front offices to provide face-to-face service to its customers at institutions and also to attract more customers from the public. The first such office is to open in Princeton, N.J., in early October, said Stephanie Cohen Glass, a TIAA-CREF spokeswoman. The company will also open offices soon in Hamden, Conn., and Charlottesville, Va., she said, and dozens of others are to follow.
 Previously, customers have dealt with TIAA-CREF mainly over the phone or the Internet or by mail, she said.
 Ms. Glass said that many of the job cuts were being made in the company's computer operations department, which accounted for 29 percent of TIAA-CREF's expenses, compared with 15 percent to 19 percent for other financial services companies. In a review, she said, the company discovered it had been using 27 computer systems "speaking hundreds of computer languages."
 The layoffs were by far the biggest staff cuts in the long history of a company that has been criticized as stodgy and inflexible, but has also been admired for providing an almost family-like atmosphere for workers. "This probably came as quite a shock," Mr. Kligerman said.
 Mr. Goldstein said that while the reorganization plan was being developed, TIAA-CREF held town-hall-style meetings to discuss the company's operations. "The employees were very much aware of what the cost structure was and where changes needed to occur," he said. 
 The company said it laid off the workers yesterday. Managers spoke personally to those who were being fired, and those who were not at the office received phone calls, Ms. Glass said.
 "We decided that completing it as quickly as possible would be in the best interests of all employees," Mr. Allison said in his e-mail message. "Stretching this process over a period of days or weeks would have only exacerbated what has been a high level of anxiety within the company in recent weeks."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Regain Some Ground as Worries on Dollar Ease

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose broadly yesterday after posting their biggest drop in almost seven weeks on Monday, when the dollar slumped.
 "It looks like yesterday's decline was a bit of an overreaction," said Wendy Trevisani, who helps manage $7 billion at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M. "Anyone who does global business will benefit from a weaker dollar." 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 6.21 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,030.12, helped by gains in computer-related and health care companies. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.63 points, or 0.4 percent, to 9,576.04. The Nasdaq composite index increased 27.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,901.72. 
On Monday, stocks declined after Group of Seven finance ministers signaled that they were prepared to let the dollar fall. That led to a slump in the dollar and raised concern that international investors might shun American assets.
The dollar reached its lowest level in almost three years against the Japanese yen earlier yesterday but rebounded to 112.09 yen, up 0.13. The weakness in the dollar will help American companies that sell goods overseas by making their products less expensive in other countries.
Companies that may benefit from the dollar's drop include Pfizer and Kimberly-Clark, analysts said.
Pfizer, which generates more than a third of its sales from outside the United States, rose 46 cents, to $31.60. Kimberly-Clark advanced 37 cents, to $51.07.
Two technology stocks that rose yesterday were Cisco Systems, up 37 cents, to $21.15, and Microsoft, which advanced 53 cents, to $29.60.
Tyson Foods gained 95 cents, to $14.25. The company said it expected a fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 35 cents to 40 cents a share, compared with an average analyst forecast of 23 cents as reported in a survey by Thomson Financial.
Brokerage stocks were mixed after three of the biggest securities firms reported earnings. 
Goldman Sachs shed $3.60, to $89.06, for its biggest drop in more than four months. Third-quarter revenue in Goldman's fixed-income, currency and commodities division dropped 37 percent, to $828 million, on a decline in the mortgage and currency units.
Morgan Stanley gained $1.18, to $52.33. Third-quarter earnings more than doubled as bond sales and trading surged. The company said an accounting change related to compensation added $350 million to earnings.
Lehman Brothers Holdings rose 69 cents, to $70.90, after it said third-quarter profit more than doubled.

Treasury Prices Climb
(By Reuters)
Treasury prices recovered from early losses yesterday as concerns about the dollar faded into the background.
The dollar sagged against the yen as investors worried that Japan might not sell its currency to protect exporters. But a bout of short covering helped stem the decline and gave Treasury prices a lift.
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note gained 6/32, to a price of 100 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.21 percent from 4.22 percent on Monday. And the 30-year bond rose 21/32, to 104 6/32. Its yield fell to 5.09 percent from 5.13 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.933

HEADLINE: Strong Dollar, Weak Dollar: Anyone Have A Scorecard? 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Rarely have so many people in so many countries been pushing for the dollar to get weaker rather than stronger.
 But today, three days after the Group of 7 nudged China and Japan to adopt more "flexible exchange rates," it remained unclear whether those two players would join in the game to weaken the dollar. 
 The dollar, after plunging to a three-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday, actually climbed a bit today. Treasury notes rose in value, a sign that the dollar may not, after all, be poised for the plunge that so many want. 
Anxiety about the continued strength of the dollar against most Asian currencies is running high both in the United States and in Europe. 
American manufacturers have complained for years that the strength of the dollar has devastated their competitive position by making foreign imports cheap and their own exports expensive.
The Bush administration, eager for anything that could help reduce unemployment before next year's elections, has all but abandoned the strong-dollar policy of the Clinton administration and pressured Asian countries to let their currencies appreciate against the greenback.
European leaders are almost equally anxious. Over the last two years, the euro has soared against the dollar as well as Asian currencies. After an initial blush of pleasure at the euro's new credibility, European leaders are suddenly worried about having the only strong currency in the world.
Indeed, European finance officials were at least as forceful as Treasury Secretary John W. Snow in prodding Asian countries at the Group of 7 meeting over the weekend in Dubai.
"It's a fundamental change," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington, who has argued in favor of a weaker dollar for several years. "This is the G-7 with the U.S. in the lead, quite clearly in favor of a weaker dollar." 
Economists say there are many good reasons why the dollar should decline in value against other major currencies. Thanks in part to the strength of the dollar, which makes imports cheaper than otherwise for American consumers, the United States has a huge trade deficit and is by far the heaviest borrower in the world.
A weaker dollar would make imports more expensive and provide a lift to American exports. Over time, it would help reduce the imbalance between the United States and the rest of the world.
For American and European leaders alike, the question is simply how far and how fast the dollar should decline against other major currencies. 
But the key to the dollar's prospects lies less in what the United States does than in the decisions by central bankers in Japan, China and to a lesser extent those in South Korea and Taiwan. 
Asia's big central banks have accumulated more than $1 trillion in United States Treasury notes and dollars over the last several years, and most of that growth is the result of attempts by Asian central banks to keep their currencies weak in relation to the dollar.
The Bank of Japan has nearly $500 billion in Treasury securities and has been buying at a ferocious pace over the last year. China's central bank has about $350 billion. South Korea and Taiwan have amassed an additional $230 billion combined.
If China and Japan actually allowed their currencies to float freely, many analysts say the dollar would sink far more quickly than American officials actually want.
Chinese leaders have made it clear they are not ready to change their policy, which is to peg the Chinese yuan at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar. And after an initial frenzy about a shift in Japanese policy, currency traders once again began predicting that the Bank of Japan would return to its old ways and intervene in the currency markets to weaken the yen.
After allowing the yen to rise to its highest level against the dollar in three years on Monday, Toshihiko Fukui, the governor of the Bank of Japan, dampened expectations about a shift in Japanese policy. 
Mr. Fukui said that currency markets had "overreacted" to statements made by the Group of 7 countries. Though Japan is part of the group, the official statement left room for its leaders to continue intervening in currency markets.
Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a publisher of financial newsletters, noted that China did not even participate in the Group of 7 meeting and that Japan quickly played down expectations of a change in policy.
"What we have is a somewhat wishful statement from the Group of 7, when six of the seven are already committed to flexible exchange rates," Mr. Crandall said. "Only one of the targeted nations had a seat at the table, and that nation politely dissented in statements after the meeting."
Many experts predict that Japanese leaders will be reluctant to let the dollar weaken substantially against the yen. After years of stagnation, the Japanese economy is finally beginning to show signs of stronger growth and exports have traditionally been the key to growth.
Letting the Japanese yen rise in value would make Japanese exports more expensive in the United States. 
But even those who do not believe that Asian countries will change policy say the days of championing a strong dollar are over. 
The shift may have begun under President Bush's first Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, who placed less emphasis on keeping the dollar strong than on letting market forces rule.
The shift became much more pronounced under Mr. O'Neill's successor, Mr. Snow, who has tried to publicly press Chinese leaders into relaxing their policy.
That shift reflected intense lobbying from American manufacturing companies, which have shed more than two million jobs over the last several years and have blamed much of their plight on efforts by China to deliberately undervalue its currency. 
"The big story here is that John Snow finally listened to the key points we were making," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Hudson Valley House Prices Are Called Unaffordable 

BYLINE:  By DEBRA WEST

 BODY:
Housing prices in the suburbs north of New York City have grown so far out of reach for many residents that 79 percent of households there would not have been able to qualify for a conventional 90 percent mortgage if they tried to buy a median-priced home in their own community in the spring of 2002, a study released today by the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. says.
 The report is the second in a series commissioned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that will examine the affordability of housing in different regions throughout the state. 
 The labor federation commissioned the report to bolster its case for a bill that it lobbied for and got introduced in the State Senate this year calling for state subsidies of housing for the middle class.
"There is a crisis in affordable housing in New York," said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 2.5 million unionized workers from teachers to tradesmen. "People tend not to realize that you can go to work and make a decent salary and still not be able to afford housing here. There is a very good chance that when your kids grow up and start their own family, they won't be able to stay in the area." 
In Westchester, a buyer would have had to earn $187,000 to buy the median-priced $520,000 home, at 90 percent financing, the report found. In Rockland, a buyer would have to earn $123,000 to qualify for the median home at $343,000, and in Putnam, the buyer would have to earn $83,655 to qualify for the $285,000 median-priced home. 
Even in Sullivan County, which has little industry and is too far for most who commute to New York City, the median home price reached $90,000, meaning a buyer would have to earn $32,400 to qualify for a 90 percent mortgage. 
And these numbers, of course, do not reflect how much income buyers would need to qualify for the 50 percent of homes that are above the median price.
The bill in Albany includes ideas like giving direct rent subsidies to people whose incomes are as high as $100,000, state investment in housing development and rehabilitation for middle-income residents, and funds to cut the cost of development, Mr. Hughes said. 
He said he could not estimate how much money would be required.
The report released today looks at housing in the Hudson Valley, which it defined as the seven counties north of New York City: Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan. There are 772,000 households in the region, the report said. 
The union's first report was released in July and focused on Long Island. It found an even worse housing squeeze on the middle class.
Both reports were prepared by David M. Muchnick of Sustainable Enterprise, a Manhattan consulting firm. The next reports will examine the Albany area and New York City.
While new building is taking place in the Hudson Valley (70,900 homes were built between 1990 and 2000), it has not kept pace with an increase in households, Mr. Muchnick said. There is a shortage of 12,100 units of housing during the decade.
For groups who need housing that costs less than the median price, like single parents and the elderly, there is a shortfall of 13,500 units, the report said.
About 200,000 to 300,000 adults ages 20 to 34 still live with their parents in the Hudson Valley, because they cannot find housing they can afford. This represents an enormous pent-up demand, in addition to the 12,100-unit shortage, the report said. 
The housing problem reaches across nearly all sectors of the economy, from teachers, tradesmen and uniformed services to entry-level corporate and professional jobs, Mr. Muchnick said. 
The decade from 1990 to 2000 was marked by widespread increases in housing costs, with median monthly mortgage costs rising 23 percent in Westchester and 41 percent in Ulster and Sullivan Counties.
Other costs of homeownership, including taxes, utilities, insurance and fuel, increased 30 percent in Dutchess County and 62 percent in Westchester.
For renters, the cost of renting grew even faster than the cost of ownership.
In Westchester, where 40percent of households rent, the fair-market rent of a two-bedroom apartment rose by 57 percent to $1,108. Sixty percent of apartments cost more than the fair-market rent, a category defined by the study.

HEADLINE: Charges May Be Filed In Release Of Teenager 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Troublesome and possibly criminal issues have turned up in an internal investigation of the mistaken release of a teenager suspected in the killing of a 7-year-old boy, the Essex County executive, Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., said today. The child's death prompted sweeping changes in the state's child welfare system.
 The findings of the investigation into the Sept. 5 release of Wesley A. Murphy, 17, the suspect in the killing of Faheem Williams, have now been turned over to the Essex County prosecutor's office for possible criminal charges, county officials said. 
 Mr. DiVincenzo, whose office operates the county jail and juvenile detention center, which both figured in Mr. Murphy's release, would not give details of what the internal review had found. He said that the county prosecutor had asked him to avoid comments that might affect their investigation. 
He did say, however, that "systemic practices" had grown up that allowed inmates to the transferred or released on the basis of "verbal instructions" by telephone, and that the practice would be immediately banned in the county. He added that he would stiffen requirements for written documentation of all inmate transfers or releases that were ordered by the court or any other agency, and suggested that people "inside and outside of county government" might become the subject of the criminal investigation.
The acting county prosecutor, Donald C. Campolo, said that his office had referred the investigation to its economic crimes and official corruption unit, and that apart from any possible criminal charges emerging, he welcomed the chance to address any "systemic problems" in a part of the criminal justice system.
Meanwhile, Mr. DiVincenzo, who this month proclaimed himself "embarrassed" by Mr. Murphy's mistaken release, said that as a result of his internal review he had "lost faith in the the current leadership" at the youth detention center. Consequently, he said, he had forced the three top officials of the center to step down, and today he announced the appointment of Ronald Salahuddin, a detective in the county sheriff's office and a former East Orange public safety official, as the center's new director.
The three officials dismissed are Dana Hobson, Anthony Paglucci and David Sutton, the director, superintendent and detention officer, respectively. All were appointed by Mr. DiVincenzo's predecessor, James Treffinger, and serve at the discretion of the county executive. Mr. Hobson did not return calls for comment and Mr. Sutton could not be located. Anthony Pope, Mr. Paglucci's attorney, said that his client had had no direct role in Mr. Murphy's release. He said that based on his own review of the case, the fault for the mistaken release rested with the county's adult jail, which had sent Mr. Murphy to the juvenile center with flawed paperwork in the first place.
"There were errors committed, but nothing intentional," he said. "But to fire people with families and responsibilities is a knee-jerk reaction, and so political."
Mr. DiVincenzo is a Democrat and Mr. Treffinger, who was convicted this year on corruption charges, is a Republican.
Mr. Murphy, the cousin of Faheem Williams, has been charged with aggravated assault in the death of the boy, whose decomposed body was found in the locked basement of a Newark home where his two brothers had also been found malnourished and dehydrated. According to prosecutors, the injuries leading to the boy's death were suffered well before his body was found and were the result of roughhousing with Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Murphy's lawyer, Patricia Weston Rivera, scoffed at the suggestion that anyone outside of the jail or the criminal justice system could be faulted for the mistaken release. She said that her client, who played basketball in the area, had not fled, had eventually turned himself in, and could not have been part of any criminal conspiracy.

HEADLINE: Outer Banks' Residents See Good and Varieties of Bad in a Storm 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NAGS HEAD, N.C., Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Families who have passed this vacation spot down through the generations expect certain landmarks: Jennette's Pier, 64 years old and stretching 600 feet into the Atlantic; the Sea Foam Motel, all teal-colored kitsch; and Crabtree Court, a cluster of 50's-era cottages hard by the beach. 
 All are gone now, or at least grievously damaged by the 30-foot waves that pounded communities up and down the Outer Banks when Hurricane Isabel roared through on Thursday. Entire strips of beachfront are devastated, and though natives of these pinky-thin barrier islands insist things will soon return to normal -- another year, another storm, they say -- they also admit that this hurricane altered their landscape far more than any other storm in decades. 
 What it means for the economy of the Outer Banks, so dependent on the tourist trade, and for its culture, so proudly defiant of the elements that regularly batter it, depends on whom you ask. 
"A bit of a cleansing" is how Carolyn McCormick, director of the Outer Banks Visitors Bureau, described the storm's impact with a fierce smile. Her business is persuading people to visit, and so her take on the hundreds of millions of dollars in property and beach damage is that Hurricane Isabel uncovered more of the natural resources that visitors flock here to see. New dunes have been formed, Ms. McCormick said, and a previously submerged shipwreck is now off Coquina Beach.
"It is even more magical now," Ms. McCormick said as she prepared to assess commercial damage in a meeting with business owners. "We will come back stronger than we've ever been."
Stronger, maybe, but also less appealing, other residents say. With institutions like the Sea Foam and Jennette's Pier in ruins, chances are good that developers will snap up the properties and build big, flashy houses and hotels, chipping away at the old-time, mom-and-pop feel of Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and other oceanfront towns that suffered a lot of damage. The Outer Banks, so geographically isolated that they were long untouched by development, has seen a lot of it over the last decade, as people from Virginia on up the Atlantic coast discovered they could buy land here for significantly less than land closer to home. 
The damage wrought by Hurricane Isabel will only speed the transformation from old-fashioned and out-of-the-way to modern and crowded, some say. Permit agencies will forbid the rebuilding of old structures on grounds that they are dangerous, they say, making way for flashy new development. 
"All these places are going to collect on insurance and they're going to sell the land," said Shane Johnson, 26, a plumber who was gazing at the remains of Jennette's Pier, where he used to surf. "You'll see a bunch of houses with 10 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms go up, and you'll see this place lose a little more of its soul."
In the continental United States, only Florida has a more vulnerable stretch of coastline than the Outer Banks, a chain of islands that extend 137 miles from just south of the Chesapeake Bay to the South Carolina border. Wind and wild weather are constants here, and residents accept sand piled like snowdrifts on the roadways and house beams tossed out to sea. They point to the Wright Brothers, who took their first flight from Kitty Hawk, just north of Nags Head, as the models for their own pluck.
 "How in heck can someone live in San Francisco with earthquakes or New York with terrorism and tell me I live in a dangerous place?" said Mike Kelly, who owns four restaurants here and said he has lost about $200,000 in business since this hurricane.
 Mr. Kelly said Outer Banks residents learned from each storm, passing new zoning and building ordinances and constructing stronger homes.
 But will the tourists and developers keep coming now that Hurricane Isabel has reminded them how vulnerable the Outer Banks are? There has not, after all, been a storm this brutal since at least 1962, or possibly 1933, old-timers say. While today's wreckage could bring more resilient buildings to the Banks, it could also keep such development at bay, a possibility that appeals to some. 
 Mr. Johnson said Nags Head was not the tranquil place he moved to eight years ago. Instead, it teems with contractors and real estate types always looking for the latest project or land deal. A Home Depot opened last year, he said, and for the first time, a chain restaurant, Outback Steakhouse.
 "When something like this happens it makes people think twice about their investments," Mr. Johnson said, staring at the remains of Jennette's Pier. "Storms strip you down to what's real -- what's important and what's not."
 An Outer Banks spot that has resisted development more than most is Hatteras Village, 50 miles south of Nags Head at the tip of the Hatteras National Seashore. It is even more isolated now: the hurricane carved a new inlet through the island, cutting the village off from the highway north for the indefinite future. The damage was worst here, with at least a dozen houses and several hotels destroyed. 
Tim Midgett, a developer whose family has been in Hatteras "as far back as we can trace," said the hurricane would not stop "demand for the product." His family was in the process of selling one of its hotels when the storm hit, and though the hotel was seriously damaged, he said, the buyer is still interested.
 "We've had major catastrophes before," Mr. Midgett said, "but every time we emerge better."
 But in the most ravaged part of Hatteras, where hotels, shops and homes look as though they were stomped on or blown up and the air smelled of decay, not everyone was so resolute. Jody Stowe, who was born there and saw her jewelry shop, her home and her mother's home reduced to soggy, stinky rubble, told Mr. Midgett something new to his ears when he greeted her today. . 
 "I don't know if I'm going to stay here," Ms. Stowe murmured, suggesting that like the coastline itself, the people who know it best can in fact be broken by a storm.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: UNITED NATIONS; 
Annan Tells General Assembly That U.N. Must Correct Its Weaknesses

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Saying that the United Nations has "come to a fork in the road," Secretary General Kofi Annan argued today that fundamental weaknesses in the architecture of the institution must be remedied for it to retain any effectiveness in combating genocide, terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 If a robust and flexible new structure can be devised, he said, it could answer "the concerns that make some states feel uniquely vulnerable, since it is those concerns that drive them to take unilateral action" -- a clear reference to the Bush administration's policy of using pre-emptive force to eliminate perceived threats. 
 The logic of pre-emption, which was the political underpinning of the war in Iraq, he said, "represents a fundamental challenge to the principles on which, however imperfectly, world peace and stability have rested for the last 58 years."
The secretary general's remarks were the clearest indication to date of his strategic shift over the past 10 months, through the rancorous dissolution of Security Council consensus on confronting Iraq, the slow response to massacres in the eastern Congo and Liberia and, most critically, the Aug. 19 bombing attack on the Baghdad headquarters of the United Nations, which killed 22 people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, Mr. Annan's colleague and close friend for more than 20 years. 
Last winter, he urged consensus but set himself out as a person who carried out the mandates of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Since then, he has become ever more proactive. Today, he chided the delegates in language that bespoke his frustration at the United Nations' visible failures and at the attacks on it from Washington.
He also made clear his determination to leave the United Nations in better shape than it was when he became secretary general not quite seven years ago. Before the session began, he sent out personal appeals to heads of state and government to attend.
Last week, at a memorial service for the victims of the Baghdad attack, he said that bombing meant "a loss of innocence" for the institution. Today, he addressed the assembled delegates sternly, saying that the United Nations and its more than 9,000 employees belonged to them, and that they must do a better job of protecting them.
"Excellencies, you are the United Nations," he said. "The staff who were killed and injured in the attack on our Baghdad headquarters were your staff."
"We must take more effective measures to protect the security of our staff," he added. "I count on your full support -- legal, political and financial."
But the overarching message of his speechwas: Do not delay the tough political work of remaking the institution. Crucial to any change, he added, is reform of the Security Council -- which for many members means expanding the 15-member body, and for others means making it smaller.
Over the past few years, there have been suggestions that Germany and Japan, as economic powerhouses, should have permanent seats on the Security Council. Some have argued for expanded representation for Latin America and the Islamic world, others for a reduction in the number of European countries, which currently occupy one-third of the Council's 15 seats.
Today, Mr. Annan chastised his audience for debating this issue for more than a decade. "In the eyes of your peoples, the difficulty of reaching agreement does not excuse your failure to do so," he said. "If you want the council's decisions to command greater respect, particularly in the developing world, you need to address the issue of its composition with greater urgency."
He added, "History is a harsh judge; it will not forget us if we let this moment pass."
Mr. Annan said that he intended to set up a panel of "eminent personalities" to assess the current security threats and the best use of collective action to respond to them. This group, he proposed, would also recommend changes in the United Nations and processes of the United Nations, and would report back in time for their ideas to be discussed at the next General Assembly.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Secretary General Kofi Annan's speech to the United Nations General Assembly quoted incorrectly from a remark he made about the organization's failure to include more developing countries in the Security Council after more than a decade of debate. Mr. Annan told the delegates that unless they address the issue with greater urgency, history "will not forgive us" (not "forget us").

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET --Long Island; 
A Big REIT Is Taking A New Tack

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

DATELINE: MELVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Members of the family that founded the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, the Long Island-based real estate investment trust with more than 20 million square feet of office and industrial space in the New York area, are in the process of taking part of their properties private in a $315 million transaction.
 Four members of the Rechler family will resign from the REIT to acquire its Long Island industrial portfolio, with properties totaling 5.9 million square feet. They will form Rechler Equity Partners in a deal that is expected to close by the end of the year. The family entered the real estate business 42 years ago, and Reckson went public in 1995. 
 The planned acquisition will cover 95 properties, with 300,000 square feet in Nassau County and 5.6 million in Suffolk County.
 The transaction will ensure that the Rechler family remains the largest holder of properties in Long Island's strong industrial market, according to Jack O'Connor, senior vice president at the Woodbury office of CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company.
 "This particular venture will not have an impact on the office market," Mr. O'Connor said. But he estimated that the new company's plans to buy up and renovate vacant industrial buildings could reduce the industrial vacancy rate by "up to three-quarters" of a percentage point. The vacancy rate is currently 6.3 percent. 
 "Long Island's industrial marketplace remains strong," Mr. O'Connor added, "primarily because of our diversification; we are not impacted by a national recession. The Rechlers are known for quality buildings and will be a major player and a lure for national companies as they renovate old buildings and look to acquire more land."
 Active family members today are Donald Rechler and his son Mitchell and Roger Rechler and his sons Scott and Gregg. 
 Scott Rechler will remain the REIT's chief executive, a position he now shares with Donald Rechler, who will remain as Reckson's nonexecutive chairman while joining the others as a partner in the new industrial company.
 Mitchell and Gregg Rechler are currently Reckson's chief administrative and operating officers. They will be the managing partners of Rechler Equity Partners and will remain with the REIT in an advisory capacity for two years. 
 Explaining some of the thinking behind the split in an interview at Reckson's headquarters, Mitchell Rechler said: "Going private allows us more flexibility to dedicate our time to doing what we like most, getting our hands on the real estate. With the REIT, 50 percent of our time was dealing with the public end. Also, we were managing 330 employees under Reckson; now we will have 30." 
 In a telephone interview, Scott Rechler said, "We had always planned that as the company grew to a certain size we would be grooming a management team to grow as well that could fill the role of some of the family." 
 There were also estate planning considerations for family members, he said.
 The Rechler family's ties to the industrial portfolio go back to 1961 when William Rechler, who died in 1976, came to Long Island from the Bronx and purchased 1,400 acres of land that would become part of the Hauppauge Industrial Park. In 1968, his sons Donald and Roger founded Reckson Associates.
 Its first project that year was a 12,000-square-foot industrial building in Islandia that cost $5.50 a square foot to develop. 
 When Reckson went public in 1995, its industrial properties and most of its office properties were rolled into the REIT, which became the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation. 
 When the company went public, its common shares sold for $12.13 a share, adjusted for splits, and it had a total market capitalization of about $400 million. Today, the shares are trading around $23 a share and the company's market capitalization is in excess of $3 billion.
 Reckson's most recent industrial project, a 70,000-square-foot building completed this year, was the final structure in a four-building complex of ultramodern Class A high-tech industrial buildings totaling 540,000 square feet at Airport International Plaza in Bohemia. 
 Its most recent office acquisition was the $31 million purchase last month of a 180,000-square-foot building at 1055 Washington Boulevard in downtown Stamford, Conn. 
 The REIT will retain about 500,000 square feet of industrial properties in Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as its 14.8 million square feet of office buildings. Of the office portfolio, 34 percent is in Manhattan, 28 percent in Westchester and Connecticut, 16 percent in New Jersey and 22 percent in Long Island.
 "We wanted to take the proceeds from the sale of the industrial properties and continue to grow and have a balance in all markets,"said Scott Rechler. 
 According to Mitchell and Gregg Rechler, the new industrial company plans to build up its portfolio by redeveloping property, including 2.5 million square feet at the 14-million-square-foot Hauppauge Industrial Park. 
 "We plan to convert the older buildings that our grandfather built and redevelop them into high-tech industrial and office space, and we will aggressively pursue new properties," Gregg Rechler said.

HEADLINE: Cut the Cost of Prescription Drugs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What is particularly outrageous about the drug industry's opposition to the importation of Canadian drugs is the repeated rationale that the United States market provides the resources for necessary research (editorial, Sept. 20). 
Where is it written that only Americans should pay for drug research?
 Since most workers receive their drugs through an employer plan with only a small co-payment, the only people in the world who pay full price for their medications are the elderly, employees who are not covered by their employers or, even worse, the unemployed and the disabled. 
 Is this the way to pay for research, particularly since so much of it is done by the United States government at taxpayer expense?
The pharmaceutical industry can get away with this only as long as it continues to line the pockets of our representatives and senators from both political parties.

HEADLINE: Learning From 9/11, Bloomberg Seeks High-Rise Safety Changes 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Legislation that would enact most of the fire safety improvements for tall buildings recommended by a task force that studied the World Trade Center collapse was announced yesterday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 Under a bill being submitted to the City Council next week, existing office towers in New York would have to comply with some of the stricter codes already in place for new buildings, including a potentially expensive requirement that sprinkler systems be installed. 
 City officials estimated that 200 to 400 buildings, all more than 9 or 10 stories tall, would need to be retro-fitted with sprinklers. 
Building owners would have 15 years to put the systems in place. They could apply for an extension in cases of financial hardship or waivers where structural limitations or historic-landmark status made them impractical. Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that economic concerns drove the decision to set a lengthy deadline for compliance.
"It sounds like a long time," the mayor said at a City Hall news conference. "But in a practical sense, by the time everything is engineered and given the economic expense, we think it is a reasonable compromise between our needs to get these buildings sprinklered and what landlords can afford."
Landlords would have much less time -- generally 18 months -- to comply with other proposals, which include adding more illuminated exit signs, providing backup power to existingsigns and placing glow-in-the-dark markings in stairwells.
Most of the legislation affects construction of new commercial buildings and is a result of lessons learned from the trade center disaster. For instance, buildings will be required to have stronger steel joists, since investigators believe the "open web" joists used in the trade center design failed more quickly in the extreme heat caused by jet-fuel fires.
Also, stairwells must be made more resistant to impacts; collapsing drywall stairwell enclosures were blamed for blocking the exits for many people trapped in the twin towers.
Over all, the proposals are geared toward giving office workers more time to escape.
"We can make buildings safer by getting people out faster," said Barbara J. Lancaster, the city building commissioner.
The 13 proposals in the legislation are drawn from a report released in February by the Building Department's World Trade Center building code task force. The report contained 21 recommendations, two of which have already been enacted. Six more are still under technical review, Ms. Lancaster said.
The legislation will be taken up by the Council's Housing and Buildings Committee, whose chairwoman, Madeline Provenzano, joined the mayor in issuing a statement yesterday praising the task force's work.
The task force included a representative of the Real Estate Board of New York, which in the past lobbied against requiring sprinkler systems in existing buildings. This time, the board lined up behind the recommendation, despite lingering concerns that the 15-year window for compliance "may actually not be enough time," said Marilyn Davenport, the board's senior vice president.
"We support the legislation," Ms. Davenport said. "There will be a cost involved, but we think it's the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: First Wave Of Suits Hits Mutual Funds Under Inquiry 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The lawyers who have filed hundreds of claims against investment banks, research analysts and corporate executives are now training their guns on mutual funds.
 Nearly a dozen plaintiff law firms have brought lawsuits against companies that manage mutual funds in the three weeks since Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, accused some fund companies of allowing favored investors to engage in trades not possible for most shareholders. Bank One, Strong Capital Management, Bank of America and Janus have been named in the suits, as they were by Mr. Spitzer. 
 But Mr. Spitzer, who has already received one big settlement from Wall Street, has said that the problem is more widespread and that his investigation is widening. The plaintiffs' lawyers are eagerly watching and are even trying to identify the firms that have received subpoenas. 
"Any time you introduce big, sophisticated players essentially engaging in what seems like preferential treatment and small investors being the worse off for it, that creates, potentially, a big claim," said Michael A. Perino, a professor at St. John's University School of Law in New York. 
The reason is simple. Investment companies, which manage some $7 trillion invested by 95 million Americans, are plump targets.
Plaintiffs' lawyers hope that the funds will ultimately settle, partly because of the difficulty of defending themselves in numerous cases. So far, the fund companies' public statements have not denied engaging in questionable practices and have, in some cases, vowed to make restitution where appropriate.
The lawsuits challenge the practices identified by Mr. Spitzer and federal regulators. Those practices include allowing favored investors to trade after hours and to buy and sell mutual fund shares over short periods to turn a quick profit, a practice known as timing.
In the eyes of plaintiffs' lawyers, the potential settlements could dwarf the biggest paid by corporate defendants (and their insurers) in shareholder lawsuits to date -- for example, $3.5 billion to settle claims of fraud at the Cendant Corporation and $568 million to settle claims that executives at Lucent misled investors.
Wall Street firms, after agreeing to pay $1 billion to settle regulators' complaints about research and conflicts, are still battling shareholder suits, and the cost is hard to gauge. In June some 300 companies agreed to pay $1 billion to escape litigation that challenged practices in initial stock offerings.
The suits against mutual fund companies rely on laws governing that industry, rather than those used in most shareholder suits. This lets lawyers skirt hurdles from legislation in the mid-1990's that make it harder to bring securities suits as class actions in federal court.
"It's not a traditional case," said Seth Ottensosser, a lawyer at the New York firm of Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, which has filed five lawsuits so far, against Janus, Strong and Bank One. "We always have to be innovative."
Because the legal arguments are novel, Mr. Perino said, predicting the outcome of the lawsuits is hard. "Whether this turns into a big payday at the end of the day is still an open question."
Even if the suits are ultimately unsuccessful, battling them will cost time and money, said Aegis J. Frumento, head of the securities litigation group at Duane Morris. 
"Lawsuits are headaches by definition," Mr. Frumento said. "Certainly, the plaintiffs bar is very creative, they're very imaginative and they're very aggressive."
The fund companies have declined to comment on the shareholder suits. But in public statements, Janus, Bank One and Strong have advised shareholders that they are conducting investigations into their practices in response to Mr. Spitzer's concerns. Bank One and Janus also say that if appropriate, they will make restitution to investors. 
Mr. Ottensosser's firm, like numerous other plaintiff-side firms, is busily investigating several mutual funds. It has a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a former New York City police detective and a former investigative reporter interviewing investors, former employees of fund managers and others, Mr. Ottensosser said.
It is easier and cheaper, though, to use information made public by Mr. Spitzer and federal regulators to identify funds that are worth a closer look, said Mr. Perino, the law professor. "Here, the state attorney general's office has basically done the work for you."
Another benefit for lawyers suing mutual funds is the ability to draw on laws other than the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which usually form the basis for shareholder lawsuits against companies and their executives, Mr. Perino said. Laws passed in the 1990's require such lawsuits to meet tougher standards, such as describing in detail any suspected fraud before the lawyers have begun discovery. Those standards do not apply, however, to suits brought under two other laws that apply to mutual funds, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, both of 1940.
"Potentially, it's a great opportunity for plaintiffs' lawyers because it puts them back to where they were on Dec. 21, 1995," before the laws imposing the tougher standards were passed, Mr. Perino said.
But the plaintiffs' lawyers will still face obstacles, said Fred Dunbar, a senior vice president at NERA Economic Consulting who has been an expert witness in calculating damages in securities lawsuits. 
First, market timing is not easily defined, he said. Second, establishing liability may be hard, because market timing is not always illegal and because some investors who traded in and out of funds quickly did not intend to engage in market timing. 
Even if liability is established, calculating damages is not easy because there will probably not be an agreed-upon method of valuing fund shares and adjusting for one investor's market timing, Mr. Dunbar said.
Steven G. Schulman, a partner in the New York office of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, said it was too early to calculate damages."It's clear that value has been diverted from the funds," said Mr. Schulman, whose firm has filed 8 to 10 lawsuits so far. As for damages, he said, "That's a question of fact for trial."

HEADLINE: Hearing on E.P.A. Nominee Takes an Ideological Turn 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats used the confirmation hearing today on Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, President Bush's choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, as a forum to sharply criticize the administration's environmental record, all but ignoring the nominee sitting in front of them.
 In the packed, three-hour hearing, members of the Environment and Public Works Committee told Mr. Leavitt repeatedly that the job he was seeking was one of the worst in Washington. 
 In response, Mr. Leavitt said that he viewed himself as a problem solver, that his preferred approach was collaboration and that his main goal was clean air.
"The solutions to these problems are found in the productive middle," he said. "Rarely are they found at the extremes."
Democrats and Republicans expect the committee to confirm Mr. Leavitt when it meets next week and say that the full Senate will vote to confirm him.
But four Democratic senators -- Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and three who are running for president: John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina -- have said they will bar the nomination from reaching the Senate until President Bush addressed certain issues. These include questions about why the administration removed warnings from agency press releases about the safety of the air at ground zero in New York shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Republican aides said after the hearing that the White House was likely to work out these issues with each senator.
Even environmentalists who oppose the nomination predicted that Mr. Leavitt would be confirmed.
"In the long run, the odds are that Governor Leavitt will be confirmed, but not without some significant compromises from the administration," largely on providing information that committee members have sought, said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust.
In the hearing, Mr. Leavitt revealed little about his intentions as administrator and made no commitments.
Swirling around him were accusations from Democrats that the Bush administration's record on the environment had been a disaster and that the administration could not be trusted on the issue. Mr. Leavitt faced almost no questions about his 11-year record as governor.
In his opening remarks, Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the committee, predicted that the hearing would be less about Mr. Leavitt than it would be a battleground over Mr. Bush's environmental record. Mr. Inhofe recited objections raised by environmentalists about the president's policies -- chiefly, that he was a friend to polluters -- and said none of them were true.
Mr. Leavitt refused to be drawn in to that debate.
To a request from Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent, for information on a recent administration decision not to require pollution-control devices on old power plants, he answered, "My objective is to have the air cleaner when I finish than when I started."
When Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked Mr. Leavitt if he would freeze that rule, noting that the governor's own director of air quality in Utah had strenuously objected to it, he said that the official had changed his mind and no longer objected.
The Republican members of the committee reproached the Democrats for what they said were baseless accusations about administration policies. Mr. Inhofe said at one point that the concept of global warming, a concern of the Democrats, "could be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people."
Some senators portrayed Mr. Leavitt as bystander tossed into the Cuisinart of partisan Washington politics.
"Into this political cauldron comes a good man," Mr. Wyden said.
Senators from each party expressed befuddlement over why Mr. Leavitt sought the job, particularly given the interagency tensions that preceded the resignation of the previous administrator, Christie Whitman, a Republican.
Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, said that Ms. Whitman "did the very best she could, but I'm sure she was relieved and glad to leave the battle."
Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, told Mr. Leavitt, "Governor, you've got a lot of guts to take this job," adding that it would probably be impossible to override the White House if he ever thought the president was wrong. "The fact that you decided to take this job in no way is impugning your intelligence," Mr. Reid assured him.
And Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, warned him that he would be giving up control by leaving the governor's office. "I've seen so many governors come here and think they could run it the way they ran their states," Mr. Baucus said. But Washington is different, he said, because "you're someplace else in the pecking order" and in Washington, the knives are longer.
Mr. Leavitt said that in seeking the post, he was answering the president's call.
"I passionately believe that this nation deserves to have a clean and safe and healthy environment," he said. "And I also believe that the United States can increase our velocity of our environmental progress. We can do it without compromising our competitive position economically in the world."
After the hearing, Mr. Leavitt told reporters who asked whether he was being naive about the difficulties of the job: "I don't have any illusions that it's an easy job. The president's asked that I do it, and I am going to give every ounce of energy I have."

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Learning His Lines, and Others', for Debate Tonight 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
As Arnold Schwarzenegger prepared for his first and only debate, his handlers said they expected few specifics from any participant.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, who contrary to his public image says he has laid out the most specific agenda of any of the recall candidates, is preparing for a full frontal assault from the four candidates who will share the stage with him on Wednesday at Sacramento State University for the 90-minute debate. 
 With questions (for instance: What does a colorblind society mean to you?) already distributed to the candidates, those prepping Mr. Schwarzenegger said he was expecting trickery from Tom McClintock, the conservative state senator who is splitting the Republican vote with him and who is coming under heavy pressure from the establishment right to drop out. Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, the main Democrat on the recall ballot, leads Mr. Schwarzenegger in the most recent poll by 2 percentage points and Mr. McClintock by 14. 
"We expect Tom to throw long, try silly stunts, do something to distinguish himself," an aide to Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "We expect him to ask for a no-tax pledge or challenge him to another debate. Arnold will be prepared to answer."
Mr. Schwarzenegger's strategy will be to raise the specter of special-interest money, which has flooded the Bustamante campaign and to a lesser extent Mr. McClintock's, the aide said. The Schwarzenegger strategy is to make a boogeyman of the Indian tribes who have contributed generously to his opponents.
On Monday, a county judge ruled that Mr. Bustamante illegally used millions of dollars donated to him by big tribes and big labor. The judge ordered the campaign to return nearly $4 million. Commercials valued at $500,000 that feature Mr. McClintock as the best choice for California were paid for by another powerful gambling tribe. 
As for Ariana Huffington, the radio personality and author who is campaigning as an alternative to corporate greed, Mr. Schwarzenegger may remind her on the stage that she paid less than $800 in income taxes over a two-year period and took enormous write-offs through her company, the Schwarzenegger aide said. Mr. Schwarzenegger will characterize Peter Camejo, the Green Party candidate, as a reckless tax-and-spend zealot.
Now that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has reversed itself, full attention is focused on Wednesday's debate, which is seen as critical to the chances of Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Bustamante for replacing Gov. Gray Davis.
In a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California, 67 percent of likely voters said the performance of the candidates in the debate would weigh significantly in their decisions. The poll shows that Mr. Bustamante's support is eroding while Mr. Schwarzenegger's has stagnated as he fights the perception that his campaign has little substance. 
But some politicians and political writers believe that Mr. Schwarzenegger has offered the most detailed plans of any of the major candidates. Drowned out in the off-again-on-again rulings by the court of appeals this last week were two major initiatives he laid out.
Last week, he offered a four-point plan to make state government more transparent, including a fund-raising freeze during the budget season to lock out big-money influence. He also called for increased penalties for fund-raising violations for the kinds of irregularities the county court said Mr. Bustamante committed.
On Sunday, Mr. Schwarzenegger unveiled an ambitious environmental plan that would end offshore oil drilling, build a network of hydrogen fueling stations and force older polluting vehicles off the roads. Even so, Mr. Schwarzenegger was criticized for his role as a spokesman for the Hummer military-style vehicle.
"It's the most advanced environmental program offered by a serious contender for governor," said William Bradley, a former California Democratic political adviser.
The other candidates have offered few nuggets of specificity, and when they have, economic and political professionals have criticized them as wishful or unrealistic. Mr. Bustamante has proposed $8 billion in tax increases despite the fact that Republicans refused to raise them a nickel during the last budget negotiations. He has proposed a $500 million savings by rooting out MediCal insurance corruption, which he acknowledges goes on under his watch. He also proposes $2 billion in other unspecified savings.
Mr. McClintock, like Mr. Schwarzenegger, proposes rolling back the $4 billion tax increase for car registration fees, but he has not said where he would find the money to replace it in the budget. He also said he would rescind the energy contracts signed by Mr. Davis at the height of the power crisis, despite the fact that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ruled that those contracts stand.
"Everyone is being vague, it's true," said Aaron S. Edlin, a professor of law and economics at the University of California at Berkeley. "Bustamante has a plan that is arithmetically possible but politically unpopular. Schwarzenegger's is arithmetically impossible and McClintock's is arithmetically impossible and probably irrelevant."
A bit of momentum is swinging toward Gray Davis, with just 53 percent of likely voters in favor of a recall, compared with 58 percent a month ago. To combat this, Mr. Schwarzenegger has begun an advertising blitz reminding citizens that Mr. Davis signed bad energy contracts, gave driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and raised the car tax 300 percent.
"The spotlight has illuminated the paucity of substance," said Jerry Brown, former governor of California and current mayor of Oakland. "They're all praying the economy gets better and the deficit disappears."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: COSTS; 
Partisan Battle Builds in Congress Over Bush's Spending Request

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The huge sums requested by the White House to occupy and rebuild Iraq sharply inflamed partisan tensions on Capitol Hill today, with Republican leaders accusing Democrats of undermining the military and sowing division by criticizing the Bush administration's postwar policies. 
 Democrats, emboldened by internal polls showing a growing public unease with the administration's $87 billion spending request for military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, have strongly amplified their disagreements with the White House in recent days. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who said late last week that President Bush's Iraq policy was a "fraud," today went to the Senate floor to describe the policy as a "colossal failure" unworthy of what he said was an $87 billion blank check. 
 Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said the $20.3 billion the president wanted for reconstruction in Iraq alone would have a hard time passing without a stronger justification. 
Republican lawmakers lashed back in their strongest terms yet. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader, accused Mr. Kennedy of uttering "hate speech" and said he needed to apologize to the country for accusing Mr. Bush of what amounted to treason. Senate leaders said the criticism threatened the military's mission.
"Those comments, while freely exercised in freedom of speech, they strike at the hearts of the military families," said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, referring specifically to Mr. Kennedy.
"The impact that has on our ability to maintain a strong and viable armed forces -- I think some of those comments have no place in the dialogue of the Congress of the United States," Mr. Warner added.
The increasingly harsh words among lawmakers do not necessarily reflect the degree of support for the Iraq spending bill, which large majorities of both parties say they will approve after several weeks of hearings and questioning.
Rather, the $87 billion request has become a surrogate for the longstanding political divisions between the two parties. By contrasting the amounts allotted for schools, hospitals and roads in Iraq, for example, while infrastructure is crumbling at home, Democrats are really making a case against Mr. Bush's tax cuts and economic policies at home.
Many Republicans, at the same time, share the unease over the size of the request, but say they have to support the president when polls show his approval levels declining.
"You have to admit with some members there was sticker shock at $87 billion," Mr. DeLay said. "They're trying to grapple with that."
A memorandum distributed to Congressional Democrats by Democracy Corps, an opinion research firm run by several former members of the Clinton administration, said that 60 percent of the public opposes the $87 billion request, while 54 percent believe Mr. Bush does not have a plan to win the peace and bring troops home.
The memorandum, by John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, and Stanley B. Greenberg, his pollster, urges Democrats to wage a battle over the spending request as a way of framing the public debate.
Bolstered by these numbers, Democrats are growing vocal about the costs of Iraq. House Democrats released a study today asserting that the long-term cost of remaining in Iraq would be much greater than the administration has said -- $237 billion if troops remain through 2006, and $309 billion if troops remain through 2008. 
Mr. Daschle said that if the $20.3 billion in reconstruction money could be broken out from the military part of the request and voted on separately -- a plan already rejected by Republicans -- it would not pass the Senate.
And Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, forcefully rejected the argument of L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator of Iraq, that the money must be spent quickly to avoid further unrest there.
"Every time I hear in the administration, 'If you don't do this immediately, dire consequence are going to follow,' we do things immediately and dire consequences follow," Mr. Hoyer said. "I am not very sanguine about Mr. Bremer or the administration's representations, which have proved to be egregiously incorrect for the most part."
Mr. Bremer testified on Monday that the money would provide only the most fundamental and essential services for Iraq. But even Republican officials said they were surprised by the breadth of the public works projects the administration was proposing. One Republican official noted with amazement that amid all the housing and water projects was $19 million to build a wireless Internet network for the Iraqi post office that mobile computer users could join.
Publicly, however, Republicans made it clear that their defense to the charge of excessive generosity to Iraq would be a vigorous comparison to the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II.
"After World War II we built schools and roads and hospitals in Japan and in Germany when we did not have those things in Tennessee," said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. "And we did it not for the Japanese and the Germans, but for ourselves, because we knew we had to win the peace as well as win the war. I think the people of Tennessee understand that we can't just walk away from this mess."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; 
In Annan and Chirac's Words: 'Fork in the Road' and 'Call a Summit'

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches today at the General Assembly by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Jacques Chirac of France, as supplied, partly in translation, by the United Nations. The texts are at www .nytimes.com/international.

By Kofi Annan
 The last 12 months have been very painful for those of us who believe in collective answers to our common problems and challenges. In many countries, terrorism has once again brought death and suffering to innocent people. In the Middle East and in certain parts of Africa, violence has continued to escalate. In the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere, the threat of nuclear proliferation casts an ominous shadow across the landscape. 
 And barely one month ago in Baghdad, the United Nations itself suffered a brutal and deliberate assault in which the international community lost some of its most talented servants. Yesterday it was attacked again. . . . 
Excellencies, you are the United Nations. The staff who were killed and injured in the attack on our Baghdad headquarters were your staff. You had given them a mandate to assist the suffering Iraqi people and to help Iraq recover their sovereignty. In future, not only in Iraq but wherever the United Nations is engaged, we must take more effective measures to protect the security of our staff. . . . 
Subject to security considerations, the United Nations system is prepared to play its full role in working for a satisfactory outcome in Iraq and to do so as part of an international effort, an effort by the whole international community, pulling together on the basis of a sound and viable policy. 
If it takes extra time and patience to forge that policy, a policy that is collective, coherent and workable, then I for one would regard that time as well spent. Indeed, this is how we must approach all the many pressing crises that confront us today.
Excellencies, three years ago, when you came here for the Millennium Summit, we shared a vision, a vision of global solidarity and collective security, expressed in the Millennium Declaration. But recent events have called that consensus in question.
All of us know there are new threats that must be faced or, perhaps, old threats in new and dangerous combinations, new forms of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
But while some consider these threats as self-evidently the main challenge to world peace and security, others feel more immediately menaced by small arms employed in civil conflict or by so-called soft threats such as the persistence of extreme poverty, the disparity of income between and within societies, and the spread of infectious diseases, or climate change and environmental degradation.
In truth, we do not have to choose. The United Nations must confront all these threats and challenges, new and old, hard and soft. . . . In fact, all these struggles are linked. We now see, with chilling clarity, that a world where many millions of people endure brutal oppression and extreme misery will never be fully secure, even for its most privileged inhabitants. 
Yet the hard threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are real and cannot be ignored. Terrorism is not a problem only for rich countries. Ask the people of Bali or Bombay, Nairobi or Casablanca. Weapons of mass destruction do not threaten only the western or northern world. Ask the people of Iran or of Halabja in Iraq.
Where we disagree, it seems, is on how to respond to these threats. Since this organization was founded, states have generally sought to deal with threats to the peace through containment and deterrence, by a system based on collective security and the United Nations Charter.
Article 51 of the Charter prescribes that all states, if attacked, retain the inherent right of self-defense. But until now, it has been understood that when states go beyond that and decide to use force to deal with broader threats to international peace and security, they need the unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations.
Now some say this understanding is no longer tenable, since an armed attack with weapons of mass destruction could be launched at any time without warning or by a clandestine group. Rather than wait for that to happen, they argue, states have the right and obligation to use force pre-emptively. . . . It is not enough to denounce unilateralism, unless we also face up squarely to the concerns that make some states feel uniquely vulnerable, since it is those concerns that drive them to take unilateral action. We must show that those concerns can, and will, be addressed effectively through collective action.
Excellencies, we have come to a fork in the road. This may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded. . . . 
The Council needs to consider how it will deal with the possibility that individual states may use force pre-emptively against perceived threats. Its members may need to begin a discussion on the criteria for an early authorization of coercive measures to address certain types of threats, for instance, terrorist groups armed with weapons of mass destruction. And they still need to engage in serious discussions of the best way to respond to threats of genocide or other comparable massive violations of human rights, an issue which I raised myself from this podium in 1999. Once again this year, our collective response to events of this type in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia has been hesitant and tardy.

By Jacques Chirac
The United Nations has just weathered one of the gravest trials in its history. The debate turned on respect for the Charter and the use of force. The war, embarked on without Security Council approval, has undermined the multilateral system.
Having taken stock of this crisis, our organization can now resume its onward march. For it is above all in this forum, which is the crucible of the international order, that it behooves us to exercise our responsibilities to the world of today and to future generations. . . . 
Multilateralism is the key, for it ensures the participation of all in the management of world affairs. It is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy, especially in matters regarding the use of force or laying down universal norms. . . . 
In Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, who must have sole responsibility for their future, is essential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the United Nations to give legitimacy to this process. 
It is also up to the United Nations to assist with the gradual transfer of administrative and economic responsibilities to the present Iraqi institutions according to a realistic timetable and to help the Iraqis draft a constitution and hold elections. 
Lastly, it is up to the United Nations to give a mandate to a multinational force, commanded naturally by the main troop contributor, in order to ensure the security of Iraq and all those helping with the country's reconstruction.
In this way, the international community and the Iraqi people, united around a common project, will together end the tragic decades of this great country's history. . . . 
The fight against international terrorism is another key challenge. This is well in hand, under Security Council auspices and within the framework of our various treaties. 
Our determination is rooted in the horror of Sept. 11. The threat goes to the very heart of our democracies and societies. We are using force to combat terrorism, but that is not enough. It will return over and over if we allow extremism and fanaticism to flourish, if we fail to realize that it uses the world's unresolved conflicts and imbalances as its justification.
In the face of proliferating weapons of mass destruction, we reject all faits accomplis. 
We must stand united in ensuring the universality of treaties and the effectiveness of nonproliferation regimes. We must strengthen our means of action in order to ensure compliance. 
France has proposed the creation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the authority of the Security Council. We need to give fresh impetus to this policy. Let us call a summit meeting of the Security Council to frame a genuine United Nations action plan against proliferation. . . . 
In order to fulfill the missions entrusted to it and remedy some of its blatant shortcomings, the United Nations must change. Democracy, authority and efficacy must be our watchwords. Progress has been made, thanks to the secretary general, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to the member states to take matters forward without delay and to put an end to the damage caused by the stalemate over reforms.
The United Nations suffers from the current weakness of the General Assembly. Yet that is where debate on solutions to the world's great problems should take place and consensus be forged. A culture of confrontation must give way to a culture of action, aimed at achieving our common goals.
Chief responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lies with the Security Council. It is therefore essential to its legitimacy that its membership reflect the state of the world. It must be enlarged to include new permanent members, for it needs the presence of major countries. France is thinking, naturally, of Germany and Japan, but also of some leading countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It needs additional elected countries, as well, in order to make the Council more representative still. . . . This reform should be accompanied by a strengthening of the Council's authority. 
It is the role of the Council to set the bounds to the use of force. No one is entitled to arrogate to himself the right to utilize it unilaterally and preventively.
Conversely, in the face of mounting threats, states must have an assurance that the Council has appropriate means of evaluation and collective action at its disposal, and that it has the will to act. . . . 
Ladies and gentlemen, against the risk of a world without order delivered up to violence, let us work to establish one governed by the rule of law.
Against the injustice and suffering of a world of ever-widening inequalities -- even though it has never been as rich as it is today -- let us choose solidarity.
Against the chaos of a world shaken by ecological disaster, let us call for a sharing of responsibility, around a United Nations Environmental Organization.
Against the barbarity of a world in which fundamental rights are trampled on, where the integrity of mankind is under threat, where native peoples -- the heirs to an irreplaceable heritage -- vanish amid silence and indifference, let us uphold the demands of ethics.

HEADLINE: Dean Takes The Offensive In Comments On Clark 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN with EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Howard Dean, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has been built on an antiwar message, yesterday questioned the antiwar credentials of his newest opponent, Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
 Dr. Dean, who himself has been accused by rivals of flip-flopping on issues, focused on remarks General Clark made last week when, in interviews, he first said that he probably would have voted for the Congressional resolution authorizing war in Iraq and then, the following day, was led to backtrack. 
 "I was shocked" by General Clark's initial comment on the resolution, Dr. Dean, former governor of Vermont, said in an interview as he flew from a rally in Boston to a series of fund-raisers in New York. "I was even more shocked that he switched the next day."
"He still has to clarify his position," the candidate added.
Dr. Dean, who had met several times with General Clark to discuss national security, spoke after a week in which the retired NATO commander's entry into the crowded race largely eclipsed the former governor's summer surge.
Though raising questions about his new rival, Dr. Dean largely stuck yesterday to the tactics that had attracted a great deal of support, intensifying his attack on President Bush. He drew laughs from a noontime crowd of about 3,000 at Copley Square in Boston when he said that before the American Revolution, "there was a king named George who had forgotten his own people in favor of special interests."
"What's at stake in this election is democracy itself," he said. "James Madison and Thomas Jefferson spoke of the fear that economic power would one day seize political power. That fear has been realized in this administration."
Dr. Dean used the language of the Constitution's preamble to condemn the president's record on court appointments, race, education, domestic security and the war on terrorism. "This democracy and the flag of the United States," he then said, "do not belong to Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Falwell and Tom DeLay and John Ashcroft and Dick Cheney."
Though in the home state of a second Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry, he made no mention of him.
The speech followed suggestions by three national polls that after a week of saturation news coverage, General Clark had moved at least for now to the top of the 10-member Democratic presidential field.
For his part, the general focused yesterday on Mr. Bush and Iraq.
"I've been against the war from the beginning," he told reporters in Indiana, where he later addressed students at DePauw University.
"I never saw the imminent threat in Iraq, and I think the president failed to really make the case of the imminent threat," he said. "I think the facts on the ground show there wasn't an imminent threat, and I think this is the whole undercurrent which has made it so difficult for him to receive the kind of assistance he and we would like to have from the international community."
Then, in his visit to DePauw last night, General Clark told students that the United States needed "a new strategy for dealing with the world and a new strategy at home." He also said his young campaign had already raised $1 million.
If General Clark's candidacy took the harsh spotlight off Dr. Dean last week, the onetime governor has continued to be a chief object of criticism by his Democratic rivals. Yesterday, aides to Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri circulated a newspaper article highlighting Dr. Dean's comment that a "white male president can talk to whites about racism, and a white male president can talk to men about domestic violence better than a woman who is a victim."
Tricia Enright, Dr. Dean's communications director, noted that he had made that remark during a meeting of women's advocates, and said of the Edwards-Gephardt tactic, "I don't know whether this is more offensive or pathetic."
"He's saying, you know, race is a white person's problem, too, and domestic violence is a man's problem, too," she said. "What he's saying is you have a responsibility as president to use the bully pulpit to talk about these issues, as tough and difficult as they are."

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Plans to Urge U.S. to Reconsider Its Food Policies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 

 BODY:
Jacques Diouf, the director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, dedicated to helping solve the world's hunger problems, knows he has a hard sell on Capitol Hill.
 Mr. Diouf is here on a visit from his Rome headquarters, trying to keep alive the issues that stalled trade talks in Cancun, Mexico, last week. Like many at the talks, he wants Congress and the administration to reconsider the nation's annual $22 billion in farm subsidies, which make it hard for farmers in poorer countries to compete. 
 But he also wants to make a separate, difficult point: that the United States' generosity with food aid sometimes undermines countries' abilities to feed themselves.
The United States provides 41 percent of the food aid distributed by the United Nations. But in an interview at his agency's Washington offices, Mr. Diouf said hunger could be better fought if money were spent to help poor farmers dig wells and canals for irrigation and lay better roads to bring crops to market. 
"Giving money to farmers before a crisis is better than giving food after the crisis hits," he said.
In the last 15 years, as rich countries increased their subsidies to their farmers and slashed aid to the world's poorest farmers, poor countries have gone from net exporters of food to net importers. With 70 percent of poor countries' populations dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods, the change has helped fuel a rise in malnutrition. In places like sub-Saharan Africa, one out of three people suffer chronic hunger.
Mr. Diouf will meet with officials including Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development; and Ann M. Veneman, secretary of agriculture.
But there is no immediate legislation before Congress, and both Republican and Democratic politicians are publicly rejecting much of the criticism leveled at the United States by the developing nations at Cancun. With the 2004 election on their minds, many lawmakers said they were disinclined to question the subsidies.
Mr. Diouf, an agricultural economist, said he would remind the lawmakers of the cold war era, when presidents like Ronald Reagan spent as much as $1.3 billion every year to help farmers around the world. Today, the United States gives some $400 million to that effort.
But the resistance to his various messages may be high. At a Congressional hearing today, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said he saw a bigger problem in tariffs imposed on imports by some poor countries, which make the exports of other poor countries less affordable.
"The vast bulk of market access barriers faced by farmers in developing countries are imposed by other developing countries," he said.

As More Markets Go Public, Salaries Are Under Scrutiny

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
By the standards of the New York Stock Exchange, James J. McNulty, the president and chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, does not have an outsized salary. It was slightly less than $1.9 million last year.
 But when his stock options are added, his total potential compensation is many times larger. 
 At yesterday's closing price of $70.25, his exercisable options on the shares of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings, which recently went public, were worth $69 million. Add the options he holds that cannot be exercised yet and the total value climbs to $86 million. 
Mr. McNulty's options, granted when he was hired in February 2000, indicate the potential for individual profit at other exchanges that are moving toward going public or considering the possibility, as the New York Stock Exchange is.
The question is whether other exchanges, which perform regulatory functions like trading oversight and arbitration, can be as generous as the Mercantile Exchange, given the scrutiny generated by the compensation furor at the Big Board.
Some new focus may also fall on the American Stock Exchange. An official who has seen some details of the compensation for Salvatore Sodano, its chairman and chief executive, said late last night that Mr. Sodano was paid about $5 million last year. His package includes a pension, deferred compensation and a severance agreement that totals about $22 million.
One exchange that is taking steps toward going public, the Chicago Board of Trade, appears so far to have decided not to give its top five executives stock options or shares in the proposed public company, judging by the most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The current top executive's pay is actually a little bit less than the No. 2 executive's, and only half that of his predecessor, whose contract also entitles him to stock in the C.B.O.T. if it goes public.
Constantine Papadakis, chairman of the compensation committee at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and president of Drexel University, said that he thought this was a "new era" for stock options.
"I don't object, but at the same time I have to be convinced that we add value," he said when asked about granting options to the Philadelphia exchange's top executives. The Philadelphia exchange is planning to go public.
Paul Hodgson, senior research associate for the Corporate Library, said he did not think other exchanges would be able to match the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "The Mercantile Exchange has put the spotlight on them now," he said, "so they won't be able to slip it through."
Outside of the Big Board and the American Stock Exchange, base salary levels do not seem to be a major issue. But not all of the exchanges have disclosed the compensation of their executives in the past.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades futures contracts on interest rates, indexes, currencies and commodities, must disclose executive pay now that it is public. The Chicago Board of Trade, also a futures exchange, has begun disclosure before going public.
Meyer S. Frucher, chairman and chief operating officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which trades stocks and equity, index and currency options, disclosed his compensation when asked by a reporter.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, which trades options on stocks and stock indexes, declined to release compensation data; so did the International Securities Exchange, which trades options electronically. The Pacific Stock Exchange, which trades options on stocks, had not provided compensation information by late yesterday.
The American Stock Exchange was in the process of arranging the regular disclosure of compensation as the information on Mr. Sodano's compensation surfaced. The exchange's place in the market, which is closer to that of the other exchanges than the Big Board, may add to criticism on the compensation. Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the Big Board had total compensation of $12 million in 2002, after a $30.6 million payout in 2001. Mr. Grasso resigned after his $139.5 million deferred-compensation package drew heavy criticism.
Mr. Frucher of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was paid a salary of $600,000 in 2002, the same as his predecessor. Healso received a $300,000 bonus, the largest of his tenure so far. In addition, the board gave him a $600,000 loan, which is being forgiven at $200,000 a year in an effort to retain him, Mr. Papadakis, the compensation committee chairman, said.
"After he has read all the news about Grasso, he will probably ask for a raise," Mr. Papadakis joked. 
Bernard W. Dan, president and chief executive of Chicago Board of Trade Holdings, was paid a salary of $422,051 in 2002, with a bonus and other compensation that brought his total to $891,121. The executive vice president and chief of staff, Carol A. Burke, got total compensation of $908,788. Mr. Dan's predecessor, David J. Vitale, was paid $1,779,459 in salary and bonus in 2001, according to regulatory filings; the value of the stock he is entitled to receive in a publicly owned C.B.O.T. will not be known until the exchange gets to the point of actually going public.
One reason for the difference is that Mr. Vitale had been recruited from outside the exchange, while Mr. Dan was promoted from within.
Mr. McNulty, who is leaving the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at the end of the year, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. She did note that the market value of the exchange had jumped to $3.1 billion from $900 million during his tenure.
Four other top executives at the exchange also hold options, now worth a total of $7 million each, with $2.8 million of that exercisable now, according to regulatory filings.
"Giving that many options to Mr. McNulty is a board problem," said Scott C. Newquist, president of Board Governance Services. "It is up to the board to explain what incremental value the exchange is getting by paying McNulty $50 million instead of $10 million."

Procter & Gamble bets that men will buy a car wash called Mr. Clean.

BYLINE:  By Claudia Deutsch 

 BODY:
WILL macho guys use their mamas' Mr. Clean to wash their muscle cars?
 Procter & Gamble sure hopes so. The consumer products powerhouse is no longer content to bolster Mr. Clean, the 45-year-old brand of liquid cleanser, with garden-variety extensions like new scents and wipes, nor with simply licensing the name for merchandise like gloves and mops sold by other companies. 
 For the first time in decades, Procter is putting the bald character's imprimatur on new Mr. Clean products of its own: Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, for removing crayon marks from walls and scuff marks from chair rails, and Mr. Clean Autodry, for leaving a freshly washed car spot-free without hand drying.
The brand-product connection for Magic Eraser is easy to spot: Mr. Clean has always sold mainly to women, and that is the market Magic Eraser is chasing.
But cars? Cars driven by men? Men described by Marc Stoiber, executive creative director at the Toronto office of Grey Worldwide Canada, the unit of the Grey Global Group that is developing both campaigns, as "the Nascar crowd, who love drag races and chrome and squealing tires and hoods they can see their reflection in"? 
You may think that conventional wisdom would say no, but Robert D. Gilbreath, brand manager for Mr. Clean North America at Procter in Cincinnati, insists that the research dictates yes.
"We tested made-up names, we tested Dawn, and in every test, guys said that Mr. Clean was the name they'd trust most," Mr. Gilbreath said. Dawn, a Procter dishwashing liquid, is already used by many people to wash cars. 
Mr. Stoiber said he thought he knew the secret: "Mr. Clean may be smiling and approachable, but come on, look at the muscles on that guy."
Procter is certainly putting marketing muscle behind Mr. Clean, with a marketing budget triple that of last year, when it spent $24.3 million to advertise the brand in major media, according to the TNS Media Intelligence/CMR division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
Analysts are not surprised by the higher spending. "Mr. Clean isn't a mission-critical brand for a $48 billion company like Procter, but its name and image resonates with consumers," said William H. Steele, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. "It's a real opportunity brand, one that has legs."
The new push for Mr. Clean is a logical outgrowth of a Procter effort to slough off brands that have little prospect for growth, and focus attention on the rest, particularly those with sales exceeding $1 billion a year, like Crest, Pampers and Tide.
Procter sold Comet and Spic and Span, two profitable but aging cleaning products that "we just didn't think we could take farther," Mr. Gilbreath said. It introduced Swiffer, a hybrid broom-mop that cleans floors with disposable wipes, and for a time the company considered using that brand on Autodry. But research showed that, unlike Swiffer, Mr. Clean was more than a brand. "He's an icon," Mr. Gilbreath said, "and we'd underestimated his power."
The new products have vastly different roots. Magic Eraser is Procter's version of a cleaning product that some company executives saw in use in Japan. (Alan S. Goldstein, manager of research and development for Mr. Clean, said there were no patent infringement issues.) 
Procter seems convinced that acceptance will be easy, and its marketing, based around the theme "It's magic," is almost minimalist. There will be six $1-off coupons in newspaper inserts. A print ad meant to resemble an old-time magic-show poster is headlined, "And for my next trick I'll make this mark disappear."
A television commercial, to start running next Wednesday, shows a frustrated mother trying to rub crayon stains off a wall. Mr. Clean materializes next to her, demonstrates how easily Magic Eraser does the job -- and watches her mark the wall with crayon, just so she can rub it off again.
Suggested prices for Magic Eraser, which is already in stores, are $2.19 for a package of two and $4.19 for four. Procter expects $30 million to $40 million in sales in its first full year, Mr. Gilbreath said.
Autodry, a homegrown product that took more than three years to develop, will pull in $100 million in its first year, Mr. Gilbreath predicted. Not surprisingly, Procter is putting a lot more effort and money behind it.
The product attaches to a garden hose and uses special soaps and filters to keep water from beading on car surfaces. A starter kit, good for about three washes, is intended to retail for about $19.99. Soap and filter refills will go for $4.99 each.
Mr. Gilbreath conceded that all auto-wash products claim to leave no spots, so he said he turned to colleagues at Procter's Old Spice division to find out how to dispel healthy male skepticism. The Old Spice answer: endorsements, guarantees, race cars and technology.
Autodry's marketing stresses those points. The product package includes the logo of Pur, Procter's brand of water filter, as well as a "Motor Trend approved" logo -- the automotive equivalent of a Good Housekeeping seal. Procter is offering a one-year money-back guarantee.
Although Autodry will not be shipped to retailers until January, Procter is already running 60-second and 120-second spots on CMT (Country Music Television) and ESPN, which include a toll-free telephone number for orders. Procter is sponsoring a Mr. Clean Autodry race car, to be driven by Wally Dallenbach, a retired Nascar driver turned NBC racing sportscaster.. 
Mr. Clean Autodry is one of eight Procter brands competing for the commercial time the company has bought during Super Bowl XXXVIII on Jan. 25, the trade publication Ad Age reported this week. Also, an Autodry commercial will probably run in conjunction with the Busch Series Nascar race at Daytona Speedway, held the day before the Daytona 500 in February.
The full campaign, to start running in March, will include print ads in magazines as well as TV ads. "Our target is the car aficionado and gadget lover, and we figure the message will trickle down from them to the average dads who wash their car," Mr. Stoiber said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Remains Leader in Global Arms Sales, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The United States maintained its dominance in the international arms market last year, especially in sales to developing nations, according to a new Congressional report.
 The United States was the leader in total worldwide sales in 2002, with about $13.3 billion, or 45.5 percent of global conventional weapons deals, a rise from $12.1 billion in 2001. Of that, $8.6 billion was to developing nations, or about 48.6 percent of conventional arms deals concluded with developing nations last year, according to the report. 
 Russia was second in sales to the developing world last year, with $5 billion, followed by France with $1 billion. 
While the report focuses on sales and deliveries of conventional weapons from the industrialized world to poorer nations, it also offers a glimpse into such issues as missile proliferation by North Korea and foreign weapons transfers to Iraq.
The new report, "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1995-2002," was sent to the House and Senate this week by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. The annual study, written by Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in national defense at the research service, is considered the most authoritative resource available to the public on worldwide weapons sales.
From 1999 to 2002, there were no deliveries of surface-to-surface missiles to the Middle East from arms makers in the United States, Russia, China or Europe, the report said.
But the study says 60 surface-to-surface missiles were delivered to the Middle East by nations in the category "All Others," which includes such suppliers as Israel, South Africa and North Korea.
United States officials, both military and civilian, said today that North Korea was the source of the surface-to-surface missile deliveries listed in the report, and of 10 anti-ship missiles delivered to the Middle East in that period.
President Bush has increased public pressure on North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programs, and the administration is organizing a number of joint military exercises to train for the interdiction of possible shipments. The goal of these exercises is to make it more difficult to transmit components of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons -- and the missiles to deliver them.
But difficulties in halting North Korea's missile trade were evident in December, when a North Korean cargo vessel that was not flying a flag was halted off the Horn of Africa by two Spanish warships.
A search revealed 15 Scud missiles hidden beneath the cargo. But the vessel was eventually allowed to sail on with the missiles to its destination in Yemen after officials conceded that neither North Korea nor Yemen had violated any treaties.
In addition to the shipment to Yemen, North Korea is suspected of selling missile technology to Iran and others, Pentagon officials said.
The study says that none of the major arms makers delivered weapons to Iraq from 1999 to 2002 -- or at least not in amounts of more than $50 million, the lowest sales amount included in the study.
But a category of nations labeled "All Other European," which includes formerly Communist states in Central and Eastern Europe, delivered about $100 million worth of weapons to Iraq from 1999 to 2002, although the report does not specify the source of the deliveries.
Ukraine is believed by American officials to have sold an advanced Kolchuga radar system to Iraq, Pentagon officials said.
Arms deals with developing nations in 2002 totaled $17.7 billion, more than the $16.2 billion for 2001 but the second-lowest total for the years 1995 to 2002. (The report measures sales and deliveries in dollar totals adjusted for inflation, called "constant 2002 dollars.")
"Many developing nations have curtailed their expenditures on weaponry primarily due to their limited financial resources," Mr. Grimmett wrote in the report. "To meet their military requirements, in current circumstances, a number of developing nations have placed a greater emphasis on upgrading existing weapons systems while deferring purchases of new and costlier ones."
Total arms transfer agreements reached nearly $29.2 billion in 2002, a decrease from 2001 and the second year in a row that total arms sales dropped, according to the study.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: ALLIES; 
Mongolians Return to Baghdad, This Time as Peacekeepers

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
In 1258, the Mongol general Hulegu, a grandson of Genghis Khan, sacked Baghdad, killing 800,000 people and ending its primacy as the largest city in the Arab world.
 This month, the Mongolians returned to Iraq. Ferried into the country on American military transports, 180 Mongolian Army soldiers -- all male, all volunteers -- are guarding pipelines and working on construction projects under a Polish command. 
 "This is not like the 13th century," Col. B. Erkhenbayar, commander of Mongolia's Peacekeeping Operation Battalion, said here, smiling so widely his eyes disappeared. "Then, we went to invade. This time, we are going to build Iraq." 
In the Bush administration's roster of 34 nations serving in Iraq in the American-led "coalition of the willing" about half are formerly Communist countries like Mongolia. Like many other normally overlooked nations that have sent soldiers to Iraq, Mongolia did so more out of geopolitics than concern for Iraq. Mongolia's offer of troops surprised the American government because it had not asked Mongolia for help, said Steven R. Saunders, president of a private, Washington-based group promoting business ties with Mongolia.
Around this dusty city with its Cyrillic character signs left over from the Soviet era, Mongolians talk of supporting democracy in Iraq, of bolstering geopolitical ties with the United States and of returning their nation's long-eclipsed name to the world stage.
Mongolia is the only nation in Northeast Asia where there is widespread support for sending troops to Iraq: Russia glowers, China appears neutral and Japan has approved the sending of troops but begs for more time. South Korea has 650 military medics and engineers in Iraq, sent despite violent public protests. Now, in the face of American demands for combat-trained troops, South Korea is sending a study group.
Slightly more than a decade after the departure of the last Soviet troops here, democracy is not an abstraction for Mongolia. Last summer, Tibetan Buddhist priests working at a monastery here disinterred the remains of about 600 lamas, or high priests, each buried with his hands tied behind his back and a bullet hole in the skull. They were killed in 1937 by Mongolian Communists in an effort by Stalin to stamp out Mongolia's historic religion.
"Words are not enough to fight with terrorism," Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia said in an interview last week, fresh from welcoming delegates from 118 countries classified as new or restored democracies.
Mongolia is rapidly embracing the United States in an effort to develop a balance to its historically dangerous neighbors, China and Russia. Twice the size of Texas, but with only 2.4 million people, this land of nomadic herders has a deep, if rarely voiced, fear of becoming another Tibet. After centuries of Chinese rule, Mongolia won independence only in 1921 with Soviet support.
Gen. T. Togoo, chief of staff of the Mongolian armed forces, noted that, historically, Mongolia won breathing space by pitting neighbors against each other. As he spoke, rap music from the Voice of America radio filtered through his Soviet-built headquarters.
At the training ground for the peacekeeping unit, the rear window of a Soviet-made jeep carried two fresh stickers in red and gold: "Semper Fi" and "USMC," souvenirs from 50 United States marines who left last week after leading a training exercise.
"Even though our country is locked between China and Russia, the biggest countries in the world, we should not restrict our relations," Colonel Erkhenbayar said in his second- floor office, decorated with photos, patches, and medals from nearly a decade of contacts with American military forces. "America could be our first neighbor, the way it is for Poland."
The Mongolian efforts appear to be paying dividends. "They were one of the first nations to sign up to send peacekeepers to Iraq," Pamela J. H. Slutz, the American ambassador here, said in an interview. "That has created enormous good will in Washington. For us it was also a prime example of the utility and success of our military assistance program."
The United States has provided the Mongolian military with peacekeeping training, English lessons and, for the Chinese border area, patrol radios and engineering work.
According to foreign mining company employees who work in the Gobi Desert border areas, this "engineering work" seems to involve installing electronic surveillance equipment to monitor North Korea and the Lop Nor nuclear testing site in China, which is just across Mongolia's western border.
American Embassy officials here declined to comment on these reports.
In addition, the United States is advising Mongolia on how to reshape its military for the post-Soviet era. Over the last 20 years, Mongolia's military has shrunk by two-thirds, to about 15,000 today. Last year, a law took effect defining the military's primary missions as border patrol, disaster relief and participation in international peacekeeping missions.
By sending troops to Iraq, Mongolia hopes to win powerful friends for a small nation that is often confused with Inner Mongolia, the neighboring Chinese province.
"Now," said Col. Gurin Ragchaa, a military spokesman, "everyone will know where Mongolia is."
"We are squeezed between two superpowers, so having an army is not enough," Prime Minister Enkhbayar said in English honed at the London School of Economics and Americanized in trips to Washington. "We have to secure our sovereignty and independence through diplomatic measures, economic measures, international organizations."
Two weeks ago, as the last Mongolian soldiers arrived in Iraq, Mongolia, whose trade with the United States was only $180 million last year, formally proposed to Washington a free trade pact.
"Negotiations could be concluded in one weekend," Mr. Saunders said over a pineapple pizza lunch at the California Restaurant, one of the latest American cultural imitations here. "It would have not any economic impact on the U.S. In one year, the U.S. trades less with Mongolia than what it trades with Taiwan in 12 hours."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 25 about the arrival of Mongolian peacekeeping troops on American transports to serve in Iraq misstated the number of people killed by the armies of the general Hulegu in a past Mongol operation -- the sacking of Baghdad in 1258. Historians generally agree that it was 80,000, not 800,000.

HEADLINE: Connect The Dots 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The U.S. war on terrorism suffered a huge blow last week -- not in Baghdad or Kabul, but on the beaches of Cancun.
 Cancun was the site of the latest world trade talks, which fell apart largely because the U.S., the E.U. and Japan refused to give up the lavish subsidies they bestow on their farmers, making the prices of their cotton and agriculture so cheap that developing countries can't compete. This is a disaster because exporting food and textiles is the only way for most developing countries to grow. The Economist quoted a World Bank study that said a Cancun agreement, reducing tariffs and agrisubsidies, could have raised global income by $500 billion a year by 2015 -- over 60 percent of which would go to poor countries and pull 144 million people out of poverty. 
 Sure, poverty doesn't cause terrorism -- no one is killing for a raise. But poverty is great for the terrorism business because poverty creates humiliation and stifled aspirations and forces many people to leave their traditional farms to join the alienated urban poor in the cities -- all conditions that spawn terrorists.
I would bet any amount of money, though, that when it came to deciding the Bush team's position at Cancun, no thought was given to its impact on the war on terrorism. Wouldn't it have been wise for the U.S. to take the initiative at Cancun, and offer to reduce our farm subsidies and textile tariffs, so some of the poorest countries, like Pakistan and Egypt, could raise their standards of living and sense of dignity, and also become better customers for U.S. goods? Yes, but that would be bad politics. It would mean asking U.S. farmers to sacrifice the ridiculous subsidies they get from our federal government ($3 billion a year for 25,000 cotton farmers) that make it impossible for foreign farmers to sell here.
And one thing we know about this Bush war on terrorism: sacrifice is only for Army reservists and full-time soldiers. For the rest of us, it's guns and butter. When it comes to the police and military sides of the war on terrorism, the Bushies behave like Viking warriors. But when it comes to the political and economic sacrifices and strategies that are also required to fight this war successfully, they are cowardly wimps. That is why our war on terrorism is so one-dimensional and Pentagon-centric. It's more like a hobby -- something we do only until it runs into the Bush re-election agenda.
"If the sons of American janitors can go die in Iraq to keep us safe," says Robert Wright, author of "Nonzero," a book on global interdependence, "then American cotton farmers, whose average net worth is nearly $1 million, can give up their subsidies to keep us safe. Opening our markets to farm products and textiles would be critical to drawing many nations -- including Muslim ones -- more deeply into the interdependent web of global capitalism and ultimately democracy."
The U.S. and Europe, argues Clyde Prestowitz, the trade expert and author of "Rogue Nation," should actually shrink their farm subsidies unilaterally, even if developing countries don't immediately reciprocate.
"Such a move is essential," wrote Mr. Prestowitz on the YaleGlobal Web site, "not only as a matter of providing a badly needed boost to developing countries, but also because the failure of Cancun poses a serious threat to the main hope of generating the economic growth necessary to lift developing countries out of poverty."
If only the Bush team connected the dots, it would see what a nutty war on terrorism it is fighting, explains Mr. Prestowitz. Here, he says, is the Bush war on terrorism: Preach free trade, but don't deliver on it, so Pakistani farmers become more impoverished. Then ask Congress to give a tax break for any American who wants to buy a gas-guzzling Humvee for business use and also ask Congress to resist any efforts to make Detroit increase gasoline mileage in new cars. All this means more U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia.
So then the Saudis have more dollars to give to their Wahhabi fundamentalist evangelists, who spend it by building religious schools in Pakistan. The Pakistani farmer we've put out of business with our farm subsidies then sends his sons to the Wahhabi school because it is tuition-free and offers a hot lunch. His sons grow up getting only a Koranic education, so they are totally unprepared for modernity, but they are taught one thing: that America is the source of all their troubles. One of the farmer's sons joins Al Qaeda and is killed in Afghanistan by U.S. Special Forces, and we think we're winning the war on terrorism.
Fat chance.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Plunge After OPEC Decides to Cut Oil Production

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest one-day point loss in nearly 15 months yesterday after the surprise decision by OPEC to cut oil production sent stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones industrials plunged 150 points.
 News that oil producers were lowering their output starting in November exacerbated a sell-off that was already under way. But analysts still attributed much of the downturn to the market being vulnerable, especially in technology, to selling after its six-month rally. 
 "You are coming to the end of the quarter and people are a little worried that prices might be extended. To see some profit taking at the end of the quarter is no surprise," said Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla.
Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Wachovia Securities, agreed. He said many market watchers had been wondering when stocks would really pull back, because recent downturns have been short-lived and replaced by more buying.
"You are overextended, overbought, overdone. You have no juice left on the upside," said Mr. Wachtel, who called the OPEC news "an excuse" for investors to cash in some gains.
The Nasdaq lost 58.02 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 1,843.70. The last time the Nasdaq had a larger one-day loss was July 1, 2002, when it shed 59.41 points, to close at 1,403.80.
Other major gauges had their biggest losses in just over four months. The Dow fell 150.53 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,425.51. The Dow has not had a bigger one-day point drop since May 19, when it lost 185.58 points to finish at 8,493.39.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 19.65 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,009.38. The last time the S.& P. had a larger one-day point loss was also May 19, when it gave back 23.53 points to close at 920.77.
Investors are becoming more wary of making bigger commitments to stocks, wondering if prices are too high given six months of rallies and if third-quarter and yearly earnings will be good enough to support Wall Street's gains.
Trepidation increased after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that it would cut oil production 3.5 percent beginning in November, an unexpected move that caused Wall Street to worry that higher energy prices would undermine the economic recovery and corporate profits. OPEC produces about a third of the world's crude oil.
Technology was the weakest area yesterday. Analysts said that was simply because investors had been doing the most buying in high-tech since the rally began in March.
Among the technology losers, Microsoft fell $1.14, to $28.46; Intel dropped $1.16, to $27.78; and Cisco Systems declined 83 cents, to $20.32.
Media stocks also contributed to losses after Viacom, owner of CBS and MTV, cut its full-year earnings forecast, saying local advertising did not increase as much as had been anticipated. Class B shares of Viacom fell $1.44, to $38.83. Also hurt were Walt Disney, which was down 39 cents at $19.81, and AOL Time Warner, which dipped 47 cents, to $15.76.
Among gainers, J. M. Smucker climbed $1.81, to $43.58, after Deutsche Securities raised its recommendation on the food maker to buy from hold.
Treasury bond prices gained. The benchmark 10-year note rose 17/32, to a price of 100 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.14 percent from 4.21 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond climbed 28/32, to 105 2/32. Its yield fell to 5.04 percent from 5.09 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a two-year note:

HEADLINE: South African Leader Defends Delay in Offering AIDS Drugs 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa yesterday defended his government's delay in distributing anti-AIDS drugs until this year, saying that it had been necessary to create a critical mass of public health care workers who knew how to instruct patients on the drugs' use.
 "It's incorrect merely to say: 'Distribute anti-retroviral drugs, problem solved,' " he said. "It can't be correct. It isn't. You've got to come at it in a more comprehensive way. 
 "The assumption in a country like the United States," he added, is "of a health infrastructure and system that is as good as here."
President Mbeki has been widely criticized in recent years for his willingness to consult scientists who argue that there is no proof that human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS. South Africa is one of seven African countries with H.I.V. infection rates of more than 20 percent, according to a new United Nations population report. 
The report projects the country's population in the year 2050 at 9 percent below the 2000 level of 44 million, and 44 percent lower than it would have been had there been no epidemic. 
In an interview with The New York Times yesterday at his hotel, President Mbeki, who was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly session, also said he was waiting for the report of a panel of scientists appointed three years ago before forming an opinion about why AIDS had spread so rapidly and how best to combat it. 
The half-hour interview covered topics like AIDS, trade relations and Mr. Mbeki's view of Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe. 
Mr. Mbeki said he had been urging Mr. Mugabe, whose suppression of the news media and forcible expropriation of farms belonging to white landowners have made him one of the most criticized leaders on the African continent, to meet with his political opponents. "The political problems and conflicts they've experienced, I think they'll get over that," he said. "Then they have to attend to the economic challenges."

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Rights Drive Starts 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Ninety immigrants and supporters left their buses and marched outside the Roman Catholic cathedral here today, carrying foot-high crosses to commemorate people from south of the border who died in the desert as they sought a better life in the United States.
 At St. Augustine Cathedral, the immigrants were greeted by more than 400 parishioners, students and others who marched alongside them and joined in singing, "We Shall Overcome." 
 Outside the cathedral a woman carried a large sign that said "How Many Must Die: Arizona Deaths This Year 146. Change Our Border Policy." 
The ceremony was part of an elaborate spectacle, the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, in which 18 buses carrying hundreds of immigrants are stopping in more than 100 cities to promote immigrants' rights. Inspired by the 1961 freedom rides that sought to integrate buses in the South, the new ride aims to turn immigrants' rights into a new civil rights movement. 
"Then, as now, let the freedom buses roll," the Rev. John M. Fife, pastor of the Southside Presbyterian Church, said in the eucharistic celebration at the cathedral. "Then, as now, vigilantes terrorized and discriminated with guns. Then, as now, there is a moral and ethical issue that must unite church and synagogue and mosque and labor and civil rights and mainstream America in a movement to change the course of history."
As they visit Tucson, Las Vegas, Dallas, Detroit and other cities, the riders are saying the United States needs a more humane immigration policy, one that makes it easier to reunite families, that stops immigrants from dying in the desert, that prevents employers from preying on long-time workers who do not have legal documents. 
The riders hope for nothing less than to move immigrant rights, especially gaining legal status for more than eight million illegal immigrants, to the forefront of legislative and political debates. Leaving from 10 cities, the riders are scheduled to converge on Oct. 1 in Washington to lobby Congress and proceed to Flushing Meadows, Queens, for a giant demonstration on Oct. 4.
"The idea of legalization is very important," said Angelica Soto, a farm worker from Mexico on a bus from Los Angeles. "Legalization is important to stop employers from exploiting workers. It's important to help reunite families. I have a friend who couldn't go to his mother's funeral back in Mexico, because he was worried he'd never be allowed back into the United States."
The two buses that arrived here today left Los Angeles on Tuesday morning after a huge good-bye party. They stopped in Palm Springs, Calif., for a rally and proceeded to Phoenix for a demonstration at the State Capitol where priests, politicians, African-American leaders and union presidents spoke. The buses carry immigrants, some legal and some illegal, from China, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mexico, the Philippines and other countries. 
In the rally in Palm Springs, more than 300 immigrants, parishioners and union members joined the bus riders at Our Lady of Solitude Church. The signs said "Immigrants are today's slaves" and "I cut your grass, I make your bed, I wash your dishes, I pick your fruit. I refuse to be invisible." 
The Rev. Miguel Ceja, a graduate of Stanford University who entered the United States illegally from Mexico at 14 to work on farms, presided over the ceremony as he strummed a guitar.
In a skit that students from Coachella Valley High School performed, Steve Aquino, a senior, said: "I work for minimum wage to put food on your table. But you don't know if I have food on mine." 
Mr. Aquino, whose father is a landscaper, said he wished the ride had occurred years ago. 
"I'm so glad they're here," he said after the skit. "Immigrants work so hard. Too many immigrants don't get paid right for what they do." 
The organizers said they hoped the effort focused President Bush and Congress on expanding immigrants' rights because the issue dropped off the public radar after the Sept. 11 attacks. Before then, the push to reform immigration laws was receiving a serious hearing from Mr. Bush and Congress as President Vicente Fox of Mexico and many immigrant groups pushed the issue.
"Our message of changing immigration laws is a message to Democrats and Republicans as they try to attract Latino voters," the chairwoman of the ride, Maria Elena Durazo, said. "There is hardly a Latino family who doesn't currently or didn't very recently have a family member who was undocumented."
The Congressional Black Caucus, the N.A.A.C.P., the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and other African-American groups back the ride. Not only do those groups see it as a valuable tribute to the 1960's freedom rides and civil rights movement, but they also recognize that the push for immigrants' rights will help immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean.
The main sponsors are immigrant advocacy groups and unions. In urging union leaders and members to rally around the riders, labor is seeking to increase its visibility among the fast growing immigrant population and to convince immigrants that unions can improve their economic lot.
The groups have asked powerful and visible friends, including clergy members of Congress and state senators, to appear with them.
"The vast majority of these people are working, and many of them face unscrupulous employers who take advantage of them," said Antonio Villaraigosa, a Los Angeles City Council member and former mayoral candidate. "We need a humane, sensible immigration policy that takes into account that these people have worked here for years, they pay taxes, their children are living here."
Anti-immigrant groups have denounced the ride, heckled the rallies and sent threatening e-mail messages. 
"There's something almost Orwellian for people violating the laws of the country to go en masse to Congress to demand their rights under the law," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform in Washington. 
The riders want Congress to approve an amnesty for illegal immigrants like the one enacted in 1986. The demonstrators also want stronger protections for immigrant workers, additional visas to reunite families and fewer violations of immigrants' civil liberties.
"I think the people in the United States are fair minded," said Dolores Huerta, a rider who founded the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez. "When you have people who are being oppressed, who are not being paid fairly, whose children suffer, this is not fair, and we have to change that."

HEADLINE: Service Is a Struggle For Virtual Town Halls 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. FITZGERALD

 BODY:
AS the Internet has grown up and consumers have become accustomed to going online for everything from banking to buying movie tickets, cities large and small have joined in by making more municipal services available on the Web.
 The motivation was twofold. Effective municipal Web sites made life easier for citizens, the local governments' main customers. They also saved money by freeing government employees to do other work. 
 But in an era of budget cutbacks and a sputtering economy, many local governments have found themselves forced to hold back on the deployment of "e-government." In states where tax cuts and other factors have led to declines in revenue, aid to cities and towns has been cut, stifling some technology initiatives. 
 "There's been a trickle-down effect," says Cindy Mullan, an information systems manager for the city of St. Paul. Because it is getting less money from Minnesota's state government, St. Paul has delayed buying the centerpiece of its Web initiative, Ms. Mullan said, a content-management system that was expected to improve efficiency by making it easier and faster for city departments to put information on the Internet and to manage it once it was there. "We're moving ahead with pieces of the initiative, but not the biggest part," she said. "It's a frustration. We were hoping to get more timely information out there."
 Still, even as some municipalities scale back, others are pressing ahead with plans to integrate government services more tightly with their Web sites. Chesapeake, Va., created a site (www.cityofchesapeake.net) that allows residents to pay property taxes, peruse real estate assessment values and even watch programming on the city's cable television channel. Although it, too, has suffered a cutback in state budget allocations, Chesapeake has set aside money for its long-range plan to add more services. 
 City officials say their goal is to meet residents' expectations of a steady increase in government services on the Internet and predict that the site, which was developed by the city's information technology staff, will eventually help pay for itself through savings on other labor costs. "We think that once we are a little farther down the road, it is going to take the place of staffing in certain areas," said Mark S. Cox, the city's director of public communications.
 In smaller towns, which lack the potential economies of scale that would justify costly Internet initiatives, officials are nonetheless anxious to offer Web access to registration for recreational activities, permit applications and other mundane activities that would otherwise require a trip to town hall. While some already do provide such e-services, many face insurmountable hurdles to building even basic informational sites. 
 The mayor and board of trustees in Scotia, N.Y., a town of 7,900, recently considered developing a Web site but decided to devote workers' efforts to other priorities. "It takes a lot of time to put a Web site together as well as to maintain it," said Wendy Ashley, the village clerk treasurer. "And we don't have anyone on the staff with the expertise." 
 In some small communities, enthusiastic citizens have pitched in to help hold down the costs of putting the local government on the Internet. In Franklin, Mass., volunteers developed an innovative site (www.franklin.ma.us) that enables town officials, civic groups and teachers to create their own interactive Web pages and to manage the content of the pages themselves. The only cost to the town is a monthly fee of $79 for the Web host, said Les Barnes, the site's volunteer Webmaster. 
 Fran Buchheister, a fourth grade teacher at Oak Street Elementary School in Franklin, is one of many teachers who take advantage of the site. Mrs. Buchheister created an interactive Web site (www.franklin.ma.us/auto/schools/oak/classrooms/buchheister) for her classroom with links to online educational resources and exercises that the students can do in class or at home. By posting homework assignments, vocabulary lessons and parent surveys, she said, the site gives parents quick access to classroom activities and fosters communication.
 "It works better when we work together," Mrs. Buchheister said.
 Setting up and managing the Web pages requires only an Internet-connected computer with a Web browser. The easy-to-use features of the site were programmed by a volunteer, Phil Grove, using Web-site development tools like Active Server Pages, VBScript (a version of Visual Basic) and Microsoft Access.
 Other communities have turned to outside companies for help. George Finch, the city manager of Eastport, Me., which has a population of just 1,640, created a new site (www.eastportme.com) with help from Virtual Town Hall (www.virtualtownhall.net), one of several companies that have developed systems that allow municipal employees without technical expertise to manage the content of a site. (Others are GovOffice, www.govoffice.com, for small to medium-size municipalities, and EzGov, www.ezgov.com, a pioneer in the field that works mainly with larger entities like federal agencies and state and county governments.)
 Eastport's site, which publishes city council agendas, a calendar of events and contact information for city departments, cost the town a $500 setup fee plus $1,200 annually. While the city does not expect to save money with the site, Mr. Finch said, he considers the expense worthwhile. "For us, the Internet is a very valuable tool for keeping the public informed," he said.
 Likewise, in Bozeman, Mont., a town of about 30,000, a Virtual Town Hall module was added to the city's main site to make it easier for city employees to publish documents like the minutes of city commission meetings. The city manager, Clark Johnson, said the site (www.bozeman.net) had reduced some costs and improved efficiency by freeing employees from tasks like answering phones. Over all, however, for most small towns, "Web sites do not save you money," Mr. Johnson said. "If you have forms that get filled out on the Web, you still have to process those forms just as if the person had brought them in to you."
 But the real point, some municipal officials contend, is not whether local governments save money by doing business online. The biggest beneficiaries, they say, are the individuals and businesses who use the systems. "If you look at who is saving money on this, it's probably the customers," said Ms. Mullan, the St. Paul official. "If you put a dollar amount on what their time is worth and you can save them time, then you are saving them money."

HEADLINE: U.S. Income Gap Widening, Study Says; 
<B YL>By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The gap between rich and poor more than doubled from 1979 to 2000, an analysis of government data shows. 
 The gulf is such that the richest 1 percent of Americans in 2000 had more money to spend after taxes than the bottom 40 percent. 
 In 1979, the wealthiest 1 percent had just under half the after-tax income of the poorest 40 percent of Americans, analysis of new data from the Congressional Budget Office shows.
The figures show 2000 as the year of the greatest economic disparity between rich and poor for any year since 1979, the year the budget office began collecting this data, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research organization in Washington that advocates tax and federal spending policies to benefit the poor. It released its analysis on Tuesday. 
The richest 2.8 million Americans had $950 billion after taxes, or 15.5 percent, of the $6.2 trillion economic pie in 2000, Isaac Shapiro, a senior fellow at the center, said. 
The poorest 110 million Americans had less, sharing 14.4 percent of all after tax money.
But the higher incomes of the last decade did not lift all people equally.
In 2000, the top 1 percent of American taxpayers had $862,700 each after taxes, on average, more than triple the $286,300 they had, adjusted for inflation, in 1979.
The bottom 40 percent in 2000 had $21,118 each, up 13 percent from their $18,695 average in 1979.
Mr. Shapiro also analyzed the budget office data in tandem with a recently updated study on income by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization in Cambridge, Mass. The bureau study found that in 2000, the top 1 percent income group had the largest share of before-tax income for any year since 1929.
Mr. Shapiro said that findings from both studies suggested that in 2000, the top 1 percent had the largest share of the nation's total after-tax income since at least 1936 and probably since 1929. Mr. Shapiro emphasized that his combined analysis accounted for the fact that his study used after-tax incomes while the bureau's study used pretax incomes.
Both low- and middle-income people shared in the boom of the 1990's, while in the 1980's the bottom fifth experienced a decline in after-tax income, according to the budget office data analyzed by Mr. Shapiro and Robert Greenstein, director for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The middle fifth had an average after-tax income of $41,900 in 2000, a rise of 15 percent both since 1979 and 1997, indicating a long period of no real economic gains for this group.
"You do have gains across the spectrum from 1997 to 2000," Mr. Shapiro said, "but they are much more dramatic at the top."
The center's analysis said the highest income Americans had grown richer from 1979 to 2000 both from gains in income because of economic prosperity and from tax cuts. Huge gains in executive pay were a significant factor, Mr. Shapiro said.
Federal tax burdens for most Americans had declined over the previous two decades, and not risen as some conservative policy experts have asserted, the center said. Congress enacted tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that were heavily weighted to the top 1 percent, which supporters said would encourage them to invest more to the benefit of all Americans.
From 1979 to 2000, the total federal tax burden for the top 1 percent dropped 3.8 percentage points, but for the middle fifth the decline was only 1.9 percentage points. Tax rates for the poorest fifth declined 1.6 percentage points. 
The top 1 percent pay a quarter of all federal taxes, while the bottom 40 percent pay 6 percent of all federal taxes.

HEADLINE: European Parliament Votes To Limit Software Patents 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The European Parliament agreed today to make sweeping changes to a proposed law on the patenting of software inventions, threatening a fragile compromise reached by the European Commission.
 A majority of members of the European Parliament voted in support of amendments to the bill that would make it harder to register a patent. The amendments tightened up the wording of the bill to make it explicit that no patent, like the one Amazon.com registered for its one-click online shopping method, can be registered in the union. Such patents are known in the industry as business-method patents. 
 The members of Parliament also expressly outlawed patents for algorithms, the mathematical equations in software programs, and they restricted the definition of the sort of software that should be eligible for a patent.
"We have rewritten this law," said Arlene McCarthy, a Socialist Party member of the European Parliament from Britain, who was instrumental in forging the Parliament's position on the law.
"We are sending a clear message that the Parliament wants strict limits on patentability for software," she said, adding that the version of the bill agreed upon today balanced the need for a unionwide legal regime that allows inventors to protect their inventions, with the need to avert a European move toward the more protective patent laws in the United States.
The lobbying effort behind the bill has been intense. Several members of Parliament, including Ms. McCarthy, accused opponents of software patents of being aggressive in promoting their view. 
Open-source and free-software advocates, as well as some economists, have been pushing hard and loud for the bill to be scrapped, arguing that software developers do not need the protection of patents. They argue that software development occurs incrementally, so that by patenting an idea and preventing another engineer from developing that idea further, patent laws put a brake on innovation.
Patents, they contend, pose more of a threat than a help to small companies of software developers. "As a small firm you go unnoticed by the big software makers until you create something really special," said Robert Dewar, president of Ada Core Technologies, a small company that is based in New York.
"Then you start to receive letters from patent lawyers representing big firms that either want to buy a license to your software at a cheap price, or they simply want to drive you out of business so they can pick up your idea for next to nothing in the bankruptcy court after you have been sunk by astronomical legal fees," Mr. Dewar said.
The most vehement opponents to any unionwide software patent law were disappointed by today's vote. The European Parliament "has used this proposal as a Trojan horse to smuggle software patents into the E.U.," said Mercedes Echerer, an Austrian member of Parliament in the Green Party.
But supporters of software patents were also unhappy with the vote today. "The vote is a setback," said Thaddeus Burns, a lawyer with the Brussels office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and a former employee of the United States Patent Office.
"Some of the Parliament's amendments could deprive existing patent holders of their ability to enforce their property rights," he said, adding that such a law might well violate international intellectual property agreements. Mr. Burns said that he did not represent any clients in the software industry.
Roland Louski, head of the legal department of info2clear.com, a small Belgian company that specializes in distributing secure documents, said small companies also need patents to secure financial backing. "If you are a small firm with a brilliant idea which you want to take to market, you need to safeguard your invention," he said. Mr. Louski said he welcomed today's vote as a sensible compromise between competing interests. "It's a wise move," he said.
Ministers of the 15 national governments of the union are likely to challenge the amendments approved in Parliament today. "There will probably need to be some work to be done to reconcile the Parliament and the ministers' positions," said one union diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The European Commission, author of the bill, is also likely to be unhappy with some of the amendments approved by Parliament today. A commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said the commission's original version of the bill is a "good middle ground between the opposing arguments."
The diplomat said the differences in position could be overcome.
"We are all agreed that Europe should not be allowed to register the sort of patents you find in the United States, " he said. "Everyone wants this directive. It isn't impossible to reach agreement here."

HEADLINE: City Unveils Plans to Turn Old Rail Line Into a Park 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration moved ahead yesterday with its plans to transform an abandoned elevated rail line into a 1.6-mile-long park and make it the centerpiece for new commercial and residential developments along the western edge of Chelsea. 
 At a news briefing, city planning officials unveiled a detailed proposal to carve out a special redevelopment district along 10th and 11th Avenues, between West 16th and West 30th Streets. The plan is part of the city's overall effort to encourage and control development on the West Side, Manhattan's most undeveloped area. 
 Zoning there would be changed from manufacturing and commercial uses to allow up to 4,200 units of new housing, primarily along the avenues.
Running through it would be the High Line, a railroad viaduct from the 1930's that extends from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street. Development along the line would be restricted to protect the open views. The plan also restricts development of midblock areas throughout the district to preserve the low-lying warehouses that are home to more than 200 art galleries.
In a concession to those who own land directly under the High Line, the proposal would allow those property owners to sell their air rights -- as much as one million square feet -- to high-rise developments on the avenues. 
Amanda M. Burden, the city's planning director, said the High Line would open up parkland in a part of the city that does not have enough while adding character to a once thriving manufacturing area. 
Members of Manhattan Community Board 4 said, however, that they were concerned about the proposed height of some of the buildings and wanted more assurances that there would be enough housing at prices for lower- and middle-income people. City officials estimate that developers could set aside as much as a quarter of the new units at below market rates. 
"There really are some very good things there, but there are still some glitches," said Lee Compton, co-chairman of the board's Chelsea preservation and planning committee.
City officials will seek comments on their proposal at a public hearing on Oct. 2, and could adopt the special district as early as next fall. The final proposal would have to be approved by the City Council.
The neighborhood has been much coveted by developers in recent years, prompting the city to insist on an overall plan for the area. Much of the discussion has centered on the future of the High Line.
The last boxcar rumbled over the line more than two decades ago, and many New Yorkers have pushed to save the rusty relic. The rail line has even inspired its own group of patrons, the Friends of the High Line, which has enlisted the help of celebrities like Edward Norton to drum up support for preservation efforts. 
Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who keeps a giant color photograph of the railway in his home, has committed to spending more than $15 million over the next four years to transform the High Line into a public space. City officials estimate the project's cost at more than $65 million.
"I'm probably the High Line's biggest supporter," Mr. Miller said. "I've had the opportunity to walk on it, and it's a transforming experience. You see the city in a different way than before."

HEADLINE: Studios Moving To Block Piracy Of FilmsOnline 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
If Hollywood executives have learned anything watching their peers in the music business grapple with online file sharing, it is how not to handle a technological revolution.
 While the major labels in the music industry squabbled among themselves about how best to deal with Internet piracy and failed to develop consumer-friendly ways to buy music online, the movie industry has gone on a coordinated offensive to thwart the free downloading of films before it spins out of control. 
 This summer, night-vision goggles became a familiar fashion accessory for security guards at movie premieres as they searched for people in the audience carrying banned video recorders. The industry's trade association began a nationwide piracy awareness campaign in movie theaters and on television. Studios are aggressively putting electronic watermarks on movie prints so they can determine who is abetting the file sharing. And some movie executives are considering whether to send out early DVD's to Academy Award voters, fearing the films will be distributed online. 
Also, as early as next month the industry will begin promoting a "stealing is bad" message in schools, teaming up with JuniorAchievement on an hourlong class for fifth through ninth graders on the history of copyright law and the evils of online file sharing. The effort includes games like Starving Artist, in which students pretend to be musicians whose work is downloaded free from the Internet, and a crossword puzzle called Surfing for Trouble.
"There is no issue in my life I take as seriously as this," said Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer of the News Corporation, which owns 20th Century Fox. "This is going to be with us for the rest of our careers. But if we remain focused on it, maybe it won't kill us and we won't have to panic."
This is not the first time the studios have battled technological advances they worried they could not control. Back in 1982, Jack Valenti, then as now the head of the movie industry's trade association, said the threat of videocassette recorders to the film industry was like that posed by the Boston Strangler to a woman alone. The studios hope they can find a way to co-opt online movie swapping as profitably as they did the VCR and now the DVD player. Still, many in Hollywood fear that online movie sharing could be the most serious menace to profits so far.
The concern is such that 20 of the film industry's top decision makers, including Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman of the entertainment group at AOL Time Warner, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-founder of Dreamworks SKG, attended a focus group in June at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills. The participants, about 20 college- and high school-age students, quickly and easily downloaded several current hits at the executives' request. Next they confirmed what many already knew. "These kids said they weren't going to stop," Mr. Chernin said.
As a result, in late July the major studios through their lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association of America, began an advertising campaign, with the theme "Movies. They're Worth It." It profiles, among others, a set painter, stuntman and makeup artist. 
The music industry, which began feeling the effects of online sharing four years ago because the relatively small size of music files makes for much quicker downloads, began running national antipiracy ads only last year. Executives lament the delay. "It could have had an impact," said Hilary Rosen, the former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, the music industry's trade group. 
But music executives then were indecisive about how best to tackle online file sharing. "I think the music industry has always resembled feudal warring kingdoms with an underworld edge thrown in," said Martin Kaplan, a former executive at the Walt Disney Company who is now the director of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California, which studies entertainment, business and society. "If you look at Jack Valenti's French cuffs, it is a different culture. Movie executives collaboratively deal with joint enemies at the gate."
Many Hollywood executives say there is still time before free Internet movie swapping takes hold. Internet movie files are still large and unwieldy, taking as much as two hours to download. 
But there is a growing contingent who fear the threat is closer than some in Hollywood want to admit. Already industry analysts suggest there could be as many as 500,000 copies of movies swapped daily. 
Hollywood is cracking down on what a recent study published by AT&T Labs found was the source of a large number of movies on the Internet: movie industry insiders. Now invitations to premieres include a warning about unauthorized copying. While the film is showing, the audience is closely monitored by guards.
Many in the entertainment industry privately say that only fear of reprisals, like the 261 lawsuits filed by the recording industry's lobbying group this month, will stop consumers from sharing files. But to change behavior in the long run, they say, consumers -- particularly younger ones -- have to be educated.
This fall the industry's trade association is joining with Junior Achievement, an organization based in Colorado Springs whose volunteers lecture students from kindergarten through high school on the fundamentals of business, economics and free enterprise. An hourlong lesson plan was created in conjunction with Warner Brothers Entertainment, a unit of AOL Time Warner, and covers the history of copyright, the economic benefits of both the music and movie industries, and the consequences for consumers who violate copyright laws.
Junior Achievement is projecting that the lesson, which will be taught both in school and after school, will be used in 36,000 classrooms nationwide and has the potential of reaching 900,000 students in grades five through nine, or about 10 percent of all students in those grade levels.
In the role-playing activity Starving Artist, for example, groups of students are encouraged to come up with an idea for a musical act, write lyrics and design a CD cover only to be told by a volunteer teacher their work can be downloaded free. According to the lesson, the volunteer would then "ask them how they felt when they realized that their work was stolen and that they would not get anything for their efforts."
Some in Hollywood and in education circles wonder if it is appropriate for the movie industry to be teaching children about the moral and ethical consequences of downloading when the legal and cultural issues are still being worked out. "You have to ask the threshold question, 'Should any outside entity be allowed in the classroom?' " said Mr. Kaplan of the University of Southern California.
David Chernow, chief executive of Junior Achievement, counters by saying the industry's message that downloading is stealing is an ethical lesson not to be ignored.
Still, Hollywood executives agree that to succeed in changing minds, they have to come up with easy and cheap online alternatives to free downloads. 
Movielink, the industry's first major effort, has met limited success so far. Started last November by five major studios, including Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Brothers, Movielink allows consumers to rent downloadable films via the Internet for 99 cents to $4.99. 
But even some in the industry say Movielink is not flexible enough. Users cannot burn movies onto discs, and must watch the movies on a computer screen. And while rented films stay on customers' hard drives for 30 days before they disappear, the customers have only 24 hours to finish the film once they hit play.
Movielink recently rolled out an improved version of its product, and is backing it with an ad campaign aimed mostly at college students. Entertainment executives said the industry's fate would be decided more by the success of services like Movielink than a public relations campaign. "Movie executives have to be aggressive in their business strategy right off the bat," Ms. Rosen said. "Frankly if they don't take that view given what has happened in the music business, they should all be fired."

 UAL, the parent of United Airlines, said yesterday that it would sell food in economy class for 90 days, starting Oct. 31. 
The food will be sold on more than 200 flights from Chicago and Denver, two of United's main domestic hubs. United said that offerings would include items from relatively well-known restaurant chains like Bennigan's, Hard Rock Cafe and T.G.I. Friday's. Breakfast will cost $7 and lunch and dinner will be $10 each, the airline said. Passengers in business and first class will be served free. UAL also said its loss last month fell to $46 million from $112 million in July and that its results met covenants in its bankruptcy proceeding. Edward Wong (NYT)

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
In Giants' Plan, Jets Still Play Second Fiddle

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Jets have never felt quite at home at Giants Stadium. The Giants got there first, so their name is on the building, not the Jets'. The Giants have won two Super Bowls since they moved there; the Jets, none. 
 Now, with an agreement reached Tuesday on a plan for the Giants to finance the renovation of the stadium, the Jets may feel even more subservient. 
 The deal gives the Giants great leverage. They are willing to spend up to $300 million, so starting next season, they will keep all their game revenues and the rent the Jets now pay the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
 Won't this be awkward? "It wouldn't be for us," John Mara, the Giants' executive vice president, said.
 No one is saying this outright, but the Giants will be the Jets' de facto landlord. Carl Goldberg, the chairman of the sports authority, said, "The sports authority will still be the Jets' landlord, but a lot of the talks about economic issues will be between the Jets and the Giants."
 Mara said, "We will be dealing with them on lease issues."
 The Jets are not commenting on the Giants' deal until they review its details.
 Goldberg insisted that the Jets should not feel glum that the Giants have chosen, with the National Football League, to take the financial risk of revamping the stadium. He hopes the deal will lead the Jets to stay beyond the expiration of their lease in 2008 even if the Jets are pursuing what they believe will be an even better deal at a proposed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
 "I think they'll feel better," Goldberg said. "One, if the Giants find someone willing to buy the naming rights to the stadium, it won't be Giants Stadium anymore. That should give them some subliminal comfort. Second, they'll get enhanced revenues because of the renovation without making a capital investment. I'd suggest that would be a significant inducement to get them to stay."
But the Jets are still a tenant and feel they pay too much rent. Last June, they sued the sports authority, saying that they had been overcharged $7.6 million in rent and demanding that their rent (15 percent of gross receipts) be reduced to what the Giants pay (10 percent). 
 The Giants got the better deal when they extended their lease to 2026, and the authority has said the Jets can pay less if they stay as long as the Giants do.
 The Jets rest their claim on a clause that says that if the sports authority gives the Giants better lease terms, the Jets have to be treated similarly. The agency disagrees, reasoning that the lower rent is inextricably tied to the lease extension.
 But the terms have changed again. The Giants will keep all their game revenues, the Jets' rent revenues and take half of all nonfootball revenues. 
 Shouldn't the Jets be offered the same terms? 
 "I don't believe so," Goldberg said. "Only one team can renovate the stadium."
 Two years ago, however, the Giants and the Jets were discussing a joint plan to renovate the stadium, Mara said. The Jets were looking at Manhattan, but still eyeing a potential future in New Jersey.
 "They were at the table with us," Mara said. "We hadn't agreed on how we would split renovation costs. But they elected to go in a different direction."
 Intriguingly, Mara left the door open. Would it be possible for the Jets, if they grew disenchanted with the process in Manhattan, to split the costs of renovating Giants Stadium?
 "It might be grand," Mara said. "But it's not realistic."

HEADLINE: City Plans Design Competition For a 2012 Olympic Village 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
An international architectural competition will be held to design the 2012 Olympic Village, where more than 16,000 athletes and coaches would live if New York City is selected as the host of the Summer Games. 
 The village -- with 4,400 units of housing on more than 36 acres at Queens West, across the East River from the United Nations -- "will be the spiritual heart of the Olympic Games, and we want it to be remarkable, a real landmark," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. 
 The competition is open to all architects, and up to five finalists will be announced on Dec. 4. Those finalists will participate in a 20-week planning and design study. After public commentary sessions akin to those during the architectural selection process for ground zero, the winner is to be announced in May. 
The $400,000 design competition will be sponsored by NYC2012, the committee leading New York's bid to become the host city of the 2012 Games. The competition, as well as the village, will be privately financed, said Mr. Doctoroff, who was the founder of NYC2012.
Last November, New York was selected over seven other cities to represent the United States in the host-city competition. The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to announce the winning city on July 6, 2005. 
The projected cost of the Olympic Village has been estimated at $1.5 billion. 
A mix of high-rises, mid-rise structures and townhouses, the village "will not be dormitories," Mr. Doctoroff said. "We see it as first-class housing for New York City residents in a world-class design that people 50 years from now will remember as the center of the Games in our city." 
He said the village would become a new city neighborhood at the southern margin of Queens West after the Olympics. 
Contest submissions are due by Nov. 17. Alexander Garvin, director of planning, design and development for NYC2012, said: "We welcome proposals from young designers who are interested in exploring the potential of an environmentally sustainable residential community that will set the standard for urban design in the 21st century." 
Members of the design review panel include Gary Hack, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts; Con Howe, planning director for the City of Los Angeles; Ronay Menschel, chairwoman of Phipps Houses in Manhattan; Laurie D. Olin, professor of landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania; Will Rogers, president of the Trust for Public Land; Moshe Safdie, an architect; Denise Scott Brown, of the architecture firm Venturi Scott Brown; Dejan Sudjic, editor of the architecture magazine Domus; and Cristina Teuscher, an Olympic swimmer.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CONGRESS; 
Democrats Step Up Attacks on Iraq War

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats, sensing an opening against President Bush, pressed forward today with bitter criticism of the administration's handling of the aftermath of the Iraq war, directly challenging the White House after months of treading softly when it came to the conflict.
 At hearings, at press conferences and in interviews, Democratic lawmakers unleashed a torrent of criticism, finding fault with everything from the administration's rationale for the war and a lack of postwar planning to its diplomatic efforts and even Mr. Bush's decision to leave the United Nations Tuesday before others finished speaking. 
 The assault was a marked contrast to the reluctance of many Democrats to confront a popular wartime president while that war was under way. They were constrained not only by an unwillingness to question the commander in chief during combat but by the prospect of being pummeled by Republicans who were quick to attack any Democrat who questioned administration policy. 
Democratic lawmakers say the request for $87 billion -- including more than $20 billion to rebuild Iraq at a moment when the U.S. economy is struggling -- has shifted the dynamic of the political fight. They say it gives them a new opportunity to contrast their policies and priorities with the president's.
"On Sept. 7th, the president of the United States asked the Congress to put up $87 billion to cover for its failed policy in Iraq," the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said today as she accused the administration of misleading the public on the postwar risks in Iraq. "That was a very pivotal day in this debate."
Even some of those who had previously backed the administration were harsh in their judgment.
"The administration waited until the 11th hour to begin planning," said Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, speaking to the American administrator for Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing. "Its leading members believed we would find an oil-rich, functioning country, that we'd be met by cheering crowds, that all we had to do was sweep out the top Baathist layers, implant our favorite exiles and watch democracy take root as the bulk of our troops returned home by Christmas."
The increasingly tough tone was first struck by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a consistent opponent of the war, who charged the administration with perpetrating a "fraud" with its justification for the war on Iraq. 
Mr. Kennedy's comments, in an interview last week with The Associated Press, drew a strong Republican rebuke, but Senate Democrats, including their leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, defended his right to speak his mind on the Senate floor. Mr. Daschle himself has been leery of taking on the president over Iraq after coming under intense political fire for his criticism just before the start of the war. 
"We ought to have an opportunity to have this open discussion and expression of views without challenging the motives, the patriotism or the very right of any senator to express him or herself," Mr. Daschle said. 
At a private luncheon meeting later, Mr. Kennedy thanked his colleagues for their defense and said he believed that Democrats should press ahead with a tough tone, suggesting that it was an important moment for Democrats as well as the president. He told his colleagues they could no longer afford to stay quiet.
"We are going to be held accountable on this," Mr. Kennedy said in an interview today, suggesting that Democrats were reflecting the alarm expressed by their constituents at the "extraordinary" costs associated with Iraq. "We have some real responsibility to our service men and women who are bearing the brunt of a failed, flawed and bankrupt policy." 
Top Democratic aides said public unease with the Iraq aid request as well as some slipping in the president's support reflected in polls is certainly making it easier to take on the administration. They said the criticism was not being orchestrated, though Senate Democrats met this evening to plot strategy on the spending request.
The Democratic presidential field was heaping criticism on Mr. Bush as well, an indication that next year's elections were a factor in the outspokenness. Democrats were also bolstered by outrage expressed by Democratic hawks like Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, as well as acknowledgment in Republican circles that the size of the aid request was hard even for some on that side of the aisle to swallow.
Republicans were moving quickly to respond to the new Democratic stance. After attacking Mr. Kennedy and others on Tuesday, the House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, spoke at the Heritage Foundation this afternoon and suggested that the Democratic leadership lacked the "moral clarity" of John F. Kennedy or Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said Democratic leaders had been infected with a "blame America first" mentality.
"Rather than a challenge of historic importance, too many Democrats treat the war on terror like a political nuisance," he said. "Isn't $87 billion, or for that matter $187 billion, a bargain if it helps prevent another 9/11?"
Other Republicans said Democrats would regret their criticism should the administration ultimately achieve its goal of a democratic Iraq.
"I have the feeling that those who are making the current comments about the progress since the war will end up having to eat the same kind of crow they had to eat on the military side when they said that you didn't know what you were doing," Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, told Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld at a hearing.
Democrats and Republicans predicted that the spending request would be approved. But the critics seemed to be releasing pent-up frustration after months of relative silence, saying they had been treated as irrelevant by the White House. 
"It doesn't matter what we think, that's the impression that's given," Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told Mr. Rumsfeld. "And Peter's coming home to pay Paul now, because you've come in for huge money without a way to pay for it, and in a war that many of us think was generated for the wrong reasons."

HEADLINE: OPEC Says It Will Cut Output, And Price of Oil Climbs Sharply 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
OPEC unexpectedly agreed today to cut oil production on Nov. 1, just as most of the developed world will be heading toward winter and demand for heating oil is likely to be rising.
 Though the United States has been increasing imports, oil prices had fallen over the last few weeks. Commercial inventories of heating oil are healthy and government stockpiles are robust, but the sharp rise in crude oil prices after the announcement could translate into higher prices for heating oil and gasoline. 
 Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, joined for the first time by representatives of post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, cited the still sluggish global economy, including a "jobless recovery" in the United States, as well as rising production at non-OPEC countries as the main reasons for their decision to trimoutput by 3.5 percent. The weak economy has the potential to curb demand and push down prices unless production is reduced. 
Going into the meeting, OPEC had been expected to keep production unchanged for now, because prices had eased only modestly in recent weeks, after remaining high after the war in Iraq. Members of the cartel were expected to curb production only next year, when Iraqi output is expected to increase.
After the move to trim OPEC's overall output ceiling by 900,000 barrels a day, to 24.5 million barrels, analysts said the decision might have been influenced by other, more political factors.
"This was a message to Washington: 'You can send a delegation to OPEC, but we control the oil price,' " said Mehdi Varzi, a private energy consultant in London.
Iraq was attending as one of OPEC's 11 full members, even though the country will not get a production quota until its production rises to "normal" levels, said Abdullah al-Attiyah, OPEC's president and the oil minister of Qatar; that, he added, would be at least the 2.5 million barrels a day of oil that Iraq was pumping before the war. It now produces about 1.8 million barrels of oil a day, according to the Iraqi governing council.
The Bush administration, fearing the economic damage of higher oil prices, had successfully lobbied OPEC heavily before and during the war to keep supplies ample and prices in check. The White House wanted low prices to help spur the economy, but low prices also limit the amount of money Iraq can raise to pay for its own reconstruction. President Bush has asked Congress for $87 billion for military and reconstruction operations in Iraq, a sum that is much higher than expected.
While OPEC officially welcomed the Iraqi representative, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, at least one member country, Venezuela, tried to block his attendance until the United Nations recognized an Iraqi government.
Mr. Varzi and other analysts said that by cutting output now, sending prices soaring, OPEC could demonstrate that it retained considerable political power in a region with most of the world's oil reserves.
Over the long term, OPEC is eager to keep Iraq, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia, in the fold; the cartel has been losing market share and has watched its influence over oil prices wane since the 1970's.
Mr. Uloum said Iraq would continue as one of OPEC's 11 members.
"Iraq is a founder member of OPEC," he said during a news conference. "It will stay and remain a member of OPEC. Iraq should play an active role in achieving the objectives of this organization, with full cooperation with its members."
He added that Iraq planned to increase oil production sharply from current levels. Sabotage to Iraqi oil facilities continues to restrain output; wartime damage could cost another $2 billion to repair, he said.
By the end of 2005, he said, Iraq aims to produce 3.5 million to 4 million barrels a day, and by the end of the decade, up to 6 million barrels.
Analysts said those targets were optimistic, unless the political situation in Iraq stabilized quickly and foreign investment was brought in to aid in tapping the reserves.
Such a substantial increase in output would mean that OPEC would also have to adjust the quotas of individual members. Before the United Nations imposed sanctions after the first gulf war in 1991, Iraq's quotas were comparable to those of its neighbor, Iran.
Mr. Attiyah, the OPEC president, said the group did not address the issue of Iraq's quota.
Reducing members' quotas slightly now could ease the way for bringing Iraq back into the quota system alongside the 10 other OPEC members. Before the war, Iraq could sell oil only under the United Nations' oil-for-food program.
"Until they're producing at least as much as they were under oil for food, there's really no need for a quota," said Yasser Elguindi, a consultant at Medley Global Advisors.
OPEC's new overall quota of 24.5 million barrels a day -- about one-third of the world's total -- brings its official production ceiling back to the level that prevailed before a meeting in April. At that time, the group raised the official limit to 25.4 million barrels, though analysts said actual production at times was probably considerably higher, given that many OPEC members routinely pump more oil than their quotas prescribe.
OPEC's communique today called for "compliance and strict discipline" under the new limits. Mr. Attiyah also said leading non-OPEC oil producers supported the group's goal of keeping prices within a band of $22 to $28 a barrel.
But at least one non-OPEC member present at the meeting as an observer questioned the need for a cut in production now, at a time when Iraqi oil is still only trickling onto the market and when the global economy shows signs of improving, leading to possibly higher demand.
"Forecasts of supply and demand suggest there is no need for an immediate cut in supply," said Anibal Octavio da Silva, head of the Angolan delegation.
Oil inventories in the United States rose by 1.5 million barrels last week, to 280.8 million barrels, though that was still roughly in line with levels a year earlier, and relatively tight by historical standards, the Energy Department said today.
But Mr. Attiyah and other OPEC officials said they were worried that inventories would rise in the fourth quarter, amid mixed signals on the course of global economic growth. Analysts said the move suggested that OPEC members expected that Iraq might be able to ramp up production faster than was foreseen.
"We saw more supply than the market needed," Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri, head of the delegation from the United Arab Emirates, told reporters before heading into a meeting where the cut was approved.
"Any lack of action could have been very negative for prices," he added.
He would not say which OPEC members had proposed the production cut, after officials arriving for the meeting in Vienna had hinted as recently as Tuesday night that quotas would remain unchanged.
As energy traders learned of the cut, prices surged, with crude rising $1.11, or about 4 percent, to $28.24 a barrel in New York. Major American stock markets fell on the news of rising oil prices. 
"It's obviously a bullish move," said Gary Ross, chief executive of the Pira Energy Group.
"They want to ensure that prices stay at the upper end of the band" of $22 to $28 a barrel that OPEC has set as its target range, he added.
Prices had remained near the upper end of that range after the Iraq war, but had eased slightly in recent weeks. OPEC said it would review market conditions at a meeting on Dec. 4. Analysts said that would give members of the organization a chance to determine whether production by Iraq would, in fact, rise as quickly as Mr. Uloum predicted today.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
California's long-term economic problems need long-term solutions.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
CALIFORNIA'S off-again-on-again election is moving toward a climax, and it's a cliffhanger. Gov. Gray Davis is fighting for his political life.
 It looks as if Arnold Schwarzenegger has the Hummer owners' vote sewed up, but even in California that's not enough to win an election. The far right sees Mr. Schwarzenegger as too liberal for their tastes, so there's a chance the vote will split, leaving Governor Davis, or at least the Democrats, with a victory. 
 But even if Mr. Davis retains the governorship, his political future looks bleak. How did he get into this mess?
The governor was hit with two big economic crises: the blackouts in the spring of 2001 and the budget shortfall of 2002-3.
These two episodes offer some useful lessons in economics. Understanding what went wrong may help avoid such disasters in the future.
Governor Davis certainly can't be blamed for the electricity crisis: the fatally flawed electricity deregulation policy was created in the previous administration.
They say a camel is a horse designed by committee, but this plan was more of a wart hog. It required all electricity purchases to be made in a spot market, virtually eliminating long-term contracting, and was vague about who would pay for more transmission facilities.
As a result, investment in generating capacity was delayed for several years while the industry haggled over who would pay for needed improvements. During this period the demand for power continued to grow.
When a few generators went offline for maintenance in the spring of 2001, it became apparent just how vulnerable California's power supply was. The shortfall in supply, coupled with fixed retail prices and the inability to make long-term contracts, ceded market power to sellers of electricity.
"Enron-style market manipulation was part of the problem," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, "but the real root cause was shortages, some real and some created by sellers who had an incentive to drive up prices."
Governor Davis was, at least initially, not willing to play the one valuable card he had: allowing retail electricity prices to rise.
When he finally did allow price increases in the spring of 2001, the resulting incentives for conservation, falling natural gas prices, and the long-term contracts he negotiated stabilized the situation. Californians turned off their electric hot tubs and adjusted their air-conditioners, and the crisis evaporated.
Why was Mr. Davis so reluctant to allow prices to rise? He recognized that such a move would be deeply unpopular and could cost him the election the following year. He was betting that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would come to his rescue with price caps, or that electricity prices would stabilize on their own. Unfortunately, neither of these things happened.
Getting no help from Washington, the governor was forced to sign disadvantageous long-term contracts, obligating electricity distributors and consumers to pay high prices for electricity for years to come.
Most California voters think the electricity crisis contributed to the state budget deficit. If only things were that simple. In reality, not a cent of the deficit was caused by electricity prices: the cost of the crisis will show up solely in future electricity bills.
The basic economic lesson is this: a deregulated wholesale market and a regulated retail market is a recipe for disaster. If you tell a supplier, "I'll buy the same amount no matter what you charge," don't be surprised if you are charged a high price.
So if the electricity crisis didn't cause the deficit, what did?
Fundamentally, the deficit is a hangover from the days of irrational exuberance. California was the epicenter of the dot-com boom of the late 1990's, and tax receipts flowed to Sacramento. Tax revenue from stock-option grants and capital gains alone rose from $7.5 billion in 1998-9 to $12.7 billion in 1999-2000 to $17.6 billion in 2000-1.
When money flows in, governments find it hard not to spend it. This is particularly true in California, thanks to mandated spending constraints. For example, Proposition 98, passed in 1988, requires the state to spend 40 percent of general funds on education from kindergarten through high school. As a result, spending, both automatic and discretionary, rose in parallel with tax revenue.
Then the house of cards came tumbling down. Revenue from options and capital gains fell to $8.6 billion in 2001-2, and $5.2 billion in 2002-3.
Reversing those spending decisions was not as easy as putting them in place: much of the increased revenue went for education, tax cuts and other long-term commitments.
This brings us to the second lesson in economics: don't spend transitory income on permanent commitments.
State tax revenues in California come basically from three sources: the sales tax, the property tax and the personal income tax. Stephen Levy of the Institute of Regional and Urban Studies in Palo Alto has looked at the historical volatility of these series. (His summary is available at http://www.ccsce.com/irus_cbe.htm.)
Surprisingly, he found that the sales tax base had the most volatility, in part because the sales tax excludes the rapidly growing services sector. Personal income, excluding capital gains, has grown relatively smoothly by comparison.
Mr. Levy argues that revenues from volatile sources, like capital gains, should have special treatment in budgeting: one-time revenue increases should be tied to one-time expenditures or automatically put into a rainy day fund. This is an eminently sensible suggestion.
Whoever ends up in the governor's office will face the same budget mess. Expenditures will have to be cut and taxes will have to be raised. But more important, some changes in spending policies of the sort Mr. Levy suggests should be put in place to prevent future budget crises.
Long-term reforms require a long-term vision. The last thing Sacramento needs now is a governor who is obsessed with the next election.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Thursday about California's budget crisis misstated the year in which some power generators shut down for maintenance, demonstrating the vulnerability of the state's power supply. It was the spring of 2000, not 2001. The column also referred incorrectly to decisions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The agency indeed imposed some price caps in California, in December 2000 and June 2001.

HEADLINE: Doubts Expressed As Bush Presses Asia on Currency 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
Publicly berating China and Japan over their exchange rates is winning the Bush administration praise from American manufacturers, but is not playing so well among economists.
 Pushing China to let its currency rise against the dollar, asTreasury Secretary John W. Snow has been doing, would help American producers by making Chinese imports more expensive and American exports cheaper. 
 But a growing number of experts, including some with close ties to the Bush administration, warn that the effort could create more problems than it solves.
For one thing, China and other Asian countries have helped to finance the rapidly expanding federal budget deficit with huge purchases of Treasury securities over the last year. 
They have done so largely to keep their own currencies low against the dollar, and the added demand for Treasury securities has helped keep interest rates low.
If China and Japan were to reverse course, they would start selling Treasury securities, and that could drive interest rates higher.
"This is not a small amount of money we're talking about," said Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy research organization here that has close ties to the White House.
"If the Asians aren't buying the paper, then you got to ask yourself who is going to be buying this stuff."
R. Glenn Hubbard, who was chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers until earlier this year, has been even blunter.
In a commentary published this month in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Hubbard wrote that it was both "unpersuasive" and "unfortunate" to blame China's currency, the yuan, for job losses of American manufacturers.
Mr. Hubbard warned that pushing China to let the yuan float more freely, as the administration has been suggesting, could wreak havoc with China's large and troubled banking sector.
And while many economists agree that China and Japan have kept their currencies artificially weak, to make their own exports cheap in the United States, many also warn that an abrupt shift in policy could have disastrous consequences.
"They are not in a position to cope with it right now," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "It would be destabilizing for China, destabilizing for the United States and destabilizing for the world."
In a sharp departure from past policy at the Treasury Department, Mr. Snow has repeatedly and publicly called for Asian countries to adopt more "flexible" exchange rates.
China, which has a trade surplus with the United States of more than $100 billion this year, has been the biggest target of Mr. Snow's efforts. China keeps its currency at a fixed exchange rate of 8.3 yuan to the dollar, a rate that has remained constant since 1994.
Critics of Chinese policy say the yuan is now artificially undervalued by about 40 percent against the dollar, which makes Chinese products even cheaper than they would otherwise be, and makes American exports more expensive.
The Bush administration is not alone in pressuring China. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, have introduced legislation that would impose import tariffs of up to 27 percent on Chinese products if the currency remains fixed.
Administration officials reject the idea of punitive tariffs as too heavy-handed. John B. Taylor, the under secretary of Treasury for international affairs, told the Reuters news agency today that the administration preferred "financial diplomacy."
But that might not be enough. The National Association of Manufacturers, which has campaigned for more than a year for tougher pressure against China, said this week that it would file a legal complaint that accuses China of using its currency as an "unfair trade practice."
Last weekend, Mr. Snow persuaded officials from the Group of 7 industrialized countries to declare their support for more "flexible" exchange rates -- a clear attempt to pressure Asian governments into letting their currencies rise more in value.
But even people who have long made similar arguments distanced themselves today from the United States.
Horst Koehler, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, cautioned against publicly pressing countries to change their foreign exchange policies.
"Certainly, the role of the exchange rate is nothing that we should push ahead through public trumpeting and organized pressure," Mr. Koehler told reporters at the fund's board meeting today in Dubai.
It remains far from clear whether China or Japan will change their approaches. Chinese officials have said they will not change policy anytime soon, and Japanese officials have already warned that the markets "overreacted" when they drove the value of the yen on Monday to its highest level in three years.
Carl Weinberg, global economist at High Frequency Economics, said the Bush administration's tactics were based more on politics than on economics. "The political forces have an ax to grind," Mr. Weinberg said today. "The president is running for re-election and he wants to support big business."

HEADLINE: Paying for War's Aftermath 

 BODY:
How about forcing the Iraqi people to take out a mortgage on their newfound freedom, using their nation's future oil revenue as collateral? A proposal to do that -- making a loan out of the $20 billion the Bush administration is seeking to cover the first round of reconstruction costs -- is gaining support in Congress. Of all the bad ideas that have been floated recently about Iraq's future, this is one of the worst. 
 It is understandable that lawmakers from both parties are suffering sticker shock over President Bush's request for an additional $87 billion for postwar Iraq and Afghanistan. The estimated costs of occupying and rebuilding Iraq are skyrocketing, while projections for foreign contributions and potential Iraqi oil income keep shrinking. But adding $20 billion to Iraq's current foreign debt is not the answer. 
 Iraq already owes tens of billions to France, Russia and others, much of which may have to be written off. Preferentially guaranteeing Iraq's debt to the United States (for funds paid out to American contractors) with future oil revenue would only reinforce suspicions around the world about our motives for going to war. 
Nor is it sensible economically. Baghdad may earn only about $10 billion from its oil sales next year, and while Iraq stands to make more than that in the longer term, it is hard to see how the struggling country would be able to repay a $20 billion loan from Washington.
The White House is scrambling to oppose the loan idea, but its refusal to level with the American people over the past year about the true costs of the war and its aftermath only fed the notion that no great sacrifices lay ahead. Its vague talk about oil money's covering much of the tab did little to prepare Congress for the day of reckoning.
The $20 billion for reconstruction the administration is seeking is a down payment on an investment that could add up to $100 billion in coming years. Congressional demands for more specifics about how this money will be spent are appropriate, but efforts to separate this request from the less controversial $65 billion for military operations are counterproductive.
Lawmakers who overwhelmingly supported this war should face the responsibility for helping to build a stable and functional Iraq, eventually able to stand on its own. Right now, building new roads and power plants in Iraq is as essential to our national interest as paying for the training, salaries and equipment of the men and women in the military forces in Iraq.
The alternative, moving to make the task just a bit cheaper by saddling the Iraqi people with even more foreign debt, is a recipe for fomenting resentful anti-Americanism. It sounds more like a punitive Versailles-style approach to the vanquished, instead of the Marshall Plan for the Middle East that the White House keeps promising.

Brazilian farmers, the world's No.2 producers of soybeans, got the go-ahead today to plant genetically modified seeds this season after the country's vice president said he would lift a ban on transgenic crops.
 Vice President Jose Alencar, standing in for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who is visiting the United States, Cuba and Mexico, said that he would sign a decree ending the ban, despite resistance from environmental advocates and their supporters in the government. 
 The decree effectively extends a temporary decree legalizing the sale of genetically modified soy from this year's harvest, but officials said they expected it to pave the way for legislation that would be sent to Congress this year. The extension comesjust in time for the October planting. 
Until last year, Brazil was one of the world's last main exporters of farm goods to ban the planting or sale of genetically altered crops or foods, although an increasing number of farmers, especially in the southern farming states Rio Grande do Sul and Parana, have flouted the ban in recent years by planting transgenic seeds smuggled in from neighboring Argentina.
"This decree essentially legalizes what was already happening, but it is important," said Amaryllis Romano, agribusiness analyst at Tendencias, a consultant in Sao Paulo.
Analysts estimate that 30 percent of Brazil's soy is grown from smuggled genetically modified seeds, and in Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Argentina and where most of Brazil's transgenic soy has been planted, the figure is closer to 70 percent.
Even under the ban, Brazil produces more than a quarter of the world's soy and has been closing the gap with the United States, the top producer and exporter.
Brazil's oilseeds association says soy exports should top $8 billion this year, 34 percent more than in 2002. This year's harvest produced 52 million tons, nearly 60 percent more than five years ago and only 20 million tons behind estimates for this year's American harvest.
"Sooner or later, Brazil will overtake the United States, with or without transgenics," Ms. Romano said.
While the agriculture minister, Roberto Rodrigues, and other members of Mr. da Silva's pro-business economic team have advocated lifting the ban, it was opposed by the environment minister, Marina Silva, and by environmental advocates. Court rulings have overturned, then upheld the ban in recent months. On Tuesday, a group of landless rural workers stormed the agriculture ministry to protest the expected lifting of the ban.
"The technicians tell me there are no risks, the environmentalists tell me there are," Mr. Alencar said at a function in Brasilia. "But really I must sign this decree."
The lifting of the ban is good news for the Monsanto Company, which last week ran notices in several newspapers here, asking soybean farmers to pay royalties on future use of its Roundup Ready soybeans.
But smaller farmers were also happy. 
"We did all our sums and we found that we had lost 28 percent of our income by not planting transgenic seeds last year," said Amauri Miotto, treasurer of Rio Grandes family farmers federation who farms 120 acres near the Argentine border. "That's about $1,500 -- a lot of money for a farmer like me."

HEADLINE: Where Life Used to Be Like a Box of Chocolates 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: FULTON, N.Y., Sept. 23 

 BODY:
A few months ago, the trucks driving through here were carrying away freshly made Nestle products. The smell of roasting cocoa beans wafted through the streets when the wind was out of the west. And the booths at Mimi's Drive-In restaurant were filled with workers from the Nestle plant, either starting their day with a cup of coffee or ending it with some benign gossip.
 These days, the trucks driving up to the plant are owned by professional recyclers. Mimi's has fewer customers, and they are less talkative. The only thing hanging in the air is a feeling of bitterness. "You don't want to talk Nestle's around them," said Mary House, 25, a waitress at Mimi's whose uncle and father had worked at the plant. "They get so upset. They're lost." 
 In May, the second-largest employer in Fulton and the country's oldest chocolate plant closed. Nestle officials reasoned that the 102-year-old, 38-acre factory was getting too old to upgrade, and its location -- about 30 miles northwest of Syracuse -- was impractical in these modern times. Residents of Fulton, a city of 12,000, were not exactly shocked. The area had been through it before, when it lost its Miller brewery and 900 jobs in 1994. They watched the Nestle plant downsize for years to 450 workers from 1,500. The ones who stayed with the company until the end lived with the speculation that it would close.
When it did close, though, they hoped Nestle would see a greater profit in helping the community, and sell the whole plant to other chocolate manufacturers -- even if they were potential competitors -- so it could be reopened. Instead, against the public urgings of United States Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Nestle rejected several purchase offers and chose to dismantle and sell its equipment in thousands of pieces at an auction last weekend.
"People say it was a good business decision; I've heard that phrase so much it makes me sick," said Michael Stafford, the mayor of Fulton, whose daughter and son-in-law just sold their house of three years and moved to Myrtle Beach, S.C., after losing their jobs at the plant, as did the mayor's wife.
Mayor Stafford added, "There's got to be more to life than business decisions."
A spokeswoman for Nestle USA, Patricia Bowles, said that the company tried to sell the plant starting last October but did not receive any serious offers until August, a month before the auction. "Our goal, without question, was to sell the plant," Ms. Bowles said. "And the primary reason was getting Fulton back to work. I'm disappointed to hear that some people did not think we seriously considered offers."
She added that Nestle tried to help its workers by announcing its decision early. "It was painful for us, too," she said. "No company closes a plant without going through very thorough review."
Nestle rejected offers by a group of former employees and by a consortium of European chocolate experts, officials said. It agreed to sell some equipment to a former Syracuse University basketball player and developer, Richard M. Duffy, who plans to make a low-carbohydrate chocolate bar and employ perhaps several hundred people in three years. The company offered to give the land and buildings, for which it had once asked $3.5 million, to the county economic development agency. The agency has yet to accept.
"Empty old buildings aren't necessarily a gift," Mayor Stafford said.
The thousands of pieces of equipment were auctioned mostly to small business owners and private recyclers, said Cathy Welch, project manager of Biditup!, an industrial assets company. The buyers have until Oct. 17 to remove their objects.
The Lion Capital Management group, which represents the unnamed European chocolatiers, is trying to buy back the equipment sold at auction. The development agency Operation Oswego County is now working on a package of incentives and lease agreements for that group and for Mr. Duffy, in hopes one or both can reopen much of the plant.
"It's not a done deal yet, but I'm optimistic," said Michael Treadwell, head of the county agency.
One of those standing by was Jim Panepinto of Rochester, owner of Ms. Ashleigh's Recycling Services. Mr. Panepinto bought whole production lines and was looking to resell them. A $10,000 line might resell for double or triple that, he said.
"We were the Empire State because of manufacturing," Mr. Panepinto said. "What are we now?"
Michael Pollard, 56, of Fulton had worked for the plant for 32 years by the time it closed. Now he and his friends get together once a week to play golf and talk about the plant's future. "We all made a good living," he said. "There are a lot of bitter feelings, but if they get the jobs back it will help heal that."
Mr. Pollard added, "I don't think being idle is going to do any good." He said it both about the plant, and himself.

HEADLINE: Rivals Mix Issues and Attacks In Free-for-All Recall Debate 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER and DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Sept. 24 

 BODY:
The five major candidates vying to replace Gov. Gray Davis met tonight for the first and probably last time, engaging in a spirited, substantive -- and sometimes sarcastic and personal -- debate over topics including the state's dismal budget mess and the wisdom of the Oct. 7 recall itself.
 The debate, which featured Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, the only big-name Democrat in the race; the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger; State Senator Tom McClintock; Peter Camejo of the Green Party; and the television commentator Arianna Huffington, had been eagerly anticipated by California voters, who quickly put behind them a week of legal uncertainty that had threatened to delay the election. 
 The debate may well prove pivotal over the final 12 days of the race. 
According to a poll released this week, more than 90 percent of voters are following the election closely and two-thirds said the candidates' performances tonight would be a significant factor in their vote. 
The candidates sparred over issues like the state's fiscal condition, its worker's compensation program and whether taxpayers should pay the cost of health care for children of illegal immigrants. They also tangled over a ballot proposition that would bar the state from collecting data on race and ethnicity. But relatively little time was devoted to the target of the recall itself, Mr. Davis. 
The debate began in a relatively sedate manner, with each candidate addressing the question of whether the recall should be held in the first place. Mr. Schwarzenegger called it "a great idea," and Mr. McClintock welcomed it as a means of correcting a mistake made at the ballot box last November when Mr. Davis was re-elected. Mr. Camejo said that recalling the governor was necessary to solve the state's budget crisis, and Ms. Huffington said the recall provided the only chance to elect an "independent progressive with a simple plurality."
Only Mr. Bustamante objected, calling the recall a "terrible idea" that would lead to an era of perpetual politics in California.
Within five minutes, however, order broke down as the candidates began speaking all at once on the question of the state's business climate. The moderator, Stan Statham, had to step in to calm the melee.
Much of the debate was dominated by feisty exchanges, with repeated moments of candidates talking over one another and Mr. Statham expressing frustration with the free-for-all. More often than not, Mr. Schwarzenegger was either the instigator or the recipient of the sniping, in which he delivered punchy one-liners that often had the ring of rehearsal.
In one exchange, Ms. Huffington acted offended that Mr. Schwarzenegger had interrupted her, saying: "Let me finish. This is completely impolite. This is the way you treat women, we know that."
Mr. Schwarzenegger, smiling, responded, "I just realized I have a perfect part for you in 'Terminator 4.' "
Mr. Statham, trying again to regain control, said resignedly, "This is not Comedy Central, I swear."
Ms. Huffington, who until now has not made an issue of Mr. Schwarzenegger's comments about women, said after the debate that she had been deeply offended by his treatment of her tonight. She called on women intending to vote for Mr. Schwarzenegger to reconsider.
"I give it as well as I take it, so that is not the problem," Ms. Huffington said at a news conference. "The distinction here was very clear: the only woman on the panel was treated differently by Arnold Schwarzenegger than the men were."
Ms. Huffington and Mr. Camejo, the two outsiders -- and underdogs -- in the exchange, used the forum to attack Democrats and Republicans alike, insisting that the time was ripe for a new order in Sacramento. Perhaps surprisingly, little of the fireworks occurred between Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. McClintock, who are in a fierce fight for Republican votes.
Mr. Schwarzenegger was asked after the debate about Mr. McClintock, a diehard conservative.
"I think he's a terrific guy," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "We would make a great team in Sacramento."
He suggested that Mr. McClintock would soon succumb to the pressure from Republicans to withdraw from the race and throw his support to Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"We'll see where it goes in the next 13 days," Mr. Schwarzenegger said.
Mr. McClintock, speaking to reporters after the debate, said he was not considering dropping out.
"When I entered this race, I made it as clear as I can," he said. "I made a promise to stay in this race until the finish line, and I keep my promises."
One of the evening's surprises was how little time was spent attacking Mr. Davis, whose record, after all, is the reason for the recall election. Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. McClintock referred frequently to the Davis administration's fiscal and business policies but refrained in general from attacking the governor personally. Mr. Bustamante, who does not have good relations with Mr. Davis, seemed at one point to blame him for steep increases in tuition for the state's colleges and universities.
Davis allies shrugged off the relatively mild criticism of the governor as further evidence that he should not be recalled. Ann Lewis, a campaign adviser to Mr. Davis, said the only candidate to rise above the ruckus tonight was Mr. Bustamante, who had opened the evening with a strong statement against the recall.
"If you look at this as Team B," Ms. Lewis said, "and say 'Is Team B ready to lead,' tonight raises questions in people's minds."
Under the debate's free-wheeling format, the candidates -- who invariably addressed each other by first name -- were free to interrupt one another. Early on, Ms. Huffington was blaming corporate tax loopholes for part of the state's budget deficit when Mr. Schwarzenegger broke in.
"Arianna, let me say one thing," he interjected. "Your personal income tax is the biggest loophole, I can drive my Hummer through it."
He was referring to the fact that she paid less than $1,000 in personal income taxes over two years.
She responded: "I paid $150,000 in property taxes and payroll taxes. I am a writer. I'm not making $20 million violent movies." 
A few minutes later, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the Democrats in Sacramento were guilty of overspending and overtaxing. "You guys have an addiction problem," he said. "You should go to an addiction place." 
Ms. Huffington jumped in, saying, "Arnold's analysis perfectly fits the Bush administration in Washington."
Mr. Schwarzenegger shot back: "You want to campaign against Bush, go to New Hampshire. You're in the wrong state right now."
As she tried to respond, he said, "You need a little more decaf." 
Even with the theatrics -- and occasional grandstanding -- the candidates were compelled to delve into some of the state's most vexing problems. Taxation and budget cuts led the early discussion, but the problems of workers' compensation, health insurance, education and the state's business climate were also debated.
Mr. McClintock, who has made California's lost dream a focus of his campaign, spoke of disillusioned residents abandoning the state for the deserts of Arizona and Nevada. "We all have friends and family leaving," Mr. McClintock said. He spoke of the "four horsemen of this recession": high workers compensation costs, high taxes on business, excessive litigation and overregulation.
Mr. Schwarzenegger described California as the country's most unfriendly state for business. But Mr. Bustamante, Ms. Huffington and Mr. Camejo accused the two Republicans of exaggerating the state's downturn.
"I would really like you to tell the people the truth," she said to Mr. Schwarzenegger. 
The debate's sponsor, the California Broadcasters Association, did not invite other 130 candidates on the recall ballot because it said they had no chance to win. All eyes were on Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has avoided previous debates, saying he wanted to focus on tonight's widely watched session, which he called the Super Bowl of debates, even though the candidates had been given in advance copies of the 12 questions likely to be asked.
"This could well be the defining moment in the entire election," said Timothy Hodson, executive director of the Center for Governmental Studies at California State University at Sacramento, tonight's host. "This campaign has been so fluid on so many levels. There are a great many voters who may have told pollsters four weeks ago they had made up their minds who in fact are just making up their minds now." 
Mr. Davis took advantage of the lull in coverage before tonight's debate to take a swipe at Mr. Schwarzenegger after signing a bill on embryonic stem cell research in Davis, about 15 miles west of Sacramento.
"I think it's kind of ironic that the only debate Schwarzenegger is participating in is the one where you have the questions in advance," he said today at the University of California at Davis Medical Center. "Part of being governor is thinking on your feet, being able to react to unplanned events." 
More than 500 reporters, photographers and technicians requested credentials for the debate. It was broadcast live into every corner of the state, carried on national cable networks and broadcast in England and Japan, according to the broadcasters association.
The format of the debate touched off controversy and the threat of a boycott by several of the candidates. They contended that releasing the debate topics in advance gave an advantage to Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has the least experience in unscripted settings.
But Mr. Statham, the moderator and president of the broadcasters association, said the session was not intended to catch candidates in gaffes or misstatements, but to provide a forum for a lively discussion.
"This is a debate and a half," he said. "It's our opinion that the candidates are already scripted and this format will give them an opportunity to go after each other." 
Outside the debate site, the University Union, hundreds of supporters of major and minor candidates, as well as pro- and anti-recall demonstrators, competed for the attention of hundreds of cameras, often in outlandish costume.
And beyond the confines of the college campus, the campaign was taking a decidedly negative turn in a flurry of radio and television advertisements.
Mr. Schwarzenegger is running a new television commercial and a new radio spot criticizing the flood of Indian casino money into the election.
Several big California tribes with gambling interests have given large sums to Mr. Bustamante and are running television commercials praising Mr. McClintock, whose candidacy is cutting into potential support for Mr.
Schwarzenegger. Mr. Davis has also received large donations from California tribes, in this and previous campaigns.
In a radio commercial released today, Mr. Schwarzenegger says of the tribes: "All the major candidates take their money and pander to them. I don't play that game." 
Mr. Schwarzenegger is also running advertisements reminding viewers of what he considers the lowlights of the Davis era, including rolling power blackouts, a hemorrhaging state budget, a 300 percent increase in vehicle registration fees and a law recently signed by the governor granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants.
Mr. Bustamante continued a series of negative advertisements focused largely on Mr. Schwarzenegger and financed almost entirely with Indian contributions.
"Arnold doesn't share our values," the newest commercial says. "He doesn't live in our world. He lives on Planet Hollywood."
Mr. Davis, meanwhile, is broadcasting a new commercial in San Francisco and the Central Valley that warns that the next governor could be elected with as little as 15 percent of the vote. "Who will finish first?" it asks. "Will they be qualified?" It then urges a no vote on the recall.
Tonight's debate was seen as particularly critical for Mr.
Schwarzenegger. He said that tonight's debate was the only one worthy of his presence, causing aides to cringe because it meant that he was setting high expectations for tonight's performance.
This morning, The Wall Street Journal published an essay on its editorial page by Mr. Schwarzenegger titled "My Economics," in which he said Mr. Davis had created a hostile climate for business in California, treating employers as if they were "enemies of the state."

HEADLINE: Clark Issues Job Plan While Criticizing Bush 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Under pressure to broaden his presidential candidacy beyond his experience in national security, Gen. Wesley K. Clark issued a detailed proposal yesterday for creating jobs, saying, "We simply cannot have strong security without a strong economy."
 General Clark, who is retired from the Army, said he would devote $100 billion over two years to three programs, which he said would not expand the federal deficit because he would repeal President Bush's tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 a year. 
 He delivered his plan in a crisp address along the East River in Manhattan, weaving his military resume into his critique of President Bush. "In the area of economics," he said, "this White House still needs basic training." 
After his short outing, he secluded himself with some of the Democratic Party's most seasoned political operatives in a Manhattan office building in preparation for a Democratic debate today in New York. It will be the first time he will appear on stage with his nine rivals, who are eager to stop his surge. Two of them raised sharp questions today about his Democratic credentials.
One of them, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, said in a news conference that General Clark would have to explain why he had supported Republicans like Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Mr. Kerry spoke after being endorsed by the International Association of Firefighters.
Howard Dean, in an appearance on ABC, also said he was surprised that General Clark had voted for the two Republicans. Asked if the general was a true Democrat, Dr. Dean said, "I think that we have to find out about that."
An array of veterans from campaigns past, particularly from the Clinton administration, have been providing General Clark with policy expertise. Those offering informal advice on the economy include Robert E. Rubin, the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's economic adviser, both of whom have also advised other candidates.
Their views also helped inform General Clark's first detailed policy proposal, which he offered in New York yesterday morning on the subject of creating jobs.
He said he would invest $40 billion over two years to create jobs that improve domestic security, including in the Coast Guard and Customs Service, as well as construction projects to strengthen bridges and tunnels that might be subject to terrorist attacks.
He would give $40 billion over two years to the states to ease cuts in health and education programs. And he would provide $20 billion over two years in tax incentives to businesses to create jobs, giving them a $5,000 tax credit for each employee they hire.
The economy is the focus of today's debate, and Clark advisers said it was important for him to show that he had specific proposals on how to improve it. Still, they said, General Clark's candidacy would be based chiefly on broader issues of character and experience.
The general's rivals are already challenging his credibility on military matters. He has made contradictory statements about his stance on the Iraq war, saying last Thursday that he "probably" would have supported the Congressional resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but then backtracking the next day. 
It is not just his rivals who are raising questions. Gen. H. Hugh Shelton, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is retired, recently made critical comments about General Clark, formerly the supreme allied commander for NATO.
As reported by The Los Altos Town Crier in California, when General Shelton was asked by a moderator in a local forum what he thought of General Clark, he said: "I've known Wes for a long time. I will tell you the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote."
General Shelton could not be reached for comment yesterday.
A spokeswoman for the campaign, Kym Spell, said, "General Clark has served his country for 34 years and for General Shelton to make these comments came as a surprise and a huge disappointment."
General Clark also has supporters in the military. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has known General Clark since they were two classes apart at West Point, said in an interview, "Having watched some of the most senior people in the international community in the last decade, I can say he's one of the most brilliant, thoughtful, articulate and experienced public servants I've ever met in my life."

BYLINE:  By PAMELA ROBIN BRANDT

 BODY:
 THE staid and the silly have always existed side by side in Coral Gables, an exclusive enclave (so exclusive that residents are prohibited from parking pickup trucks in their own driveways) surrounded by Miami, as one glimpse of the eight eye-popping pagodas in the Chinese Village will attest. They and other "international villages" -- small housing developments -- were planned by George Merrick, the founder of Coral Gables, to offer architectural diversity in the otherwise Spanish Mediterranean-style town. When William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic nominee for president, was hired to promote the brand-new town in the early 1920's, he proclaimed, "You can wake up in the morning and tell the biggest lie you can think of about the future of Coral Gables, and before you go to bed at night you will be ashamed of your modesty." The latest residents to buy into the undeniable charisma of the place are members of the affluent YUCA population, the local acronym for Young Urban Cuban Americans, who have helped to create the economic miracle referred to in the name Miracle Mile, a centrally located shopping street. Coral Gables today retains some of the most striking architectural and natural sights in Miami-Dade County, but it also has some of its most luxurious hotels and shops, and, many food critics agree, better restaurants than South Beach. It all adds up to a super, if relatively sedate, tropical trip. PAMELA ROBIN BRANDT

Open only since March, Carmen the Restaurant (in the David William Hotel, 700 Biltmore Way, 305-913-1944) has fast become one of the town's hottest hangouts, largely because of its chef, Carmen Gonzalez. As well as a regular formal restaurant room, the space contains a wining-and-dining bar with a casual Continental-chic ambience. Unusual wines by the glass include the complex Cerreto Blange Arneis ($10). Specialties include a terrine of Florida lobster and avocado with Key lime mayonnaise and plantain fritters ($14) and, available at the bar, sirloin-mango dumplings with an addictive 17-ingredient Asian barbecue sauce ($6.50).

8 p.m.

2. Polite at Night
South Beach-style night life does not exist in the Gables. But early-to-bed culture is cool. More than a dozen downtown art galleries sponsor gallery nights from 7 to 10 on the first Friday of each month. At Books and Books (265 Aragon Avenue, 305-442-4408), owned by Mitchell Kaplan, founder of the Miami Book Fair International, there are often readings, open microphone poetry slams, live music groups and events like cookbook-related cookouts on the patio on Friday evenings. The shop also offers a wealth of vacation reading by locals like Edna Buchanan, Carolina Garcia-Aguilera and Dave Barry.

Saturday

9 a.m.

3. A Merrick Tour
The son of a New England minister-turned-Florida guava grower, Mr. Merrick's vision for the family groves was of a planned "city beautiful" whose architectural style could be called highly imaginative Spanish Mediterranean. Start your tour at Coral Gables (907 Coral Way), Mr. Merrick's 1906 home. The house itself is currently closed for restoration, but the mixed-breed classic Palladian and antebellum plantation-style exterior of oolite, a type of deeply pitted limestone commonly called coral rock, can be seen. The eccentric manor's gardens are also well worth a gander. Continue on to the most striking of Mr. Merrick's seven international villages: the flamboyant French Normandy Village (9400 block of Vizcaya Avenue, at Le Jeune), the Chinese Village (one block east of Riveria Drive), the Florida Pioneer Village (Santa Maria Street, within the Riviera golf course) and the Dutch South African Village (Maya Avenue at San Vicente Street) with its Dutch-style twisted coil chimneys and filigreed peak roofs.

11 a.m.

4. Make a Splash
Time for a swim. The Venetian Pool (2701 De Soto Boulevard, 305-460-5356; adult admission $9 April to October, $6 the rest of the year) is a popular site for fashion photographs and films as well as the favorite swimming hole for Gables residents. This inspiration of Denman Fink, Mr. Merrick's uncle, and the city art director, Phineas Paist, is a stylish salvaging of a huge hole left after limestone was extracted for construction elsewhere in town. It has Venetian-style bridges and striped lampposts, coral rock caves and diving cliffs, and two waterfalls, as well as prosaic stuff like changing rooms.

12:30 p.m.

5. Cuban Picnic
To avoid the long lines of locals who pack Havana Harry's (4612 Le Jeune Road, 305-661-2622) for some of South Florida's tastiest traditional bargain-priced Cuban food, pick up a picnic -- the mojito pork subs (garlic-citrus pulled pork, $5.50) rule -- and head for Matheson Hammock Park (9610 Old Cutler Road) on Biscayne Bay. Gondolas no longer navigate the canals between inland Coral Gables and the town's limited waterfront as they did in Mr. Merrick's day, but the park is still a festive site for al fresco feasts. The free picnic area has expansive lawns with picnic tables, a freshwater pond where alligators may be spotted, two nature trails and a coral-rock shelter with grills. Alternatively, spring for the $4 parking fee and drive half a mile to the "atoll," a saltwater swimming hole surrounded by a palm-planted beach and more picnic tables. Taking Gables exclusivity to its ultimate depth, the sandy-bottomed lagoon's inlet from the bay is gated to control water and sea life entering the lagoon while keeping it from becoming stagnant.

3 p.m.

6. Rain Forest Visit
Conveniently bordering Matheson Hammock Park, Fairchild Tropical Garden (10901 Old Cutler Road, 305-667-1651), founded in 1938, has a two-acre rain forest; the world's largest palm collection (more than 400 of the known 2,600 species); extensive bamboo, cactuses, flowering trees and cycad gardens; bird and butterfly refuges; and a huge new gift shop. A tram tour is included in the $10 admission. A schedule of special weekend events like this fall's first International Bamboo Festival (Oct. 16 to 19) is at www.fairchildgarden.org.

7 p.m.

7. Norman's New World
The decor is elegantly Old World Spain, but the internationally famed chef and cookbook author Norman Van Aken is serving New World fusion at Norman's (21 Almeria Avenue, 305-446-6767), a creative combination of elements from all over the so-called Floribbean area. Mainstays at Norman's, which opened in 1995 and remains endlessly inventive, include yuca-stuffed crispy shrimp with habanero tartar sauce ($15.50), and roasted pork Havana with 21st-century mole and golden Haitian grits ($29.50).

Sunday

10:30 a.m.

8. Brunch and Bubbly
Billed as "the last word in the evolution of civilization" when it opened in 1926, the Biltmore Hotel (1200 Anastasia Avenue, 800-727-1926) was modeled after the Giralda tower of the cathedral in Seville, Spain. But on Sunday mornings the hotel's outdoor 1200 Restaurant improves on the Spanish original by filling its fountain courtyard with tables of caviar, smoked fish and healthful salads balanced by sinful desserts, plus custom carving and grilling as well as sushi, pasta and crepes suzette stations. Completing the all-inclusive $61.80 experience is the live but low-volume Latin music (romantic conversations possible) and the unlimited Champagne. This is why you decided to become a grown-up.

THE BASICS
Visiting Coral Gables
You will want a car for exploring Coral Gables. Miracle Mile in downtown Coral Gables is four miles south of Miami International Airport, a straight 10-minute drive on Le Jeune Road and Southwest 42nd Street. Coral Gables is 29 miles from the Fort Lauderdale airport.
It would be possible to spend an entire weekend at the 280-room Biltmore (1200 Anastasia Avenue, 800-727-1926) with its spa and fitness center, 18-hole golf course, 10 tennis courts, large swimming pool, an independent on-premises professional theater company (GableStage) and, reportedly, the ghost of Al Capone, a former Miami resident, haunting the halls. In high season, which begins Sept. 30, rooms start at $299.
The ivy-covered Hotel Place St. Michel (162 Alcazar Avenue, 305-444-1666) has a more central downtown location and a more intimate scale. Its 27 rooms are $125 to $160 through October, $150 to $185 starting Nov. 1, and go up slightly again for January through March. A Continental breakfast is included.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
A Painter Who Saw God and the World in Perpetual Motion

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
George Inness's achievement hovers in the background of 19th-century American painting with all the mysterious haziness and edgelessness of his tantalizing, startlingly simplified late landscapes. Its indistinctness has prevailed despite serious attention from scholars, most notably Nicolai Cikovsky Jr., the author of two books on the artist and the curator of a 60-work Inness retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1985. The Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, the main repository of Inness's work, organized another survey in 1994.
 Now the National Academy of Design is trying its hand, with "George Inness and the Visionary Landscape," a taut 36-work show that feels bigger than it is. Perhaps its seeming expansiveness emanates from the thrilling sense of seeing an artist finally begin to get his due. 
 What is that due? Inness's life and art are permeated by an unusual ease. They lack the rough edges, eccentricities and tragic circumstances that have helped imprint the achievements of Albert Pinkham Ryder and Thomas Eakins on the American art consciousness. Yet his work intersects with much of the visionary landscape painting of the 19th century, from German Romanticism, through the Barbizon and Hudson River Schools, to the Symbolists. Inness had arguably the most impressive artillery of painting skills of any 19th-century American, and also the character to use them with restraint. (Yes, this can be taken as a dig at Whistler and Sargent.) And his faith in paint as material aligned him not only with Whistler, but also with Turner. 
Inness's appreciation of paint as a vehicle for personal, complex emotional expression was years ahead of its time. His late landscapes exude a freedom of hand and an openness of brushwork that are the antithesis of academic rendering; their directness and economy can still seem radical, even Minimalist in intent. His work has long been considered a precursor to the painterly, process-oriented art of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning.
If you are even half-willing, the National Academy show will take your breath away.
It is the work of Adrienne Baxter Bell, a doctoral candidate in art history at Columbia University. Formalism is not a dirty word in her vocabulary; she writes in refreshingly plain English, without any of the jargon or the ad hoc gerunds -- like "privileging" or "emblematizing" -- favored by art historians.
She has a firm, accessible grasp of the mystical conception of a God-haunted landscape that inspired the artists, writers and entrepreneurs of 19th-century America, and is as adept at parsing Inness's extraordinary paint surfaces as she is at explaining his immersion in the ideas of the religious thinker Emanuel Swedenborg. Her goal is to show how these elements come together in this artist's work. Swedenborg's belief that everything in nature is a reflection of God's immanence -- which infuses the world with a "living motion" that can open the individual to spiritual "influx" -- was one of the underpinnings of Inness's landscapes, whose merging forms and liberated brushwork have a living motion of their own.
Inness was one of those lucky rebels blessed with a stable personal life who lived in a time and a place that were ready for him. Born in 1825, the son of a well-to-do farmer in Newburgh, N.Y., he grew up in Brooklyn and Newark. As an adult he lived in New York, New England and New Jersey, settling finally in Montclair.
He had remarkably little formal art training: some drawing lessons in his teens, part-time work as a map engraver's assistant, a month's study with the itinerant French landscape painter Regis-Francois Gignoux, a student of Delaroche. In mid-1843 he took the first of three courses in drawing from antique casts at the National Academy; his first work wasaccepted in its 1844 annual.
Eager patrons sent Inness to Europe in the early 1850's for crucial exposure to the works of Lorrain, Poussin, Theodore Rousseau and the Barbizon School. From the early 1860's on, he was sustained by a decent market, growing reputation and friendships with some of the most forward thinkers of his time, including William James and Henry Ward Beecher. It didn't hurt that he was opinionated, articulate, well read and immersed in the ideas of his time. 
Inness was by nature a true believer, briefly jailed during his first trip to Rome in 1852 for refusing to remove his hat in the presence of the pope. Then there was his iron-clad conviction that his paintings were not only never really finished, but that they also belonged to him no matter what collector or museum might buy them. Paintings in his studio were subject to incessant revision, sometimes accumulating as many as 10 or 20 works beneath their surfaces.
Paintings dropped off at his studio for minor repairs might be unrecognizable when they were picked up, and he was even known to have repainted the work of another artist who was out when Inness visited his studio. And yet this marvelous flexibility was somehow consistent with his idea that everything was perpetually in process: when a friend commented that a sunset he was painting seemed wan, he obligingly squeezed more orange on the canvas. 
The exhibition follows the chapters of a doctoral thesis a little too closely, which means that it circles through Inness's development more than once rather than laying it out chronologically. But Inness himself had circular tendencies, moving back and forth between dissolving and more precisely rendered images, and encompassing quite a bit of past and future art in the process.
It took only a short time for him to establish his basic scheme. The show's earliest and second-largest painting, "A Bit of the Roman Aqueduct" (1852), is a perfect riff on Lorrain's Arcadian views -- with their leaf-by-leaf depictions of lush, sheltering trees, and their contented cattle and herdsmen -- even though the aqueduct of the title is pushed way to the background. Antiquity is largely absent from Inness's art, as are the yawning vistas and identifiable sites of the Hudson River School painters. 
He moves on to the Barbizon School with "The Huntsman" (1859), and from there to the essentially geometric structure of "Winter Evening, Medfield" (circa 1860). This work, whose hot-pink sky and lavender snow make you think of Monet, presents the basic elements of Inness's mature art in a slightly crabbed, derivative form: the low, even horizon and flat expanse of ground; the landscape that could be almost anywhere; a roof peak glimpsed through the trees; and small, solitary figures. The debt here is to Martin Johnson Heade. The figures would eventually fade into the mist, and all suggestion of anecdote or gesture would be eliminated. 
Yet Inness spent the 1860's and much of the 1870's reviewing his options. In the show's other big painting, the melodramatic "Valley of the Shadow of Death" (1867), he tries religious grandiosity. It depicts a tiny, white-cloaked Jesus gazing at a small white cross high in the distant sky in a mountain setting that might have been painted by Bierstadt.
In the early 1870's he painted Lake Nemi in Italy; the image is a golden, slightly saccharine Mediterranean update of Caspar David Friedrich's mystical communion between solitary figures and revelatory vistas. And on returning home, he seemed to bid the Hudson River School a fond farewell in the crystalline little "Landscape With Cattle," whose simple device of bisecting the canvas with a flat horizon line and then dividing the upper half with trees echoes through his paintings of the late 1880's and early 90's. 
It is these last paintings, with their floating mergers of land, water and sky, of leaves and clouds, that seal Inness's greatness. While he refrained from anything as flamboyant as impasto, we can follow his process every inch of the way: the extended slurring of paint that forms a tree trunk; the quick jabs with a frazzled brush or a brush handle that intimate wild flowers or grasses in the foreground. On the final wall of the exhibition is a stunning pairing: "Hazy Morning, Montclair" and "The Home of the Heron," 1890's paintings whose severe simplicity bring to mind the early landscapes of Mondrian.
Ms. Bell doesn't go into the links with Japonisme that these works suggest. Her goal is to relate Inness's achievement to the visionary notions of God and nature that he shared with other American artists and writers of his time. Her exhibition and catalog leave you with the impression of an artist saved by faith from the potential pitfalls of his artistic gifts.
When Inness intimates a figure standing in the dusk of one of his landscapes, his technique often has a whiff of the bravura of an artist like Boldini. Luckily, Inness wanted to show that paint has a nature all its own, and that God, or something close, was in the lack of details: in the diffuse sense of human spirit emitted by the soft light, passing signs of life and the evanescent bobbing and weaving of the brush, which may keep you studying these surfaces long after you expected to be elsewhere.

"George Inness and the Visionary Landscape" is at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Dec. 28.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; 
A Lost Art That Amazed the World By the Eerie Exactness of Its Detail

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
THE daguerreotype was announced to the French public in January 1839. By December, the rage for it inspired Theodore Maurisset, an illustrator, to lampoon Parisians in La Caricature with a cartoon called "Daguerreotypomania": scores of people lining up for their photographic portraits while engravers, driven out of work by the new technology, hang themselves from gallows.
 To recapture the thrill and astonishment people must have felt at the invention by the Parisian showman and diorama painter Louis-Jacques-Mande Daguerre, you might take a magnifying glass with you to the Metropolitan Museum's "Dawn of Photography," which has just opened. In the first room is a view across the Seine by Marie-Charles-Isidore Choiselat, one of the forgotten masters of this erstwhile art that changed the world. The daguerreotype is about 6 by 7 inches, a compact panorama. 
 It shows the Pavillon de Flore and the Tuileries on a September afternoon in 1849. You see the piers of the Pont Royal streaked by shadows under gathering clouds. A halo surrounds the buildings where the photographer blocked out part of the picture to prevent the sky from being overexposed. 
So we get both sharp detail in the architecture and passing weather, the halo making the scene look not just dramatic but slightly unreal. The wind must have been brisk that day because the leaves on the trees in the garden are a little blurry, a result of the longer exposure time Choiselat allowed in that part of the picture. But if you take your magnifying glass and look very closely at the bridge, you can just make out the nearly invisible speck of a policeman standing at attention.
The daguerreotype is so minutely detailed that when the magnification is strong enough, you can even count the buttons on the starched front of the policeman's uniform (as the curator, Malcolm Daniel, confirmed through a microscope).
The magic of this image, along with its incredible detail, also has to do with the shimmer of the photographic plate, which, as with all daguerreotypes, is irreproducible on a printed page. Silvered sheets of copper, sensitized with iodine and developed in heated fumes of mercury, daguerreotypes are alchemical objects of ethereal physicality. They shift as you move past them, glinting in the light, giving fleeting hints of intangible color, which make the people and objects they capture seem almost three-dimensional and at the same time vaporous. The effect is akin to what you may have experienced the first time you saw a holograph: an illusion of ghostly space.
The show, half the size it was in Paris this summer, is still a little too large and repetitive, daguerreotypes being small and intricate and hard to digest by the dozens, but it is lucid and handsome. It tracks the brief evolution of daguerreotypy in France, where the medium lasted barely two decades.
In America, the daguerreotype, like its poorer cousin the tintype, appealed to this nation's inherently empirical and mechanical sensibilities, and daguerreotypes persisted as an unpretentious tool and folk technique for making photographs into the 1860's.
But in France, the newer and more practical medium of paper photographs, which could be printed in multiples, unlike daguerreotypes, caused the daguerreotype pretty much to go the way of the Hula-Hoop by 1855. Daguerreotypes were one-of-a-kind objects. Their equipment and materials, including silver, copper and mercury, were also expensive. Daguerre, who got an annuity of 6,000 francs by selling his invention to the French government, in a prospectus in 1838 blithely declared that "everyone can use the daguerreotype to make views of his chateau or country house," indicating the clientele he had in mind. Camera plus equipment cost 400 francs in an era when workingmen made 4 francs a day.
But even if you weren't rich you could hire a daguerreotypist to take your portrait. Portrait studios opened across France. Millions of portraits were made, few any good. Sitters had to hold a pose with their heads clamped in vises to prevent them from moving during the long exposure time, and caricaturists like Daumier had a ball ridiculing the uncomfortable process, although many people still preferred a bad photograph of themselves or of their Aunt Beatrice or brother Charles to a drawing or to nothing. Photographs had both the cachet of a novelty item and the unprecedented, seemingly impossible ability to mirror reality.
Some memorable portraits did end up being made anyway: Leon Riesener's of Delacroix captures that painter's idiomatic panache; Adolphe Humbert de Molard's self-portrait, one eyebrow raised, head resting on two fingers, looks charmingly animated and casual; Jean-Baptiste Sabatier-Blot's portrait of his daughter beside a woman, who must be her mother, has the stiff affection befitting mid-19th-century French bourgeois propriety, a mood exactly opposite to the one struck in Louis-Auguste Bisson's portrait of a dog, which probably belonged to the painter Rosa Bonheur, Bisson's surrogate sister. Bisson sweetly framed the photograph in a sketch of a doghouse, a precocious example of homespun photographic kitsch.
Speaking of kitsch, there is an extraordinary hand-colored and engraved daguerreotype of a middle-aged man named Jean-Baptiste Meurice, the king of the Incas of Valenciennes, a local philanthropic society, a 19th-century French version of a Mummer, in elaborate regalia.
And then there is the anomalous daguerreotype of a man, unidentified, with his mouth open, which, like billions of modern family snapshots that have been lost or are thrown away, becomes a mystery of art untethered from its original source.
French scientists took to the daguerreotype more readily than French artists, for many of whom its exactitude seemed inartistic. The show includes scientific daguerreotypes of fossils, some incidentally artful, and documentary views of archaeological ruins and exotic locales. Baron Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros went to Greece and produced exquisite pictures of the Acropolis in Athens, where Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, another neglected daguerreotype master, made one of the great daguerreotypes in the Met's survey, a silvery, incandescent image of a palm tree. There is even a daguerreotype of brewer's yeast made through a solar microscope by Jean-Bernard-Leon Foucault.
Early daguerreotypists were like chefs, each tinkering with the standard recipe for preparing and developing plates and trying to devise new ways to streamline the photographic process. They had some success. Exposure times were sufficiently reduced that daguerreotypes came to record news, or glimpses of it: the funeral of the Duc d'Orleans in 1842, with Notre Dame in the background draped in black, and the barricades in the Faubourg du Temple, before and after the attacks during the revolution in 1848.
Wood engravers still had to copy daguerreotypes to make images that could be printed in newspapers, the caption "from a daguerreotype" accompanying the published prints giving these handmade images a new authority and veracity. "Because the medium of photography gives us reality stripped bare, without art," Etienne Serres, an anatomist, wrote at the time, the daguerreotype image had "a credibility that no other means could surpass."
I have left unmentioned until now the daguerreotype's other principal role, namely as a purveyor of pornography. The pornographic potential of the new medium was recognized and exploited instantly, as it would be more than a century later after the invention of the Internet. This is the first Met show in memory to include a stereoscopic peep show along with various photographs (erotic or pornographic or neither, depending on your perspective) featuring nude women, alone and in pairs, as well as one naked man, slumped in a chair, eyes straight ahead, looking dazed, as if he had perhaps just lost a game of strip poker.
Who knows whether this man was someone's erotic fantasy or an ethnographic case study or an artist's model. Various artists, if they didn't automatically dismiss the new medium of daguerreotypy, recognized the threat it posed to their livelihood, and a few capitalized on its potential as an aid to painting, a tool for storing visual information. (Ingres, for example.) A few photographers even tried to make art with it, staging mostly hokey tableaux vivants and composing landscapes. Choiselat, with a partner, Stanislas Ratel, produced a view of a cottage on a lake, whose flat geometry and mirror symmetry, as Mr. Daniel, the curator, points out, could have been made only by people acclimated to the visual peculiarities of a photograph. From this sort of picture evolved a whole way of seeing the world that we now call modern.
Although the daguerreotype had virtues that paper photographs did not, it, like Betamax, died because the marketplace had its own priorities. For a while daguerreotypy was a better medium than paper photographs, but the latter product soon offered greater convenience, economy and reproducibility. So daguerreotypes died.
But you might also say that in an age overrun by visual images, photographers today like Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth make spectacular color prints with digital means to recover something of the shock and amazement daguerreotypes must have provoked when people first saw them.
But the best early daguerreotypes, like Choiselat's view across the Seine, remain weirdly unlike any other photographs, with their own mysterious, ethereal space. From Daguerre's invention photography got the seeds of its talismanic aura: most people wouldn't casually rip up photographs of their loved ones because it is still commonplace to believe, if only unconsciously, that photographs somehow contain tidbits of the souls of their subjects.
That is completely irrational and superstitious, of course. But you can see where it comes from when you look at daguerreotypes. They are perfectly true to life and somehow not of this world.

"The Dawn of Photography: French Daguerreotypes, 1839-1855," remains on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 4.

Tougher Road For Playwrights
 On Monday, James Houghton, the artistic director of the O'Neill Playwrights Conference, sounded like a man preparing for the firing line -- and, in a way, he was. In two days, he was to speak at a specially called meeting filled with playwrights upset with him. His offense was eliminating open submissions from the process of selecting plays for the conference, the country's premier workshop for new plays, where writers like John Guare and Christopher Durang have cut their teeth. The new system would instead rely on nominators to find promising new scripts. 
 Every aspiring August Wilson in the country recognized the ramifications of this decision: it has become even more difficult for an unknown playwright without any connections to get his or her voice heard.
"I had to make a very tough decision," Mr. Houghton said. "But the bottom line is that between the bad economy, increased demand and limited resources, we can't sustain open submissions." Last year, Mr. Houghton shortened the conference, which takes place in Waterford, Conn., from five weeks to three and a half, with 4 writers in residence and 11 staged readings of new scripts. The conference, which receives both public and private money, still has a $700,000 debt. 
The response to this decision has ranged "from understanding to absolutely horrified," Mr. Houghton said.
"It's tragic," said the writer Adam Rapp. "Every playwright is utterly disappointed. If I wasn't able to submit 'Ghosts in the Cottonwoods' in 1996, I never would have become a playwright." Many authors wrote to the O'Neill decrying the change as a disaster for the American theater. At least one asked Mr. Houghton to resign.
On Wednesday, Mr. Houghton emerged from the meeting unbloodied, if exhausted. More than 100 writers, including Mr. Wilson and David Lindsay-Abaire ("Fuddy Meers"), attended the event; nonplaywrights were not welcome. By most accounts, civility was the surprise guest of the evening. "It got slightly heated," Mr. Houghton said. Several playwrights suggested that the O'Neill could continue open submissions using volunteers. But Mr. Houghton said, "This problem isn't going to be solved with a little bit of volunteerism." 
"I think people walked away with a better understanding of the severity of the situation," Mr. Houghton said, adding, "The fact that playwrights are angry is a good thing."

A Bigger Gene Pool
The newest artistic director in town was explaining the problem with classical theater in New York at the Cafe Edison last Friday. "The canon has shrunk," said Brian Kulick, who recently replaced Barry Edelstein at Classic Stage Company in the East Village. "We're being fed a steady diet of Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov. How many 'Twelfth Nights' can we see? We need something different."
Of course, there's a reason that "Twelfth Night" is produced so often. Shakespeare, besides being a nifty writer, also happens to sell tickets. Will more obscure classical writers find an audience in today's cluttered theatrical landscape?
Mr. Kulick admits to being a little nervous on this point. ("Mortified is more like it," he said.) But if his inaugural productions are any indication, he seems to have come upon plays that contain a few reliable crowd-pleasers -- namely, greed, revenge, violence and rank villainy. The First Look Festival, a series of readings that may or may not become full productions, features four top-drawer talents playing some of the grandest antiheros of the stage. 
The Tony-winning Ron Liebman kicks things off as Barabas in Marlowe's "Jew of Malta" on Oct. 1. Frances McDormand and F. Murray Abraham star in the Elizabethan "Arden of Faversham" and Ben Jonson's "Volpone" on Oct. 3 and 8, respectively. And just so you don't think Mr. Kulick has completely abandoned the Great Crowd Magnet, he includes a reading of "Richard III," starring John Turturro, Oct. 10 to 12.

Skinning the Cat
One of the first things Anthony Page had to decide after signing up to direct "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" was which "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" he wanted to stage. "There are three versions," Mr. Page said, "and they are all very good." 
Tennessee Williams's original is rarely produced today, and Mr. Page says it's the sparest and bleakest version. Elia Kazan had Williams make radical changes before the original Broadway production in 1955, adding, among other things, a redemptive conclusion for Brick, the alcoholic and possibly homosexual son. Mr. Kazan also had Williams bring back Brick's father, Big Daddy, for a final showdown in the third act. In 1974, when Michael Kahn directed Elizabeth Ashley as Brick's wife, Maggie the Cat, on Broadway, Williams sat in on rehearsals and rewrote the script again, removing some of Mr. Kazan's changes but keeping Big Daddy's late scene. 
For Mr. Page, the third time's the charm: he's using the Kahn version. "There's no doubt that the Kazan version was an improvement; it's dramatically richer," he said. "But the 1974 production removed the facile reformation of Brick. The end of the play is more ambivalent."
Last year, Mr. Page directed the play in London, to rave reviews, but it has been totally recast, except for Ned Beatty, who plays Big Daddy. Ashley Judd has replaced Frances O'Connor as Maggie, and Jason Patric has taken over for Brendan Fraser as Brick. "Jason has a much darker view than Brendan," Mr. Page said. "So I guess, in that way, it's closer to the first version."

Along the Way
* Joe Morton, who played the Brother in "The Brother From Another Planet," and Aunjanue (pronounced Ingenue) Ellis, who was Sistah Girl in "Undercover Brother," join the same theatrical family in the Manhattan Theater Club's Broadway production of "Drowning Crow," Regina Taylor's update of "The Seagull." It opens Feb. 19.
* Kirsten Johnson and Lili Taylor will star in the New Group's revival of Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan and Lemon." The first preview is Dec. 9.
