In 90 Minutes, 500 Years' Worth of Destruction

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Earth Day message from HBO is that America was a much pleasanter land when it was inhabited by more bison than human beings, and when none of the latter were white Europeans.
If pretentiousness were an ecological threat, "Earth and the American Dream" would face a heavy fine for fallout. Moving through 500 years of assaults on the environment in 90 minutes, Bill Couturie (who won an Academy Award for his 1989 documentary, "Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt," a work about AIDS) exploits visual effects the way American industry has exploited natural resources. 
 The program begins with highly unnatural-looking nature scenes that are meant to evoke the idyll that was supposedly North America before the invasion by the European horde. These are accompanied by portentous quotes from famous figures (Washington, Toqueville, Thoreau, Audubon) read in a somewhat hard-breathing way by even more famous actors (Edward Asner, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Burstyn, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Dustin Hoffman, Jeremy Irons, you name them).
The westward movement is pictured as an invasion, every ground clearing an attack on the environment. A few old photographs, particularly one of a man, presumably a buffalo hunter, standing like a conqueror on a small mountain of buffalo heads, make the point better than all the fancy shots of sparkling streams and splashing fish. One real picture is worth a thousand imitations.
The program picks up as the 20th century comes in, when by a striking use of newsreels and, later, television commercials, set to peppy tunes, Mr. Couturie catches America's unstoppable drive to produce and its insatiable capacity to consume, with small regard for the long-range cost. One generation's progress becomes another's problem. A picture of a pile of junked automobiles echoes that pile of slaughtered buffalo.
In the final minutes, the documentary goes global, hopscotching the world for catastrophe. It is a phantasmagoria of oil spills in Alaska, famine in Ethiopia, disasters in Chernobyl, Bhopal and elsewhere, to a litany of sound bites about global warming, toxic dumping and acid rain. (Pictures of the homeless are dropped in, although the connection between their troubles and global warming remains smoggy.) The prolonged conclusion offers prophetic preachments from friends of the earth like Rachel Carson and Jacques Cousteau, and ends, as it began, with an appreciation of nature by an American Indian.
Presenting American history from the perspective of the land itself, although no longer novel, can still be enlightening, but "Earth and the American Dream" suffers from videoitis, a tendency to lay on visual stunts to disguise the conventionality of the ideas. Still, what reviewer wants to come across as a fan of strip mining, clear cutting, ocean dumping, leaded gasoline and holes in the ozone? So, happy Earth Day.
 
'Adam Smith'
PBS, tonight at 8 P.M.
(Channel 13 in New York)
"Now that the cold war is over, do we need a Central Intelligence Agency?" The question is posed by tonight's timely edition of this lively PBS staple. The most definite answer comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The ever-eloquent New York Democrat says that since the agency has been "getting everything wrong for 30 years," this is a good time to hand out medals and send the snoopers into early retirement.
But others, like Adm. Stansfield Turner, a former Director of Central Intelligence, supports turning the agency's attention to economic intelligence, which he grants means spying on friends and allies, like Japan and Germany, who, no one doubts, are spying on American business. Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, also seems to be inclined toward some such effort.
The half-hour, dotted with pictures of lock picking and a shady-looking photographer at work, ends with the reminder that the Soviet K.G.B., by whatever name, is still busy. The hope is expressed by a Russian critic that for a change, it is spying on the United States economy instead of on its own people.

BYLINE: By Winston S. Churchill; Winston S. Churchill, grandson of the wartime Prime Minister, is a Conservative Member of Parliament.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
As a vast European tragedy unfolds a tragedy unprecedented in 50 years -- where is the Western political leadership that will halt this slaughter of the innocents?
Sanctions have not persuaded the Serbians to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan and honor a cease-fire. The case for Western intervention in Bosnia has become overwhelming. Margaret Thatcher may have been emotional in calling for military intervention against Serbians. But she struck a chord with millions. 
 It is no good that Western leaders wring their hands and shed crocodile tears as the butchery continues. They know that the Serbians began this conflict with a vast arsenal of modern weapons and a supply of ammunition sufficient for two years' fighting -- more than 10 times as much as the Muslims have. They also know that the consequence of imposing an arms embargo equally upon the victims of aggression, the Bosnian Muslims, and on the Serbian aggressors -- unprecedented in U.N. history -- is that the genocide will continue.
Nor is it just that women and children have become random victims of crossfires. There is abundant evidence that time and again atrocities have been deliberately inflicted on the civilian population, with little children being machine-gunned or bayoneted, old men shown no quarter and women slaughtered or kept to be gang-raped by Serbian forces.
Of course, all sides -- Muslim, Croat and Serb -- are guilty of atrocities. But overwhelmingly the perpetrators have been Serbian and the victims Muslim. So long as the U.N. policy of providing no more than food and care packages continues, requiring our troops to stand idly by while atrocities are committed, Serbians will remorselessly overrun Muslim towns and enclaves.
The grotesquely misnamed U.N. Protection Force, whose national contingents have done a magnificent job in bringing humanitarian aid and food and saving many thousands from starvation, has thus far been powerless to prevent Serbian forces from pursuing "ethnic cleansing." This policy may change now that Canadian troops in Srebrenica demilitarized the town yesterday.
Europeans and Americans are increasingly demanding action. But what, their leaders ask, can be done? For the West to become embroiled with ground troops would be a disastrous mistake. But no one is suggesting that.
What we can do first and foremost, with the threat of withholding European Community and U.S. economic aid to Russia, is to bring Russia, which has close links with the Serbians, back into line on this issue. Second, the Serbian Government and Bosnian Serbs must be given an ultimatum that unless they honor the cease-fire and accept the Vance-Owen plan, the West will lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, and launch air strikes against military targets in Serbia and Serbian artillery positions in Bosnia. Possibly this threat alone will be enough to bring them to heel.
But if not, the gulf war showed us how "smart" weapons can achieve military feats unimagined a decade ago. The West, with fighters and bombers stationed in Italy and the Adriatic, outside the range of Serbian retaliation, can dramatically alter the military situation on the ground and help decisively redress the balance.
It is time for the West -- with the European Community for once in the lead, as this is our special responsibility -- to decisively halt the massacre of Muslims. All that is required is moral courage and political will.

MEGO of the Year

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Occasionally a speech is written of such apparently stupefying dullness that it rates the accolade "MEGO of the Year." (MEGO is the acronym for "My Eyes Glaze Over.")
This year's award -- a half-lidded eyeball on a field of z's -- goes to Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, for his speech this week to the Economic Club of New York. Its stirring title was "Remarks," a come-on to become comatose. 
 You remember Alan, whose mournful countenance the cameras caught sitting next to the First Lady in the balcony during the President's Inaugural Address. I don't read any diminution of Fed independence into that; he thought he was going to sit way back in the Executive Box next to Alice Rivlin or some other functionary, and nobody told him he would be presented with the A-6 ticket in the front row inviting him to televised hand-holding with Hillary.
Greenspan's topic was inflation. At first, he acted unworried: "The inflationary pressures that so dominated the economic events of most of the last quarter-century appear largely, though not as yet wholly, subdued."
But then he wondered, in Fed-chairmanese, why long-term interest rates, though at the lowest level in 20 years, did not fully "reflect the benign view of long-term inflation" of a generation ago. This led to some really fervent rhetoric: "It is an open question," said Greenspan, "whether we have learned enough to skirt the dangers of budgetary and monetary excess that have triggered past episodes of debilitating inflation."
What he means, I think, is that the inflation premium built into the price of long-term bonds used to be 1 or 2 percent, and is now 4 percent. That curvaceous "yield curve" (not a description of Rosie Scenario's voluptuous hip) shows that investors still suspect that the Government isn't serious about holding down deficits and stopping inflation.
He's worried that if the political system does not cut deficits, preferably by reducing the growth of spending rather than by taxation, the whole burden of fighting inflation will fall on the central bank. This would require the high interest rates triggering recessions that infuriate voters -- which might cause a future Fed to cave in and print money like mad.
That sets up the key question: Is inflation on the way? The post-election revelation of President Clinton's urge to tax has been a bonanza for the "bond ghouls" -- those morbid souls who figure that new taxes will either reduce the deficit (good for bonds) or re-ignite recession (bad for everybody but bondholders).
Chairman Greenspan brushes aside "the recent firming in some materials prices" (translation: lumber is skyrocketing) and blames the weather for "the recent firming of wages" (overtime is way up). So long as banks are reluctant to lend, "it is difficult to envision inflationary pressures intensifying. . . ."
So we can relax? Nope: "we need to be especially vigilant not to be mesmerized," he warns, "by the current tranquillity of the inflationary environment."
O.K., let's help the chairman -- who in his dull way makes an exciting point -- unmesmerize:
1. Clintonites are regulators and environmentalists; that adds to costs to be passed on to consumers.
2. Whether it's a buck on a pack of cigarettes or a nickel on a can of beer, or an energy tax or national sales tax that pushes up the price of every product and service, the Clinton tax plan is inflationary.
3. Labor, which delivered for Clinton, wants a 20 percent increase in the minimum wage, special job protection for strikers and protection from foreign production -- all of which raises the price consumers must pay.
4. When you sock business with new mandatory health benefits to cover tens of millions of non-workers, you add to costs and prices.
5. The world economy is pulling out of the dumps, as our own has been; when plants operate at higher capacity, up go producer prices.
The only thing that could stop such cost-push inflation, if the Clinton economic plan goes through, is for the tax increases to trigger the Triple Dip. That prospect is welcomed only by bond ghouls and ballot ghouls.
Excuse me, usher, I thought I'd be sitting back in the 2 percent row of the Executive Box, but what's this number on my ticket? Four percent? Nobody told me . . .

Pollution-control companies find little to celebrate on Earth Day.

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
WHEN America's baby boomers elected one of their own, Bill Clinton, to the Presidency last November, he and his running mate pledged to put environmental protection at the top of their to-do list.
But for problems that may take millenia to fix, there's a temptation to put them off until tomorrow. And with bloodshed in Bosnia, holes in the health-care system, budget deficits and trade skirmishes clamoring for the Administration's attention, who has time to deal with the environment? 
 That's apparently what many Wall Street analysts have concluded, downgrading their 1993 earnings estimates on 12 of 14 companies that specialize in pollution control. "Environmental policy is likely to remain a low priority" this year, Vishnu Swarup, a Prudential Securities analyst, wrote recently.
Businesses are deferring hazardous waste and other cleanup projects, Mr. Swarup noted, awaiting guidance from policy makers. Washington, meanwhile, has been unsure how to proceed, aware that a rule-making spree could snuff out the economic recovery. Moreover, landfill operators are slashing prices before Bush-enacted regulations take effect in October. The rules are expected to drive up the operators' costs sharply, but the price-cutting is squeezing profits.
All in all, the regulatory haze gives green companies little to cheer about on Earth Day.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 24, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in the Market Place column of Business Day on Thursday, about Wall Street analysts' estimates of earnings for 14 pollution control companies, included erroneous data supplied by I.B.E.S. Inc., a financial research company, for Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. The data omitted reference to Wheelabrator's 2-for-1 stock split in January. Estimates for Wheelabrator have increased 1.9 percent since December.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Signs A Lease for 8 Floors At the Trade Center

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation announced yesterday that it had signed a 15-year lease to move 1,100 workers to eight floors of Tower One of the World Trade Center.
The move by the nation's second largest bank holding company was portrayed by bank executives and government officials as a vote of confidence in the Twin Towers after the terrorist bombing of Feb. 26. In the wake of the explosion in lower Manhattan, fears surfaced that security concerns would prompt many companies to move out when their leases were up and others to decide not to move in. 
 It was clear yesterday that the Port Authority, which owns the trade center, was forced to offer extraordinary incentives. Officials close to the negotiations said BankAmerica would receive two years' free rent, effectively giving it a square-foot rental lower than many other tenants in the towers pay.
The bank's decision to move workers from at least 10 other buildings in Manhattan followed weeks of rumors that it had changed its mind about moving into the tower after the bombing. Bank officials said at a news conference that it had looked at alternative buildings in New Jersey, Phoenix and California, and had, in fact, postponed any decision after the bombing.
But Dan Costello, the corporation's executive vice president in charge of real estate, said that after bank officials reviewed security systems in the World Trade Center, including improvements made since the bombing, they were convinced that the complex was "the safest building in New York, and perhaps even in the country."
BankAmerica executives announced their decision at a news conference attended by Mayor David N. Dinkins, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and other officials, who described it as a major expression of confidence in the troubled complex. "BankAmerica is sending an important message to the world that the World Trade Center is back," Governor Cuomo said.
Although not all details of the deal were disclosed, it was clear that the city, the state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had mounted an aggressive campaign for at least nine months to lure the company to the World Trade Center and prevent it from leaving Manhattan.
 
Sales-Tax Breaks
 The bank holding company, second in size to Citicorp, is to receive sales-tax breaks and other incentives from the city and state worth $15.5 million over the 15 years. The package includes a promise by New York City to buy some machinery and equipment to be used by BankAmerica.
BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, also said yesterday that it had signed a new 20-year lease and will retain 360 employees at the Bank of America Building at 335 Madison Avenue, near 46th Street. It will also retain 240 employees at 40 East 52d Street, the former Security Pacific Building. Its 1,700 Manhattan employees are in international banking, foreign exchange trading, stock trade processing and other operations.
Financial incentives have become all but routine in government efforts to attract and retain big business. In an example last year, Morgan Stanley & Company, which had threatened to move 4,100 employees to Stamford, Conn., received a tax-incentive package worth $39.6 million over a 10-year Manhattan lease.
But, according to people close to the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, it was deep concessions offered by the Port Authority that were most critical in attracting BankAmerica. The effort almost certainly created political conflicts for the agency since it is accountable to both New Jersey and New York and was courting a large tenant that might otherwise have selected a New Jersey office building.
After BankAmerica begins paying rent, authority officials said, it will pay between $25 and $35 a square foot. Though they declined to be more specific, they said the Tower One space would have brought 20 percent more in the robust years for Manhattan real estate in the mid-1980's.
It was unclear yesterday whether the Port Authority had offered the free rent before the Feb. 26 explosion, or whether BankAmerica used the uncertainty after the bombing to extract the further concessions.
BankAmerica had made a verbal pledge to lease its World Trade Center space by December, several officials said. But by the February blast, they said, that oral promise had not been made formal in a legally binding contract, and a legion of economic development officials set out on a fresh campaign to persuade the bank holding company to sign its lease.
With BankAmerica occupying eight floors of Tower One, authority officials said the complex would be 92 percent occupied. The rate is higher than before the explosion, when 88 percent of the complex was filled.
BankAmerica's committment to the complex comes at a time when most tenants in the buildings say life has returned almost to normal.
No large tenants have left the complex since the bombing. But because all are required to meet legal requirments of their leases and would lose money if they left before the leases expire, it is not known whether some will elect to leave when they have the option in coming months and years.
 
Not Back in Offices Yet
 One of the last remaining World Trade Center tenants that has not yet returned to its offices in the complex is Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, which has seven floors in Tower Two and moved 1,200 workers to other buildings in Manhattan. Because of the pressures of the government's April 15 deadline for filing income tax returns, the firm had said it had not plans to return to its trade center offices until after that deadline.
Yesterday, Paul Higgins, a Deloitte & Touche spokesman, said the firm had still not returned. The reason, he said, is that cleaning the firm's Twin Tower offices -- the Port Authority's responsibility -- had not been completed. He declined to say when the firm would return.
But other companies said their return to the trade center complex was accomplished without any snags.
"There are no lingering problems," said George Mullen, executive vice president of Fiduciary Trust International, an investment management concern, which returned with 500 employees to five floors of Tower Two on March 25. Since then, it has signed a lease for an additional floor for 45 employees.

HEADLINE: Russian Official Links Defense Chief to Illegality

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 22

 BODY:
Just three days before a referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's performance as Russia's President, Russia's top law enforcement officer today accused Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister of involvement in the illegal sale of military property in the former East Germany.
The charges against Gen. Pavel S. Grachev were made by Valentin G. Stepankov, the Procurator General of Russia, whose job is roughly that of an attorney general in the United States. They came only days after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who has broken with Mr. Yeltsin, accused various Yeltsin officials of corruption. 
 Since Mr. Rutskoi's speech, allegations of Government corruption have been the centerpiece of the anti-Yeltsin campaign before Sunday's referendum, which will offer Russians a chance to support Mr. Yeltsin and his vision of economic reforms or to repudiate them.
Mr. Rutskoi, a former air force pilot who has become the chief spokesman for the opposition, has announced his intention to run for President in any new elections.
 
Sale of Military Property
 In his speech to the Russian Parliament, Mr. Rutskoi concentrated in particular on assertions of the illegal sale of military property belonging to Soviet troops withdrawing from the former East Germany, suggesting an official coverup of the investigation. He promised to hand over his evidence to the Procurator General. Mr. Stepankov, who himself has been increasingly critical of Mr. Yeltsin and who spoke to the Supreme Soviet immediately after Mr. Rutskoi, acted quickly in what Yeltsin officials called a political maneuver.
In a statement issued to the Itar- Tass news agency, the Prosecutor General's office said that it had "discovered new facts of abuse of official position" by the commanders of former Soviet troops in Eastern Germany, known as the Western Group of Forces, and by officials in the Defense Ministry, "including Defense Minister Pavel Grachev personally."
 
Another Corruption Case
 General Grachev, who was in Siberia today reviewing troops, was unavailable for comment. He has urged the armed forces to maintain neutrality in the political struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Parliament. But General Grachev is regarded as an ally of Mr. Yeltsin, who appointed him, and the opposition is worried that Mr. Yeltsin may try to force through political changes after the referendum by threatening to use the army.
The prosecution statement also said that Gennadi Burbulis, a close adviser to Mr. Yeltsin who is despised by conservatives, would be questioned in another corruption case involving the smuggling of a substance known as "red mercury," which Western scientists regard as worthless.
It is not known if these charges will have any impact on the referendum due to take place across Russia on Sunday.
Mr. Yeltsin has admitted that some corruption exists, though not to the degree alleged by Mr. Rutskoi. But he criticized Mr. Rutskoi today for not submitting any documents on corruption sooner, "instead of accumulating them for months until the right moment and waiting for the referendum on the President to begin." Officials charged "should respond according to the law," he said.
In the four-question plebiscite, Russian voters will be asked if they trust Mr. Yeltsin as President, if they support the social and economic policies of his Government in 1992, and if they favor early elections for the Presidency and for the legislature.
Opinion polls suggest that between 55 percent and 60 percent of Russians will vote, with a small majority for Mr. Yeltsin and against new presidential elections, a small majority against his 1992 policies, and a more sizable majority for early legislative elections. The Russian Constitutional Court has ruled that the votes on early elections must pass with more than 50 percent of all registered voters, which is unlikely.

HEADLINE: U.S. Agrees to Discuss Arms Directly With North Korea

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Bowing to Chinese entreaties, the United States offered today for the first time to take part in high-level talks with North Korea to help resolve a crisis caused by North Korea's refusal to honor a treaty on nuclear weapons.
The offer, a substantial easing of the Administration's stance, was made largely at the behest of China, officials said. Until now, the Administration had urged that the standoff be resolved by the United Nations, and had warned of sanctions against North Korea. 
 If accepted by North Korea, the meeting, which was suggested by Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff during a visit to South Korea, would be the most direct dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang in more than a year. The proposal indicated the depth of distress over North Korea's continuing refusal to open its nuclear-weapons installations to inspection.
 
An Awkward Dependency
 Officials say the shift is the clearest indication of the degree to which Washington has sought Beijing's assistance in trying to put an end to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program.
Senior Administration officials say they have little option but to seek Chinese help. But other Government officials have expressed concern that relying on Beijing to help cajole Pyongyang could cause the White House to feel obligated to reward China by expanding trade, despite widespread criticism of its human rights record.
In his Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton criticized the Bush Administration for overlooking China's repressive policies, and Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation today that would impose strict conditions on China in return for privileged trade status. But Administration officials said it appeared unlikely that the White House would agree to such a strict approach.
The trade proposal, by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, would grant China most-favored-nation trade status only if Beijing improved human rights and bolstered efforts to halt the spread of weapons.
 
Calculating Tit-for-Tat
 In interviews this week, senior officials insisted that the Administration's decisions on China would be made without regard to Beijing's cooperation over North Korea. But they also said the need for Chinese help could grow most pressing as the White House neared a June 3 deadline to decide Beijing's trade status.
"The consensus is that China is the key to solving the North Korea crisis," said a senior Government official who is concerned that the relationship may be too close. "The obvious question is going to be how much influence that gives Beijing, and how it affects our China policy."
According to American officials, Mr. Tarnoff told President Kim Young Sam of South Korea today that Washington was willing to join in talks with North Korea. Mr. Tarnoff, the State Department's No. 3 official, said he would represent the United States.
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, later said that no meeting had been scheduled and no decisions made. But he said for the first time that the United States "would not rule out a meeting."
 
North Korea Wants to Talk
 Such a meeting would be the highest-level exchange between Washington and Pyongyang since January 1992, when the third-ranking State Department official in the Bush Administration met in New York with a leader of the North Korean Workers Party.
North Korea has sought new talks to reduce tensions between the two countries. But Washington's willingness to accept China's advice is surprising because Beijing remains a central obstacle to the economic sanctions that Administration officials believe may still be necessary to persuade Pyongyang to accept nuclear inspections.
Because China alone among the permanent members of the Security Council has threatened to veto such a measure, critics fear that the reliance on China will leave the White House unwilling to give offense to Beijing when it makes its trade decision.
 
A Nervous General
 But the Administration has clearly begun to grow wary about leaving North Korea feeling cornered.
Although a State Department official later described it as a worst-case scenario, the commander of United States military forces in South Korea said this week that he was "increasingly concerned that North Korea could slide into an attack" against South Korea.
The commander, Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, told a Congressional committee that Pyongyang's insular Government might launch an offensive "as an uncontrollable consequence of total desperation or internal instability."
Even though North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty six weeks ago, it remains obligated to submit to nuclear inspections until at least June 12. Administration officials have said that if more gentle suasion fails to lead Pyongyang to honor that commitment by late May, they will renew their quest for United Nations approval of punitive sanctions.
The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Friday that North Korea had in fact decided to honor the non-proliferation treaty, attributing the account to a North Korean diplomat in Cairo. But a senior State Department official said tonight that after numerous inquiries, the department had no information to corroborate the report.
The Administration protested loudly when Pyongyang withdrew from the accord, interpreting the action as a sign that North Korea was hiding evidence of its weapons program. As an indication of its new muted stance, however, officials pointed to a low-key statement the Security Council issued this month with Washington's support.
 
Treading Softly
 While the International Atomic Energy Agency had asked for assistance in compelling North Korea to submit to inspections, the 15-member body did little more than to declare that it was "concerned at the situation."
Such language is tepid compared to that used by the Security Council in the past to condemn Iraq's refusal to honor similar international commitments. But a senior official said the central role played by China had caused the Administration to "discard the Iraq template."
He declined to discuss where and when the consultations between American and Chinese diplomats had occurred, but he indicated that they had been extensive.
Senior Administration officials said they remained confident that Beijing shared Washington's unease about North Korean weapons, adding that they saw no reason why China would not serve as an honest interlocutor.

HEADLINE: Currency Traders Frantic Over Conflicting Information from Germany

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: LONDON, April 22

 BODY:
Market chaos surrounded the Bundesbank's announcement today of interest rate cuts, analysts said.
At least five news services, including Bloomberg Business News, ran urgent bulletins early today saying that German interest rates were not changed after the Bundesbank council meeting in Frankfurt. 
 A Bundesbank official, when asked about rate cuts after bank officials had met, said, "Nothing on rates," and that news was sent out. But a few minutes later, a press release detailing the rate cuts was handed out.
Those few minutes were enough time for traders to have bought or sold millions of dollars worth of currencies and other securities before the news services ran corrected reports.
 
 
'Could Be Improved'
 "We are not aware that we made any mistakes," the Bundesbank's spokesman, Manfred Kerber, said. "I might concede, however, that the procedure of releasing press releases at such press conferences could be improved."
Jeff Brooks, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said, "I would imagine a lot of people have lost a lot of money on this."
Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki in New York, said, "It cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for some people, maybe millions."
Mr. Soria said he sold dollars, basing his decision on the report that rates had been left unchanged, and then had to buy them back once the news was corrected.
A trader selling $10 million at an exchange rate of 1.60 marks to the dollar, who then had to buy back dollars to cover that trade when the dollar rallied, would have lost as much as $350,000 on the trade, calculations showed.
The dollar dropped half a pfennig to 1.5940 marks on the reports German rates had been left unchanged, only to rally as high as 1.6150 once it became clear interest rates had been trimmed.
 
 
Frantic Trading
 Alison Cottrell, an analyst at Midland Global Markets, said the clamor from the foreign exchange trading desk in her bank indicated that trading was frantic as conflicting news stories ran across traders' electronic news screens.
Officials at the Bank of France in Paris said they were surprised at the way the Bundesbank announcement was handled.
The French central bank announces interest rate changes through its money market repurchase operations, which it reports to news services by telephone, in theory letting all the services know the news at once. If the bank governor decides to cut interest rates outside the repurchase operations, the news is sent by fax simultaneously to news services.
The Bank of England has electronic feeds that it supplies to news agencies, supplying its own text on interest rate moves.
"People like the Bank of England seem to be well sorted, everything seems to come out at the same time," Mr. Brooks of Credit Lyonnais said.
The Bank of Italy, which cut its discount rate today to 11 percent, from 11.5 percent, after the Bundesbank move, announces its actions by telephone, beginning with the main Italian news agency Ansa, and calls other agencies in turn.
Traders have no redress against news agencies, which protect themselves by carrying disclaimers.
Because news services now operate on an instantaneous global basis, today's confusion affected markets worldwide.
 
 
'Chaotic in There'
 Trading volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as much as doubled, with the market plunging amid "fast market" conditions, meaning the market was moving so fast that up-to-the-second quotes could not be assured.
"It was chaotic in there," said John Lavender, a currency futures and options trader who trades for his own account. "There were a lot of unhappy people. And I'm sure there were a few people who got lucky and were on the right side."
An equity trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt said: "It was totally unexpected. There were rumors that both rates would be left unchanged and there was some selling on the futures, but with the cut, all hell let loose. It was total panic."

HEADLINE: 12 IN STATE DEPT. ASK MILITARY MOVE AGAINST THE SERBS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
In an unusual revolt against American policy in the Balkans, the State Department's top experts on the Balkans have sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher an impassioned letter that calls Western diplomacy a failure and recommends military action against the Serbs.
The experts, career diplomats serving in Washington, said in a petition to Mr. Christopher that the United States had a moral obligation to save the Muslims from "genocide" at the hands of Serbian nationalist forces in Bosnia. 
 "We are only attempting to end the genocide through political and economic pressures such as sanctions and intense diplomatic engagement," the letter said. "In effect, the result of this course has been Western capitulation to Serbian aggression."
 
Air Strikes Urged
 Senior Administration officials also said today that the American representative at the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, had sent the White House a memorandum urging air strikes to protect the predominantly Muslim towns and cities under siege in Bosnia.
If the European nations decline to take part, Mrs. Albright says, the United States should act on its own under existing United Nations authority. "We should not turn our backs on our international responsibilities," she wrote.
Taken together, Mrs. Albright's memorandum and the petition by the State Department experts provided a dramatic look at the internal debate in the Administration over whether to use American military force in the Balkans, and the degree of disagreement that remains after months of trying to frame a policy.
 
Meeting With Christopher
 The diplomats who appealed to Mr. Christopher, who included the desk officers responsible for virtually every Balkan country, are the sort of career officials who normally labor far from public view.
Mr. Christopher, who has been cautious in his public comments about military action, met with the State Department specialists on Monday, officials said.
Asked about Mr. Christopher's view of the meeting, a senior Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said: "Several Foreign Service officers who worked in the area asked to see the Secretary. He found the exchange helpful and timely given that the Administration is reviewing its options with respect to the former Yugoslavia. This Secretary of State does not consider such sessions a revolt against policy; he considers it a healthy part of the policy-making process."
The petition from the State Department specialists and Mrs. Albright's memorandum to the White House were described by officials on both sides of the debate over using force in the Balkans.
In her memorandum to the White House, Mrs. Albright argued that Western air attacks would reduce the military threat to the relief effort, slow the supply of arms from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs and demonstrate American resolve.
While President Clinton has said that he is not prepared to act unilaterally, Mrs. Albright argued in her memorandum that the United States already had sufficient authority to stage air attacks under the United Nations Charter and the Security Council resolution authorizing "all measures necessary" to deliver relief aid.
A spokesman for Mrs. Albright, Robert Nevitt, declined to comment on her memorandum, saying her advice to the President was private.
The petition to Mr. Christopher by 12 State Department specialists is highly unusual. The appeal to the Secretary was signed by the State Department desk officers for Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia, as well as other major officials involved in East European affairs and United States policy at the United Nations.
The drafter of the petition reportedly was Marshall Harris, the Bosnia desk officer. Other signers were Janet Bogue, Eric Rubin, Gordana Earp, Jon Benton, Jim Moriarty, Brady Kiesling, Ellen Conway, Scott Thompson, Drew Mann, John Menzies and Mirta Alvarez.
"It means the frustration level is high enough for them to undertake the somewhat risky tack of going around the normal hierarchy and stating their dissent," said a State Department official, who was not among the petitioners but who had learned about the effort.
"There are few people in State who believe the current policy is useful, consistent with our values, or has any prospect of success," the official said.
Mr. Clinton has been consulting with European allies over a range of options in the Balkan fighting, including lifting the arms embargo to the outgunned Muslim-led Bosnian defenders and air strikes against the Serbian attackers.
The Clinton Administration's debate has been brought to a head by brutal Serbian attacks on Srebrenica, a predominantly Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia. Under an agreement arranged through the United Nations, a cease-fire has been established, and Bosnian defenders are surrendering their weapons to the United Nations in exchange for a halt in the Serbian shelling of the town.
But some Administration and United Nations officials are concerned that the cease-fire may break down, and that the Serbs plan to press the attack until they sweep the Muslims out of their remaining enclaves in eastern Bosnia in their "ethnic cleansing" campaign.
 
Britain and France Wary
 Britain and France have been wary of military action, fearing that it would lead to retaliation against their troops serving in Bosnia with the United Nations force. But some senior officials, including the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, have said air strikes should be considered.
In the petition to Mr. Christopher, the State Department officials told the Secretary that they believed American policy toward Bosnia has failed.
"Today, Srebrenica is on the verge of falling, in part because we have failed to take forceful action against Bosnian Serb forces," it said, according to officials who have read the document. "We urge you to try to change the course of U.S. policy by advocating the use of military force to save these people and eastern Bosnia from the horrors of Bosnian Serb aggression."
The appeal said that without military intervention, the Bosnian Serbs would realize their goal of creating "an ethnically pure Bosnian state."
 
'Teach Would-Be Conquerors'
 A failure by the United States to take military action "would teach would-be conquerors and ethnic bigots throughout the world that their crimes will go unpunished," the letter said.
Discussing military force, the appeal called for lifting the arms embargo so the Bosnians can arm themselves. It also recommended that American air power be used to protect the Muslims in Srebrenica and urged the Administration to immediately determine whether air strikes alone could be used to destroy or drive back the Serbian forces threatening the Muslims.
As Mr. Clinton has reviewed his options on Bosnia, Pentagon officials have reached conflicting conclusions about the effectiveness of air strikes.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said he does not believe that air power alone would be decisive in halting the Serbian forces.
 
Aspin's View on Air Attacks
 But Defense Secretary Les Aspin has argued that the Serbian forces may be overrated and that air attacks might be effective in deterring Serbian attacks, Administration officials said.
Administration officials said the arguments by the State Department specialists had been echoed by other ranking officials in private communications to their superiors. But not all State Department officials involved in policy toward Eastern Europe agree with the group's recommendation for military intervention.
Still, the appeal from the State Department specialists, and the support it has received from officials who did not sign it, indicate that there is a schism between Mr. Christopher and his top aides and the key foreign service officers who are directly involved in managing American policy toward the Balkans.
The split is especially striking since Mr. Christopher has made an effort to include longtime Foreign Service officers in dealing with policy matters, unlike the Secretary of State during most of the Bush Administration, James A. Baker, who left many career Foreign Service officers out of key positions.
 
Balkan Update
 A tense standoff continued yesterday in the Muslim enclave of SREBREBICA in eastern Bosnia, with Serbian nationalist commanders saying that United Nations troops had made "a farce" of their effort to disarm the town's Muslim defenders.
In SARAJEVO, the United Nations Commander in BOSNIA, Gen. Philippe Morillon, gave assurances that the town and the United Nations contingent were safe."
In ZAGREB, Lars-Eric Walgren, the commander of United Nations troops in the Balkans, said his troops would use force to defend Srebrenica if it was attacked.
In WASHINGTON, President Clinton's hesitation in the Balkans created a diplomatic fissure in the Administration, with the United Nations Ambassador and State Department Balkan specialists urging the White House to use military force to stop Serbian attacks on Muslim areas.
In BRUSSELS, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations and a Russian envoy warned against quick military action in Bosnia.
NATO's Secretary General Manfred Worner, said he was ready to back tougher measures against the Serbs, but only they were was supported by the United Nations.
In TUZLA, in Bosnia, as Muslims and Croats continued to fight, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia urged former Muslim allies "not to be tricked" by the Serbs.
In BANJA LUKA, Bosnia, Serbs said they are preparing their final answer to the world on a peace plan for Bosnia.
In STRASBOURG, France, The European Parliament failed to approve a resolution that would have sanctioned the use of force to stop the war.
And in ATHENS, Lord David Owen, Balkans peace mediator, said he had constructive talks with Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis on ways to solve the name dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits jumped by 26,000 in mid-April, the first increase in three weeks, the Government said today.
The Labor Department reported that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 359,000 for the week that ended April 17, up from a revised 333,000 for the previous week. The department originally estimated that claims totaled 335,000 for the week that ended April 10. 
 Many analysts had expected claims to increase by about 14,000 last week, to what economists at Mitsubishi Bank in New York called a "more trendlike reading" after two weekly drops from a weather-related surge in late March.
Claims had dropped to 373,000 for the week that ended April 3 after shooting up by 32,000, to 379,000, for the week ended March 27.
The four-week moving average of jobless claims -- which many analysts track because it smooths out the volatility of the weekly numbers and more accurately reflects the labor situation -- also rose in the latest reporting period. It totaled 361,000, up from 358,000 a week earlier.
The report also said 26,021 applications were filed under a Federal emergency unemployment program for the week that ended April 10, up from 23,498 for the previous week.

HEADLINE: Perot Steps Up Attack on Clinton and Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Sharpening his attacks on the Clinton Administration, Ross Perot told the Senate Banking Committee today that he no longer believed that the North American Free Trade Agreement could be fixed through side agreements, as the Administration plans.
Mr. Perot also said that he would produce at least one and probably several half-hour television commercials criticizing the pact -- and implicitly, Mr. Clinton -- to be broadcast in the coming months. 
 Mr. Perot has emerged as a self-appointed gadfly on the trade pact, chastizing the Administration before Congressional committees. He has emphasized his split with Washington's political establishment by condemning the pact, which is supported by leaders of both parties, and appears to have struck an uneasy alliance with organized labor and conservative advocates of a more self-sufficient economy.
His opposition to the trade pact, and apparent willingness to spend money, threatens to make a daunting political battle even tougher for the White House. Labor and environmental groups have been campaigning against the pact, contending that it would encourage American companies to move factories to Mexico to take advantage of low wages there and to avoid pollution controls in this country.
 
Mounting a Pact Defense
 The Mexican Government and American business groups have responded by hiring at least a dozen lobbying and public-relations firms and preparing advertisements defending the agreement.
At a House Small Business Committee hearing on March 24, Mr. Perot said it might be possible to alter the three-nation pact to his satisfaction. But today he compared the agreement to a worn-out inner tube and said it was not worth patching.
In a brief interview after the hearing last month, Mr. Perot said, "I wanted to leave everybody and the Administration plenty of room."
Asked why he had initially taken one position and then changed it, Mr. Perot replied, "Frankly I was asked to give them plenty of room, and I did, and then I got tired of all you guys saying I wasn't specific."
Mr. Perot refused to say who might have made the request, and the White House refused to comment. But his remarks highlighted the delicacy with which both political parties have been handling him.
 
Warning About Lost Jobs
 The free-trade pact would eliminate import tariffs and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the banking committee and scheduled the hearing hearing today, has been the Senate's leading opponent of the pact for the last two years.
Mr. Perot said at the hearing that up to 2.9 million American jobs could be moved to Mexico if the free-trade agreement is approved by Congress.
Anne R. Luzzatto, the press secretary for Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said that the Administration believed the pact and three side agreements now under negotiation would "increase jobs for the American people and strengthen the economy."
The political diversity of the free-trade pact's opponents was illustrated by the trade experts who sat with Mr. Perot at the hearing. One was Pat Choate, a conservative critic of the influence of foreign lobbyists. The other was Lori M. Wallach, an aide to the consumer advocate Ralph Nader and a board member of Citizens Trade Campaign, a group of mostly liberal labor, environmental, consumer and religious groups that oppose the pact.
Ms. Wallach said the Citizens Trade Campaign was working with Mr. Perot's volunteers at the state level to oppose the free-trade pact. But she and Jim Jontz, a former Democratic Congressman from Indiana who is now the director of Citizens Trade Campaign, both appeared uncomfortable about being identified too closely with the wealthy Texas businessman and former Presidential candidate.
"There's no relationship, there's no agreement, it's a mutual interest," between the two groups, Mr. Jontz said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Nintendo's Dominance in Games May Be Waning

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 22

 BODY:
The game may finally be over for Nintendo, which reignited the video game boom in the 1980's and used it to become one of the most profitable companies in Japan.
That, at least, is the view of a growing number of analysts, including some longtime supporters of the Nintendo Company who are suddenly switching their recommendations on the company's stock from "buy" to "sell." 
 There is little prospect that Nintendo will have more years of hyper-growth, they say, explaining that the Kyoto-based company is facing a more saturated market, tougher competition from its archrival, Sega Enterprises, and a seeming inability to define its future technological direction.
 
Recommendations Change
 "I recommended people get out of Nintendo two weeks ago," said Chuck Goto, senior analyst at S. G. Warburg in Tokyo, who until then had been bullish on the company for three years. "I really think the long-term fundamental trend is changing for the company."
David Benda of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities shifted his recommendation to sell, from buy, on both Nintendo and Sega a month ago. He expects Nintendo to post revenue and profit growth of only 2 percent in the fiscal year that began this month.
Nintendo, once a manufacturer of playing cards, has been virtually immune to the recession that has sharply cut the profits of nearly every other Japanese electronics company. Revenues for the fiscal year that ended in March are expected to climb 10 percent, to 560 billion yen, or about $5 billion at today's exchange rates. Net income is expected to reach 86 billion yen, or $774 million, up about 1 percent from the previous year.
Nintendo's stock, too, has done relatively well, staying at roughly the 10,000-yen level throughout 1992 as Japan's overall market declined.
But since the beginning of this year, as the overall Tokyo stock market has risen more than 15 percent, Nintendo shares have fallen nearly 11 percent, to 9,560 yen today from 10,600 on Dec. 30.
Analysts do not foresee a collapse of the video game market, like the one that devastated Atari in the mid-1980's But they see the market growing more slowly and becoming subject to more competition. "The cake is getting bigger, but it's getting carved up by more and more people," Mr. Benda said.
The biggest competitor is Sega, based in Tokyo, which is best known for its Sonic the Hedgehog game. While Nintendo is still the market leader by far in Japan, Sega's Genesis machine has drawn roughly even with Nintendo's Super NES in the United States and Europe, analysts say. New competition looms as well, including the threat posed by 3DO, a Silicon Valley start-up.
The competition threatens the core of Nintendo's business, which is software. Outside software companies that develop games for Nintendo machines must allow Nintendo to manufacture the game cartridges. The software companies then buy the cartridges from Nintendo and resell them. This gives Nintendo a profit on each software package and accounts for the company's extremely high profit margins.
 
 
Stronger Alternative
 But with Sega's market share rising, some software companies may desert Nintendo or demand more favorable terms. Capcom, a leading software company known for its Street Fighter II game, has already said it will start developing games for Sega as well.
"I think software companies will start taking back more of their profit," said Mr. Goto of S. G. Warburg. For Nintendo, he said, that means "the fundamental profit-making structure is changed."
Another concern for analysts is that Sega seems to be beating Nintendo technologically. Sega scored its big gains in market share because it was first to market a 16-bit game machine, which offered better images than the 8-bit machine Nintendo was selling.
Sega is also selling a CD-ROM attachment for its Genesis machine, offering games with video images and better sound, while Nintendo has not yet said when it will introduce its CD-ROM player. Sega said this month that it would distribute video games electronically over the cable television systems of the two largest American cable operators, Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner.
Nintendo argues that there is no need to rush into risky technological adventures. Company officials say that Sega's cable television distribution venture may not succeed or, if it does, will only anger the company's retail distributors. And Nintendo says there is no need to introduce a CD-ROM attachment until there is good software available for it. A Nintendo official says the company thinks it can keep growing by selling more software to a growing base of machines.
But some analysts say Nintendo risks falling behind if it does not move faster with new technology. "Right now, I think they are lost," said Kaori Hasegawa, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
She agrees with the company that software sales can continue to propel the company's growth. She expects sales to climb 10 percent and net profits 14 percent, driven in part by a new hit game, Star Fox.
Still, Ms. Hasegawa is placing her stock recommendation on Sega. "Although Nintendo is still a growth company, it will not be a leader in the next generation of games," she said.

HEADLINE: By Pratt & Whitney's Math, Connecticut Costs Too Much

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 22

 BODY:
When Pratt & Whitney, Connecticut's largest private employer, said last week that it might have to close most of its state operations, it did more than send a shudder through the state's economy. It put a specific and startling price tag on just how badly Connecticut's business climate is out of step with its competition. 
 The company, which has made aircraft engines here since 1925, says the extent of Connecticut's competitive disadvantage is $6 to $8 an hour. That is how much more the company said it costs to pay a hypothetical middle-level manufacturing worker here, compared with the company's plants in Maine and Georgia. The figure includes fringe benefits, taxes and energy costs.
 
An Expensive Place
 Certainly, it scarcely came as news that Connecticut is an expensive place to do business, or that the state has lost tens of thousands of jobs from companies seeking cheaper havens.
But by putting Connecticut's cost differentials in such a stark light, the company has galvanized the debate over business costs in a way that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has not, for all his frenetic efforts to build what he calls "the New Connecticut."
State legislators said pressure immediately increased to pass a bill, now in committee, to overhaul workers' compensation laws. At a hearing today at the Capitol to discuss Pratt & Whitney, the talk centered on specific dollar figures: how the $6 to $8 an hour disadvantage could be reduced. The company has proposed a $2 pay cut for all union members across the board.
"I think we really have some lights going on here," said Peter M. Gioia, director of research for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business lobby group. "If people do see it for the real crisis it is and react to it, we'll be reducing those cost differentials."
Economists and business experts say that while the company has not opened its books to allow a check of its figures, the findings do not sound exaggerated. What their release has done, primarily, is transform what had been largely a theoretical debate into one of hard numbers.
What the numbers show, the experts say, is the legacy of years and years when holding down costs was simply not a priority -- partly because of the state's long-term dependence on the military, and partly because of regional quirks.
Energy costs in New England, for example, exceed most of the nation's, largely because New England has few power plants and so must import more electricity than it produces.
Higher costs for expenses like workers' compensation, which, according to Pratt & Whitney figures, run about 10 times more than the level per hour in Georgia, are simply the result of a system that started on a more generous footing and stayed that way. The average wage for a manufacturing worker in Connecticut, $513 a week, is about 38 percent higher than in Georgia, where wages average $372.40, according to figures from the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The maximum benefits for that worker if injured on the job in Connecticut are about 240 percent higher, at $769 a week, than the $225 that a counterpart would collect in Georgia.
 
The Loss of Cost-Plus
 Perhaps most crucially, economists say, is that companies like Pratt & Whitney thrived in Connecticut so long despite these higher costs because of the Pentagon. Under military procurement rules called cost-plus, local expenses became essentially irrelevant because the price of a product, whether a jet engine or a transistor, was arrived at by taking local production costs and adding the profit margin.
In Pratt & Whitney's case, the loss of military business has been particularly acute. In 1981, for example, the company built 1,700 jet engines, about half of which were under the cost-plus system for the military. This year, it will produce fewer than 600 engines, with perhaps only 80 going to the military.
With high-tech centers growing up in formerly low-skill states like Georgia and the old high-profit cost-plus system of military contracts drying up with the end of the cold war, Connecticut's higher costs -- hidden by years of prosperity and Pentagon accounting -- have been exposed as never before.
Industry analysts who follow Pratt & Whitney and its parent company, United Technologies, say that the Maine and Georgia plants, both nonunion shops, are also newer and rely more on labor-saving devices like robots than the older Connecticut plants. About 2,500 people work in Pratt & Whitney's plant in Columbus, Ga., and North Berwick, Me., compared with 17,000 in Connecticut.
As a rule, the newer factories have younger workers. Once, seniority and experience might have been in Connecticut's favor, but now that no longer seems to be the case.
"Age might have been an advantage in days when things were less computer driven, but not now," said John W. Adams, an analyst at Adams Harkness, a securities firm in Boston.
Connecticut still has the highest proportion of college graduates in the nation, as well as the highest proportion of technical workers in such areas as electronics, optics and aerospace, according to DRI/McGraw-Hill of Lexington, Mass., an economic consulting firm.
But other states, notably Georgia, are gaining fast. Over the last decade, Georgia had the third-highest rate of growth in high-technology jobs in the nation, at 6 percent a year, said Sara Johnson, a regional economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill. Connecticut, meanwhile, had the nation's third-worst record, a decline of 0.6 percent a year in its high-tech work force.
If Pratt & Whitney's previously announced layoffs take place this year, Ms. Johnson said, Connecticut will very likely lose its first-place ranking in technical workers. The company said that it expects that by New Year's Day 1995 it will employ at least 6,700 fewer workers in Connecticut than it did at the beginning of 1993.

HEADLINE: Officers Cleared in Slaying of Fleeing Man

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A Manhattan grand jury has voted not to indict two police officers in the fatal shooting of an armed man who ran from the scene of a brawl outside a 24-hour diner last month, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said yesterday.
The man, Bekim Ahmeti, 20, of 83 Continental Place in Mariners Harbor on Staten Island, was struck by four bullets -- one in the hand and three in the back of his body -- as he ran from the front of the Moonstruck Diner at 23d Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan at 5 A.M. March 20. 
 On the day of the shooting, a police account said Mr. Ahmeti, an unemployed doorman, had been shot in the chest and abdomen. But the following day an autopsy contradicted that account.
 
Assumptions Offered
 The chief of the District Attorney's trial division, Nancy Ryan, said yesterday that the grand jury apparently decided not to indict the officers -- Lieut. Michael Herer, 37, and Officer Joseph Dalton, 32 -- because "There was independent civilian evidence in this case that the deceased did, in fact, have a gun and that as he was running across the street he pulled his gun out and that he was turning in the direction of police officers." A .38-caliber revolver was found in Mr. Ahmeti's possession.
Asked how Mr. Ahmeti could have been struck in the back if he was turning toward the police, Ms. Ryan said she could only "assume what inferences the grand jury drew from the evidence," but that "there were officers at various positions all along the street, and the ones who hit him, one could deduce, were located at some point behind him."
Of the four bullets that struck Mr. Ahmeti, Ms. Ryan said: "One of those was actually in his right side, slightly to the rear. There was another gunshot wound to one of his hands, and then there was one wound above the left buttock and one above the right buttock."
Told of the grand jury's decision yesterday, a lawyer hired by Mr. Ahmeti's family, David Breibart, said: "You're kidding. Three bullets in the back and no indictment?
"The witnesses that we've spoken to, many of whom were called into the grand jury, gave us no indication whatsoever that they saw him pull a gun," Mr. Breibart said. "They saw the cops shoot him down in the middle of the street as he was running away." Mr. Breibart said he intended to file a civil suit against the city and the officers.
 
Brother Is Angry
 Mr. Ahmeti's brother, Shkelzen, 24, said the grand jury's decision would devastate their parents. "They murdered my baby brother," Mr. Ahmeti said. "All the witnesses, his friends, even two other women who were not with him, said they saw him with no gun. This is a whitewash."
A Police Department spokesman, Officer Andrew McInnis, saying the department had not received official notification of the grand jury's decision, declined to comment on it last night. Departmental guidelines say an officer can use deadly force to stop a fleeing felon only under certain circumstances, including when the officer has probable cause to believe that a suspect is armed with a deadly weapon.
The day after the shooting, Suzanne Trazoff, the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information, said Mr. Ahmeti might have run from the officers because he was on probation on a gun charge and did not want to be caught with the pistol, which was unlicensed. In February 1992, Mr. Ahmeti pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a deadly weapon after his arrest for shooting at some bus shelters on Staten Island. He received five years' probation.

HEADLINE: Environmental Group Assails Electricity Deal With Quebec

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Environmentalists in New York State and Quebec are trying to block renewal of a contract in which Consolidated Edison buys hydroelectricity from Quebec every summer, saying the deal helps finance dams that are destroying how Indians around James Bay live.
The environmentalists have proposed that instead of renewing the 15-year-old contract, New York should help Quebec use its electricity more efficiently. By doing so, they argue, New York would be able to buy the power saved and Hydro-Quebec, the utility owned by the Quebec government, would not have to build more dams. 
 But Hydro-Quebec, which is selling the power to New York, disputes the idea that the sales contracts have much relevance to its plans to build the dams in the sub-Arctic, hundreds of miles north of Montreal.
At the same time, company officials insist that the utility is already doing all it can to improve efficiency and is expected to spend $3 billion (Canadian) for energy efficiency programs over this decade.
"It's kind of cynical for someone consuming more energy to say there's something wrong here," Jacques Guevremont, a Hydro-Quebec official who has negotiated several purchase and sale contracts, said of environmentalists in New York.
 
Lawsuit Is Filed
 In another effort to block the sale of the power, a suit was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in New York City, challenging the legality of the New York Power Authority's agreement with Quebec. The suit was filed by two New York Congressmen, the Grand Council of the Cree Indians, individual citizens of New York and Vermont and several citizens' groups. The Congressmen, Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of upstate New York, and Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan, argue that the contract violates Article 1 of the Constitution, which forbids agreements between states and foreign governments unless authorized by Congress.
At the heart of the dispute are the lands that the Inuits and the Cree Indians have hunted and fished for thousands of years.
Environmentalists say that the hunting land in the James Bay area would eventually be flooded after new dams are built while fish would be tainted by mercury bleeding into the area from rocks in the area of the dam.
They also say that the wholesale price of electricity has fallen and demand has dropped, creating less of a need for the new dams. The environmentalists won a battle last year when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo rejected a deal that would have allowed New York to buy 1,000 megawatts of new electricity year-round from Hydro-Quebec.
 
'No Time for the Land to Heal'
 Matthew Coon-Come, Grand Chief of the Cree, pleaded his case last week at a news conference at the Natural Resources Defense Council headquarters in New York. "We have no time to adapt, we have no time for the land to heal," he said. "There's no way they'd be allowed to build a project of this magnitude down south."
Ashokh Guptah, an energy expert on the resources council, said New York could better help Quebec by encouraging greater efficiency there, which would allow for a "conservation transfer."
Energy efficiency programs are in place in many states, including New York, to cut the need for new construction, but the money is generally spent in that state.
Because electricity costs three times as much in New York as in Montreal, Mr. Guptah said, New York can afford to spend far more on conservation. New York could then buy the saved energy from Hydro-Quebec, which would not have to build the dams and risk damaging the environment.
 
Environmental Studies Begun
 But officials at Hydro-Quebec said the dams will not cause substantial damage. The utility, which has offered various benefits to the Indians including cash, public works programs and some jobs, has begun a variety of environmental studies.
Meanwhile, the New York Power Authority, which would buy 800 megawatts and sell 20 to Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, with the rest going to Con Edison, has asserted that the contract was economical and would cut air pollution in this country by reducing the need to burn fossil fuels.
Stephen Shoenholz, a spokesman for the authority, said that the price to Con Ed could fall to 4.3 cents a kilowatt-hour. Con Ed's other sources of power range substantially in price. It sells electricity to homeowners for nearly 14 cents a kilowatt-hour in summer.
The existing 15-year-old contract expires in 1998, and the renewal would pick up the next year and run through 2018. While the terms of the renewal have already been negotiated, the contract has an escape clause that allows either side to cancel between November of this year and November of 1994 if all the necessary regulatory approvals cannot be obtained.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
BANKAMERICA CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation reported a 60 percent rise in its first-quarter earnings, largely reflecting its acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation last April. Its net income of $484 million included a $12 million charge from accounting changes related to employee benefits.
Still, BankAmerica, which has been plagued by the depressed California economy, is one of the few big banks to report earnings below analysts' expectations. Net interest income from loans and investments at the nation's second-largest banking company fell 5 percent for the quarter, partly as a result of a modest decrease in loans and interest payments from Brazil in the previous period. Its trading revenue increased while its fees and commissions fell. 
 BankAmerica's portfolio of assets that it intends to sell declined by 30 percent, to $2.6 billion, for the quarter. The bank plans to sell real estate assets carried on its books at $723 million to a partnership controlled by Morgan Stanley. Credit losses during the first quarter declined by 40 percent from the fourth quarter, to $303 million. BankAmerica's profitability was modest, with a return on equity of 13.6 percent, down from 16 percent for the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Ad executives hear an impassioned warning against selling brands solely on their price.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

DATELINE: LAGUNA NIQUEL, Calif.

 BODY:
THE program for yesterday's general session of the 75th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies resembled nothing so much as auditions for a revival of "The Music Man" to play on Madison Avenue rather than Broadway.
The three speakers -- who seemed to be trying out for the Robert Preston role of Harold Hill, that consummate charismatic salesman -- alternately cajoled, flattered, provoked and exhorted the audience at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here with rhythmic cadences and alliterative phrases. 
 But in their versions of "Trouble," the pool-hall evils of River City, Iowa, were replaced by the menace that products sold solely on price posed to America's leading marketers of name-brand goods.
"The recession is not over, at least so far as consumers are concerned," warned James A. Taylor, managing partner and chief executive of Yankelovich Partners, a marketing and consumer research company in Westport, Conn. "They believe they are facing difficult times and they expect that to continue."
Exacerbating that threat to higher-priced brands, he added, is the "overchoice" that consumers perceive confronts them when staring at supermarket shelves.
Since "consumers are frustrated with the number of choices they're asked to consider when making the most trivial purchases," like gum, Mr. Taylor said, "they're opting for the simplest answer: the cheapest brand in the category."
Such behavior patterns, which Mr. Taylor called a manifestation of consumers' "downward nobility" of the 1990's, are reinforced by a growing willingness to consider retailers as "brand editors," he said. "They choose to believe the merchant understands their need better than the manufacturer."
Even worse, said Watts Wacker, managing partner and executive vice president at Yankelovich, "the only things consumers would like to have regulated more than advertising are things that will kill you," like hazardous waste.
That attitude results from "the accumulated impact of a lifetime of consumption," he added, which has produced a cynical market in which "there are no virgin consumers."
Larry Light, president of the Arcature Corporation, a marketing consulting company in Stamford, Conn., was the most emotional of the three would-be Harold Hills, blasting the growing obsession with selling a brand on its price instead of its image, benefits or performance.
"Brands do not have to die," he said. "But they can be murdered. And the marketing Draculas are draining the very lifeblood away from brands."
"Brands are being bargained, belittled, bartered and battered," he added, unleashing a torrent of B-words that caused the audience to buzz. "Market leadership can be bought through bribes. But enduring, profitable market leadership must be earned through building both brand value and volume."
"You do not build brand value by saying how cheap you are," he said. "You do build brand value by reinforcing how special you are."
A primary purpose of Mr. Light's speech was to proselytize for the Coalition for Brand Equity, an organization he heads as chairman. The coalition was formed last year by the Four A's, as the organization is known, the Association of National Advertisers and six media trade association.
"The enemies of brands have many guns in their arsenals," Mr. Light said, "but the builders of brands have not yet begun to fight."
He grew so emotional that not only did he declare at one point, "Thank God for the Coalition for Brand Equity," he appeared to choke up at the end of his address, when he said, "I plead with you" to make the coalition's mission "your mission."
All three speakers, like Harold Hill, offered the audience hope amid the gloom and doom. After all, as Mr. Taylor noted, "This is the year Charlie Brown hit a home run and won a ball game," referring to the uncharacteristic heroics of the "Peanuts" comic strip character.
Mr. Wacker stressed that advertising had an opportunity to help consumers who, as they increasingly declare themselves to be in charge of their own lives, are "looking for someone to delegate to, to edit what they need to know."
He cited advertisers that are successful in providing customers with "mastery of the basics," like Stouffer's Frozen Foods, with "consistency," like McDonald's, and those that are "fixing mistakes," like Saturn.
Mr. Light shared what he called "the best news of all: the consumer is on our side."
"In a world where trust is in trouble, consumers are looking for people, institutions, companies, retailers and even brands they can trust," he said. "They want reliable, dependable, trustworthy brand relationships. They want exactly what you should provide."
The meeting continues here through tomorrow.

Long Bond Yield 6.75% for Third Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year bond remained at 6.75 percent for the third day in a row yesterday with most of the trading action in shorter maturities.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 1/32 , to 10428/32 . The prices of Treasury notes rose from 4/32 for the seven- year note to 1/32 for the two-year note. The price of the 10-year note was unchanged. 
 Traders said the lowering of short-term interest rates in Germany did not have a major impact on bond trading. But they said that the fall of the dollar to its 11th record daily low against the yen in the last 16 trading days did lead to comments from the Japanese that helped send bond prices lower in foreign trading.
 
Effect of Stimulus Defeat
 There seemed to be little response to the fact that President Clinton's $16 billion economic stimulus program had been defeated by the Republican minority in the Senate. That could have been viewed as a positive for the market because bond traders had been worried that the stimulus program could push the economy ahead too quickly, igniting inflation.
But some traders suggested that the defeat might have made some investors think that getting the President's budget and deficit reduction plan approved would be more difficult. If this becomes the case, that would be a negative because it appears that some of the recent decline in interest rates has been based on the expectation that Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction program would be successful.
Prices and yields moved up and down sharply during the day, adding a lot of volatility to the trading. But they ended little changed as traders and investors seemed to be waiting for signs to give the market a new direction.
"We're really in a holding pattern until we get some more economic data to see how fast the economy is moving along and find out exactly what Mr. Bentsen's definition of radical is," said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, head of fixed income at S. G. Warburg & Company. He was referring to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's promise, repeated again yesterday, that the Treasury would not make any change in its borrowing mix that would make a "radical" shift from long-term to shorter-term borrowing.
Speculation that the 30-year bond auction in May may be skipped as part of the shift to shorter-term borrowing addressed by Secretary Bentsen has been running through the market.
 
Awaiting the Data
 The new economic data Mr. Leuzzi is looking to are needed so that investors and traders can decide how quickly the economy is growing. The reports for March have shown a sharp slowdown, but because much of that was caused by bad weather, there is doubt about the pace of growth.
If the April data signal slow growth again, prices of Treasury notes and bonds could move higher because there will be more confidence that inflation is going to remain in check. But signs that the slow March was only a blip could unsettle a market that is still just off its highs for the year in prices and lows in yields.
Yesterday's report that initial jobless claims rose by 26,000, to 359,000 in mid-April, did not have a major impact, although the jump was more than predicted in many forecasts.
In the morning, prices of the 30-year bond and Treasury notes fell as their was talk of a major selling, which made some decide that the market had finally reached the top. Overnight, bond and note prices weakened and yields rose as a Japanese official said that the fall of the yen against the dollar could lead to higher prices in the United States and maybe even force some Japanese investors to sell some of their Treasury securities, especially the 30-year bond.
 
Buying of Treasury Notes
 But by later in the day, prices had rebounded, in part because there were reports that the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury notes, most likely for foreign central banks.
Treasury notes were also aided, traders said, from buying by state and local governments. These governments do the buying as part of the process of paying off older higher interest rate debt. The Treasury securities are bought with new lower-interest debt and put into an escrow account to guarantee the payments on the old debt.
Daniel Callahan, a managing director in charge of government securities at Paine Webber, said that this buying of Treasury notes by state and local governments had made the intermediate sector of Treasury securities the leader of the market recently, a role usually held by the 30-year bond.
"Watching the bond is the wrong story," he said.
He noted that yesterday, the current 3.875 percent two-year note, which was auctioned last month, was at its highest price since it was auctioned.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Broadly Lower, Despite German Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Inaccurate news reports that Germany's central bank failed to cut interest rates touched off sharp swings in the dollar yesterday and misled many traders into money-losing transactions.
The reports early in the New York session were quickly corrected to show that the Bundesbank's policy-making council in fact had cut two key short-term rates. But market participants said many currency traders suffered significant losses because they initially sold dollars when they should have been buying. 
 Despite the rate cuts, the dollar ended broadly lower, dragged down by further appreciation in the Japanese yen.
Gold was mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery edged up 50 cents a troy ounce to $340. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $339.60 a troy ounce, up 35 cents.
The false news that the Bundesbank's policy-making council had decided to hold the line on interest rates caused the dollar to fall about half a pfennig, to 1.5940 marks.
Shortly after, the corrected news came out that the Bundesbank's policy-making council lowered the discount rate to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, and the Lombard rate to 8.5 percent from 9 percent. Lower German interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
 
'Blood on the Street'
 Traders scrambled to buy dollars, and the United States currency swiftly shot up about 2 pfennigs, to 1.6135 marks.
"There's plenty of blood in the street," a currency trader in New York said.
However, the dollar gradually retreated against major world currencies as the Japanese yen continued to march higher, mostly undeterred by reports of further interventions by the Bank of Japan during Tokyo trading.
The yen's advance was encouraged by new remarks by world leaders expressing support for the yen's increase as a way to reduce Japan's bulging trade surplus.
In addition, the market took another look at the German rate cuts and decided they were largely expected, analysts said.
"We came back off because the market isn't really overwhelmed by the fact the Bundesbank cut 25 basis points on the discount rate," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group, in Hoboken, N.J.

HEADLINE: Germany Cuts Two Key Rates

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, April 22

 BODY:
Answering calls from France and elsewhere to try to stimulate the sagging European economy, the German central bank again lowered two of its key interest rates today amid signs that Germany's recession had worsened substantially in recent months.
Symbolically at least, the Bundesbank's rate cuts, the second round in about a month, amounted to a German gesture of economic solidarity with France, its most important European partner, whose new Government has been bringing down its own interest rates and calling for the Bundesbank to cut its rates further. 
 The bank reduced the discount rate, the interest rate it charges commercial banks for short-term loans, to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent. The bank, which is not obliged to take instructions from the German Government, also cut a second important indicator, the Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling on money-market interest paid, to 8.5 percent from 9 percent.
 
Others Follow Cuts
 Long-term German interest rates have fallen to as low as 6.5 percent for some public issues.
The cuts are intended to stimulate economic growth by making it easier for German businesses to borrow money and for the authorities in other countries whose currencies are tied to the mark in the European Monetary System to cut rates, too. Belgium, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands all announced small reductions this afternoon.
Despite the rate cuts, the dollar ended broadly lower, dragged down by further appreciation of the Japanese yen. [Page D15.]
The bank's announcement after its meeting in Frankfurt came amid a flood of bad economic news. German officials quietly told news organizations that their economy, the engine of European growth, might shrink by as much as 2 percent this year. Last year, according to a Dun & Bradstreet study, 210,000 enterprises went bankrupt all over Europe -- some 57,600 in France, more than 62,700 in Britain and almost 10,000 in western Germany, in the most severe European recession since the early 1970's.
Mercedes-Benz A.G. announced that it had sold 32 percent fewer cars in the first three months of this year than during the corresponding period in 1992, and the German Economics Ministry conceded that pessimism in German industry was growing deeper. Faced with declining tax revenues, the German federal budget deficit could rise to as much as $43 billion this year, twice as much as expected, officials said.
The central bank announced that it had taken cautious action on interest rates after the new French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, had completed his first visit with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Mr. Kohl said that he and Mr. Balladur had discussed interest rates during lunch in the Chancellor's office, and that on the whole, the Bundesbank's cautious steps to reduce rates gradually over the last few months had been "positive."
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States welcomed the German move on interest rates.
Whether Mr. Kohl had pressed the French Prime Minister on trade issues as much as Britain and the United States would like was not clear. At a news conference, both men said they had agreed on the need to resolve the remaining issues holding up an agreement on global tariffs and trade as soon as possible.
"We all need GATT, but it requires readiness for compromise," Mr. Kohl said. Mr. Balladur said he hoped Germany would understand French concerns about agriculture. French rejection of a European compromise with the United States on agricultural subsidies prevented completion of an accord last year.
The Bundesbank's president, Helmut Schlesinger, said today that he expected to be criticized for not taking stronger action, but that continuing inflation and labor demands in eastern Germany for wage increases had forced the bank to continue its caution.
"Instead of setting clear investment signals with courageous interest rate reductions, the Bundesbank is prolonging the recession by its stubborn policy of tiny little steps," said Wolfgang Roth, a spokesman for the Social Democratic opposition.
Mr. Kohl's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, welcomed the Bundesbank's step as a move toward renewed economic growth.
Mr. Schlesinger said in an interview two weeks ago that the bank would continue reducing interest rates as it saw "maneuvering room" opening up, but only in gradual steps that would not undermine the credibility of its anti-inflation policies or the exchange rate of the mark on European currency markets.
"It's been at best a snail's pace," said Irgeen Rust, an economist with the Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Dusseldorf, speaking of the central bank's movement.
German inflation is running at 4.2 percent, higher than the Bundesbank would like. "If the economy is in such bad shape, you can't be worried about 4 percent inflation in the short term," Ms. Rust said.

CATERPILLAR INC. (N)

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. reported first-quarter earnings yesterday that were much better than expected, as the heavy-equipment maker reversed a loss from a year earlier.
The company, based in Peoria, Ill., said the turnaround was a result of a 19 percent increase in sales, especially in the United States; a buildup in dealer inventories; higher prices charged for its products, and lower costs for wages and benefits. 
 "It was a blow-out quarter" for Caterpillar, said Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York.
Caterpillar said that it expected all of 1993 to be profitable, but that the results would be dependent on the severity and duration of the recession in Europe, political and economic conditions in Brazil, and the strength of the American economy.
"We still have a long ways to go," said Len Kuchan, director of investor relations. "The U.S. economy is still improving, but it is in relatively early states of recovery."
Labor worries also hang over the company. While Caterpillar and the United Auto Workers ended a strike in April 1992, the two sides have yet to sign a new contract.

Mariners' Bosio Tosses No-Hitter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:

Mariners 7, Red Sox 0
Chris Bosio of the Seattle Mariners pitched the first no-hitter of the season last night -- a 7-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox at the Kingdome. Bosio, signed as a free agent after going 16-6 with Milwaukee last season, walked the first two batters of the game. He then went on to pitch the second no-hitter in the history of the Mariners' franchise.
The 30-year-old right-hander got several outstanding defensive plays from his infielders, including the last out when shortstop Omar Vizquel barehanded a chopper by Ernest Riles behind the mound. The last time Boston was no-hit was by New York's Dave Righetti on July 4, 1983, at Yankee Stadium. 
 With the crowd of 13,604 standing for the ninth inning, John Valetin led off with a routine grounder to short. Tony Pena then hit an easy grounder to third for the second out.
Bosio then got his no-hitter when Riles hit a slow grounder over the mound. Vizquel made a barehanded pickup as the ball bounced off the turf and his running throw nabbed Riles by two steps. The Mariners mobbed Bosio after the final out, the crowd cheering for several minutes.
Bosio's performance was all the more remarkable considering he was pitching on three days' rest. "That turned out to be good," Bosio said, and then referred to his manager, Lou Piniella. "At the beginning of the season I told Lou he could move me up if he wanted to because I've done it before. But this was last thing that I ever expected."
Bosio (1-1) got out of a jam in the first inning after walking Riles and Carlos Quintana to start the game. He got Mike Greenwell to hit into a double play and then, with Riles at third base, struck out Andre Dawson swinging. Bosio walked two and struck out four for his ninth career shutout.
He got an outstanding play from first baseman Tino Martinez in the third inning. Martinez fielded Riles's hard-hit ball on his knees and then threw to the pitcher to get the out.
Bosio pitched his no-hitter in his fourth start for the Mariners. He pitched two two-hitters for Milwaukee -- in 1987 and 1991. His gem came after Randy Johnson, who pitched Seattle's first no-hitter on June 2, 1990, against Detroit, beat the Red Sox, 5-0, on a four-hitter Wednesday night. Bosio threw 97 pitches, 60 for strikes.
 
Twins 5, Brewers 4
 A year ago, Jim Deshaies was unemployed, hanging out at the Milwaukee Brewers' extended spring training camp in Ahwatukee, Ariz., and hoping to catch a break. Yesterday afternoon, he showed the Brewers -- and every other big-league team -- what they could have had for next to nothing by pitching Minnesota to the victory over visiting Milwaukee.
Deshaies (4-0), the majors' first four-game winner, allowed five hits and two runs in six and two-thirds innings. The Twins scored two eighth-inning runs off Bill Wegman (1-3). And they needed them when Rick Aguilera gave up two ninth-inning runs before nailing down his fifth save.
 
 
Blue Jays 6, Royals 3
 David Cone, an $18 million free agent, dropped to 0-4 as a rookie, Pat Hentgen, pitched four-hit ball for eight innings to help Toronto beat the Royals at Kansas City. John Olerud and Paul Molitor each drove in two runs for the Blue Jays.
 
 
Angels 8, Indians 0
 The rookie J. T. Snow homered twice, giving him four in his last three games, and Chuck Finley pitched a two-hitter at home as California beat Cleveland. The victory gave the Angels a three-game sweep of the Indians.
 
 
White Sox 3, Orioles 2
 Chicago scored two ninth-inning runs on an error by center fielder Mike Devereaux and beat Baltimore at Camden Yards.
Gregg Olson (0-1) started the ninth by giving up singles to Robin Ventura and Bo Jackson. Ellis Burks, running for Jackson, moved to second on a wild pitch. Both runners then scored when Devereaux couldn't handle Dan Pasqua's liner to center. Pasqua was credited with a sacrifice fly.
 
Marlins 4, Braves 3
 Catcher Benito Santiago retrieved a bouncing pitch and tagged Otis Nixon out at the plate as he tried to score the tying run with two outs in the ninth, preserving Florida's home victory over Atlanta.
Trailing, 4-2, entering the ninth, the Braves made it 4-3 on Jeff Blauser's sacrifice fly off Bryan Harvey. After a stolen base and a walk, Harvey threw a 1-2 pitch in the dirt to Terry Pendleton that got a few feet behind Santiago. But he ran down the ball, lunged toward the plate and tagged out a sliding Nixon with his bare hand.
 
Pirates 5, Reds 4
 John Smiley had a rough return to Pittsburgh, allowing five runs in five and two-thirds innings as the Pirates rallied from a three-run Cincinnati first inning to beat the Reds. Just one night after reliever Rob Dibble fractured his left arm in a home-plate collision, the Reds lost outfielders Roberto Kelly and Kevin Mitchell with pulled hamstrings. Kelly left in the first inning and Mitchell in the fourth, and both are listed as day to day.
Tim Wakefield (2-2) pitched the Pirates' first complete game of the season, despite walking nine. The knuckleballer has walked 25 in 29 innings. It was the second time this season he has walked nine in a game.
 
Expos 3, Dodgers 1
 Darrin Fletcher and Wil Cordero hit run-scoring doubles in the eighth inning as Montreal beat visiting Los Angeles. With the score tied, 1-1, Larry Walker hit a one-out single off Orel Hershiser (2-2) and scored the go-ahead run on a double by Fletcher. Cordero then added his run-scoring double.
 
 
Padres 2, Phillies 1
 Andy Benes gave up one run in eight and two-thirds innings for his third straight victory and Bob Geren hit his first major-league home run since 1991, leading San Diego Padres past Philadelphia at Veterans Stadium.
 
 
Cardinals 5, Rockies 2
 Todd Zeile broke a 2-2 tie with a run-scoring single to highlight a three-run eighth inning as St. Louis beat Colorado at home. Ray Lankford led off the eighth with a triple off Gary Wayne (0-2). Zeile then lined a 3-0 pitch from Jeff Parrett for his second hit of the day. Tom Pagnozzi added a run-scoring single and Jose Oquendo squeezed home a run later in the inning.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Double Dutch
The Metropolitan Museum of Art came this close to making an important purchase recently.
The museum reached an agreement several weeks ago, people in the art world say, to pay $2.3 million for an 18th-century still life of flowers by the Dutch painter Jan van Huysum. The painting had hung for decades at Sudeley Castle, a stately home in Gloucestershire, England, owned by Lord and Lady Ashcombe. But at the last minute, in a move that surprised many experts, the Metropolitan changed its mind. 
 After the purchase had been approved by the museum's acquisitions committee, the Met's curators discovered that what is probably the original version of the work was hanging in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. This raised questions about the painting the Met was on the verge of buying: Was it a duplicate painted by van Huysum himself? Or a copy by another artist? Or was it even a fake?
It's not as though the Museum of Fine Arts had kept its van Huysum a secret. A photograph of the still life appears in the museum's catalogue of its collection as well as in a book of its masterpieces.
But somehow, judging by reports from in and outside the museum, neither of the curators involved in the Met's transaction -- neither Everett Fahy, who heads the Metropolitan's department of European paintings and who was the painting's original and principal supporter, nor Walter Liedtke, a curator in Mr. Fahy's department who is in charge of Dutch paintings -- were aware of Boston's possession, which is regularly on view in the paintings galleries at that museum.
Nor did they find out about it during several months in which the Sudeley Castle picture was at the Metropolitan, ostensibly to be scrutinized and researched by the Met's staff. The discovery was made only after Otto Naumann, a New York-based Old Master paintings expert, heard about the pending purchase and called Mr. Liedtke to tell him of the existence of the identical van Huysum.
What followed has been two weeks of scrambling by the Met, by Richard L. Feigen, the New York art dealer who was acting as the agent for the trustees of Sudeley Castle, and by art experts on all sides. Fingers have been pointed privately in all directions, not only at the Met's curators for not knowing about the existence of a similar picture in a nearby major museum, but also at Mr. Feigen, since dealers usually supply detailed information about what they sell. But Mr. Feigen, who says he was acting only as a middleman here, says he did not know about the Boston picture either.
 
The Experts Are Puzzled
 So far, the experts trying to agree on what the Sudeley Castle painting actually is have reached no consensus.
Mr. Feigen says he is waiting for Sam Segal, a renowned expert on Dutch paintings, to examine the two works side by side to see what the true story is. Because of poor health, Mr. Segal has not been able to travel for the last three weeks, Mr. Feigen said. But experts in Mr. Feigen's office, he said, have flown to Boston to view the work at the museum there and believe that the Sudeley Castle van Huysum is authentic. "It appears likely that this is simply another version by van Huysum," he said. "While the composition of the flowers is identical, there are slight differences in color; therefore it's not an exact copy. But until the two pictures are studied side by side, the whole thing is up in the air."
Peter C. Sutton, the Baker curator of European paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, disagrees. "I think it's a copy," he said in a recent telephone interview, referring to the Sudeley version. "There aren't any changes or adjustments, which are what is normally found in an authentic painting."
Mr. Sutton said that he had not seen the two works side by side, but that he had compared detailed photographs of the one the Metropolitan was considering with the van Huysum in Boston. "Our signature is subtler," he said.
Mr. Sutton called the painting the Metropolitan wanted to buy "an astonishingly high-quality studio work." But connoisseurship is a tricky business, he warned: "This kind of thing happens, but it's usually caught earlier."
 
'Our System Works'
 Experts at the Metropolitan, however, refuse to discuss the question of authenticity. Indeed, the Metropolitan does not wish to talk about the incident at all. At the museum's request, neither Mr. Fahy nor Mr. Liedtke would discuss the painting. Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, would say only: "The Met had thought about buying the picture but changed its mind. These things happen all the time. It shows that our system works."
Mr. de Montebello added that while the acquisitions committee, which meets four times a year, had approved the purchase, such approvals are "conditional and preliminary." He added, "Our trustees often authorize things, but it's always pending further study."
If the museum had bought the painting, Mr. de Montebello said, the money would have come from the museum's general acquisitions fund.
 
The Situation: Sticky
 Mr. Feigen, who thought the deal was done, is in a sticky position. "I've never encountered anything like this in my 36 years in the art business," he said. "It's amazing the Met didn't know. They had three and a half months to study it. I'm just acting as the agent. Had I been selling the picture directly, I would have had my research department study the work carefully."
Mr. Feigen said that when the picture arrived in the United States, it was terribly dirty, so dirty in fact that the signature was not even visible. So the dealer hired Nancy Krieg, a Manhattan-based restorer, to clean the work. Ms. Krieg said that at the time it had not occurred to her that there might be a problem. "There was nothing to set off alarm bells," she said. "The signature seemed correct and normal for an 18th-century painting. None of the pigments struck me as being out of sync." After it was cleaned, the painting was taken to the Metropolitan on Jan. 21.
"The fact that they did not know there was another version is an embarrassing mistake," said Mr. Feigen. "The Met backed out because they can't have a version of a picture that is in a sister museum only one hour away."
 
The Modern's Massive Gift
 Ronald Lauder has just bought "Intersection II," Richard Serra's monumental new sculpture, as a gift to the Museum of Modern Art. But until the museum finds a secondary exhibition space that can accommodate contemporary art of such an enormous scale, as it is eagerly trying to do, the Modern has no place to put it. "It will go in storage temporarily," said Mr. Lauder, who is a member of the Modern's board of trustees. "I think this is the most important sculpture of the last decade and felt there was only one place in the world for it and that's the Museum of Modern Art." Mr. Lauder is reported to have paid just under $1 million for the work, which was on view at the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo.
The sculpture is gigantic -- it is made of four 2-inch-thick gentle curves of hot-rolled steel, each 55 feet long and more than 13 feet high -- and weighs a total of 240,000 pounds. The work had been on view for five weeks at the Gagosian Gallery, a renovated garage on Wooster Street, where it barely fit into the ground-floor space. The sculpture was dismantled this week.
If the Modern tried to put it in the West 53d Street building, the only conceivable space for it would be the third-floor East Wing gallery. "It would clear the ceiling by less than a foot," said Kirk Varnedoe, the director of the department of painting and sculpture at the museum. "I've looked into engineering studies and am not sure if the floor could bear the load or how it could be rigged. But it will be one of the crowning glories of a different space for the Modern." Mr. Varnedoe added that putting it in the Modern's sculpture garden was out of the question since it would overpower other works already in place. Besides, both the curator and Mr. Lauder say they feel strongly that such a piece should only be shown indoors. "The power of it is the tension between the curves within the confinement of walls," Mr. Lauder said.
The gift is a very important acquisition for the Modern. "Getting a masterpiece like this would not have been possible were this not a promised gift," said Agnes Gund, the Modern's president. Ms. Gund added that finding an alternative exhibition space for the museum is "not just a dream on paper."
"We're working hard to find an off-site space," she said. "The curators, the trustees and friends of the museum are keen to find a space that will make sense for the 21st century. It will be something that won't be just an extension of the museum but a re-invention."
 
Christie's Expands
 Christie's is going retail, sort of. The London-based holding company of the auction house announced this week that it had bought Spink & Son, the 327-year-old antiques gallery on King Street adjoining the Christie's London premises. Christie's paid about $10.9 million for the business. It will run as a separate entity from the international auction house.
Spink specializes in Oriental works of art as well as British paintings. It is also an international auctioneer and dealer in coins and metals. In addition, the company designs and commissions the production of commemorative and campaign medals and orders. It has been looking for a buyer since 1990, when the recession hit the art market.
"We're not trying to put together brand names," said Christopher Davidge, Christie's chief executive. "If we look at the emerging economy in Southeast Asia as a new third market for Christie's, it makes sense. Spink has a high profile there and it will give us a point of contact and understanding." Spink's assets include a long-term lease for its building on King Street, adjoining the auction house, so Christie's now has long-term leases for buildings on the entre block bordered by King, Duke, Ryder and Bury Streets.
Some experts see the purchase as a potential conflict of interest since Christie's could possibly manipulate the market by putting higher estimates on works that Spink might sell at auction, if the gallery was trying to liquidate its inventory. Realizing the possible conflict, Lord Carrington, who is retiring next month as the chairman of Christie's, is heading what Christie's calls a compliance committee. "In the event any conflict of interest issues arise or any public perception of a conflict of interest, we felt this was important," Mr. Davidge said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole's Selfish Strut

 BODY:
"So, how do you think Clinton's doing?" One confronts that question everywhere these days. Except for his surprisingly worthy speech on the environment, the President has been in a blind stagger for several days. With Janet Reno's help, he made Waco a synonym for fiasco. On the economic-stimulus package, Mr. Clinton and his staff managed to make the Senate Republicans, usually a milling school of minnows, look like a pack of tiger sharks.
But the economic debate deserves a closer look. Mr. Clinton's sin was clumsiness. The Republicans' was one of indifference to the plight of working people and to untangling the economic wreckage left by the Reagan and Bush Administrations. So it's important to look behind the headlines congratulating Senator Bob Dole and his colleagues on their tactical brilliance in killing this Administration's $19.5 billion package. 
 In his time, Mr. Dole has groveled for Presidents of his own party (Richard Nixon) or treated them with contempt (George Bush). But his assault on the economic plan of this Democratic President shows us the essential Dole. He is a creature of the storm who is happiest when he can ride the wind of anti-Democratic oratory and strut about spouting platitudes on the obligations of opposition parties.
Mr. Dole wants to frustrate the President's effort to manage the economy. Fair enough, if Mr. Dole had a stronger idea or better record. But look at his history. As Senate majority leader, he helped Ronald Reagan launch his deficit rocket. During the Bush years, when unemployed families all over America and on the plains of his native Kansas were suffering, Mr. Dole and his party stood for the most grudging of remedies -- temporary extension of jobless benefits, with nary a bow toward creating jobs that would make the benefits unnecessary.
Now the Senator has seen to it that Mr. Clinton's modest attempt to spur the economy has been knocked off track in favor of the same shopworn idea about temporarily stretching out payments to the unemployed. Sure, by including $2.5 billion of pork-barrel projects in its stimulus package, the Clinton team handed Mr. Dole a weapon. But it wasn't just Mr. Clinton who got whacked with that club. Mr. Dole gave a good thrashing to the poorest, weakest and most undefended Americans, who might have profited by its job programs and by a stronger economy.
Mr. Dole, of course, had his stated reasons. He didn't want to add to the deficit he helped lift off.

HEADLINE: Bold Stroke in Japan's Retailing Art

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Takashimaya, the Japanese department store chain, is opening a much-awaited specialty store today on Fifth Avenue in New York City that will challenge American notions of what a store is.
If it succeeds, not only will it change the conventional wisdom about store environments, it will also reverse the poor showing of Japanese retailers in the New York market. 
 Shoppers will not be able to dash through the heavy glass doors to buy lipstick, a purse or some perfume. On the ground and second floors, Takashimaya is selling culture.
In what many in the retail business consider a risky departure from protocol, Takashimaya has filled the first two floors with a soaring atrium and art gallery instead of the cosmetics bars, hosiery racks and jewelry cases that are staples of the American store landscape. Customers will take stock of fantasy landscapes in ink on paper and surreal photos printed on linen -- all for sale -- before they reach the collection of unusual home furnishings, jewelry, decorative items and accessories for sale on the third, fourth and fifth floors.
"Of course we have some concerns about the first two floors," said Corliss Tyler, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for Takashimaya New York. "We have a very short window of opportunity to catch a New Yorker's attention, but we think we have the means to do it."
She added, "And jewelry and cosmetics on the main floor are tired concepts anyway."
In addition to the art, which will change periodically, the atrium of the 20,500-square-foot store, between 54th and 55th Streets, will incorporate merchandise related to gardening and decorating patios and terraces. Rustic Japanese rice scoops are displayed as jardinieres, and scissors used to trim bonsai trees are presented as elegant substitutes for clunky gardening clippers.
Some retailing experts say America may be ready for stores that break the mold. Several said the combination of unusual merchandise in a fresh setting might distinguish Takashimaya from the rest of New York's pack of luxury goods retailers.
"Why do something everyone else is doing?" said Randall E. Gebhardt, principal in the Retail Marketing Group, a consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio. "That's what's wrong with a lot of American retailing today. The time may be more right for that kind of adventurous retailing than at any other time."
The concept may also set Takashimaya apart from other Japanese retailers that have tried their hands in New York without much success. Despite their wide acceptance in Europe and East Asia, these retailers have failed in the United States either because they tried too hard to imitate American stores or they carried merchandise not easily incorporated into American life styles.
But will harried American customers take the time to smell the flowers? In a recent study on retailing trends by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a market research company, consumers indicated that time-saving convenience was their top priority in shopping.
They also, however, expressed a hankering for entertainment in stores, and it is to that yearning that Takashimaya's art gallery and unconventional merchandise may appeal. "People are looking for fantasy and entertainment from retailing more than sports events these days," said Watts Wacker, Yankelovich's resident futurist.
From bargain-basement discounters to trendy boutiques, retailers across the United States have been struggling to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Decades of knocking off one another's best ideas have led to intense and crippling price wars as sales promotions have become the only way to establish differences between store chains.
Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, noted that Galeries Lafayette, the French department store company that has a store on 57th Street, has fared poorly in New York because it has failed to distinguish itself from American rivals in the neighborhood. "It has run into a stone wall of competition because it hasn't turned out to be very different," he said. "Its prices aren't even so different, so why should I shop there instead of at Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's?"
For a Japanese retailer, daring to be different is unusual. Japanese businesses tend to be extremely wary of taking risks, and department stores in Japan typically spread their risks by sharing profits and losses with manufacturers and distributors, according to Larry R. Katzen, a partner at Andersen Consulting who has closely studied Japanese retailing. As a result, Japanese retailers have learned to live with much slimmer profit margins than their American counterparts.
But Takashimaya's margins are more stable than most American retailers'; since at least half of its merchandise is exclusive to the store, it can use pricing to protect profits.
Takashimaya is not the only Japanese retailer interested in making a run at the New York market. Felissimo opened on 56th Street just before Christmas. And Mitsukoshi, Japan's oldest department store chain, had planned a 40,000-square-foot store for 57th Street and Park Avenue, but postponed the opening because of the weak American economy and a somewhat saturated market for luxury goods, said Katsuhiko Nitta, vice president of Mitsukoshi U.S.A.
"We got the word from our headquarters in Tokyo to wait and see, and we're still waiting," Mr. Nitta said.
Takashimaya opened its first store in New York in 1958 and has had a presence here ever since, although its most recent location was a corporate office that also housed the home decorating and interior design services for which the company is known.
Jiro Shinohara, president of Takashimaya U.S.A., said he expected the new store to post about $15 million in sales this year, and he noted that business was not exactly booming in Japan these days.
"New York is still the No. 1 consumer city," he said. "And we are not thinking about the short term. We are thinking more about the 21st century, actually."
And Felissimo, a retail branch of a Japanese mail-order company, is doing very well despite initial fears that the recession would hamper sales, according to Haruko Smith, the store's director.
 
 
Tearooms, Too
 Like Takashimaya, Felissimo has an art gallery (albeit on the fourth and top floor of the store, in traditional Japanese style) adjacent to a tearoom. Ms. Smith said the store had recently added a lunch menu and installed a jewelry department on the same floor to help draw customers to the gallery. Takashimaya plans a tearoom for its basement this year.
While Japanese retailers have in the past ended up catering to the Japanese expatriate community, Ms. Smith said about 95 percent of Felissimo's customers were American.
"Most people are surprised by our Japanese connection," she said. "We do see quite a few Japanese businessmen -- but they just come to see the store."
Takashimaya's Japanese origins are evident in its name. But Ms. Tyler is determined to make her buyers' finds functional besides having curiosity value.
The store will sell chopsticks with a display that demonstrates how they can serve as a alternative to a salad fork. Rough-hewn wooden boxes used to raise silkworms will be featured as planter boxes. And Japanese kimono fabrics turn up in lingerie sets and men's vests.
"This is a store," Ms. Tyler said. "We're not trying to create a museum or a Japanese cultural center."

HEADLINE: An Issue of Bonds From Albany Is Given Moody's Highest Rating

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 23

 BODY:
Saying that it was heartened by New York State's improved financial position, an important Wall Street credit agency today gave its highest rating on a relatively small, but closely monitored, portion of the state's debt.
The agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., said that the improved rating, MIG1, the highest for the state since 1990, reflected the fact that New York ended the most recent fiscal year with a surplus of $671 million and that it was borrowing far less than in previous years to cover its spring expenses. The higher ratings could translate into lower interest payments on the state's debt. 
 At the same time, Moody's refused to upgrade New York's ratings for two other important types of bonds that account for the bulk of the state's more than $23 billion in long-term debt. It left the rating for bonds backed by legislative appropriation at Baa1, which ranks the state in a tie with Louisiana and ahead only of Massachusetts. It is barely above the level for high-risk, or junk, bonds. And it left the rating for those bonds that must be approved by voter referendum at A, the second lowest in the country, ahead only of Louisiana.
Today's new MIG1 rating, Moody's highest grade for short-term debt and an increase from last year's MIG2 for a similar offering, affects only $850 million in short-term notes that the state intends to borrow to cover spring operating expenses and that it must repay within a year.
Standard & Poor's Corporation, the other major bond-rating service, is expected to announce its rating on the short-term notes next week.
State officials immediately heralded the new rating as evidence of the state's fiscal comeback. "I have said that New York has been successfully fighting its way back from the punishing effects of the national recession," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in a statement.
But George W. Leung, a managing director at Moody's, warned that the new rating reflected only a thin slice of debt and was far from a ringing endorsement.
"These are very narrow issues that you focus on for these short-term notes," Mr. Leung said. "Over the long term, there still needs to be structural reform."

HEADLINE: Cesar Chavez, 66, Organizer of Union For Migrants, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT LINDSEY

 BODY:
Cesar Chavez, the migrant worker who emerged from the poverty of an agricultural valley in Arizona to found America's first successful union of farm workers, was found dead yesterday in San Luis, Ariz. He was 66.
Mr. Chavez, who lived in Keene, Calif., and was in Arizona on union business, died in his sleep, the local police said. An autopsy is planned. 
 Blending the nonviolent resistance of Gandhi with the organizational skills of his mentor, the social activist Saul Alinsky, Mr. Chavez captured worldwide attention in the 1960's. Leading an initially lonely battle to unionize the fields and orchards of California, he issued a call to boycott grapes that soon became a cause celebre.
Mr. Chavez, who was described by Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 as "one of the heroic figures of our time," was widely acknowledged to have done more to improve the lot of the migrant farm worker than anyone else.
Fighting growers and shippers who for generations had defeated efforts to unionize field workers, and later fighting rival unionists, Mr. Chavez for the first time brought a degree of stability and security to the lives of some migrant workers.
Largely because of him, the California Legislature in 1975 passed the nation's first collective bargaining act outside Hawaii for farm workers, who are largely excluded from Federal labor law coverage. "For the first time," Mr. Chavez said when asked to describe the union's achievement, "the farm worker got some power."
Asked what had motivated his stubborn fight, he said, "For many years I was a farm worker, a migratory worker, and, well, personally -- and I'm being very frank -- maybe it's just a matter of trying to even the score."
But he ultimately failed to realize his dream of forging a nationwide organization. In most of America, farm workers continue to toil for low wages, without job security, vulnerable to exploitation. Even in California he found it difficult to translate the early triumphs of what he called La Causa into a viable labor organization.
The union that Mr. Chavez founded, the United Farm Workers of America, became troubled by dissent and other problems and was unable to organize more than 20 percent of California's 200,000 farm workers.
The tactics that he used so effectively in the 1960's and early 70's -- strikes and boycotts, fasting and the long march -- eventually lost their magic. And, as the United Farm Workers were no longer seen as a social cause but as a conventional labor union, he was disappointed by the disaffection of politicians and other supporters.
 
Gains From Unionization
 In 1965, when he formed the union, farm workers in California averaged less than $1.50 an hour. They had no fringe benefits, no seniority rights and no standing to challenge abuses by employers or exploitative labor contractors.
Unionization brought sharp pay increases. For the first time, migrant workers were eligible for medical insurance, employer-paid pensions, unemployment insurance and other benefits, and they had a mechanism to challenge employer abuses.
And the union's impact extended far beyond its membership. The threat of unionization by Mr. Chavez raised agricultural wages throughout California.
 
Born On Arizona Farm
 Cesar Estrada Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, near Yuma, Ariz., the second of five children of Juana and Librado Chavez. His father's parents migrated from Mexico in 1880.
His early years were spent on the family's 160-acre farm. But in the seventh year of the Depression, when he was 10, the family fell behind on mortgage payments and lost its farm.
Along with thousands of other families in the Southwest, they sought a new life in California. They found it picking carrots, cotton and other crops in arid valleys, following the sun in search of the next harvest and the next migrants' camp.
Mr. Chavez never graduated from high school, and once counted 65 elementary schools he had attended "for a day, a week or a few months."
Beginning with the Industrial Workers of the World at the turn of the century, unions tried for decades to organize immigrant unskilled workers, first Chinese, then Japanese and later Filipinos and Mexican-Americans, on whom California growers depended. But the field hands, their organizing drives vulnerable to the competition of other poor migrants seeking work, found themselves fighting not only powerful growers, but also the police and government officials.
In 1939 Mr. Chavez's family settled in San Jose. His father became active in a successful effort to organize workers at a dried-fruit packing plant, giving Mr. Chavez his first glimpse of workers taking collective action.
After World War II, in which he served two years in the Navy, Mr. Chavez resumed his life as a migrant. He married Helen Fabela in Delano, which he later made famous far beyond its dusty corner of the San Joaquin Valley.
Besides his wife he is survived by eight children, 27 grandchildren, a great-grandchild, three brothers and two sisters.
The pivotal role in Mr. Chavez's emergence as a labor leader was played by Mr. Alinsky, the Chicago-based organizer who described himself as a "professional radical." In the early 1950's he helped Mexican-Americans organize into a political bloc.
Mr. Alinsky sent an aide to recruit potential leaders, and among the first people he met was Mr. Chavez, then working in a San Jose apricot orchard.
Mr. Chavez joined Mr. Alinsky's Community Service Organization, registering Mexican-Americans to vote and helping them deal with government agencies. But he later criticized the organization as dominated by non-Hispanic liberals, and in 1958 he quit, went to Delano and formed the National Farm Workers Association.
 
Five Years of La Huelga
 By 1965 Mr. Chavez had organized 1,700 families and persuaded two growers to raise wages moderately. His fledging union was too weak for a major strike. But 800 workers in a virtually moribund A.F.L.-C.I.O. group, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, struck grape growers in Delano, and some of the members of his group demanded to join the strike.
That was the beginning of five years of La Huelga -- "the strike" -- in which the frail labor leader, who was 5 feet 6 inches tall, became familiar to people in much of the world as he battled the economic power of the farmers and corporations in the San Joaquin Valley.
With its charismatic leader, song-filled meetings and the fundamental appeal of its struggle, depicted as a downtrodden minority battling an exploitative oligopoly, Mr. Chavez's organization reminded many old-timers of the industrial battles that they had waged generations earlier.
He was shy and not an outstanding public speaker. But he showed a humility that, with his shyness and small stature, piercing dark eyes and facial features that hinted at Indian ancestors, gave him an image as a David taking on the Goliaths of agriculture.
Mr. Chavez's style was monastic, almost religious. He said his life was dedicated only to bettering the lives of the exploited farm workers. He was a vegetarian, and his weekly salary of $5 was a virtual vow of poverty. Articles about him often spoke of his "saintly" and even "messianic" qualities.
Soon, priests and nuns, college students and unionists from around the country marched with Mr. Chavez. Supporters sent money for La Causa. Most of the farm workers who enlisted had meager resources and were asked to pay only the dues they could afford, often only a few cents a month.
Borrowing from Gandhi, Mr. Chavez sometimes went on fasts or invited arrest to call attention to his battle with the growers. But he ran the union along authoritarian lines.
With music and singing and hundreds of fluttering flags bearing the union's symbol of a black eagle on a field of red, union rallies had the quality of ritual. Typically, Mr. Chavez arrived late at the rallies, appearing to a roar of approval after a musical group had played and other speakers warmed up the audience.
In 1968 he began his most visible campaign, urging Americans not to buy table grapes produced in the San Joaquin Valley until growers agreed to union contracts. The boycott proved a huge success. A public opinion poll found that 17 million Americans had stopped buying grapes because of the boycott.
On July 30, 1970, after losing millions of dollars, growers agreed to sign. It was probably the high point in the union's history.
More successful boycotts and organizing successes followed, but soon many of the largest growers, in an effort to stave off Mr. Chavez's union, invited the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to organize their workers. Mr. Chavez complained that the teamsters were signing "sweetheart contracts," and before long his hard-won gains in Delano seemed to be slipping away.
More growers, many charging that the United Farm Workers was poorly run and undependable, signed with the teamsters. But two things kept his dream alive: First, the teamsters' leaders, smarting from charges of corruption, made a truce.
Second, Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat who had marched with the farm workers before his election as Governor in 1974, won adoption of the state Agricultural Labor Relations Act, a landmark bill establishing collective bargaining for farm workers and granting the union concessions. Among these concessions was a "good standing clause," which in effect permitted union leaders to deny work in the fields to any worker who challenged their decisions.
The teamsters virtually abandoned the fight against Mr. Chavez in 1977. In the years that followed, the United Farm Workers signed occasional contracts with growers but never attained the dominance that Mr. Chavez envisioned. A decade after the Delano strike, fewer than 10 percent of the grapes in that community were harvested by his union's members.
In the mid-1970's Mr. Chavez, who had built a commune-style union headquarters called La Paz in a former sanitarium in Keene, near Bakersfield, began to complain that "spies" were trying to undermine the union.
This occurred after Mr. Chavez befriended Charles Dederich, the founder of Synanon, a drug rehabilitation organization. Some Chavez associates said Mr. Dederich advised him to be autocratic. Soon, Mr. Chavez purged the union of non-Hispanic officials.
After Mr. Brown's departure from the governorship in 1983, Mr. Chavez battled with the successor Republican administration of George Deukmejian, whose campaign was backed by the growers. In 1983, Mr. Chavez, expressing determination to recapture the union's momentum, revived the use of the boycott, directed at nonunion table grapes and Salinas Valley lettuce.
By the end of 1985 growers said the high-tech boycott was having little effect on sales.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
CLINTON CONSIDERS BOSNIA AIR STRIKES; SEES ALLIED ACCORD

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he was giving "serious consideration" to air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina amid indications that Britain and France were softening their opposition to military intervention.
Asserting that "other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position," Mr. Clinton said that he would complete his policy review on the Balkans within the next several days and that agreement among the allies was likely. "I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to," he said at a news conference. [Excerpts, page 7.] 
 Officials from Britain, France and Canada have long opposed air strikes or the lifting of an embargo against weapons shipments to the Bosnian Muslims because those countries have ground troops stationed in the Balkans and fear retaliation.
 
View Has Changed
 But during meetings with Administration officials in recent days and in interviews, British and French officials have said they are now convinced that Washington will feel compelled to take some military action soon. They have indicated their preference for air strikes over other options, like lifting the arms embargo for the Bosnian Muslims.
Key Administration officials have also increasingly begun to see limited air strikes in the Balkans as their best remaining option.
European foreign ministers are to meet this weekend in Copenhagen to discuss possible options in Bosnia. A United Nations Security Council team arrived today in Zagreb, Croatia, on a fact-finding mission to last several days.
 
Awaiting Russia's Vote
 In addition to awaiting the results of these meetings, the Clinton Administration was also not interested in taking any new steps against the Serbs before the referendum Sunday in Russia on President Boris N. Yeltsin's performance. Mr. Yeltsin has feared that new action against the Serbs could reverberate against him.
Mr. Clinton, who reiterated his opposition to sending American ground troops to Bosnia, said that any new policy would require "heavy consultations" with Congress; but a senior Administration official said these should be considered to be only routine discussions, not a signal that a final decision has been made to pursue military action.
"If the United States takes action, we must have a clearly defined objective that can be met," Mr. Clinton said. "We must be able to understand it, and its limitations must be clear. The United States is not -- is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war."
Mr. Clinton offered few clues about what his final policy would be; but his words suggested that he was contemplating military intervention aimed at limited goals like forcing a cease-fire, freezing the current military situation or protecting declared "safe havens" from attacks from any military force in the area.
By speaking of the need to avoid partisanship, the President seemed to indicate that the United States was not contemplating broader strategic strikes that might be aimed at destroying the Serbian military or rolling back Serbian territorial gains.
Mr. Clinton spoke at a news conference called by the White House to provide him with a forum to discuss his first months in office as the 100-day mark approaches.
Mr. Clinton addressed the question of military intervention in Bosnia at a time when his Administration is embroiled in a debate over how forceful the United States should be in trying to stop the fighting in the Balkans.
Mr. Clinton said that he had made no promise to hold off action until after the voting in Russia is completed, but that Russia must play a significant role in any action that affects the Serbs. Moscow has supported the Serbs in the past, and they are still considered allies by some Russian politicians.
Malcolm Rifkind, the British Defense Secretary, who had previously opposed the use of military force in the Balkans, said this week in Washington that air strikes "clearly would be an important and powerful signal to the Serbs that the international community is increasingly concerned."
Mr. Rifkind, who met on Thursday with Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and with Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, also said, "The spectrum of possible activity ranges from warnings to the Serbs to the hard brutal use of physical force."
Mr. Clinton said a final decision on what steps to take would be made when a policy review is completed during the next several days, but the measured tone of his comments indicated that he is still weighing the international and domestic ramifications.
"We're not at the endgame yet," a senior Administration official said.
Calling the situation in Bosnia "the most difficult foreign policy problem we face," Mr. Clinton said the United States must lead other Western nations in the drive to end ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.
"That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful," he said. "I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way, consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties, we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing, and that is the -- obviously, the difficulty we are wrestling with."
His comments drew quick support from one of his most vocal critics on domestic politics, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. In a television interview, Mr. Dole said he would back Mr. Clinton if he chose to use targeted force in Bosnia with the cooperation of allied nations.
"I don't think we just act unilaterally, even if we are the only superpower left," the Republican leader said. "I think we have to have international support. But I think this will be a time to test whether or not President Clinton is persuasive enough to make the case to our NATO allies."
 
Consensus Evasive
 But Mr. Clinton is having considerably more difficulty in winning consensus in Congress on aid to Russia and seemed today to have lost some of his confidence about his ability to win support for the new aid that he pledged at the Vancouver summit.
In response to a question, he said the outcome of that aid package, which requires Congressional approval, would depend in part on how well his own plans to increase domestic spending fare.
"The question is: Can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress?" Mr. Clinton said. "And that is a question, I think, that will be resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future."
Mr. Clinton's comments on the future of the Russian aid package reflected some of the new caution seen in his assessment of the difficulty he encountered trying to break a filibuster over his economic stimulus plan.
Mr. Clinton said he is open to developing a new approach to win some of the battles he lost so publicly during the last few weeks.
"What I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate -- Republicans or Democrats -- is: What could I have done differently to make it come out differently?" he said. "Because the real losers here were not the President and the Administration. The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton News Conference: 'The U.S. Should Lead' on Bosnia

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today, as transcribed by The Associated Press:
Q. Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the Western response to the bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate. A holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel, asked you yesterday to do something, anything, to stop the fighting. Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites? 
 A. Well first, let me say, as you know, for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action.
And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three months. Since I became President, I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on enforcement of it; on the humanitarian airdrops; on the war crimes investigation; on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process.
We have made some progress and now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution. . . .
I think we should act. We should lead. The United States should lead. We have led for the last three months. We have moved the coalition. And to be fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part, and they have troops on the ground there.
But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?
A. I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level. I think it is without precedent or peer in human history.
 
Holocaust 'to the Nth Degree'
On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree. The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them, solely because of their ethnicity, is an abhorrent thing, and it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups lived side by side for so long together. And I think you have to stand up against it. I think it's wrong.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency -- the tragedy in Waco, defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia. What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently?

 	 	 		. . .	 	A. You know, I don't really believe that the situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I don't know that the Administration could have made it different. On the stimulus package, I think -- I'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this hundred days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American Government.
We have abandoned trickle-down economics. We have abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from one trillion to four trillion dollars in only a decade.
The budget plan which passed the Congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates. There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper credit.
That's going to put tens of billions of dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very, very good for the country. And so we are moving in the right direction economically.
 
Regret on Stimulus Package
I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the Administration but the people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that. Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics, part of it was the difference in ideas.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. (inaudible) -- Waco, Texas?
A. Well, with regard to Waco, I don't have much to add to what I've already said.
I think the -- I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into. I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that. I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over. But I still maintain what I said from the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh. And I do not think the United States Government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves. And I'm sorry that they killed their children.
Q. Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people in your tax policy. He was strongly critical of your stimulus package. He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement. How are you going to handle his political criticisms? Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan? And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill?
A. Well, let me answer that question first. We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days. I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and the others to see what we can do about that.
With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found that rather amazing. I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot. I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I would -- go back and read his book and his plan. There's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts. We raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy. But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute. You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis. The United States is the last remaining superpower. Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally?
A. Well, the United States -- surely you would agree that the United States, even as the last remaining superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations.
Q. Well, many people think that you have a mandate --
A. They do, and that is one of the things that we have under review. I wouldn't -- I haven't ruled out any option for action. I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there. We are not. So we are reviewing other options.
But I also would remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there. They have been justifiably worried about those. But they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions, they welcomed the American delegation now in Europe working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.
So I'm not -- and I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position. And I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for concerted action that goes beyond where we have been. I don't -- I don't have any criticism of the British, the French and others on that.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations. Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now-enhanced expectations?
A. Well, I don't know about that, and I don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.
But I'll tell you this. I believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of non-discrimination. I believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it.
 
Views on the Gay Issue
I believe we need the services of all of our people, and I have said that consistently, and not as a political proposition. The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston. I was just asked a question about it.
And I might add that it's interesting that I have been attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America. When I was Governor I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, getting back to the situation in Bosnia. We understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable. But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves, and to initiate some limited air strikes, perhaps to cut off supply lines.
Without telling us your decision -- presumably you haven't made any final decisions -- on those two options, what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind -- right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision?
A. I'm reluctant to get into this. There are -- those are two of the options. There are some other options that have been considered.
All have pluses and minuses. All have supporters and opponents within the Administration and in the Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy.
I do believe that on the airstrike issue, the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action apply there. If you take action, if the United States takes action, we must have a clearly defined objective that can be met, we must be able to understand it, and its limitations must be clear. The United States is not -- is not, should not become involved as a partisan in a war.
With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the question obviously there is the -- if you widen the capacity of people to fight, will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace or will it lead to more bloodshed, and what kind of reaction can others have that would -- that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy? But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options we have.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Sir, do you think that these people who are trying to get into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war, and we have -- we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam, and now many of them are coming up with bills on the treatment of Agent Orange. How could we afford to go to any more of these wars?
A. Well, I think that's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there. But we are, after all, the world's only superpower. We do have to lead the world.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on airstrikes or any other kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday, and in general how has his political situation affected your deliberations on Bosnia?
A. No. I have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that. We never even discussed that, interestingly enough. The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States, and I'm sure the rest of the free world, very much appreciated.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, since you said that one side in the Bosnian conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot take a partisan view in this war?
 
Stand Against Ethnic Cleansing
A. Well, I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against. That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful.
I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way, consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties, we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing. And that is the -- obviously, the difficulty we are wrestling with. This is, clearly, the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our allies face.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?
A. Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of all, we passed the budget resolution in record time. That was the biggest issue. That confirmed the direction of the Administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of which come from the highest income people in the society, reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class whose incomes were going down while their taxes were going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion. The total national debt and the deficit continue to go up.
We have a 20-year low in interest rates for home mortgages. We have lower interest rates across the board. We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt.
We have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different.
The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the Governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing opportunity.
We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform, on campaign finance, and lobbying reform.
And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own Administration's officials.
These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the campaign, but with turning the country around. The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the Federal Government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country.
We are working on a whole range of other things. The welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work. And, of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans. So, I think it's amazing how much has been done. More will be done.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, the Tailhook Report came out this morning documenting horrendous and, you know, nearly criminal conduct on the part of the Navy. How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?
A. First let me comment a little on that. The inspector general's report details conduct which is wrong, and which has no place in the armed services. And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Aid to Russia
Q. Mr. President, to go back to Russia for just a minute, the latest polls show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence, but there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms. Can you live -- well, can you live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid.
A. I believe -- the answer to your question is that for the United States, the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election. If he wins the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their president, then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly and put his prestige on the line against the free trade agreement, N.A.F.T.A. How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement, and when do you expect to see it accomplished?
A. I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future. You know, our people are still working with the Mexican Government and with the Canadians on the side agreements. We're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.
Q. Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners. General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic, he believes that it was incorrect. Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue? And more broadly, do you believe that in fact the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris peace accords?
A. . . . As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let me say that the Government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian document's claim.
I do not know whether that is right or wrong, but we are having it basically evaluated at this time. And when we complete the evaluation, we'll tell you, and, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were P.O.W.'s.
Q. If I could follow up on that, before the U.S. normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved, or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that, well, it may take years to resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith?
A. Well, a lot of experts say you can never resolve every case, you know, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them, and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved going back to the Second World War. But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time and that there was a complete, open, and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases.
 
A Clarification on Bosnia

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia? You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces. Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir?
A. Well, I said ground forces.
Q. You said ground forces?
A. Correct.
Q. Could I ask you, sir, if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there?
A. I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore. I've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.
Q. Mr. President, with hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend? Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities?
A. No. I -- because I -- and basically, I wouldn't do -- participate in other marches. I think once you become President, on balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should be done.
But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, a position -- a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now.
And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here asking for a climate that is free of discrimination, asking basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that and just that. And that's always been my position, not only for the gays who will be here but for others as well.
Thank you very much.

 BODY:

The Economy
Orders for big-ticket factory goods slumped 3.7 percent in March, a widespread decline that was the biggest in 15 months, the Commerce Department said. The report further dampened analysts' hopes for stepped-up economic expansion. [Page 37.]
Vehicle sales continued to strengthen in mid-April, with domestic auto makers reporting a healthy 19.5 percent gain. [39.] 
 Moody's upgraded its rating on a relatively small but closely monitored portion of New York State's debt, saying it was heartened by the state's improved cash position. [28.]
 
Companies
R. H. Macy is searching for an expert merchandiser, after serving as a training ground itself for legions of young merchants. Executive recruiters say the company's task will not be easy. [37.]
I.B.M. has established its information storage unit, Adstar, as a wholly owned subsidiary. It named Ed Zschau, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and ex-Congressman, as the operation's chief. [39.]
Consumers are buying even the most modest of products with the same discretion once shown only big-ticket items like air fares, computers and designer clothes. The result: a growing popularity of cheaper private-label products and the likelihood that price wars among consumer goods could lead to further consolidation. [37.]
Travelers has agreed to pay more than $80 million to settle a lawsuit filed by pension funds over its management of a real estate investment account. [36.] An unorthodox cancer test used by Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance to screen some applicants has increasingly come under fire. [36.]
Robert Mondavi Winery intends to go public with an initial stock offering of 3.7 million shares. [39.]
A U.S. District Court judge refused to dismiss a bondholders' suit aimed at blocking a plan that would split Marriott. [39.]
Harris Corp. said it had named Phillip W. Farmer president and chief operating officer. [39.]
 
International
Commerce Secretary Brown pressed Japan to agree to measurable goals for increasing its purchases of American products. But he also said during a visit to Tokyo that the target need not always be a specific share of a Japanese market. [37.]
The World Bank said it had reached an agreement to help finance a $1 billion project to increase Russia's oil output. [4.]
 
Markets
The stock market continued its melancholy decline, with the Dow industrials off 15.40 points in a fifth straight losing session. Even the most notable gainers, the gold stocks, seemed to be caught up in the gloom, with traders bracing for political upheaval because of the Russian referendum tomorrow. [37.] Gold futures prices jumped to a six-and-a-half-month high. [48.]
The dollar declined in heavy trading against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen. [48.]
Treasury bond prices fell amid perceptions of political turmoil in Russia and problems for the Clinton economic plan. [46.]
 
Your Money
People with large damage claims can turn to public adjusters, who review insurance contracts to make sure no aspect is overlooked. In return, they receive an average of 10 percent of settlements, giving them an incentive to obtain the most for clients. [35.]
 Neighborhood banks are offering a baffling array of mutual funds, intent on keeping depositors from wandering. But funds offered by banks usually come with higher charges than no-load funds. Allen R. Myerson: Investing. [35.]
Finding treasures in the attic may be easier than identifying them and getting an idea of their worth. Jan M. Rosen: Assets. [36.]

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Change in Tax Rule That Scuttled Baird Nomination

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
President Clinton is seeking a change in the decades-old Social Security tax laws that were a factor in dooming Zoe Baird's nomination as Attorney General.
In a letter that the White House made public today, Mr. Clinton told Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that he had asked officials from the Treasury Department to examine alternative proposals. 
 "It is clear that the law has been misunderstood by many well-intentioned people," Mr. Clinton wrote in the letter, dated April 19, "and as a result, compliance has been inadequate. The financial threshold in the law is outdated, having remained unchanged for the past four decades. It is time to amend the law."
 
Request From Senator
 Mr. Clinton was responding to a letter nearly two weeks ago from Mr. Biden, a Delaware Democrat, who asked the President to "set forth a policy governing all nominations, communicating your own views on the issue as it relates to qualifications for government service."
Under a law that took effect in 1950, employers must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for every household worker who is paid more than $50 in a calendar quarter, even teen-agers who baby-sit. The unemployment insurance tax is due if the worker is paid more than $1,000 in a quarter.
The law has hardly ever been enforced, and scofflaws are usually not punished.
But the law became the subject of great public debate when Ms. Baird was forced to withdraw, largely because she had employed a nanny and chauffeur who were illegal immigrants and had failed to pay the required taxes. Since then, Administration officials have been unsure whether to appoint to lower-level posts other people who may have also violated laws relating to household and part-time workers.
 
'The Nanny Problem'
 Several potential Administration officials were later deemed not eligible for jobs because they had what White House officials described as "the nanny problem."
In the letter, Mr. Clinton said he was seeking to simplify the reporting requirements and increase the dollar threshold of people who would have to pay Social Security taxes.
The changes would more likely affect people who had temporary workers rather than situations like that of Ms. Baird, whose employees were hired on practically a permanent basis.
"I believe that a past failure to comply does not necessarily preclude a qualified person from serving the Government," Mr. Clinton wrote, "and that is, indeed, the policy of this Administration."
Mr. Clinton said he had instructed Howard Paster, his chief lobbyist with Congress, to give Mr. Biden details of a new proposed policy.
In a letter to Mr. Biden that is also dated April 19, Mr. Paster offered more details about how the White House wants to change the policy. But it lacked specifics of how the policy would be carried out.
Mr. Paster referred to "considerable confusion" over whether job candidates were disqualified because they had hired domestic workers.
"This confusion may have been exacerbated by news accounts that have led some to conclude that past failure to comply with any employer's obligation will be considered automatically disqualifying for every Federal position," he said. "That is not the policy of this Administration."
 
Drawing the Line
 But, Mr. Paster said, candidates could be disqualified if there were instances in which their relationship with current or past household workers "was particularly wanton or willful." He added, "This will be determined on a case-by-case basis."
To comply with the current law, employers must file five to eight separate Federal forms each year. State forms must often be filed as well. Some officials have said that very few people routinely filed because of the amount of record-keeping involved.

HEADLINE: Banker Is Convicted of Embezzling Millions

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., April 23

 BODY:
The former bank president widely blamed in Rhode Island's worst banking crisis since the Depression was convicted today of embezzling $15.8 million and creating false documents to cover the theft.
A Superior Court jury deliberated nearly three days before returning guilty verdicts on all 26 counts against Joseph Mollicone Jr. 
 Mr. Mollicone, 49, faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced.
The former president of the Heritage Loan and Investment Company fled in 1990 as examiners were scrutinizing the small neighborhood bank's books and questioning him about millions of dollars in what he said were "off-line," or undocumented, loans.
Investigators proved the loans did not exist and traced the money to Mr. Mollicone's business ventures and personal banking accounts.

HEADLINE: Gold Shares Surge While Market Falls

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market continued its melancholy decline yesterday, its fifth losing session in a row.
Even the most notable gainers, the gold stocks, seemed to reflect some of the gloom. Their rise indicated that many traders were bracing for political trouble in Moscow after tomorrow's referendum on President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
Several gold-mining stocks rose to new highs during yesterday's trading. Gold bullion also surged, with the spot price jumping $6.50 an ounce, to $346.50, its highest level since early October. [Page 48.] 
 Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.40 points yesterday, closing at 3,413.77. Broader market indexes also declined. But trading volume, at 259.8 million shares, was lower than Thursday's busy 310.4 million shares. For the week, the Dow lost 64.84 points.
The Dow fell right at the opening of trading and never fully recovered. Indeed, it was down more than 25 points shortly after 11 A.M.
Contributing to the morning selloff was the Government's report that orders for durable goods fell an unexpected 3.7 percent in March.
The Dow was dragged down by six of its component stocks that fell 1 1/8 of a point or more: Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Exxon, Alcoa, International Paper, Goodyear Tire and A.T.& T.
Exxon lost 1 5/8, to 64 1/4, after reporting flat first-quarter earnings and a slump in refining. 3M also lost 1 5/8, to 113 1/8, even though some analysts had raised their earnings projections.
Amid such declines, the gold-mining stocks stood out. Homestake Mining jumped 1 5/8, to 16, and was the third most active stock on the Big Board, on volume of 3.3 million shares. It hit a 52-week high of 16 1/4 during the day. Newmont Mining, American Barrick, RTZ, and Placer Dome also saw their shares rise.
Analysts attributed much of the rise in gold and the mining stocks to fears that Mr. Yeltsin might lose the Russian referendum and be ousted. Russia is a leading gold producer, and a political upheaval could disrupt production.
In the gold market, institutional investors, bullion brokers and other industry professionals appeared to be snapping up options to buy gold. In one case, a huge option for 700,000 ounces or more of gold was traded.
"But I'd be more encouraged if some Swiss banks or some Arab sheiks were buying and physically removing gold off the market," said Edwin Arnold, a metals specialist at Merrill Lynch in London. "That's when the price goes up and stays up."
Still, Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals marketing for Credit Suisse in New York, said more fundamental factors might support gold prices even if tensions eased in Moscow. New demand, especially for gold jewelry, is likely to push prices upward, he said.
Elsewhere in the stock market, the Dow Jones transportation average dropped 9.26 points, to 1,618.02, its fourth decline in five sessions, amid growing concerns about the airlines' latest price war and its effect on earnings.
Four stocks -- UAL, Ryder System, XTRA and AMR -- accounted for nearly all of the decline. For example, UAL, the parent of United Airlines, dropped 2 5/8, to 144 1/4.
Intel continued to be one of the most actively traded stocks of the week, with unusually heavy volume of 9.65 million shares yesterday. Yesterday's trading was the most frenzied for Intel since Monday, the first session that investors could react to a court ruling in which Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, won the legal right to ship its cheaper clone of Intel chips. Intel closed down 3 1/4, to 92 3/4.
 
Advanced Micro Off
 Advanced Micro Devices was the most active stock on the Big Board with volume of 3.8 million shares. It closed down 1/2, to 30 1/2, although some analysts raised their earning projections for the company. The biggest percentage loser on the Big Board was Tandycrafts, which plunged 3 points, or 14 percent, to 18 1/4. The specialty retailer reported earnings that were a record for the company but apparently did not meet investors' expectations.
Among the broader market indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.43 points, to 437.03, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 1.23 point, to 241.85, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 5.10 points, to 658.41.
In Tokyo yesterday, stocks rebounded slightly after falling for five straight sessions. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 112.84 points, to close at 19,704.15. For the week, the Nikkei lost 593.71 points.

Court Declines to Dismiss Marriott Bondholders' Suit

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
A Federal judge has refused to dismiss a bondholders' suit aimed at blocking a restructuring plan by the Marriott Corporation that would split it into two companies.
Lawyers for the bondholders called the ruling Thursday by United States District Judge Alexander Harvey 2d in Baltimore "a major setback to the company's spinoff plan." Marriott officers countered that the next stage in the suit would find that the bondholders' claims were "without substance." 
 The ruling was not made known to both parties until yesterday. The court dismissed the bondholders' claim of negligent representation against Marriott and said the claims did not apply to bonds bought before April 1992, but it ruled that the law at least permitted the bondholders to raise the issue of securities fraud.
 
Suit Filed Last Fall
 The bondholders' suit was led by PPM America Inc., a unit of Prudential Insurance P.L.C. of Britain, which owns about $120 million of Marriott's $2.9 billion of debt. It was filed last fall when the price of Marriott's 20-year bonds plunged by 30 percent after the company announced its planned reorganization.
PPM America was a conspicuous holdout last month when Marriott reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in eight class-action suits and with representatives of institutions holding about $400 million of Marriott bonds.
The company agreed to issue new bonds at higher interest rates and to shift about $450 million of debts and assets from Host Marriott, the proposed real estate company, to Marriott International, the company that would manage hotels and restaurants.
Yesterday, the PPM side was jubilant. "I think we hit a home run," said Lawrence Kill, its lawyer. "The judge sustained the essence of our claims."
 
Ruling a Technical One
 Robert Sours, a Marriott spokesman, said the ruling did not address the merits of the claim. "In filing to dismiss their suit," he said, "our arguments were technical and legal."
Mr. Kill agreed. "This ruling is on the complaint," he said. "But without a complaint you can't go to trial. The ruling says we alleged sufficient facts to enable us to proceed to try to prove violations of Federal securities law and common law. So this ruling is the ticket you need to get into the theater."
Mr. Sours contends it will be an empty theater. "The judge decided the law permitted PPM to raise the issues," he said, "but the next step will be to see what substance there is to those claims, and when they are weighed on the merits, we will prevail."
Judge Harvey set a scheduling conference for May 26, before the June 22 annual meeting at which Marriott shareholders are scheduled to vote on the restructuring.

HEADLINE: World Bank to Help Russia Increase Its Oil Output

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
In one of the biggest Western efforts to assist Russia's oil industry, the World Bank announced today that it had reached an agreement to help finance a $1 billion project to increase Russia's oil output.
The World Bank said it would provide more than $500 million in loans for the plan, which aims to boost output by $1.5 billion a year by reopening 1,200 oil wells that have been closed because of a lack of spare parts, inadequate maintenance and other problems. 
 The plan would increase Russia's output by about 240,000 barrels per day, the World Bank said, helping to increase Russia's annual production by 3 percent.
 
'Major Support'
 World Bank officials said they hoped the plan would enable Russia to increase its exports and hard-currency revenues, thus reducing its dependence on Western aid and easing its painful transition to a market economy.
"This is very major support for the rehabilitation of Russia's oil industry," said a senior World Bank official. "It's a $1 billion investment."
Western officials say modernizing Russia's huge oil sector is essential for transforming its economy.
The agreement announced today comes after the United States and other wealthy industrial nations pressured the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to step up their pace of aid to Russia, in part to demonstrate support for President Boris N. Yeltsin and other economic reformers.
Three oil-producing associations have joined in the accord, which involves oil fields in the Tyumen Province of western Siberia. World Bank officials said they expected the oil-producing associations to reinvest some of their profits to make up a portion of the $1 billion project.
 
Other Sources
 Under the agreement, funds will also come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and from the export credit agencies of several countries.
World Bank officials said they hoped the project would be the first step toward meeting the $6 billion that they say Russia needs to reopen the more than 10,000 wells that have been shut. One oil specialist at the World Bank said such an investment might increase Russia's oil output by more than $7 billion a year.
A senior World Bank official said he hoped that some of the money to reopen these wells would come from private Western investors. He estimated that Western companies had invested less than $200 million in projects to reopen closed wells.
The World Bank estimates that between now and the end of the decade, Russia will need $50 billion in investment, from home and abroad, to keep its oil production from declining from its current level of about 2.5 billion barrels a year.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Fall After Early Strength

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday amid perceptions of political turmoil in Russia and problems for the Clinton economic plan in the United States.
The price of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 6.79 percent, from 6.75 percent late Thursday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
 Bond prices were strong in early dealings yesterday after the Commerce Department said new orders to factories for durable goods plunged an unexpectedly large 3.7 percent in March, despite a rebound in orders for military equipment.
 
Russia Is Worry
 But the problems in Russia of President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is facing a referendum on Sunday, pushed gold prices higher and sent bond prices retreating. Rising gold prices are frequently seen as an indicator of inflation, which can wipe out gains on fixed-income instruments like long-term bonds.
There is also doubt about whether President Clinton's full economic package will ever get through Congress, said Marshall B. Front, president of Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., a Chicago investment consulting firm.
"The credibility of the President to effect this deficit-reduction program is being called into question," Mr. Front said.
A rising deficit can spur inflation and also increase the supply of bonds, pushing down their value.
Short-term Treasury issues fell 1/32 point to 1/16 point and intermediate maturities fell from 5/32 point to 9/32 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
 
Funds Rate Lower
 The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 1 basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 2.83 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills rose to 2.92 percent, also up a basis point. The discount rate on one-year bills rose to 3.04 percent, up a basis point. Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 213/16 percent, down from 215/16 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10111/32 , down 1/32 from Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.93 percent, up from 5.92.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up the Pressure in Tokyo

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 23

 BODY:
Saying that no other approach will work, Ronald H. Brown, the United States Secretary of Commerce, pressed Japan today to agree to measurable goals for increasing its purchases of American products. But he also said that the targets need not always be a specific share of the Japanese market.
Mr. Brown is on a three-day trip here only a week after President Clinton met with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in Washington and told him that the United States wanted Japan to accept specific targets for opening its markets. 
 Japan is fiercely resisting the idea, calling that approach "managed trade," and arguing that it is impossible to agree in advance to the purchase of a certain amount of foreign products without knowing the price and quality of the items.
Officials in Tokyo have had a frustrating time recently dealing with trade issues and the related matter of the yen's sharp rise against the dollar. Today, a senior official of the Bank of Japan abandoned the customary reserve of a central banker and delivered a tongue lashing aimed at President Clinton over Mr. Clinton's support for a strong yen.
The yen has appreciated sharply against the dollar since February, but it was given a special impetus a week ago when President Clinton said at a news conference in Washington that a strong yen was desirable because it would help reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. A strong yen would tend to cut Japan's exports by making them more expensive for foreign buyers; it would also tend to increase Japan's imports by making foreign goods cheaper here.
After the President's remarks, the dollar tumbled to a post-World War II low of 110.25 yen, a 12 percent decline since the start of the year.
The Bank of Japan official spoke today to a group of foreign reporters on the condition that he not be identified. He warned that playing with the foreign exchange markets was a dangerous game that could backfire on the United States and he questioned whether Mr. Clinton was well prepared and adequately informed to deal with the situation.
 
Chip Accord Is Cited
 Mr. Brown at his news conference here said that gaining a specific share of a Japanese market was only one of the ways to measure results of changes in trade relations. He said other gauges could include the number of joint ventures between American and Japanese companies, the number of instances in which American components are used in Japanese products, or the overall increase in American exports.
"We have not argued that every solution has to mirror the semiconductor agreement, although we do believe that was a good agreement," he said. Mr. Brown was referring to an agreement that called for foreign computer chips to have 20 percent of Japan's market by the end of 1992, a goal that was met.
Washington and Tokyo are now working on two trade agreements, Mr. Brown said. One will be aimed at altering the structure of the Japanese economy to make it easier for foreign companies to compete. This program will be the successor to the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative undertaken during the Bush Administration.
The other, which Mr. Brown called a "strategic export initiative," will involve trying to improve market access in specific industrial sectors. Mr. Brown and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, have identified several sectors that could be candidates for these negotiations, including computers, semiconductors, supercomputers, construction and cars.
In a speech this morning to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, Mr. Brown continued the Clinton Administration's blunt criticism that has hit Japan like a sledgehammer in recent weeks, and he made it clear that America's dissatisfaction with Japan on economic matters would no longer be tempered by considerations of long-term security arrangements between the two countries.
"No approach seems to work," Mr. Brown said. "Where our exports to almost every other nation -- from Korea to Germany to Mexico -- are up, they aren't in Japan. Where tariff reduction spurs commerce in every other market, it hasn't in Japan. Where years and years of negotiations have yielded tangible results with Canada and the E.C., for the most part, they have not in Japan.
"Removing barriers and changing structures has almost become an end, rather than a means," the Commerce Secretary continued. "The Clinton Administration intends to end the obsession with process. Our focus will be on results."
But Mr. Brown, in the news conference, was somewhat vague when asked how the United States would get Japan to agree to targets or what the United States would do if Japan did not agree.

HEADLINE: Scalping on Stolen Credit;
2 Arrested and 1,428 Tickets Seized in a Pure-Profit Scheme

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
It was a sure-fire, pure profit venture: selling tickets for the biggest Broadway hits, more often than not at face value, because there simply was no overhead. Then the police got a tip.
Two Queens men were arrested Thursday night outside the Shubert Theater on West 44th Street, where "Crazy for You" is playing, and charged with ticket speculation -- better known as scalping -- with a twist. 
 The twist, according to investigators, was that all speculation had been taken out of the scheme because the tickets -- $70,000 worth of them -- were purchased with pilfered credit cards or credit card numbers.
"It cost them nothing to do this," Deputy Inspector Michael Fox, the commander of the Midtown South Precinct patrol, said at a news conference yesterday afternoon. "Maybe they bought a stolen credit card on the street for $50, but that's about it."
Spread before Inspector Fox on a table at the station house were 1,428 stolen tickets. Had they all been sold at inflated rates on the street, the police said, they could have brought in $130,000 in pure profit.
 
Tickets for Most Major Shows
 The suspects -- Howard Schwartz, 31, of 75-46 113th Street in Forest Hills, and Joel Steinberg, 30, of 69-03 Kissena Boulevard in Flushing -- were charged with grand larceny, possession of stolen property and ticket speculation. The police said that Mr. Schwartz is an accountant with the city's Human Resources Administration, while Mr. Steinberg is otherwise unemployed. Inspector Fox said a third suspect, whom he called the ring leader, remained at large.
"These are known scalpers, and they were selling tickets to most of the major shows -- 'Miss Saigon,' 'Guys and Dolls,' 'Les Mis,' 'Phantom of the Opera,' " said Sgt. Robert Lowe, one of the arresting officers.
 
Officers Pose as Theatergoers
 Inspector Fox said the police received a tip at 5 P.M. Thursday from American Express indicating that people were scalping tickets outside the Shubert Theater. Four officers posing as would-be theatergoers went to the theater about 5:30 P.M., the inspector said, but they did not spot the scalpers.
"They came back at 6 P.M.," Sergeant Lowe said. "A security guard pointed them out to us. We asked if they had any or knew anyone we could buy some from. They produced the tickets at that point.
"When we questioned them, their answers were very vague," the sergeant added. Soon after, however, the suspects led the officers to their car, a gray Toyota, parked around the corner on Eighth Avenue. In the car were 1,300 tickets that, in addition to the fistfuls the suspects had with them at the theater, brought the total to 1,428.
 
400 Tickets on 1 Card
 Officer Michael Egan, who participated in the arrests, said American Express had begun investigating the case after a card holder called to say that someone had purchased $2,000 worth of tickets by using his card number.
Inspector Fox said most of the tickets had been bought with more than 40 stolen credit cards or card numbers. The largest number of tickets charged to a single card was 400. Tickets had been purchased for performances between last month and March 1994, he said.
"They may be organized, but I don't think they're too bright," the inspector said. "If you're going to sell tickets through March 94, you would think they'd realize they would eventually have gotten caught because they had to be out there every day for a year."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Sales of Domestic Vehicles Up 19.5% for 10-Day Period

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 23

 BODY:
Vehicle sales continued to strengthen in mid-April and domestic auto makers reported today that their overall vehicle sales rose a healthy 19.5 percent in the 10-day reporting period.
The figures confirmed generally optimistic assessments from dealers. 
 "It seems like it's getting a little bit better," said Tony Ursomarso, who sells Pontiacs, Hondas, BMW's and GMC Trucks in Wilmington, Del. "It's not a straight arrow up and not what everybody would like it to be, but it's moving forward."
Sales of passenger cars seem to be rebounding with the arrival of spring. A rise of 16.3 percent in mid-April followed gains of 10 percent and 8 percent in early April and late March.
 
Nice Weather and Tax Refunds
 Mike Pisano, sales manager at Larry Roesch Chevrolet in Bensenville, Ill., just west of Chicago, said: "I'm sure the low interest rates have something to do with it. So does nice weather and income tax refunds."
Sales of light trucks, which have carried the industry's recovery for the last year, remained strong in the April 11-20 period. The segment, which includes mini-vans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles, had 23.8 percent higher sales.
The annual sales rate for North American-built cars in the period was 6.6 million, slightly better than in early April and the same as in late March. The annual rate for domestic cars in mid-April last year was 5.8 million.
All vehicles built in North America are considered domestic for reporting purposes.
 
Trucks Doing Well
 Trucks sold in mid-April at an annual rate of 5 million, the same as in early April. The annual selling rate for trucks in mid-April last year was 3.9 million.
Tom Pappert, the Chrysler Corporation's vice president of sales, said that total United States vehicle sales, including imports, had been running at an annual rate of slightly more than 14 million this month.
Chrysler, which does not report 10-day sales, had another strong period, according to estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Ward's estimated that the No. 3 auto maker's car sales were up 47.8 percent and that light-truck sales were up 32.6 percent.
The General Motors Corporation reported a rare period of sales strength in both cars and trucks. Despite drastically cutting the number of cars sold at low profit to car-rental companies, its car sales were up 15.5 percent. Four of its five car divisions and the Saturn unit reported higher sales. Oldsmobile was the sole division reporting lower sales.
A G.M. spokesman, John Maciarz, said fleet sales were down 9 percent in the period while retail sales to individuals were up 23 percent. G.M.'s truck sales were up 31.4 percent.
The Ford Motor Company continued to gain compared with a year earlier, with car sales up 15.2 percent and truck sales up 7.7 percent.
Combined Big Three sales were up 20.8 percent. Sales of cars and trucks by Japanese makers with plants in the United States were up 9.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Discount Brands Flex Their Muscles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
As the economy continues crawling toward recovery and job security is worrying an increasing number of families, consumers are buying even the most modest of products with the same discretion once shown only big-ticket items like air fares, computers and designer clothes.
The result: a growing popularity of cheaper private label products and the likelihood that price wars among consumer goods could lead to the kind of consolidation that occurred in the airline and electronics industries. 
 Moreover, analysts say, changing buying habits will force premium brand marketers to lower their prices to protect their positions, as Philip Morris did recently with Marlboro cigarettes and Procter & Gamble did with Pampers diapers. These companies may also upgrade products to distinguish them from private labels and promote their brands more aggressively than ever -- a bounty perhaps for the packaging and advertising industries but a further drain on marketers' margins.
"Consumers are forcing product innovation," said Leo J. Shapiro, founder of a Chicago-based market research company. "Products have to be sold on merit. As a result, there will be fewer brands of significance but the significant brands will be stronger."
In an written strategy report, Gail M. Dudack, an analyst for S. G. Warburg Securities, stressed, "We believe brand loyalty only exists when, or if, value is provided."
Americans have demonstrated a willingness to experiment with discount brands since their introduction in the late 1970's. But the pace of change has quickened as consumers' craving for value intersects with corporate reorganization, sluggish job growth and the expectation of higher taxes.
And the potential market for discount brands is widening.
"The unique nature of the recent recession is that it has stretched into higher-income groups," said Roy D. Burry, a stock analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. "It has shaken up those between $50,000 to $100,000, who used to go down the aisle and pull off Coke, Crest toothpaste and Budweiser and not think anything about it. But now, with consumer confidence shaken, people think: 'Maybe I don't need Crest. I can buy some other brand.' The consumer is going to walk out having spent 10 to 15 percent less."
That attitude has been a boon to discount brands and supermarkets' own labels, like the Loblaw Companies' successful President's Choice line, which is sold in their chain of supermarkets, as well as in stores like the D'Agostino Supermarkets.
Recent data from Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based survey company, show that nearly 23 billion private label items were sold in supermarkets last year, a slight increase over 1991. That represented sales of $26.3 billion, an increase of 2.2 percent for the same period. That might not sound like much, but the increase represented about $500 million in added private label sales.
As a result, private label goods now account for 18.3 percent of all units sold in supermarkets, up from 16.4 percent in 1989, according to Information Resources. Its market share in dollars for that period rose to 13.8 percent, from 12.5 percent. And private label items in 115 of 195 product categories tracked by Information Resources gained share in their respective markets last year.
Particularly vulnerable are brands that perennially rank third or fourth in their product category and generics, the no-names sold at price clubs and elsewhere, which have been passed over by consumers in favor of the more expensive private labels. According to figures gathered by the Private Label Manufacturers Association, supermarket shoppers spent $721 million on generic goods last year, less than 1 cent of every dollar they spent, as a once-fashionable option continues to fade.
"Consumers are now committed to using store brands," said Brian Sharoff, president of the Private Label Manufacturers Association. "That's a major, major problem for the big national brands, and what they do is replicated by everybody else."
Only a few companies feel safe from private label encroachment. Jack L. Stahl, the chief financial officer of the Coca-Cola Company, said last week that the premium soft-drink brands like Coca-Cola were relatively immune because their costs had remained constant. An ounce of Coca-Cola, which cost 2 cents in 1980, cost the same last year. By comparison, he said, the price of branded cigarettes increased, on average, from 58 cents a pack in 1980 to about $2 a pack in 1992.
"That left a price umbrella open for the private brands," Mr. Stahl said.
More vulnerable brands have embarked on careful counteroffensives against the private labels. Some companies have hedged their bets by also making private label versions of the same products. They include the Campbell Soup Company's Vlasic pickles, the American Safety Razor Company and Union Carbide for garbage bags.
In some cases, the big-name companies produce private label brands in other categories. The H. J. Heinz Company, for example, the leading producer of ketchup, makes about 80 percent of the private label soups sold in supermarkets.
Manufacturers are also enhancing their premium products to justify their higher prices, introducing, for example, multipurpose cleaners that come in refill packages and selling tuna packed in oils with less saturated fat. Fred C. Meendsen, a vice president at CPC International, the food products company, promised analysts recently that a combination of sensible pricing and innovation with a strong brand name "can stabilize your market share."
Mr. Meendsen cited four new CPC International products as examples of innovation: a Hellmann's mayonnaise with a reduced fat content; a new Mazola oil with canola oil replacing some of the corn oil to reduce saturated fat; Thomas's English muffins in sandwich size, and a new product, Homestyle Ranch salad mix, in which milk or sour cream can be added to make a salad dressing.
Reformulated or repackaged products are typical examples of innovative attempts to solidify market share. H. J. Heinz is introducing new containers, including a 20-ounce squeezable and recyclable plastic bottle, and is returning to a 20-year-old advertising theme, using the Carly Simon song "Anticipation." Procter & Gamble is test-marketing a diaper that is 50 percent thinner and is cutting costs and prices on Pampers and Luvs.
With an eye toward high-quality candies from Germany, pasta from Italy and even President's Choice products from Canada, Bert Flickenger, a marketing specialist with Booz, Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting firm, suggested that the big companies might have to adopt even more unconventional strategies.
"This may be considered heretical," he said, "but they should consider not only packaging and selling private label brands but also helping the chains actively market private label brands. Like, if Colgate-Palmolive brings out a new toothpaste, Pathmark gets the old product. Sure, there's a risk that might cut the market share. But the greater risk is choosing a monolithic brand strategy. There are a lot of very sophisticated companies out there looking at American retailers. Before you know it, private labels could be 40 to 50 percent of the action."

Gold Jumps Amid Jitters About Russian Referendum

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices jumped to a six-and-a-half-month high yesterday as jitters about the Russian referendum added fresh fuel to a rallying market.
Silver and platinum futures also rose sharply. On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures were lower, oil futures rose and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
 Gold for April delivery surged $6.50 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, to $346.50 an ounce, the highest settlement for spot deliveries since Oct. 9. Silver for May delivery rose 3.8 cents on the exchange, to $3.954 an ounce. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum deliveries climbed $5.30, to $380.20 an ounce.
Gold has gained $17.20, or 5.2 percent, since March 1, persuading many analysts that the market is emerging from a long slump linked to low inflation, slack investment demand and dumping by Russia and Middle Eastern banks. Demand appears to be rising for supplies of gold, which have shrunk because low prices have made it unprofitable to mine, said Ian McDonald, manager of precious metal trading for Credit Suisse.
Peter Cardillo, research director for Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York, said investors were buying gold this week as a hedge against the possible ouster of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
 
Seeking Safety During Turmoil
 Investors tend to seek the safety of gold during times of international political turmoil.
Analysts said commodity funds became aggressive buyers when the market crossed several key chart points, including $342.50 in the spot price.
"The only thing that really could upset any potential rally in gold's price would be another central bank coming in to sell," Mr. McDonald said.
Livestock and meat futures sank on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of a quarterly report from the Department of Agriculture.
The department said there were 8 percent more cattle at feedlots on April 1 than on the date last year. The number exceeded expectations and could prompt selling of cattle futures on Monday, analysts said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Heavy Trading But It Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined in heavy trading yesterday against all leading currencies except the Japanese yen.
Attention in the world's currency markets was focused on the European currencies, which gained at the expense of the dollar. Traders continued to evaluate two interest rate cuts by the German Bundesbank on Thursday. 
 Frank Pusateri, a vice president at the Bank of Boston, noted that the cut in the discount rate -- to 7.25 percent from 7.5 -- was small enough to leave Germany with an interest-rate advantage over the United States. The discount rate is the Bundesbank's cheapest fee on loans to commercial banks.
A United States Government report showing a surprising decline in new orders to American factories for durable goods also dampened demand for the dollar. The Commerce Department said orders plunged 3.7 percent in March, the worst showing since December 1991. The drop came despite a rebound in orders for military equipment.
 
A Technical Rise
 Trading was heavy until activity tapered off around midafternoon.
The dollar, which has been trading at record lows against the yen, rose against the Japanese currency in a technical move.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 110.40 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's record closing low. Later in London, it rose to 110.61 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 110.50 yen, up from 109.86 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5745, from $1.5480 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.5747 to buy 1, more expensive than Thursday's $1.5575.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5825 German marks, down from 1.5965; 1.4270 Swiss francs, down from 1.4495; 5.3415 French francs, down from 5.3900; 1,490.50 Italian lire, down from 1,513.00, and 1.2618 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2633.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5833 German marks, down from 1.6065; 1.4305 Swiss francs, down from 1.4579; 5.3440 French francs, down from 5.4225; 1.7783 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8058; 1,491.50 Italian lire, down from 1,526.50, and 1.2613 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2622.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Post 3.7% Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket factory goods slumped 3.7 percent in March, a widespread decline that was the biggest in 15 months, the Commerce Department reported today.
The report was more negative than expected and further dampened analysts' hopes for stepped-up economic expansion, although the East Coast blizzard was once again cited as contributing to a poor or lackluster March statistic. 
 While orders might not have been affected as much as, say, industrial output or retail sales, economists said the midmonth storm did disrupt the process by keeping executives from their offices and aggravating any unwanted buildup of inventory.
 
Lowering Expectations
 "We are also watching some slowdown in overall economic activity from what we came to enjoy" in late 1992, commented Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Global Markets. Mr. Fabbri is among a large group of forecasters expecting thatgrowth in the gross domestic product for the first quarter will be about half the 4.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter of 1992. The G.D.P. figures for the January-March period are to be reported on Thursday.
Today's report also showed that shipments of durable goods rose seven-tenths of a percent in March while backlogs of unfilled orders fell 1.1 percent, their first decline since November.
Durable goods, which are items that last three years or more, ranging from microwave ovens to 747 jetliners, are the backbone of the industrial sector of the economy. Unfilled orders are a widely followed predictor of general business conditions.
The biggest factor in the drop in new orders, to $130 billion, was a 10.2 percent decline in transportation equipment, mainly aircraft and parts, after sizable swings in January and February that largely offset each other. Airplanes are a notoriously "lumpy" item statistically, since airlines place orders sporadically.
 
Declines Were Widespread
 But there were also declines in every other major sector except for military goods, which rose only enough to partly recover from a 27.9 percent collapse in February.
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment eased five-tenths of a percent, while orders for industrial machinery and equipment fell four-tenths of a percent, and orders for primary metals fell three-tenths of a percent.
"It's a little worrisome," said Christopher S. Rupkey, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York, referring to the widespread nature of the March order decline. "But we don't view it as alarming."
Mr. Rupkey, noting that overall orders for durables soared 9.7 percent in December, said that some retreat was probably inevitable. January's 2.3 percent decline was followed by a 2.2 percent February gain, a figure that was trimmed today from the 2.4 percent that was initially reported.
 
Military Purchasing
 The rise in military goods was 6.5 percent, the report also showed, but this left the sector about $2 billion shy of the $8.8 billion level posted in January. Excluding the military sector, new orders over all fell 4.2 percent in March.
A particular favorite of statistics watchers -- new orders for nonmilitary capital goods, excluding commercial aircraft and parts -- declined 2.2 percent last month, nearly wiping out a 2.6 percent gain in February.
Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, said in a statement from Tokyo that the durable-goods data were more evidence "that the pace of recovery is slowing and that action is still needed to stimulate economic growth." The Administration hopes to revive pieces of the economic stimulus plan it abandoned this week in the face of Republican opposition in the Senate.
 
A Hint of Optimism
 While the March rise in shipments of durable goods, to $135 billion, was small, it was the fourth gain in five months. Some analysts were moved to predict that orders would soon follow.
For the first quarter, orders advanced 3.5 percent while shipments advanced 3.2 percent, today's report also showed.
On the other hand, a broad $5 billion decline in unfilled orders, erasing gains made earlier in the year, was a clear negative and pointed to possible economic faltering ahead. Slipping backlogs "is usually a sign of weaker demand," said Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The 3.7 percent decline in new orders last month was the steepest since December 1991, when orders dropped 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Banks Are Trying Hard To Peddle Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
PRODUCT glut, the bane of supermarket shoppers, has hit the neighborhood bank full force. The choices among detergents and dry cereals are simple compared with the range of mutual funds that many banks are brandishing.
Chase Manhattan customers are now confronted with more than 600 mutual funds. Vista, Putnam, Alliance, Massachusetts Financial, Franklin, Nuveen, Colonial, GNA . . . "I could go on," said Mitchell Ratliff, a Chase marketing manager. 
 The banks are intent on keeping depositors from wandering to fund groups and brokerages. But investors should shop around. The funds available through banks almost always come with higher charges, sometimes disguised, than no-load funds.
For customers faced with the choice of renewing a certificate of deposit at barely the rate of inflation, a stock fund yielding 4 or 5 percent or a bond fund paying 6 or 7 percent can seem like a terrific deal. The stock, bond and money market funds that banks manage themselves have grown from $35.5 billion at the end of 1987 to $90.2 billion on March 31. The stock funds alone have grown tenfold.
Banks are promoting their investment alternatives so heavily that their offices are often cluttered with as many brochures as a travel agency. Their mutual funds do offer many conveniences. Why not keep all your money at one place, especially when you can move it by telephone among checking, savings and mutual funds? Investors who buy funds managed by banks can often count their holdings toward the minimum deposits needed to avoid direct charges for checking (an arrangement that banks insistently call "free checking").
Banks also boast that institutional and trust accounts have given them ample skills in managing money. Stock mutual funds managed by banks and by other institutions have performed identically over the last five years, gaining 83.99 percent before any loads, according to Lipper Analytical Services. The Vista Growth & Income Fund, managed by Chase Manhattan, won the top ranking among similar funds in the current Consumer Reports magazine.
But the major reason customers buy mutual funds through banks is sheer inertia. When Dean Witter executives boast that their partnership with Nationsbank will give them access to the bank's customers, they are betting that most will be too scared or lazy to shop elsewhere.
Almost nobody but depositors buys mutual funds through a bank. No bank need fear that crowds surging in to buy their mutual funds will ever knock their revolving doors askew.
Banks devote their greatest efforts to selling the mutual funds they manage, where all the commissions and fees flow to them. Most of their other funds are also available through brokerage firms, with the same commissions, often 4.5 percent or more.
Some financial advisers recommend buying funds through a brokerage firm instead, but with caution. Remember that, in house, brokers are called salesmen. A hard sell, with a barrage of follow-up calls, is more likely from a brokerage firm than a bank, which usually emphasizes the more conservative funds.
Anecdotal evidence and common sense, however, suggest that brokerage firms are more familiar with a variety of investments, and more likely to ask the right questions. "If I'm comfortable getting advice from a brokerage, the bank has few advantages," said J. Heywood E. Sloane, institutional markets director of CDA/ Weisenberger mutual fund consultants.
More self-reliant investors might gravitate toward no-load or low-load funds: the Vanguard, Fidelity, Dreyfus and other groups, which sell primarily by telephone and mail. There, the telephone sales representatives are often not licensed brokers. They can readily check fund performance, but might be less qualified to deal with asset allocation.
The payoff is low annual expense and sales charges of at most 3 percent, often nothing. Although banks and brokerage firms contend that their funds are worth the commissions, most studies conclude that even after the charges, they perform no better than the low- or no-loads.
The funds sold with fees have also countered by offering what might be called loaded no-loads, with features that allow banks and brokerage firms to say that there are no sales charges. Some Putnam funds, among others, now come in three flavors: with a 5.75 percent sales charge; with no sales charge but, for six years, high annual charges and redemption fees, and with no sales charge but high annual charges forever.
Ideally, these arrangements -- clearly disclosed in Putnam prospectuses -- offer customers the flexibility to minimize charges. But many could find themselves worse off in the long run than if they had simply paid the sales charges up front.
The greatest danger to investors who buy mutual funds through banks, however, comes from more fundamental confusion. For all the warnings banks may give about the funds, many customers still believe that a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation decal on the door guarantees the full return of their money.
To avoid mix-ups, regulators used to forbid the marketing of mutual funds under a bank's name. Citibank therefore sells the Landmark funds, Bank of America the Pacific Horizon funds. Over the last year, however, several banks bestowed their names, and by implication an aura of soundness, on their mutual funds.

HEADLINE: Hiring an Adjuster for Damage Claims

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
After the ocean crashed into their waterfront home in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., during December's storms, soaking and crushing the furniture, smashing the windows and staining the walls, Judith and Victor Lolli faced a complex and costly insurance claim.
Their losses, which also included damage from last month's storms, exceeded $100,000 and were settled partly in February and finally on Thursday. They had to press their claims on two fronts: the National Flood Insurance Program, a federally chartered agency, for water damage, and Allstate Insurance for losses like roof damage from high winds covered under their regular homeowners' policy. 
 "We were going to do it all ourselves," Mr. Lolli said. "But there was so much paperwork." They were also worried they might overlook some damages.
So the Lollis decided to follow a neighbor's recommendation and hire a public adjuster -- in this instance, Andrew K. Knox & Company in nearby Toms River. Unlike the insurance company's own adjusters, who process a claim on behalf of their employers, public adjusters work exclusively for the claimants. They handle fire, storm and other covered risks.
"There was so much sand and flotsam and jetsam inside the house that sitting in the living room was like being on the beach," said Leslie Knox, president of the company.
On behalf of their clients, adjusters review the contract to make sure no aspect of coverage is overlooked. They take a detailed inventory of the losses, down to the last ruined pair of socks. They work with engineers, appraisers and contractors to prepare estimates that reflect the cost of repairs or replacement and then they negotiate with the insurer after its adjuster has made an estimate.
They write and present the claim in a way that fulfills the technicalities that can derail the amateur claim filer. A decision by the New York State Court of Appeals last month confirmed that unless "proofs of loss" were filed within 60 days of a catastrophe, as required by the contract, the insurance company retained the right to reject the claim.
Mr. Knox is a second-generation public adjuster, taking over his father's business in 1985. He earned degrees in history and economics and then worked for six years as an economist for an oil company before joining his father.
For their work, public adjusters receive an average of 10 percent of the settlement, but the percentage is negotiable. Thus they have every incentive to obtain the most for their clients. "You can usually count on 25 percent more than if you go it alone," said Robert E. Mackoul, a certified financial planner and independent insurance agent in Lynbrook, L.I., who recommends hiring public adjusters to deal with claims that exceed $10,000.
Some claimants do even better. Frank Cottone, a carpenter whose $175,000 single-story home in Cutter Ridge, Fla., suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Andrew last fall, said he received $75,000 after turning to a public adjuster. His insurer had originally offered to settle his claim for $38,000.
Yet if many customers are satisfied, some people do not like the way the adjusters seek business, sometimes descending uninvited at the front doors of families with losses. "There were four cards stuck to the front of our house even before we got back," Mrs. Lolli recalled.
Many excesses of the profession have been reduced in the last few years through licensing laws -- New Jersey enacted one in March -- and by stronger efforts of the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters for a stricter ethics code and better training.
Victims of losses should never sign with an adjuster simply because one shows up at the door -- at least not until credentials and references have been thoroughly checked. Referrals may be sought from the family lawyer, insurance agent or real estate agent. The public insurance adjusters association at (202) 371-1258, which represents 91 firms, will also provide referrals.
"Our accountant was the one who suggested the idea to us," said George Gridelli, a lawyer whose late father's beachfront home in Bayville, L.I., was extensively damaged in the December storm. "Even I didn't have the very specialized expertise we needed."
Some people say that having an independent adjuster is more important than ever. "Claims are not being processed as fully or as quickly as they used to be," said Dennis T. D'Antonio, a lawyer with Weg & Myers in Manhattan, a firm that specializes in insurance claims litigation.
Insurers are dragging their heels, he maintains, because profits are under siege from the number of recent natural disasters. Insurers have also taken a beating from bad real estate loans, he added.
"I'm seeing coverage being denied on the flimsiest of excuses," Mr. D'Antonio said.
Insurance companies vehemently deny such charges. "We really do try to treat policyholders fairly," insisted Mary DiLeo, a spokesman for Aetna Life and Casualty. Claims are treated the same whether filed by the victim or a public adjuster, she said.
Moreover, she recommends waiting at least until the insurance company makes an offer to see if it is satisfactory. "Ask yourself whether you will really be ahead after paying his fee," she said of the public adjuster.

Treasures in the Attic: Stalking the Good Stuff

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
A TINPLATE Mickey Mouse was sold for the equivalent of $18,400 at Christie's in London this month, setting a world record for a Disney toy. "A woman found the 1931 toy, which features Mickey as an organ grinder, in her attic two months ago," The Economist magazine reported.
Treasures in the attic. It sounds like a dream, but items of value are not actually that rare, experts say. The tough part is identifying them and getting an idea of their worth. 
 Jay Goldinger, president of Capital Insights, a Beverly Hills, Calif., brokerage house, who helped a client sell some collectibles last year, did some research and wrote about his findings in his firm's newsletter, "Early Warning Wire." He says he has received an enormous response. "Americans are finding a mother lode of potentially profitable possessions stashed away," he said. "Norman Rockwell plates, old books on fishing lures, a watercolor of Mickey Mouse painted by Walt Disney."
The pendulum swing of fashion has made many once-rejected items from the 20's, 30's and 40's goals of collectors. "I think a lot of senior citizens may be able to create some liquidity this way," Mr. Goldinger said.
He cautioned, however, that "90 percent of the items unearthed are worthless, according to dealers and collectors in vintage Americana."
If there are no valuables at home, what about mining flea markets or tag sales for resale to collectors?
"A flea market is unlikely but not impossible," said Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates in New York and chairman of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. She found a gold-plated Art Deco pin from the 1930's at a street sale. She bought it for $10, wore it a couple of times, discovered it was signed and sold it for $175.
Ms. Noveck has the advantage of knowledge. She was a curator at the Brooklyn Museum before she became a financial planner.
"Your only armor in the art world is knowledge, and to go around unarmed is foolhardy," she said. People who ask a dealer naively about the value of an item they hope to sell can be fairly sure of getting a low price. They should begin by visiting dealers and markets, Ms. Noveck said, because "there are easy comparisons in lower-priced items; it's not like 18th-century French furniture or Faberge eggs."
"You've got to have the passion, the interest," she added. "If not, you'll never have the knowledge, the discerning eye."
The next educational stop should be the public library. "Warman's Americana & Collectibles," and books on specific areas can help owners distinguish between trash and treasure.
If an item looks really promising, an appraisal may be in order. The American Society of Appraisers, a 6,500-member nonprofit professional organization based in Washington (1-800-ASA-VALU or 1-703-478-2228) has a directory of certified specialists who adhere to a code of ethics calling for no selling, which would be a conflict of interest, and flat or hourly fees, no percentage fees.
John V. Lanterman, a Bethesda, Md., appraiser and international governor of the society, who is preparing a report for the Smithsonian Museum on first-edition Little Golden Books, warns that authentication of collectibles is difficult because there are many skillful fakes.
Even mass-market reproductions can excite an amateur. Mr. Lanterman asked one man who called him about a violin, "Does it have a paper label inside saying Stradivarius?"
"Yes," the caller replied breathlessly.
Sears, Roebuck sold thousands of those for $3 to $5 in the early part of the century, Mr. Lanterman said, and they are worth about $75 today.

HEADLINE: Russia's Reform, on the Line

 BODY:
Russians go to the polls tomorrow to choose sides in President Boris Yeltsin's fight with the legislature. For Americans, the referendum is one vital sign that democracy is taking hold in harsh Russian soil. For Mr. Yeltsin, it's a chance to renew his shrinking popular mandate. But unless voters rally to him in unexpectedly large numbers, it won't be easy to translate that mandate into new momentum for economic and constitutional reform.
The ballot drawn up by the Congress of People's Deputies puts four questions to voters: whether they have confidence in President Yeltsin, whether they approve of his social and economic policies, whether they want early elections for president and early elections for Parliament. 
 A majority in the Parliament prefer a go-slow approach to privatizing land and ending subsidies for industrial dinosaurs -- and for good reason. These steps could destroy their political base. A majority of legislators also opposes new parliamentary elections that could cost them their seats, their pay and their privileges. Even reformers shrink from facing voters now.
Pre-election maneuvering by opposition legislators, and a curious set of rulings this week by Russia's Constitutional Court, may prevent tomorrow's referendum from breaking the political deadlock. Instead, the vote could prolong the blame-mongering and postpone the tough measures needed to extricate Russia from its grave crisis.
In one ruling, the court made it easier for Mr. Yeltsin to claim a mandate. It said that he could claim victory if he gets half the votes cast in the vote of confidence. In another ruling, the court made it more difficult for him to capitalize on that mandate. It said that a majority of registered voters is needed to force new elections. Given the current climate of public disaffection, it's not at all clear whether enough registered voters will actually show up at the polls.
Recalcitrant legislators also hope that a vote of approval for Mr. Yeltsin will be neutralized when voters register their opinion of his reform program. The ballot's multiple questions invite voters to say yes to Mr. Yeltsin personally, while blaming him for the drastic decline in living standards. The result could be paralyzingly ambiguous, taxing his considerable political skills to keep his political and economic reforms on track.
Some of his supporters were reluctant to take these issues to the electorate. But Mr. Yeltsin himself understood that trust in the people's judgment is a hallmark of democracy. And popular backing is essential for the tough reform measures that need to be taken.
Plebiscites alone are not the measure of democracy. Russia also needs courts that don't arbitrarily thwart the popular will. And after the vote Mr. Yeltsin and his opponents will still need to seek common ground in order to rescue Russia. A willingness to do that remains in short supply in Moscow's dog-eat-dog politics today.

HEADLINE: Air Strikes? Not Yet.

BYLINE: By Lee H. Hamilton; Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, is chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Bosnian situation is critical, the peace process remains stalled and opportunities for reaching agreement are receding. The world is horrified by the scenes of helpless refugees and the evidence of mass killings and forced expulsions. As frustration mounts in America and elsewhere, President Clinton is reviewing his policy and is under intense pressure -- even from State Department officers -- to take other steps, including military strikes. While it is important to keep military choices under review, we need a clear idea where they lead and what they will accomplish.
The Administration has correctly ruled out unilateral deployment of U.S. ground forces. Such action has little public support. Because we can't resolve the crisis alone, we have been committed to a multinational approach. But action on that front has been slow and halting. Today, we would not be able to obtain U.N. Security Council approval for any international military operation to force a settlement. 
 Attention is now focused on alternatives: lifting the U.N. arms embargo and ordering selective air strikes against Serbian targets. Proponents say such action is doable, would put great pressure on the Serbians and force an early end to the conflict.
But these options are not within easy reach. Gaining U.N. approval is by no means certain. Nor are there any assurances that these actions would achieve their objectives.
Those who seek to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia want to equalize the relationship between the besieged Bosnian Muslims and the Serbians. But who would arm the Bosnians: Iran? Libya? Who would provide the training: America? Further, most military experts agree that lifting the ban, without additional outside military intervention, would only prolong the killing but not change the outcome.
Before the Muslims obtained heavy weapons and learned how to use them, the Serbians, with their preponderance of arms, could unleash a fury unseen even in this bitter war. This slaughter would create even greater pressure on the U.S. and the international community to get directly involved on the ground in Bosnia and possibly Croatia.
Nor can the embargo be lifted for the Muslims alone. Weapons entering Bosnia must pass through Croatian ports or airports and travel on Croatian roads. Throughout the war, Croatia has taken a share of illegal arms flowing to the Muslims. So lifting the embargo on Bosnia means lifting it on Croatia; further arming of Croatia could jeopardize the shaky truce in the Croatian-Serbian conflict. The Croats are waiting for their chance to regain territory lost to the Serbians, and renewed fighting in Croatia would be another setback for peace.
Selective air strikes are no solution. Air strikes alone, without ground forces, would not roll back Serbian territorial gains. It is debatable whether they would force the Serbians back to the negotiating table. This action might well stiffen their resolve and prompt further aggression.
In addition to their questionable military value, air strikes and lifting the embargo would surely destroy humanitarian assistance. Key contributors to the U.N. Protection Force would remove their troops rather than expose them to retaliatory attacks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees would be the first to suffer.
The only durable solution is a negotiated settlement among the Muslims, Serbians and Croats. The peace process may be flawed, perhaps fatally; if so, it will have to be replaced by another negotiating track. Our efforts should remain focused on stopping the killing, not on contributing more weapons or violence to the region.
We must tighten the sanctions on and isolation of the Serbians in accordance with the new U.N. mandate. If the sanctions prove insufficient, we should seek termination of all diplomatic and economic ties. Military force remains available if other measures fail -- and if an allied consensus emerges.

Could Be A Long Season

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
President Clinton's bad week at the Capitol brings to mind Casey Stengel, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. "Can't anybody here play this game?" asked Stengel when he was put in charge of a major league baseball team on which nobody could.
It was the New York Mets, a brand-new expansion team, that provoked Stengel's cry of anguish. The Clinton Administration is also brand-new. What's worse, it is beginning to look like a typical baseball expansion team. 
 That means, in case baseball is not your dish, a comical bunch of greenhorns and tired old-timers who don't win very often. Thus: Because the President couldn't change four votes in the Senate, he lost his economic stimulus program Wednesday.
The three television reporters I happened to catch pronounced it a "major defeat," and even The New York Times called it "serious." What makes it serious, and possibly even major, is that new Presidents shouldn't lose showdowns like this during their first hundred days.
This is when a new President ought to be proving he is a winner, somebody you mess with only if you don't mind getting your block knocked off. In the fight over the economic stimulus program, it was the President who got his block knocked off.
The reason: He couldn't buy four senators. He had 56, which is a majority, but he needed 60 because a Republican filibuster was preventing the Senate from voting, and the quaint Senate rule says a majority isn't enough to squelch a filibuster. It takes 60.
Which is why Lyndon Johnson comes to mind. Johnson's demonizers have done such a good job blackening his name that people have forgotten he was the last President who understood the science of domestic politics. It is inconceivable that L.B.J. would have accepted a Senate defeat for lack of four votes.
Without cataloguing Johnson's full line of equipment for changing senatorial minds, I merely point out that the most formidable part of it was knowledge: he knew what every senator most needed, and what every senator most desired.
And every senator, like every other politician, is a mass of needs and desires, some of which are of absolute urgency, and most of which Presidents can happily fulfill. Or frustrate.
In "The Best and the Brightest" David Halberstam tells of Frank Church, Senator from Idaho and critic of Johnson's Vietnam policy, meeting with L.B.J., and Johnson asking where Church was getting material for his powerful anti-war speeches. Getting it from Walter Lippmann, the newspaper columnist, said Church.
And L.B.J. said: Next time you want a new dam out in Idaho, Frank, just ask Walter Lippmann for it.
Such is a President's power to sway senators' minds once he understands what makes them swayable. Cynics, who are often right anyhow, say that almost everything in politics has its price, including senators.
It is a graceless way to state the matter, but a President who can't buy a few senators when a few mean the difference between triumph and embarrassment probably didn't do his homework in President's school.
Which is why Franklin Roosevelt comes to mind, and a story I heard told at a long-ago Washington dinner by Thomas (Tommy the Cork) Corcoran, once one of Roosevelt's bright young men:
Counting votes on an important bill, F.D.R. was astonished when an adviser warned him that he would have to do a large favor for a distinguished Senator from the cactus belt or lose his vote. Roosevelt observed that he had just recently granted this statesman a considerable boon.
"How often do we have to buy him?" he asked. And was told: "Every time, Mr. President. Every time."
What efforts more persuasive than collegial discourse President Clinton may have made to win four crucial senators have not been publicly disclosed. One hesitates to assume there was an attempt to buy a few. The mere suggestion sounds brutally uncouth for an Administration rich in young Ivy League lawyers come to Washington to do good.
Which brings Franklin Roosevelt again to mind, for he too was surrounded by brilliant young lawyers who, as the old Washington wheeze has it, "came to do good, and stayed to do well." The present crop will do neither unless they learn that senators, even the Republican kind, are as human as the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Home Radon Curbs Need Not Be Costly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Environmental Protection Agency recently released two documents on indoor radon, a radioactive gas found in many homes. Your April 7 report, whose headline states we urge radon curbs in new homes, needs clarification. 
 Unlike many E.P.A. programs, E.P.A.'s radon-abatement program is nonregulatory. E.P.A. issues only "guidance" standards, based on recent research and technology, to be implemented on a voluntary basis.
You also report that some agency economists and home builders say the cost of new construction standards and testing requirements for radon could be $1 billion to $2 billion a year nationwide. The agency vigorously disputes such cost estimates.
After extensive collaboration with the National Association of Home Builders, E.P.A. estimates that these new construction guidelines, if adopted, would cost about $75 million if used in all 145,000 new homes built annually in the highest risk radon areas. If you add real estate testing cost estimates of $130 million to test all homes sold annually, the total would be about $200 million -- a stark contrast to $1 billion to $2 billion.
The agency and major health organizations, like the American Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have concluded radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. From National Academy of Sciences studies, radon exposure is estimated to cause 7,000 to 30,000 lung cancer deaths yearly in the United States.
Radon is a naturally occurring pollutant, invisible, odorless and tasteless. The only way to determine if a home has a radon problem is to test for it. A home can be tested for as little as $25 to determine if there is a radon problem. Most homes won't have a radon problem. But if high levels are found, radon levels can be successfully reduced with straightforward techniques. Individuals can take simple steps to prevent this serious health hazard, unlike most other environmental pollutants, in their home.

HIGH RISE
How 1,000 Men and Women
Worked Around the Clock
for Five Years
and Lost $200 Million
Building a Skyscraper.
By Jerry Adler.
Illustrated. 374 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $25. 
 WHETHER welcomed or despised, the many towers that bounded skyward in New York City during the 1980's seemed as inevitable as if produced by natural forces. On learning about the coincidences, accidents and sheer chance that shaped a single skyscraper, however, one marvels that anything got built at all.
The "High Rise" of Jerry Adler's narrative is 1540 Broadway, on Times Square, which sprouted during a building boom and limped to completion during a recession. Led by the developer Ian Bruce Eichner, hundreds of people spent hundreds of millions of dollars to produce an empty box 44 stories tall. (It has since been acquired by the Bertelsmann media conglomerate and renamed the Bertelsmann Building.)
Dramatic as they are, real-estate debacles are not easy to chronicle. When a property tips over the edge into bankruptcy or foreclosure, the developer usually hides behind lawyers who will not comment.
What makes "High Rise" a valuable postscript to the latest boom-and-bust cycle is that Mr. Adler, a senior editor at Newsweek, witnessed the tumultuous process firsthand, thanks to the cooperation of Mr. Eichner and his associates, and recorded in detail those episodes that they would probably rather forget.
Money was consumed in prying hold-out tenants from existing buildings and shoring up the landmark Lyceum Theater next door on 45th Street when it developed a large crack during excavations. Mr. Eichner wrestled with his architects over design and materials. And he struggled with his retail partners over a multimedia electronic display called the "Whiz Bang," which was supposed to animate the shopping atrium at the building's base but succeeded only in driving the development team apart. Meanwhile, prospective office tenants came and went.
Punctuating this tale are fascinating digressions about zoning, financing and construction. For instance, to explain why engineers must factor human metabolism into the design of ventilation and cooling systems, Mr. Adler notes that the working population of 1540 Broadway was expected to give off heat that was the caloric equivalent of three pizzas every minute. To explain why elevator consultants tend to specify more cabs than are absolutely necessary, he says: "The consequence of underelevatoring -- riots in the lobby by lawyers forced to wait a whole minute to start making money -- is too awful to contemplate."
A small shadow is cast on the book by errors like the description of the RCA Building as having a spire. By themselves, these mistakes do not compromise the points Mr. Adler is trying to make, but they raise the suspicion that other details may not be entirely reliable.
A larger shadow is cast by the relationship between author and subject. The Bruce Eichner who emerges in this account is a terribly earnest and hard-working man compromised by forces outside his control; he is far more admirable than the arrogant, devil-may-care figure portrayed in the popular press. Did Mr. Adler discover the true Bruce Eichner or fall too far under his spell? Although the author offers the assurance that the opinions in the book are his own, it would have helped to know what conditions, if any, were imposed on his reporting.
When the differences over the building project erupt into litigation, Mr. Adler briefly describes the lawsuits and the various accusations of malfeasance, but declares, "This is not the place to determine the truth of these allegations." Why not? Given his singular knowledge of the subject and his presumed disinterest, Mr. Adler would have been the perfect guide through the tangle of conflicting assertions on which the story ends.

PICTURING TIME
The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904).
By Marta Braun.
Illustrated. 450 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $65.
 
ETIENNE-JULES MAREY
A Passion for the Trace.
By Francois Dagognet.
Translated by Robert Galeta
with Jeanine Herman.
Illustrated. 204 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Zone Books/The MIT Press. $26.95. 
 THE 19th-century French scientist, inventor and photographic innovator Etienne-Jules Marey has long been consigned to the margins of the history of photography. Compared with Eadweard James Muybridge, a contemporary whose stop-action images of human and animal locomotion are frequently reproduced and exhibited, he is a virtual cipher. One might suspect that this disparity is because Muybridge made better pictures than Marey, especially since their subject matter and interests often overlapped. Or perhaps it is because Muybridge, who murdered his wife's lover in addition to taking photographs of everything from Yosemite Valley to galloping horses, led a more intriguing life.
Neither supposition is accurate. Marey was never a professional photographer like Muybridge, but the photographs he produced between 1882 and 1901 are not only unexpectedly beautiful, but also useful in a sense that Muybridge's pictures are not. And Marey's career was phenomenally fruitful and varied; he had an effect on physiology, aviation, physical education, industrial management, cinema and 20th-century art in profound and often startling ways.
Trained as a physiologist, Marey dedicated his life to finding ways to record the workings of the body. His first invention was an ungainly, strap-on machine that charted the pulse. This was the first "graphic inscriptor" used in modern medicine, according to Marta Braun -- a professor in the department of film and photography at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Torono -- whose "Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904)" is a paragon of judicious historical reassessment. The camera, Ms. Braun argues convincingly, was merely another recording device for Marey, albeit one with the essential ability to chart movement through both space and time.
Marey's experiments with what he called "chronophotography" led him to develop cameras with oscillating shutters controlled by clockwork-style gears, so that each exposure occurred at a precise interval from the one before it and the one after it. Despite the practical difficulties of getting sufficient exposure and contrast to illustrate human movement clearly, Marey persevered with stop-motion photography for some 20 years. Many of his pictures are masterpieces of economy, capturing all the phases of a complex activity like pole-vaulting within the confines of a single frame and possessing what the art historian Aaron Scharf has called a "poetic force."
There is no disputing that Muybridge's early motion studies of horses, done under the patronage of the railroad tycoon Leland Stanford, predate Marey's first involvement with photography. Indeed, it was Muybridge's visit to Paris in 1881 that inspired the Burgundy-born physiologist to develop his own stop-action cameras. But whereas Muybridge kept one eye on the camera and one on the marketplace, Marey was the model of a disinterested scientist. Marey intuitively recognized what Ms. Braun reveals as the scandal of Muybridge's corpus of locomotion studies: they are so full of gaps, rearrangements and seemingly willful deceptions that they are useless as objective data. Marey's chronophotographs, on the other hand, scrupulously adhere to the scientific method of the time.
Marey can also claim to have developed the first workable motion picture projector, which he devised as a means of synthesizing the aspects of motion he took such pains to isolate. (As Ms. Braun's recounting of 19th-century experiments with pre-cinematic devices like the phenakistoscope and zoopraxiscope suggests, Marey, like Thomas Edison and the Lumieres, was only one of several "fathers" of the cinema.) In addition, his interest in how birds fly led him to experiments that paved the way for the Wright brothers' flight, and his motion studies of athletes created new methods of physical training and inspired subsequent studies of how workers perform tasks in industrial settings.
"Picturing Time" is a first-rate model of what is called the new art history or, more modestly, contextualist art history. While much of it is devoted to a well-researched and presented biography of Marey, its importance lies in Ms. Braun's insistence on treating Marey's images as more than esthetic tokens. Marey, in her view, was not an autonomous producer of marvelous, revealing pictures but a representative of the 19th-century positivist faith in objective measurement and recording. Thus his photographs are more complex and interesting than heretofore imagined.
This is not to say that Marey's pictures had no influence on the art world. As Ms. Braun demonstrates, Cubists, Futurists and Dadaists all made use of his images in their attempts to forge a new perspective reflective of modernity. She says that the impact of Marey's pictures on early modernist artists was "probably greater than any scientific work . . . since the discovery of perspective in the Renaissance," citing Marcel Duchamp's "Nude Descending a Staircase" and Giacomo Balla's "Girl Running on a Balcony" as two well-known examples. Just because artists used Ma rey's pictures as models, however, one should not be tempted to conclude that Marey intended his photographs as works of art.
If Ms. Braun's thoughtful and well-organized explication of Marey's achievements and influences exemplifies the virtues of the contextualist method of art history, Francois Dagognet's "Etienne-Jules Marey: A Passion for the Trace" is a model of most of the method's faults. The title perhaps is sufficient warning, but Mr. Dagognet, who teaches epistemology at the University of Lyons, is capable of overheated, undocumented generalizations apparently beyond the remedial grasp of any editor or translator. Contextualism? Here is Mr. Dagognet on the impact on Futurism of what he calls "Mareyism": "Marey made it possible for the avant-garde to become receptive to new values: instead of escape into the past, the unreal or the dream, there was the double cult of machines and their propulsion. . . . One could hear the beating and hum of Marey's motors as well as his hearts. This was the double idolatry of powerful machines and their speed -- the simultaneous overtaking of space and time!"
Just how Marey's photographs "made it possible" for the avant-garde to enter the machine age is left to the reader. But while Mr. Dagognet's enthusiastic text is no match for Ms. Braun's detailed arguments and scholarship, he agrees with her about the importance of Marey's work -- as an example of 19th-century positivism and as a precursor of 20th-century modernism.

HEADLINE: Angels' Angels

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber; Bruce Weber writes the On Stage, and Off column for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In a bright morning in mid-March, the splashy, old-fashioned lights outside the Walter Kerr Theater on West 48th Street in Manhattan suddenly flashed on and began their Busby Berkeley-ish dance around the the theater's empty marquee. As photographers on the street snapped away, a crane hoisted a billboard announcing the next attraction -- "Angels in America" by Tony Kushner.
The billboard presents an eerie painting by Milton Glaser: a dark figure, human but winged, crouching in an attitude that could be interpreted as supplication, obeisance or grief. It's a fair representation of Kushner's play, a two-part, seven-hour epic that considers the AIDS plague as the defining metaphor for a national spiritual decline during the 1980's and as the starting point of a social order for the next century. 
 At a time when Broadway, dominated by ostentatious British musicals and American revivals, seems to have virtually abdicated its role as the prime showcase of new plays, "Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes" is the most eagerly awaited production of the last several seasons. Part 1, "Millennium Approaches," which just won the Pulitzer Prize, opens on May 4. President Clinton has been invited; so has Madonna. (Kushner is rewriting Part 2, "Perestroika," which will go into rehearsals over the summer and begin showing in repertory with Part 1 in the fall.)
So the billboard being fitted on the marquee was a moment hard to beat for symbolic value -- the glitz of Broadway meets the sobriety of ambitious drama. And it certainly wasn't lost on the men posing for pictures below it: Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the Kerr; Gordon Davidson, whose Center Theater Group in Los Angeles produced both parts of "Angels in America" for the first time last fall, and Kushner himself, a 36-year-old playwright who lives in Brooklyn and who was relatively obscure until enthusiasm for "Angels" escalated into a kind of hysteria during the staging of "Millennium Approaches" at the Royal National Theater in London a year ago.
For these three men -- one a kind of upstart entrepreneur bent on forcing the commercial theater to acknowledge the late 20th century, another a theater guy in a movie town 3,000 miles from center stage and the third a sudden star who has emerged from the minority fringe to test his artistic power in the mainstream spotlight -- the arrival of "Angels" in New York is a climax of aspirations. Their fortunes -- and the show's -- are being handicapped all over the theater world with the outcome viewed as a bellwether for the future of innovative drama on Broadway.
In "Angels in America," eight actors play some 30 roles, including voices, ghosts and hallucinations. But the main figures are a gay couple, one of whom is dying of AIDS; a Mormon man, who is just waking to his homosexuality, and his agoraphobic wife, and Roy Cohn, the power-mongering reactionary lawyer who died of AIDS in 1986. The dialogue, some furious, some anguished, some uproariously comic, is pitched to searing, wicked condemnation of the nation's collective conscience during the Reagan-Bush years.
Though it is an unconventional and challenging work, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who doubts that "Angels in America" deserves the wide audience only Broadway can attract. In London and Los Angeles, critics have gone berserk; even longtime theater professionals who generally reserve their superlatives for the dead have checked in. "I believe it will be seen as perhaps the most important theatrical event of the latter part of the century," says Jason Steven Cohen, the producing director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater in Greenwich Village, where the play was supposed to appear before a fevered auction among Broadway producers and theater owners kidnapped it for uptown.
The story of "Angels in America" is a case study of how theatrical art and commerce coalesce, an illustration of the well-worn path from inspiration to collaboration. But it's also a tale of the hunger in the theater world for hits, for art, for attention to a medium that has been eclipsed by movies and television. As the 11 producers' names above the title attest, this is a show that everyone wants to put a thumbprint on. Yet nobody thinks it'll make a lot of money. By the producers' estimates, it will have to run a year -- a dicey bet -- to recoup its backers' $2.2 million investment. And as Rocco Landesman points out: "What does recoup mean? It means we're back to where we started."
In a startling theatrical moment at the end of "Millennium Approaches," an angel crashes through the ceiling of a dying man's bedroom. It's fair to ask about the play what audiences ask about this symbol. Where does this angel come from? What does this angel portend?
IT WAS IN THE MID-1980'S, AFTER HE GRADUATED from Columbia and the graduate theater program at New York University, that Tony Kushner wrote a poem about Mormons and the paradox of their biased ways in the service of good works.
A recently uncloseted gay man with an intellectual bent, an interest in Freud and feminism, fiercely left-leaning political views and what he describes as "a guilty affection for this country," Kushner was, at the time, on a directing fellowship at the St. Louis Repertory Theater. The poem, written on an introspective whim, was called "Angels in America" and was bad enough, Kushner says, that he won't show it to anyone now. But it contained the seeds of the play he began writing in 1987, commissioned by his friend Oskar Eustis, a like-minded (if heterosexual) and visually inventive dramaturg, then the artistic director of the Eureka Theater in San Francisco.
"All I knew," Kushner says, "was that I wanted to write about gay men, Mormons and Roy Cohn."
A tall, oddly cherubic-looking man with a small earring in one ear, Kushner, the son of musicians, grew up in Lake Charles, La. He has spoken freely about the influence that harboring his secret homosexuality had on his play. He also acknowledges the influence of Kimberly Flynn, a fellow student at Columbia with whom he spent thousands of hours discussing Marxism and feminism and sexual politics and who remains his closest friend.
"The thing I learned most from her," Kushner says, "is that justice is part of the human condition. Injustice is anti-life."
There is more to Flynn's contribution to the play, however. In 1984, Flynn was involved in a taxicab accident, leaving her brain-injured, a condition from which she is, at long last, recovered.
"The business of helping her handle the sequellae to the accident was my most direct experience with serious health problems," Kushner says. "To that extent, there are elements of her story that have become incorporated in 'Angels.' I feel ambivalent about using them. Going through a terrible crisis with someone is, after all, not the same as going through the crisis."
As Kushner tells it, the play could not have been written without Flynn. Nor could it have been written without Oskar Eustis, whose serendipitous meeting with Kushner one evening in 1985 happened only because he was late for the theater.
"I'd missed a curtain at the Public and a friend of mine said, 'Why don't you come to a play with me?' " Eustis recalls. "It was at a loft in the 20's and I was bowled over by it."
The play was Kushner's first full-length work, "A Bright Room Called Day," a drama that drew parallels between the fall of the Weimar Republic in Germany and the Reagan years in the United States. Eustis quickly glommed onto it, announcing his interest by singing the Internationale along with the cast at the end of the first act. Eventually he produced and directed its professional premiere at the Eureka in the fall of 1987.
By that time, Eustis and Kushner were a team, well into the planning of their next project, which Eustis describes as short and humorous but with serious intellectual underpinnings having to do with the shared migratory experience of Jews, Mormons and homosexuals.
"The idea had to do with the exodus history of America," Eustis says. "You set out from an oppressive old place, go into the wilderness and reinvent yourself, start a new community free of the plagues of the old one. And yet you can never do that, really.
"We were terribly excited about this 90-minute comedy. But then in the fall of 1988, the first draft came in and we knew we were in trouble. It was 240 pages long and didn't come close to the end of any story. The angel just came in through the roof."
The long manuscript, delivered late, was the start of tensions between the two friends, as their aspirations for it began to diverge. It was, essentially, a struggle between collaborators over whose vision should be chiefly served and it was resolved only when Eustis suggested that someone else -- anyone else -- direct the play in New York. But that was still four years away.
By that time, an inexorable force had gathered behind the play, the initial signs of which became apparent to Kushner at the the first reading of it, which took place two days after Thanksgiving 1988 at the New York Theater Workshop under the auspices of its artistic director, James C. Nicola.
"I was in the lobby apologizing to people, telling them it was so long they could get up and walk out if they wanted," Kushner remembers. "But during the breaks they told me to shut up and let the actors finish. And when it was over, Jim Nicola came up to me and said: 'I want to produce this play. Immediately.' "
While that was impossible because of the Eureka commission, it was, Kushner says, his first inkling that he was on to something unusual. He decided rather than go ahead with the scheduled opening at the Eureka that spring to continue writing a play that he felt, even at more than four hours long, was only half finished.
Not surprisingly, this angered the board of the Eureka, a struggling company financially (it's now moribund, having not staged a full production since last spring), which at the last minute had to revamp its spring schedule without the show meant to be its centerpiece. Everyone ended up mad, and the future of the show might have been far different if another bit of serendipity, in the form of Gordon Davidson, hadn't materialized. It was owing to Davidson's instinct and opportunism that the play took its next step up the theater ladder.
AS ARTISTIC HEAD OF THE center Theater Group, which operates the Mark Taper Forum and other theaters in Los Angeles, Davidson, 59, is essentially the theater godfather of Southern California. He has shipped many shows dealing with social issues east from the Taper, some of them turning out to be hits (notably "Children of a Lesser God" and "Jelly's Last Jam"). But as a New York expatriate in a city where movie executives buy up subscription tickets to his theaters and then don't show up for the play, he has been working in relative obscurity for 26 years.
A paternal, if occasionally self-promoting gray eminence, Davidson admired Eustis's work, and in early 1989 he invited Eustis to become a resident director at the Taper. Eustis, fed up with the Eureka, accepted, and on a kind of unofficial basis brought "Angels" with him. Discussions between the Taper and the Eureka ensued, and Davidson eventually made a deal: the Taper would develop the play on its own, but the Eureka would stage the world premiere.
One immediate consequence of the Taper's acquisition was dividing the play into its two present parts. Kushner says it was Robert Egan, the theater's associate artistic director, who first suggested to him that his play wasn't half done; rather, Egan told Kushner, there were two related plays and that Part 1 could stand alone.
"I now believe he was completely right," Kushner says, living up to his reputation for mulishness. Davidson, for his part, wasn't sure either, but he promised Kushner up front that the Taper would present both plays together, thereby earning the playwright's loyalty.
"I honestly didn't know if he had one long play or a two-part play," says Davidson. "But when you heard it, when you saw it, you knew you were in the presence of a writer."
The work on "Millennium Approaches" subsidized by the Taper was substantial. There were dozens of readings and workshops and finally a nearly full-scale production, with an $80,000 budget, held in the spring of 1990.
By that time, the play was causing a buzz. The final Taper workshop, reviewed locally with enthusiasm, was attended by representatives of the Royal National Theater in London, who, with the prescient instinct of outsiders and the British curiosity about the Colonies, expressed a desire to present it.
Eustis and Kushner were satisfied that "Millennium" was a finished product -- "We felt we could ship it to England," he says -- and they set their sights on the world premiere of "Angels in America" in San Francisco, a production that was to include "Perestroika," which was scheduled for the following spring.
The problem was that "Perestroika" was still an embryo, and Kushner, an anguished writer under the best of circumstances, was distracted over the summer by the death of his mother. "They wouldn't let me off the hook," Kushner says, still evidently smarting from the Eureka's pressure on him to meet his deadlines.
Indeed, the draft of "Perestroika" he submitted at the end of the summer was concluded in abrupt, absurd fashion. "All the characters are standing at the base of the Empire State Building and an atom bomb goes off and that's the end of 'Angels in America,' " he says. "It didn't work, but it's what I did to get out of my obligation."
Nonetheless, the play went on as scheduled, directed by David Esbjornson, then a Taper artistic associate who, unlike Eustis or Kushner, had no ax to grind with the Eureka board.
"Frankly, I think both Oskar and Tony knew it was going to be a very difficult situation," Esbjornson says, reflecting on why the job came to be his. And though Esbjornson, who is now artistic director of the Classic Stage Company in New York, calls the production of "Millennium" perhaps his best work, the whole episode was, apparently, an odd one. "Millennium Approaches" was a great success, in spite of incidents of scenery collapsing and other low-budget catastrophes. But "Perestroika" was still so far from completion that it was a little ludicrous to have put it on at all.
"At the time we started rehearsals, I had one act of 'Perestroika' written," says Kushner, who with "Millennium" in rehearsals, went off to a cabin on the Russian River in Northern California. There, he says, "in 10 days I wrote 293 pages."
The Eureka staged 17 readings of it, "but it was so long," Kushner says, "we had to skip over some of the larger parts."
Thus the twins were split-up: as "Perestroika" went back to Los Angeles for rehab, "Millennium Approaches" went to England and became a star.
DECLAN DONNELLAN, the man who made "Angels in America" a sensation in England, first heard about it in Brazil. That's where he was in the summer of 1991, on tour with his production company, Cheek by Jowl, when Richard Eyre, the director of the Royal National Theater, sent him a copy by courier and asked him to direct it.
He was immediately attracted to the American-ness of the story, which he felt deserved a wider audience than just America. And it reminded him, he says, "in its complete lack of sentimentality" of the 17th-century plays he's more accustomed to staging. As both director and author point out, Kushner was the first living playwright Donnellan had ever worked with.
"During most of the rehearsal period, he seemed very likely to join the ranks of the dead," Donnellan says.
With the opening scheduled for January 1992, Kushner flew to London in December, where, by both his and Donnellan's reckoning, he made a pest of himself. He objected to, among other things, the set, which presented the action inside a large stars-and-stripes decorated box, as though it were illustrative of wretched American excess.
"I thought, 'Oh, God, they don't really like the play -- they just want to do this play to knock America,' " Kushner says, adding, "Declan wasn't used to getting anybody else's input, much less a writer's."
For Kushner, a self-confessed control freak who in rehearsals is used to providing directors with pages of unasked-for and unwanted notes, the experience in London was a trial that bore rewards. After seeing one run-through and panicking, he recalls, Donnellan laid down some ground rules: Kushner would not be allowed to see the first preview. At the second preview, he had to sit in the audience, not stand at the back, and he couldn't take notes.
"I was stunned when I finally saw it," Kushner says. "It had blossomed in a way that hadn't seemed possible. And what I learned is that directing is not sculpting. It's about releasing energy, not imprisoning it."
Still, it was not until opening night that Kushner had his catharsis. He can't bear watching openings, so instead he was invited to partake of a Royal National Theater tradition. He set off the Ralph rocket -- a firework launched over the Thames at the moment the curtain is raised -- named for Ralph Richardson, who initiated the rite.
"I went up to the balcony and shot this Roman candle-looking thing off," he says. "And this enormous purple explosion lit up the sky. That was the happiest moment for me."
There were more of them: sterling reviews, the Evening Standard Award for the year's best play and an agreement with Donnellan that they'd work together again on "Perestroika."
Meanwhile, if producers in New York had not heard the rumble in Los Angeles, the thunder in London got their attention. Rocco Landesman saw it there; so did Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld, the president and chairman respectively of the Shubert Organization, New York's largest theater-owning group. And so did Frank Rich, whose glittering encomium in The New York Times in March 1992 compared the playwright to John Dos Passos. "Mr. Kushner has created an original theatrical world of his own," Rich wrote, "poetic and churning, that, once entered by an open-minded viewer of any political or sexual persuasion, simply cannot be ignored." As perhaps the most palpable signal of Kushner's emerging stardom, the Gap asked him to pose for an ad.
The focus on the show shifted back to Los Angeles, where Gordon Davidson prepared to make good on his promise to stage the whole kit and caboodle. And by then, rumors had already begun to circulate that after Los Angeles, "Angels" would bypass a previously arranged engagement at the Public Theater in New York and go straight to Broadway. A commercial run!
"When it was a big critical success at the National," Oskar Eustis says. "it changed the stratosphere in which we were moving."
BUT FOR KUSHNER, Eustis and Davidson the excitement meant headaches. For them the project was not just a matter of moving the London production across the ocean. Donnellan had other obligations, and besides, Davidson had spent more than $100,000 of the Taper's money developing the play. He wanted a Taper production with the Davidson imprimatur.
For that matter, so did Eustis, who expected, at last, to direct it. This was a debt Kushner intended to honor.
"In a sense," Kushner says, "the play was written in dialogue with Oskar. I started out writing it for him to direct."
Mounting a seven-hour play with less than two months' rehearsal time is more or less impossible. In addition, "Perestroika" was still unfocused, flabby. As deadlines accumulated -- for set designs, lighting schemes and the like -- the pressure ratcheted up significantly. And when work on "Millennium" was complete and that on "Perestroika" began, worry burgeoned into discontent. Some of the actors began to feel Eustis was overwhelmed. His disagreements with Kushner were mounting, even though a co-director, Anthony Taccone, had been appointed to share the mammoth task.
"There was an attempt to hedge the bet," Davidson says. "Taccone's strengths would complement Oskar's weakness, but it was an idea better in conception than execution."
Kushner absolves Eustis -- "I love watching Oskar's work on other people's shows," he says -- and, in fact, he takes much of the blame on himself. "This was the first, the flagship, production. I needed it to be the way I wanted it to be."
Kushner was rewriting madly to the last moment; an 11-page monologue delivered by the angel had to be memorized by the actress, Ellen McLaughlin, the night before the critics' opening.
"We ended up exposing 'Perestroika' not unfairly but dangerously," Davidson says. "It hadn't benefited from the gestation the first part had."
The problems in Los Angeles were symbolized by the angel, which never quite managed to fly right; the complicated rigging left McLaughlin, after crashing through the ceiling, hanging there spinning, slowly and helplessly.
"The designs were redesigned," Kushner says, "but then her wig would get caught in it. Finally, we got it so that if nobody breathed in the theater and we got the lights off quickly, you wouldn't see her start spinning. But she always sort of torqued a little bit to the left."
WHEN "Angels in America"opened for a limited run at the Mark Taper Forum in October, it quickly became a celebrated ticket. The screen stars came out for the day-night marathons -- they laughed! they wept! -- and cast members began hearing from agents they hadn't heard from in years.
Stephen Spinella, an actor who had been with the project from the outset in San Francisco, tells the story of eating lunch with a new agent for the first time and being approached at his table by a vaguely familiar man.
"He came over to the table and said, 'Don't I know you?' And I said, 'I don't know.' And he said: 'You were in 'Angels in America' and I thought you were terrific. I'm Paul Mazursky.' That was the best, and I'm sitting there with my new agent."
Reviews, though superb overall and gentle in their acknowledging that "Perestroika" was still a work in progress, nonetheless took notice that more work needed to be done before the show came to a Broadway stage, which, by the beginning of November, began to seem inevitable. All three Broadway theater-owning groups -- the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization and Jujamcyn Theaters -- and several independent producers expressed interest. Jujamcyn even commissioned an audience survey at the Taper, the better to discuss with Kushner their plans for marketing the show.
More ominously, Frank Rich, reviewing the show for a second time, while lionizing Kushner as a playwright with the promise to both "change the world" and "revolutionize the theater," compared the direction and the set design at the Taper unfavorably with those in London, which worried those who wanted to produce the play in New York. It was a surprise to no one when Davidson announced what had already been decided but kept unpublicized, that when the show moved East, it would have another director and designer, which meant the production would have to be mounted from scratch. Again.
For Kushner, however, the move to New York loomed as a genuine moral crossroad. Where did this play belong? In a small, nonprofit theater that has been traditionally devoted to new work, experimental work, politically argumentative work? Or in the commercial world where more people would undoubtedly get to see it, but where art is frequently compromised by the profit motive?
He spent two weeks mulling over his options, consulting frequently with his agent, Joyce Ketay, his old friend Jim Nicola and Davidson.
At the same time, he was having the dizzying experience of being wooed by independent producers and given his choice of New York's most prestigious theaters. The Shuberts even ignored some of their empty houses and offered the Booth, a lovely, intimate theater on prime 45th Street real estate, suggesting they would move the show that was already there, "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," somewhere else.
But Kushner had not yet ruled out the Public, the flagship of the New York Shakespeare Festival, whose then-artistic director, JoAnne Akalaitis, made a final, fevered pitch to land the show that went directly to Kushner's conscience. The play is, after all, a proud cry on behalf of a maligned minority, and indeed it speaks with bruising intellect and emotion against the status quo, the very people whose embrace it would ask for on Broadway.
"JoAnne made a very, very moving speech to me," Kushner says. "She said: 'This is a play that comes directly from the downtown community. It needs to be seen as our play before it goes to a larger community.' That made it hard to say no."
IN THE END, OF course, that's what he said. He also said no to Bernie Jacobs, the venerable Shubert president, who at the last minute summoned Kushner to his office for a two-hour meeting. The meeting, on Wednesday, Dec. 9, impressed Kushner and left Jacobs with the sense he'd won the young man over.
But Kushner wanted everything for his play -- maximum exposure and fidelity to its roots -- and over the course of the play's journey he'd learned a lot about the power he had to get his way. The day after his meeting with Jacobs, he chose the Walter Kerr Theater, a Jujamcyn house whose creative staff would also be active producers of the show along with a passel of other producers who pledged to make the show inviting to a less affluent downtown community.
It was Gordon Davidson who made the call to the Shuberts, with whom he has considerable business ties (among other things, his wife is a press agent who handles many Shubert shows on the road). The news unleashed from Jacobs a stream of vivid vituperation. "It's going to take a while to repair that relationship," Davidson said at the time.
For the Shuberts, the commercial theater's most powerful entity, it was a bitter moment. Their theaters house the long-running Lloyd Webber musicals and their reputation for being canny businessmen rather than supporters of art is built partly on the fact that these houses are filled with highly profitable tourist attractions instead of spicier new works. Jacobs and the organization's chairman, Gerald Schoenfeld, fervently object to this characterization and constantly collect chits to support the contrary argument: "Dancing at Lughnasa," "The Sisters Rosensweig," "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me" and "Falsettos," among others, all found Shubert homes.
But unlike Jujamcyn, the Shuberts are rarely involved with the creative end of production and in recent years have pulled back on their investments, preferring the safer role of landlord. And so their reputation persists, and "Angels in America," the biggest chit of all, got away.
The other big loser was JoAnne Akalaitis, who last month was ousted by the board of the New York Shakespeare Festival, in large part because projects that cause this kind of excitement were not ending up at the Public Theater. Akalaitis was slow in warming to "Angels," or at least she didn't get heated up over the play until it looked as though she'd lose it. In the end, all she managed to land for the Shakespeare Festival was its name listed as associate producer and tickets for its subscribers.
For Rocco Landesman, meanwhile, it was a huge victory in what has become Jujamcyn's war against Broadway business as usual. In the last five years under Landesman's stewardship, Jujamcyn, which owns just five theaters in New York, has been aggressively trying to reinvigorate the Broadway scene and expand its audience beyond the middle-aged and older white middle class.
Clearly, "Angels in America" is a project that fits Jujamcyn's goals. And it also suits Landesman, 46, a slight, jittery man with thinning red hair and a pointy beard who is an unrepentant gambler; when he isn't betting on long-shot shows, he's off playing the ponies.
"This is what I took the job for," he says. "If we're not going to try to make something like this work, where's the fun?"
At the time, Kushner said he made his decision for all of these reasons, which essentially boils down to his favoring the style of Landesman and his creative director, Jack Viertel, to that of the Shuberts. But asked again, weeks later, he says simply: "Rocco and Jack are the people who came up with the idea of George, and that was a really good idea."
GEORGE IS GEORGE C. Wolfe, the writer and director of "Jelly's Last Jam" and currently perhaps the most sought-after theater talent of any kind -- actor, director, writer or producer. He is known for being in touch with the modern world in a way that few mainstream theater types are these days. At age 38, black and gay, he has fringe-culture credentials and an ear for for what's humming downtown. At the same time, with "Jelly's" -- famous for its inventively brisk staging and its black-on-black social politics -- he's shown he can make those things palatable, even alluring, in the more staid Broadway environment. The same qualities were cited by the board of the New York Shakespeare Festival when it tapped Wolfe as its new producer last month.
Naming Wolfe was, in effect, the producers' first salvo in marketing the show to New York, though the move was not without intrigue. Declan Donnellan was actually approached first, but he was busy. Wolfe was the idea of Margo Lion, one of the show's producers who had worked with him on "Jelly's," and as Landesman says, as soon as she brought it up, everyone knew it was a natural fit.
The problem was that Wolfe also had a previous commitment; he had agreed to direct "Marisol," a play by Jose Rivera, at the Hartford Stage, which was about to go into rehearsals. The offer to direct "Angels" forced him to make a decision it still pains him to recall. It pained the Hartford Stage, too. In a public statement, its artistic director, Mark Lamos, called Wolfe's move, and the "Angels" producers encouragement of it, "reprehensible."
"It was the first time in my career where what I was supposed to do, because of the journey it would take me on as an artist, was counter to what I was supposed to do because of decent, correct behavior," he says. "It was awful. It was like, 'What do I honor?' " Wolfe says no ego was involved in his final decision, though he's keenly aware of his growing stature -- the show's costume designer, Toni-Leslie James, refers to Wolfe as George Corleone -- and his landing the "Angels" job was an anointment of sorts. It was certainly a factor in his ascension at the Public just a few weeks later. "I didn't know how to do the play, at first," Wolfe explains. "It scared me. And I sort of have this rule for myself, which is: If something artistically scares you, you must do it."
The New York production has had some rocky moments but not the grievous conflicts that dogged the play elsewhere. The first preview was postponed because of more trouble with the angel's harness, and at the first night before an audience, the ceiling didn't open on cue for the falling angel. After that, the producers decided to postpone the opening for five days to work on the technical problems.
But Wolfe is the first director who has not given Kushner conniptions. And the cast members, uniformly delighted by the opportunity to work on just one play for seven weeks, express excitement, even though three of the eight are performing in the play for the first time.
As a director of actors, Wolfe's style is to be challenging, literary. "You try to find as many truths as you can," he says. He's encouraged Ron Leibman, for instance, to make his Roy Cohn a little less bludgeoning, a little more plaintive, particularly in his relationship with Joe, his ambitious but conscience-stricken protege, whose occasional waffling and moralizing Roy finds frustrating and unforgivable.
"I'm playing the same notes," Leibman says, "But a lot of Roy's anger has become a kind of pleading. Instead of trying to hit Joe over the head, he's trying to make him understand. Then when the boy betrays me, it hurts more. It was George's suggestion. He's been saying to me, 'Try to make him see.' It's another way of playing the music, and I think it's fuller."
Says Stephen Spinella: "It's going to be bleaker than it was in Los Angeles. You know, the sun doesn't shine here as much. It'll be a New York show."
ON MAY 4, IT FINALLY arrives, a New York show indeed, with New York problems, namely the harsh economics of Broadway. With the exception of Wendy Wasserstein's comedy, "The Sisters Rosensweig," the few new shows on Broadway this season have had to struggle. There are no bankable stars attached to "Angels," and its homosexual banner will not help. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago Rocco Landesman asked Kushner to drop his subtitle, "A Gay Fantasia on National Themes," but Kushner wouldn't do it.
"This is no 'Falsettos,' the family gay musical," Kushner told him.
"We wanted to bury the gay fantasia themes," Landesman concedes. "Tony and I had a tough conversation about it. He effectively reminded me why I was drawn to the play. It's tough stuff. We should probably present it that way."
At $2.2 million just to get it ready, the show is already hugely expensive for a nonmusical play and weekly production costs are budgeted at about $180,000. Rehearsals for "Perestroika" begin in August, which means that for several weeks performances of "Millennium" will be cut to four. And there are other revenue-reducing factors as well. The producers' agreement stipulates that the New York Shakespeare Festival and the New York Theater Workshop get tickets for their subscribers at subscription prices. Most tickets have been priced at $50 or $60, a record high for a nonmusical. But to accommodate Kushner's insistence that the show not be out of the economic reach of people who should see it, second balcony seats are to be offered for prices as low as $7.50 for Wednesday matinees. Finally, the show has agreed to donate $1 to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS for every ticket sold.
What all this adds up to is that a lot of tickets have to be sold, and because the Kerr, at 945 seats, is a relatively small theater, that means the play has to run a long time.
"Angels" will be the last nonmusical play to open this season, and the opening itself was scheduled craftily -- even with the delay, it sneaks in just under the deadline for Tony nominations. Auspiciously, on the day of the first preview, "Millennium Approaches" won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, but as Landesman concedes, this show will need all the awards.
"The Tonys will be very important," Landesman says. "I would say decisive. A play as tough as this one without the imprimatur of the Tony that says this is the year's snob hit, it'll have a tough go."
The question, obviously, is why bother? Why not leave plays like this to regional theater, to the world of nonprofit? Theater professionals tend to have long memories and when they talk about Broadway today, even pragmatic producers like Landesman and Gordon Davidson wax nostalgic about Broadway back then, a place where hundreds of shows once opened annually, a veritable supermarket of theatrical goods.
It's that spirit that partly explains their involvement in "Angels in America," a play they believe in so deeply that it has grown almost to represent the crisis for serious drama on Broadway. If this show doesn't make it, what will?
But it also has to do with a belief in the power of art. Unfashionable as it is to accept high-mindedness as a motive, the producers of "Angels" are basically resigned to the show's producing only a modest return at best.
"I think it'll run a season, recoup its investment," says Frederick Zollo, one of the producers. "I don't expect it to be 'Life With Father.' " Zollo had wanted the Shuberts to get the show because they have theaters available with more seats than the Kerr. But he describes the experience of watching the play as "sticking your finger in a light socket -- and liking it," and he was determined to help produce it no matter where it went. For Zollo, and many of the others, too, a project like this is important because it's responsible, both to the theater and to theatergoers. In lowbrow times, it's a way of not giving up.
"I wanted to do this one very badly," Zollo says. "And I think there's an audience for it. There's an audience for risk. We don't test the audience much. If we tested the audience more, they'd come. What's the line from the Kevin Costner movie? 'If you build it, they will come'? Well, we don't build it very often."
IT IS A MORNING IN March, and in the strangely bomb-shelterish auditorium of the American Place Theater, a few floors below ground on West 46th Street, the "Angels in America" cast is rehearsing. The scene is tricky, with the action on stage separated like a split-screen film and the dialogue ricocheting like verbal pinball.
On one side, in a hospital room, Louis (played by Joe Mantello) is leaving his AIDS-afflicted lover, Prior (Spinella); across the stage, Joe (David Marshall Grant) is explaining to his wife, Harper (Marcia Gay Harden), that he has finally faced the fact that he is homosexual.
Wolfe asks the actors to read through the scene quickly, for lines and timing, and they do so, perfunctorily, several of them munching Harden's homemade bread. At this moment, it's hard for an observer to imagine this play, this uninflated thing, as a harbinger of the future of Broadway.
But then Wolfe suggests, "Let's do it with movement," and the scene begins anew, this time the actors doing their full turns and now a current builds as thedialogue on stage -- anguish mirroring anguish, back and forth, back and forth -- rises to two separate climaxes, four lives facing ruin, one moment of truth.
"If I could get up now, I'd kill you," Prior says to Louis.
"I recognize you now," the hallucinatory Harper says to Joe, identifying him as the recurring figure in her nightmares, "the man with the knives."
Louis leaves. Harper leaves.
"I hurt all over," Prior says, alone on one side of the stage, as Joe sobs on the other. "I wish I was dead."
The theater is uncomfortably silent for a long moment.
"Let's try it again," Wolfe says.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Two Decades After the War

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON; PHILIP SHENON is the Bangkok bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
UNCLE HO never stops smiling as the bicycles whiz past him hour after hour in the middle of the busiest intersection in Hanoi. The bikes converge there beneath a giant billboard that shows a youthful, grinning Ho Chi Minh -- Uncle Ho, or Bach Ho, as he is still affectionately known in north Vietnam -- with a young child held tight in his thin arms.
The Vietnamese bicyclists rarely look up at the billboard, but that is no sign of disrespect for the founder of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. It is a matter of simple survival. 
 The intersection of Trang Tien and Hoang Streets is a ceaseless blur of rubber and chrome -- there are relatively few private cars in the Vietnamese capital, so it is mostly bicycle and motorbike traffic -- and to lift your eyes from the road at this midtown crossing is to risk catastrophe.
The bicyclists pay no attention to a white-gloved, olive-uniformed traffic cop who stands on a small metal platform in the middle of the intersection. His directions, given with precise blasts of a whistle clenched between his front teeth, are ignored.
I tried to gaze up at Ho as I maneuvered my handsome new Vietnamese two-wheeler beneath the billboard and nearly collided with a farmer on the wrong side of the road, carting his potatoes to market.
Miraculously, I did not see a single serious bike collision during a week spent peddling my way through the streets of Hanoi and, apart from that one chaotic intersection, the traffic was remarkably civil.
The North Vietnamese are a determined, practical people -- they tend to win their wars, as they will diplomatically remind you -- and a bicycle is much too valuable a piece of property to allow to be damaged in a foolish accident.
"We are very, very careful if we see a foreigner on a bike," said Mr. Van, the young English-language student from Hanoi University who would prove himself an invaluable companion on my first bicycling tour of the city. "It would be very bad if we ran over an American," he said in the deadly serious tone typical of Northerners, who are also an earnest bunch. "It would be bad for foreign policy." (While the Vietnamese are not prohibited from having contact with foreigners, it can bring them under suspicion from the police, and for that reason I use only one of Mr. Van's three names.)
From a distance Hanoi seems to many foreign travelers a gray, hostile, even frightening place. Certainly for many Americans, the city is inseparable from the ugly headlines of the Vietnam War.
I've met several Americans who, planning a trip to Hanoi, gird themselves for what they assume will be a Southeast Asian Dresden, a bombed-out shell of a city. In fact, the city survived the war largely intact. It is arguably the most beautiful capital in Southeast Asia, a city of quiet, dignified, dilapidated charm borne of 1,000 years of history and struggle. The streets are lined with the architectural legacy of the French colonizers of Vietnam: crumbling but still elegant 19th-century ocher-colored villas and storefronts.
Despite still-primitive tourist facilities, Hanoi is also among the friendliest, most inviting capitals of Asia. The Vietnamese are unfailingly polite to travelers, especially to Americans, whose help they want to revive an economy that is only now beginning to recover from that long-ago war.
That Hanoi retains so much such Old Asian charm is a mixed blessing for the Vietnamese. The colonial-era architecture and greenery have survived not so much because of far-sighted urban planners; they reflect rather Vietnam's long economic stagnation.
After decades of war and disastrous Soviet-style central planning, Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries, and progress -- as measured in much of the rest of Asia by skyscrapers and shopping malls and dirty air -- has yet to arrive for the three million people of Hanoi.
The question for the Vietnamese is how long Hanoi will remain this impoverished, and also this tranquil. The Vietnamese would never admit it, but they have been inspired by the recent economic model offered by their great rivals, the Chinese. In 1986 the Hanoi Government announced a Chinese-style policy of renovation -- doi moi, in Vietnamese -- intended to introduce a free market to Vietnam without dislodging the authoritarian government.
IT seems to be working. The Vietnamese economy is growing quickly, even with an American trade embargo in place, and visiting foreign investors and economists say it is only a matter of time before Hanoi begins to resemble its overdeveloped sister cities elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
Already the old South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, has taken on the appearance of a Bangkok suburb, complete with trendy restaurants and traffic congestion.
Hanoi may be the last major city of Southeast Asia best toured by bicycle -- a gentle breeze rustling through the tamarind and milkwood trees that line the narrow streets, the only other sound that of the tinkling of the handlebar bells on bicycles.
A bicycle tour of Hanoi begins with the search for a bike. The advice I had been given by Vietnamese friends -- and I'm glad I listened to it -- was to buy a new bicycle at the central government emporium on Trang Tien Street, across from the billboard of Uncle Ho. A new bicycle in Vietnam costs a small fraction of what it would in the West, $25 to $45. That guarantees you new wheels and new brakes, no small considerations. And while Vietnamese bicycles are not especially sturdy, they will doubtless survive several days on the capital's pancake-flat streets. Among the rows and rows of bicycles, I was immediately drawn to a sleek model with the brand name of Hanel. It had a price tag of 400,000 Vietnamese dong, or about $40.
It really was handsome, forest green with blue trim, and several wide-eyed children watched enviously as the saleslady pumped up the tires, dusted off the handlebars and raised the seat to accommodate a six-foot American. In her broken English, she thanked me, offering the most memorable line of my trip to Vietnam -- "Happy bike, mister America" -- as I waltzed my two-wheeled treasure to the street.
On my first day of touring, I chose a route that would take me from my hotel, the newly restored colonial-era Pullman Metropole on Ly Thai To Street, past some of the city's most memorable sites and picturesque neighborhoods, and on to its most important landmark, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.
I set off alone but I was quickly joined by a friendly Vietnamese student in his early 20's, Mr. Van, who wanted to test his English, the foreign language that many Vietnamese consider their ticket to prosperity. I welcomed the company.
"Where are you from? Are you from America?" Mr. Van asked as his bicycle pulled alongside mine. "I would be honored to speak English with you." I readily agreed, so long as he would be my tour guide.
We first turned left down Trang Tien Street, in the heart of Hanoi's commercial district, toward the splendid Opera House, built in 1911 by the French as a replica of the Paris Opera. It is now used as a government meeting hall.
Little did the French know that three decades after its construction Vietnamese nationalists would rush to the balcony of the gingerbread Opera House and declare independence from their occupiers.
Most of the city's largest shops and galleries are found at the other end of Trang Tien Street. Mr. Van and I parked outside the Foreign Language Bookshop at 61 Trang Tien Street. Only a year and a half earlier, on my first visit to Hanoi, the shop had been stacked high with Russian-language books. Now, the Russian books had been relegated to a dusty corner, replaced by stacks of English-language texts and the Vietnamese translations of popular modern American novels.
At the end of the block, Mr. Van and I turned right onto the busy thoroughfare that is Hoang Street, which runs along the tree-shaded Hoan Kiem Lake, or the Lake of the Restored Sword. The lake is the heart of the city.
Legend has it, and some variation of the legend is known by all Vietnamese schoolchildren, that this is the home of the magic tortoise that provided the Vietnamese hero Le Loi with a sword he used to liberate Vietnam from the Chinese in the 15th century.
The lake is at its most enchanting in the early evening, when lovers sit beneath delicate willows on its grassy banks. The tiny Tortoise Pagoda in the middle of the lake is the city's emblem.
A few blocks along Hoang Street, past the central post office, the road branches in several directions, all of them leading into the Old Quarter. A tricky place for a bicycle because of the narrow, rutted streets, the Old Quarter is the best place to glimpse colonial-era Hanoi.
We turned left down Hang Bong Street, full of Parisian-style row houses and tiny shops, the most interesting of which were the pharmacies selling traditional medicines.
As Mr. Van explained it to me, the dark-brown juice made from pulverized geckos, the small lizards found throughout the tropics, is thought to be a magic elixir for impotence and respiratory ailments. "You do not think about the taste," he said.
AT 53 Hang Bong is the The Duc The Thao Shop, where a family makes many of the gold-and-red cloth banners that are strung between street lamps during Communist Party celebrations. They take custom orders, as well, and for very little money they will sew together a grand banner that meets the requirements of a foreign tourist. I had one eight-foot-long banner made to welcome the birth of a niece in Northern California: Vietnam Welcomes Birth of Glorious Child! The price was about $5, and it took only a day to make.
We headed a few blocks south, turning right on Hai Ba Trung Street, where we encountered the grim Hoa Lo Prison. It is perhaps the only structure in Hanoi that large numbers of Americans know, if only by the nickname given it by American prisoners of war: the Hanoi Hilton. Many Americans were imprisoned, and tortured, at Hoa Lo during the Vietnam war.
The prison, which for obvious reasons is not included in tours organized by the government tourist agency, was built in the earlier part of the century by the French and is still used as a prison.
There are only a few windows in the blocklong building, and they are covered by rusting metal grills. Across the top of the 20-foot walls are both electrified barbed wire and shards of glass.
As I reached for my camera, Mr. Van whispered anxiously, "No pictures, no pictures." There was indeed an unsmiling, armed soldier watching my every move from across the street. The prison may soon be no more. The land is now so valuable that Singaporean developers are planning to pull it down to make way for an office complex.
We pedaled on toward Dienbienphu Street, named in honor of the momentous 1954 battle that ended a century of French rule.
Dienbienphu Street is a fitting address for the Army Museum celebrating Vietnam's military victories over the French, the Americans and, most recently, the Chinese, who were driven out of northern border areas of Vietnam after a 1979 invasion.
The museum was in the headlines in the United States last year after the announcement that Vietnam had turned over thousands of artifacts, including photographs, from the museum archives that could be useful in determining the fate of more than 2,000 American troops still missing from the war.
When Mr. Van and I stopped at the museum, a team of American investigators from the Defense Department could be seen on the patio on the second floor, photographing artifacts including pilot helmets and flight suits.
Many Americans, especially veterans, find the museum jarring, especially with its unsubtle outdoor display of a Soviet-built MIG-21 jet fighter perched over the charred debris of a downed American B-52 bomber. Across from the museum is Chi Long Park, which serves as a stark reminder that, while the economy of Vietnam is undergoing something of a revolution, the political system is not. Vietnam is one of the last of the satellites of the former Soviet Union to hold on tight to the trappings of Communism, and Chi Long Park is dedicated to the memory of Lenin. There is an enormous, heroic statue of the Russian leader set in well-tended gardens.
I was eager to go down the road toward the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, but pulled over to the sidewalk when I heard a distinctive hiss. I turned to look. My rear tire was flat -- my brand-new rear tire.
"Your bike, no problem," Mr. Van said, pointing a block away to a group of young men sitting on the street corner with bicycle pumps and small plastic buckets. Bicycle mechanics are found on most large street corners in Hanoi.
A small bidding war erupted among the mechanics for the chance to fix my tire. The winner was a smiling fellow who had bid 10,000 dong, or about $1.
As he worked away I watched the stream of bikes down Dienbienphu Street, wide and lined with shade trees.
The women bicyclists are an enchanting sight not only for their grace, but for their determined efforts to prevent their skin from having a moment's contact with the sun. It is serious business, for fair skin is much prized among Vietnamese women, who consider a tan evidence of field work. Many pull their bikes off the road every few blocks to readjust their conical bamboo hats.
My bike repaired, we set off on the final few blocks to the resting place of Ho Chi Minh, the imposing, gray-marble mausoleum set in the center of a complex of museums and other monuments.
WHATEVER his eventual place in history, Ho Chi Minh will be remembered as the Vietnamese leader who faced down two Western nations -- the United States and France -- in a dream of uniting his country. He never married and lived a modest life in a small house near the opulent colonial-era Presidential Palace, in which he refused to live.
His house, made of dark hardwood and supposedly preserved by Vietnamese curators just as Ho left it, is a short walk from the mausoleum and borders a pond in which he raised carp.
Mr. Van and I parked our bikes beneath banyan and frangipani trees outside the One Pillar Pagoda. The miniature pagoda was rebuilt in the mid- 1950's after the original, dating from the 11th century, was burned by vengeful French soldiers as they retreated.
Ho's mausoleum is, it would seem, exactly what he did not want. In his handwritten will, which is available in English translation at bookshops throughout Hanoi, Ho asked that his body be cremated, and the ashes divided between three sites, in north, south and central Vietnam. He asked that at each site there be a simple wooden memorial with plenty of shade for visitors.
Instead, after his death in 1969, Ho's successors in the Communist Party released a falsified version of his will and built him the hulking stone memorial. They did not cremate his body but instead put it on display, Lenin-like, under glass in a refrigerated chamber. (Once a year, Ho's embalmed corpse is shipped to Moscow for maintenance by the same technicians who tend to Lenin's body.)
Mr. Van stopped suddenly, remembering where he was. "I hope you can forgive me," he said. "I must leave because the police will watch you very carefully here," motioning to the many guard stations around the memorial, which is as heavily fortified as any place in the city. "Maybe I will go home now."
I thanked Mr. Van, and we parted with a promise that he would serve as my guide on my next visit to Hanoi. As I turned down Hung Vuong Street, I was met by one of the blank-faced honor guards who accompany all visitors in the final 100 yards or so toward the mausoleum.
The guard walked slowly alongside me until we reached the entrance, and he pointed me toward a long red carpet leading inside. Over the entrance was a sign bearing Ho's most famous slogan: "Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom."
Up a separate staircase within the structure, I found myself in a cavernous room bathed in a ghostly, pinkish light. At the center of the room, beneath a Vietnamese flag, was the glass sarcophagus bearing Ho's frail body. Ho's wispy white beard had been carefully groomed and set on a stiff gray shirt. His hands had a waxy sheen and were crossed over his chest.
In each corner of the room was a guard in a chocolate-colored uniform, apparently to insure that guests walk single file past the body and not linger. I stopped for a moment, and a guard approached me and nudged my elbow, indicating I should move on.
With the knowledge that Ho did not want to be remembered with this sort of bleak, even ghoulish monument, I found myself unmoved by the sight of his corpse.
The reaction of Vietnamese visitors was different, and I was met outside the mausoleum by several old men and women who appeared by their dark-colored, modest clothing to be from the countryside. They had just come from inside the mausoleum and all brushed tears from their eyes. Looking me up and down, they seemed perplexed that a visitor to the city of Ho Chi Minh could be so little affected by the sight of his earthly remains.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Hong Kong Is Booking Now For June 30, 1997

BYLINE: By Barbara Basler

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Hong Kong is the most popular travel destination in Asia, drawing more international visitors than China or Japan and eclipsing such exotic spots as Bangkok. Last year the territory counted seven million visitor arrivals -- a remarkable increase of one million over the year before. And the Hong Kong Tourist Association, a Government-financed body, estimates the number of visitor arrivals will increase 6 to 9 percent this year.
This growth comes at a time when the future of the British colony has never been more precarious. In 1997 Britain will return the freewheeling territory to China, which has one of the most repressive regimes in the world. While China has promised to leave life here relatively untouched, no one can be certain how the territory will fare. 
 But several years ago, with a flair and resourcefulness that is typical of the colony, hotels here began taking reservations for June 30, 1997, the eve of the handover of Hong Kong. Hotel managers estimate that more than 1,000 rooms have already been booked for that historic night.
The travel industry appears optimistic about life after 1997. The number of hotel rooms in Hong Kong has been increasing (from 17,000 in 1988 to 33,000 today), older hotels are renovating and expanding, and money has been budgeted to more than double the size of the glittering convention center.
But there are troubling signs. Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport will reach maximum capacity in the next few years. And China, angered at the colony's push to expand democracy here before the handover, has refused to approve plans for a huge new airport complex to be completed after 1997.
"No one doubts the airport will eventually be built," said one hotel manager. "It's in China's interests. But the delay could hurt us."
Meanwhile the travel industry here has continued to flourish despite recessions in the United States, Europe and Japan, because a booming regional economy has given many Asians more money for travel, and travel restrictions in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea have eased recently, according to a spokeswoman for the tourist association.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Sonny Mae Mortgages;
New Rate Is 5.75%, The Lowest Ever

 BODY:
The steady drop in mortgage interest rates over the last several years has been a boon to The State of New York Mortgage Agency, which through subsidized mortgages has paved the way to home ownership for more than 49,000 moderate-income families throughout the state.
Now the agency, also known as Sonny Mae, is offering the lowest interest rate ever, 5.75 percent for its Low Interest Rate mortgage program. The previous rate was 6.50 percent. 
 In general, the state-sponsored mortgages are for first-time home buyers. But the requirement can be waived for purchases in target areas, those designated for revitalization. Loans are available for one- to four-family houses as well as co-ops and condominiums. Borrowers have the option of 20-, 25- or 30-year terms. The minimum down payment can be as low as 5 percent for qualifying borrowers.
No points are charged for home loans made on existing properties but there is a charge of 0.50 percent for mortgages on newly constructed residences.
Income and purchase price limits vary according to the location of the home. In New York City, for example, the limit on the purchase price on existing two-family homes is $201,800 in target areas and $165,100 in nontarget areas. Likewise, the income limit for borrowers of properties in nontarget areas of New York City is $47,720 for households of three or more persons.
The loans are available through 75 participating lenders. For more information call the agency mortgage line at (800) 382-HOME.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
A Busy Week for Benefit Concerts

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
BENEFIT concerts seem to be an increasingly popular method of fund-raising, perhaps because the donors know that they are not only contributing to a worthy cause but also receiving musical dividends in the bargain. At least five such events are on the calendar this week, two of them this afternoon at 3.
The Westport School of Music is holding its 34th annual scholarship benefit at that hour in Pequot Library in Southport, with the pianist and teacher David Korevaar playing works of Bach, Beethoven, Liszt and Chopin. "We really need a successful event this year," said the director of the school, Martha Hisey. "The economy has affected so many of our families that we have allocated more scholarships than ever before." 
 "In keeping with our tradition of saluting noted people in the arts," added Ms. Hisey, "we are delighted to say that the noted composer John Corigliano will be our honored guest. His family used to have a home here in Westport, and John spent many summers in town in his younger days." The number to call for reservations is 227-4931.
The Connecticut branch of the Tibetan United States Resettlement Project is the beneficiary of a 3 P.M. program today at the Merryall Center for the Arts in New Milford. Four New York City singers, directed and accompanied by a pianist on the Yale faculty, Brian Suits, will offer arias and ensembles by Verdi, Rossini, Mozart, Puccini and Gounod, and an abridged version of Bizet's "Carmen."
Merryall's president and program chairman, Jim Brown, described the effort as important. "Any money raised will help an individual from a ravaged country make a new beginning here in Connecticut," he said. "We are most pleased to extend our assistance, and at the same time offer a great concert with these fine musicians." For tickets, call Mr. Brown at 792-4849 or Amanda Quaintance, benefit coordinator, at 261-0247.
Friday evening at 8, Woolsey Hall at Yale resounds to "A Battle of the Bands," but the winner will be the Hillhouse High School music program, which intends to use the profits to purchase band instruments and uniforms. The battling bands are, however, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, under the direction of Hillhouse alumnus Buddy Morrow, and the Willie Ruff Orchestra, using original charts from the Benny Goodman archives at Yale. Each group will also field a vocalist, Mr. Ruff introducing M. B. Singley, a Yale junior who was a hit last October in the Duke Ellington fellowship concert. Mr. Morrow brings Bridgeport native Walt Andrus, whose credits include a stint with the Pied Pipers (432-4158).
Opera New England of Northeastern Connecticut is looking forward to an ambitious educational program next fall that will bring a free production of Rossini's "Barber of Seville" to some 3,600 area children; to help pay for it, a spring musical event has been set for 7 P.M. Saturday in the Pomfret School, a recital by the bass-baritone James Rensink that promises "a combination of serious music, Broadway tunes and funny songs" (928-2946 or 429-5813).
For the past three years, the Hartford Camerata Conservatory has been holding a benefit cabaret to swell the coffers of its scholarship fund, and the fourth annual one starts at 8:15 P.M. on Saturday at the West Hartford Town Hall. "I'll Be Seeing You" is the theme of the evening, the music hailing from the World War II era, and audience members are encouraged to wear clothing of the period -- military attire, snoods, sweaters and bow ties, etc.
The conservatory's dean, Peter Harvey, will be one of the featured artists, along with the Faculty Jazz Ensemble and several other singers, instrumentalists and artists adding their talents to the evening in some unusual comic roles. Last year's cabaret was a sellout, so call 246-2588 to make sure reservations are still available.
Two events today at 3 P.M. include Wesleyan professor Neely Bruce turning away from the Americana that normally occupies much of his on-stage time to give a harpsichord performance of Book I of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier" in the World Music Hall (344-7444), and the Armstrong Chamber Concerts continuing at First Congregational Church-on-the-Green in Washington. There will be more Bach -- the Trio Sonata in F -- and Mozart, Martinu and Bartok, played by Helen Armstrong, David Krakauer, Masao Kawasaki and Kazuko Hayami (868-0522).
A pair of 10th anniversary seasons conclude an hour later, the Camerata Ensemble offering Beethoven and Dohnanyi Trios, along with Schubert's "Trout" Quintet, at the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford (233-0288); while the Filharmonia Quartet, its members drawn from the moonlighting ranks of the New York Philharmonic, has invited the Juilliard professor Martin Canin to join them for Beethoven's Op. 16 Piano Quartet and Franck's Piano Quintet. The concert will be at St. John's Episcopal Church in Salisbury (435-0439).
Also at 4 P.M., the Connecticut Chamber Choir is tendering "A Serenade to Spring" in the First Congregational Church of Stratford, with Richard Erickson conducting Mozart's "Missa Brevis," the "Wedding Cantata" of Daniel Pinkham and John Rutter's "Te Deum" along with a raft of shorter works (438-7928, evenings).
The Russian-American pianist Bella Davidovich makes it an international evening, playing the Grieg Concerto in the course of the touring Danish National Radio Symphony's 8 P.M. Thursday visit to Jorgensen Auditorium in Storrs (486-4226). Jazz is also an option at that hour, when the Preservation Hall Band will raise the roof at the Stamford Palace (325-4466), or Puccini, since "La Boheme" is Connecticut Opera's spring offering at the Bushnell, with 8 P.M. performances scheduled Friday and Saturday as well (527-0713). Another couple of evenings with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band will be offered Friday and Saturday at the Jorgensen.
Finally, 8 P.M. Saturday options include a concert at the Westport Arts Center by the Manhattan Chamber Sinfonia, with David Gilbert conducting Mozart's "Posthorn Serenade" and, with the double assistance of the violinist Mayuki Fukuhara and the pianist Jeffrey Jamner, the rarely encountered Mendelssohn Double Concerto (661-4667). At the same time, Tibor Pusztai leads a Hartford Symphony program at Trinity Episcopal Church titled "I Hear American Singing" with the orchestra joined by Trinity's own chorus and the Hartt Children's Choir (246-8742). Other options are the finale of Orchestra New England's season in Battell Chapel at Yale with James Sinclair conducting Mozart's Serenade in B-Flat and a dramatized edition of Stravinsky's "Histoire du Soldat" (934-8863), and a "South of the Border" program in Crowell Hall at Wesleyan that brings together the university's orchestra under Melvin Strauss, and that of Connecticut College, directed by Peter Sacco, for music by Villa-Lobos, Chavez and other Latin American composers (344-7944).

HEADLINE: On the Road With Cary Edwards

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AT 9 P.M. last Sunday, after a day spent attacking the policies of Gov. Jim Florio, the man he would like to displace, Cary Edwards stood before a group of 60 Republicans in New Providence and fielded a question from a local resident.
"Why are you the best Republican candidate to run against Florio in November?" Robert Dougherty asked. 
 At campaign stops in seven towns in six counties, Mr. Edwards had made scarcely a reference to his four rivals in the June 8 primary, including his most formidable opponent, Christine Todd Whitman. Ms. Whitman has followed a similar strategy.
"If they're all going to be nice to each other and not point out the differences between them," Mr. Dougherty said later, "how can we make an intelligent choice?"
At the meeting, Mr. Edwards spoke of his extensive experience in state government as making him more qualified to govern than his Republican opponents. "We're talking about running a $15 billion, 65,000 employee service business," Mr. Edwards said. "That's not a job for amateurs. I understand this system and I know the buttons that have to be pushed."
He told his listeners that "the best way to demonstrate my ability to beat Christie Whitman is to demonstrate my ability to beat Jim Florio."
In fact, he is fighting an uphill battle against Ms. Whitman, who came within a breath of defeating Senator Bill Bradley in November of 1990 and has remained in the public eye ever since.
"Christie Whitman has been at this for two and a half years," Mr. Edwards said later. "If I had been working at this for two and a half years, there wouldn't even be a primary."
The campaign day began for Mr. Edwards at 9:30 A.M. in the kitchen of his Oakland home as he finished the first of many cups of coffee he would consume over the next 14 hours. Outside, his white campaign van, equipped with two telephones, a fax machine and a television set, was waiting in the driveway. His wife, Lynn, had already left so she could be on hand to help organize the first campaign stop: a meeting of volunteers at the Bergen County Republican headquarters in Hackensack.
Seven Republican county organizations have endorsed Mr. Edwards, he said, while nine have endorsed Ms. Whitman; the remaining five are uncommitted.
"Make a left at the next corner," Mr. Edwards told the driver of the van, Bill Labonak, a retired state trooper. Until that moment, it had seemed that Mr. Edwards was so deep in conversation he could have no idea where the van was headed.
Riding with the candidate were Doug Doyle, a former New York City Legal Aid lawyer who is now a full-time campaign aide, and Robert B. Thompson, a former reporter who is the campaign press secretary.
At 10:35 Mr. Edwards entered the back door of the Hackensack campaign headquarters. His wife, who was in the front of the room, rushed to greet him and then rushed back to the people she had been talking to. A slim woman with a broad smile and seemingly endless energy, Mrs. Edwards is widely seen as one of her husband's major political assets.
"She's a great campaigner," said Jane Burgio, who was Secretary of State under Gov. Thomas H. Kean and is now a leader in the Edwards campaign. "Just watch her work the room."
Mr. Edwards's first speech of the day was a short one, delivered without benefit of notes or a microphone. The tall, silver-haired lawyer is an engaging speaker who seems totally at ease at the podium, his deep voice rising and falling, his gestures smooth and forceful.
In Hackensack, he roused cheers from about 70 volunteers who were given a quick course in grass-roots campaigning. He emphasized the importance of educating Bergen County voters about the issues and striving to bring more volunteers into the campaign. "In Bergen County, we know more about what Mayor Dinkins is doing in New York than what is going on in Trenton," he said.
 
'He Inspires Me'
 Antoinette Cassavitis, a 29-year-old single mother from Hackensack, later explained why she had joined the Edwards campaign.
"He inspires me," Ms. Cassavitis said. "He knows what our problems are. He knows what it's like to be stuck in traffic on Route 17 and to be afraid of parking your car at a mall. And he knows how hard it can be to be a single mother because he was raised by one."
Political experts have been saying that one of Ms. Whitman's advantages is that women may be more likely to vote for her than a male candidate. And one of the major campaign strategies of Mr. Edwards's campaign is to portray him as a man who appreciates the role women play in raising families.
"It was kind of like 'me and my mother against the world,' " Mr. Edwards said, settling back in the bucket seat behind the driver in the seven-passenger van. It was 11:07, the next campaign stop was scheduled for noon in East Hanover and once again Mr. Edwards interrupted himself to give Mr. Labonak instructions. "Take Hudson Street to Route 80," he said.
W. Cary Edwards, 48, was born in Ridgewood and grew up in Bergen County. When he was 11 years old, his parents separated, and he moved with his mother, Virginia, and a brother and a sister to East Paterson.
"I did odd jobs," he said about his teen-age years. "I was a baby sitter, believe it or not."
After working his way through high school and Seton Hall University and its law school, he was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1970 -- and married Lynn Cozzolino the same year. The couple, who have two daughters, moved to Oakland in 1974, and Mr. Edwards was elected councilman there in 1975.
Two years later he was elected to the State Assembly, and in 1982 he became chief counsel to the newly elected Governor Kean, who had been his mentor in the Assembly. He became the state's Attorney General four years later.
 
'An Offer I Couldn't Refuse'
 "He made me an offer I couldn't refuse," Mr. Edwards said, adding that the job of Attorney General, though technically a "step down from a staff position to a line position," was the perfect position from which he could do battle with one of his major social concerns. "My faith was shaken in the ability of government to deliver any serious solutions to the crime problem," he said.
Today, Mr. Edwards's campaign makes much of his record as an Attorney General who was "tough on crime." The candidate said: "If we're going to have tough criminal laws, we better be ready to enforce them. If we're going to need more jail cells, we better be ready to build them."
At 11:58 the campaign van pulled up in front of the Hanover Manor in East Hanover, where the Livingston Republican organization was sponsoring a brunch. Soon Mr. Edwards was moving from table to table, chatting and joking with guests. He appeared comfortable and relaxed, shaking hands with the men, kissing some of the women on the cheek, giving a light touch on the shoulder to people seated at tables.
"You better get on line," he told a group of people waiting to talk to him. "You don't eat if you don't get on line."
After a brief speech criticizing Mr. Florio's record and outlining the problems that the winner of the November election will face, Mr. Edwards and his aides were back in the van at 12:37.
Mr. Edwards talked about his style of campaigning. Conventional political wisdom, he said, always held that "if you've got holes in your shoes, don't put your feet up on the desk." But in today's political campaigns, he said, it is difficult, if not impossible, to fool the public.
"I've always believed that if I let everybody know everything about me -- the good, the bad, and the ugly -- then I would be fine," he said. "I've always tried to be open and honest."
One example, he said, was his voluntary disclosure that he had employed an illegal alien in his household. "No reporter dug that out," Mr. Edwards said. "I released it on my own. I voluntarily came forward because of the Zoe Baird matter." Ms. Whitman also acknowledged that she had employed an illegal alien; her announcement, on the same day as his, was made first.
The campaign van's next stop was at the Coach and Paddock Restaurant in Hampton Township, where the Hunterdon County Republican organization was meeting.
"O.K., fill me in, guys," Mr. Edwards said as the van approached the entrance.
Mr. Doyle read from a stack of green index cards that held the day's itinerary.
"It's a fund raiser; Christie was here and Wallwork was here, so you're the last to speak," he said, referring to Ms. Whitman and to James H. Wallwork, a former State Assemblyman who is also running for the nomination. The other Republican candidates are J. Patrick Gilligan, a Morristown businessman, and Charles P. Hoffman of Brick.
Thirty minutes after his arrival, Mr. Edwards was on the road again, headed for Basking Ridge, where the former supporters of Ross Perot had gathered in a suburban living room. About two weeks before, the group had formally endorsed Mr. Edwards.
During this session, and another later in Holmdel, Mr. Edwards offered a more detailed description of his campaign platform. It includes the appointment of more judges who believe in the death penalty, mandatory sentences for possession of guns in or near schools and mandatory sentences for violent crimes against the elderly.
He said his plan for stimulating the state's economy included tax reductions for individuals and businesses, investment tax credits and research and development credits for new and expanding businesses. He also favors the end of the "double taxation" that the state's "Subchapter S" corporations now face.
The money to make such tax reductions possible, he said, would come from the $500 million spending cut that Republican leaders in the Legislature have promised for next year's budget.
At 10:30 P.M. the campaign van pulled into the parking lot of a diner in Wayne for the campaigners' first and only meal of the day. Removing their jackets, Mr. Edwards and his aides engaged in comfortable, friendly banter.
"The yuppie wants cheese on his onion rings," he said of the 27-year-old Mr. Doyle when the waitress took the order.
An hour later, the white van parked in the driveway of Mr. Edwards's sprawling split-level home in Oakland. A splash of reflected light illuminated his tired, craggy face. Then Mr. Labonak turned off the lights and the ignition, and for a few moments the occupants of the van sat in silence.
"Thanks," Mr. Edwards said to no one in particular, "it was a good day."

HEADLINE: War Over Cigarette Machines

BYLINE: By STEVEN HART

 BODY:
EACH of New Jersey's 11,000 cigarette vending machines carries a warning, reflecting a state law passed six years ago that bans the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18. But public officials and anti-smoking groups say many under-age residents are using the vending machines, and a number of towns have moved to ban or control them.
The issue, which has been fought out in town councils and courts, is now before the Appellate Division of State Superior Court. Whichever way the court decides, it is certain to have a major effect on the approach towns take to the machines. 
 The case before the court concerns East Brunswick, which in 1990 passed an ordinance banning cigarette vending machines. Some of the 60 New Jersey companies in the industry sued to overturn the ordinance and won in Superior Court last year.
The township has appealed that decision. Oral arguments will be heard on June 1.
 
Other Suits Withdrawn
 Two other communities -- Mount Olive Township and Bernards Township -- jumped into the fray, passing ordinances that would control rather than ban the machines. They, too, were sued by the cigarette machine vendors, but in the wake of East Brunswick's court defeat, the suits were withdrawn and the ordinances stand.
Princeton has used the Bernards ordinance as a blueprint for a measure of its own, which was unanimously approved on Monday by the Princeton Regional Health Commission. The commission administers the Princeton Regional Health Department, which covers Princeton Borough and Princeton Township.
The Bernards solution, some town officials say, seems to offer a middle path satisfactory both to municipalities seeking to answer a public-health concern and an industry ready to fight it out in court. But that could change with the appeals court ruling on the East Brunswick ordinance.
"Many other towns are watching to see what happens with the case," said Irv Green, president of the C.I.C. Corporation of Springfield, one of the vendors that filed the lawsuits. Should East Brunswick win, Mr. Green said, the vendors would continue to challenge the town's ordinance in court.
"I think it's important to agree with the concept that minors shouldn't have access to cigarettes," Mr. Green said. "But it doesn't seem to me they should obliterate an entire industry to do so."
The Bernards Township ordinance, which took effect in 1991, restricts the machines to businesses not open to unsupervised children and young teen-agers -- bars and taverns, restaurants, factories and private companies -- and requires that the machines be placed "under the direct visual supervision" of employees.
The Mount Olive ordinance, enacted in 1990, similarly specifies that the machines be in plain view to keep minors from surreptitiously buying cigarettes. It also requires any business with a vending machine to appoint an attendant to insure that no illegal purchases take place.
After the passage of the state law, the Bernards Township Health Department decided to gauge its effectiveness, said Dan Jordan, the health officer. The department deputized a 13-year-old girl to visit a number of business where cigarettes were sold. Even though she "looked really young," Mr. Jordan said, the girl was able to get cigarettes "at about 70 to 75 percent of the places." Of that number, he added, roughly 15 percent of the sales were from vending machines.
After the businesses visited were alerted to the result of the survey, and groups of concerned parents visited some of the locations, the Health Department sent out a pair of 14-year-olds who "really did look like kids," Mr. Jordan said.
They were able to buy cigarettes at about 60 percent of the businesses, he said, and the Board of Health decided to combine educational efforts with a law covering cigarette vending machines.
The Bernards ordinance took effect in April 1991 and was soon challenged by a group of vending machine companies: Coast Cigarette Sales of Asbury Park; the C.I.C. Corporation; the Eskin Vending Company of East Brunswick, which is now owned by C.I.C., and the Amusement and Music Operators Association, a national trade organization that has 60 members in New Jersey. The group contended that Bernards had usurped the powers of the state.
"We disagree completely with the idea that vending machines are a significant source of sales to minors," said Keith Biebelberg, the Springfield lawyer representing the vendors.
In this he was seconded by William Treger, president of the Amusement and Music Operators Association, and a sales representative for H. Betti Industries, a Carlstadt-based distributor of coin-operated machines.
"Only 3 percent of all cigarette sales in the country are done by vending machines," Mr. Treger said. "It's really blown out of proportion. If you've got kids working at 7-Elevens and convenience stores, you know they're going to be selling to their friends. That's the kind of thing that needs to be cracked down on."
 
East Brunswick Actions
 Jack Sinagra was Mayor of East Brunswick in 1990 when he saw a young man he said was "obviously" under-age buying cigarettes from a vending machine. Mr. Sinagra went to the Township Council with a proposed ordinance banning all vending machines within the township's borders, and it took effect in January 1991.
Mr. Sinagra, now a State Senator, said he had sponsored bills in the Legislature to stop smoking in day-care centers, to forbid cigarette advertising on public lands and to prevent advertising in the vicinity of public schools.
"I'm not someone who tries to keep adults from doing what they want to do," Mr. Sinagra said. "I'm trying to keep kids from killing themselves."
Steve Rattner, a Mount Olive Councilman, was chairman of the township's Board of Health when its cigarette vending machine ordinance was introduced. "We didn't have a major problem, but we did have a lot of businesses that had cigarette machines," Mr. Rattner said. "There was nobody keeping an eye on what was going on. It was the physicians that were really pushing to do what we could to control smoking."
The township had about 25 cigarette vending machines within its borders when it decided to restrict the placement of the devices and require businesses to make someone responsible for their proper use.
Both the Bernards Township and Mount Olive ordinances were attacked in court by the vendors, but their real target was the East Brunswick ordinance. Their complaint was being heard by a Superior Court judge.
The judge had delayed a decision pending the outcome of a state bill, proposed in the summer of 1991, that would restrict vending machines to locations inaccessible to minors. In other locations, under the bill, the machines could be used only after an employee had determined that the purchaser was at least 18.
The bill passed both houses of the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Jim Florio on the ground, Mr. Biebelberg, the vendors' lawyer said, that it would prevent municipalities from enacting their own, more restrictive, ordinances.
Shortly after East Brunswick's ordinance was voided, the vendor challenges to Mount Olive and Bernards Township were withdrawn.
"Frankly, we didn't really mind certain restraints," Mr. Biebelberg said. "East Brunswick is looking to use a bazooka when all it really needed was a small weapon that we were willing to give them. What we were willing to do was go along with a restraint."
Why, then, did the vendors sue Bernards Township and Mount Olive in the first place?
"We knew other municipalities were watching, and we wanted to send a message," Mr. Biebelberg said. "We felt that the whole subject matter was pre-empted by state regulation, and we wanted to show that we were willing to back up our beliefs in court. After the East Brunswick decision, we mollified our position somewhat, and we felt there was no more to be gained by continuing this litigation. Also, there was an economic consideration. Lawsuits are expensive, you know."
The withdrawal of the vendors' suit was welcomed by Mr. Rattner, the Mount Olive Councilman. "At the time of the lawsuit, it was scary," he said. "The municipal budget of Mount Olive couldn't have afforded a prolonged fight."
 
Princeton Copies Bernards
 For that reason, the Princeton Regional Health Commission, which was on the verge of adopting an East Brunswick-style ban in February, pulled back and decided to go with a restrictive measure along the lines of Bernards Township's ordinance. The Princeton ordinance takes effect on May 12.
"We've duplicated the ordinance, basically, and changed the name Bernards to Princeton," said William Hinshillwood, health officer for the Princeton Regional Health Department.
The same goes for Mount Olive, Mr. Rattner said.
"We've done research on East Brunswick's ordinance," he said. "We are watching what happens with the appeal."
 
Anti-Smoking Group's View

So is the Group Against Smoking Pollution (GASP), a Summit-based anti-smoking organization that filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of East Brunswick.
Regina Carlson, executive director of the group, said the Bernards Township ordinance was "an appropriate strategy for a township to pursue while the appeal is pending." She made it clear that her organization, which encourages communities to take on the cigarette industry by disseminating information on the health hazards of smoking, preferred East Brunswick's sterner approach.
"It makes the most sense," Ms. Carlson said. "We wouldn't tolerate having vending machines for beer or alcoholic beverages. This is the same kind of health issue."
Ms. Carlson said the vending industry's own studies showed that while older teen-agers were more likely to buy cigarettes over the counter, younger teen-agers "used vending machines to a greater extent."
James Feinberg, of Manny's Cigarette Service, a distributor and a member of the Amusement and Music Operators Association, said his industry was being unfairly attacked by politicians with the encouragement of groups like GASP.
"I think the rationale for these ordinances is that it's politically correct right now," Mr. Feinberg said. "Politicians can get a lot of coverage by doing this."
Since the vendors abandoned their lawsuit against Bernards Township, Mr. Jordan said, the township's Health Department has used undercover teen-agers in two more surveys of local merchants, the last about a month ago.
Though the number of businesses selling cigarettes has grown to 35, the teen-agers were able to buy cigarettes at only four businesses. Summonses and fines resulted, Mr. Jordan said, and the Somerset Hills Health Department -- which includes Bernards Township in its administration area -- plans to enact vending machine ordinances in Bedminster, Bernardsville, Mendham, Peapack- Gladstone, Chester and Far Hills.

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Michael Norman

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR

 BODY:
WE are a textbook town: we have a bottom, a middle, a top. Many of the people at the top, those who possess enough money and property to be called "rich," live, literally, above the rest of us -- on the side of a small mountain that forms Montclair's western border.
The homes on the mountain cost millions. They have sweeping front lawns and carriage houses, stone balustrades and cobblestone drives. Some of the town's oldest families live up there -- bankers and doctors and lawyers -- and some of the town's newest, too: actors, producers and entrepreneurs. 
 I live in a sage green box on a side street a short walk from a supermarket. I do not have gold-leaf trim and walls of trompe l'oeil, but I think I know something of the people who do. We may be separated by a fortune or two, but in our sense of place we think alike.
Here, leagues away from the tough precincts of the big city, life seems somehow safer and more salubrious. In the spring our asylum is a place of pink dogwoods and ovals of green. We are close with nature here. We put down roots.
A man should know his neighbors, on both sides of the tracks, so a week or so ago on a warm night I found myself on the mountain, passing between stone pillars, then up a long drive to an English manor, an elegant home of mortar and stone and peaked arches, 29 rooms ("more or less," as the owner put it) on some two acres, with a tennis court on the side and a swimming pool in back.
The great room of the manor has oak beams and architectural paneling; in the middle of the room on a palace Tabriz rug sits a huge tufted tuxedo couch covered in Jacquard silk. In the right wing is a library, an Elizabethan reading room with a balcony. In the left wing is the dining room and beyond that a petite salle a manger for breakfast.
The basement holds a wine vault, a room with racks of concrete sleeves, and a table in the middle for tastings or dinners. Nearby is a game room with a pool table, a jukebox and a pinball machine. Upstairs are bedrooms, offices and a gym with a mirrored wall.
The three full-time servants -- a husband and wife housekeeping team and a nanny -- have a private suite larger than most Manhattan apartments.
Throughout the house, the walls are hung with millions of dollars in art -- Picasso, Pissarro, Raphael Soyer, Gorky, Guy Wiggins, Reginald Marsh. There is a work by Rodin so famous it is mentioned in most encyclopedias.
The effect of all this -- the scale of the house, the style and charm of the trappings, the great beauty of the art -- sometimes isolates the family (the man, woman and two children, who for reasons of safety prefer to remain anonymous) that lives here.
"It sometimes gets to the point," the woman said, "where I hate having people up. As soon as they get a load of this place, all of a sudden our jokes are funnier, and everything we say is taken as more intelligent than it really is."
She is sharp-tongued, ebullient, full of fire; he is polite and affable, with soft eyes and a diffident smile.
By many measures, we are neighbors. We shop at Kings supermarket and buy our Easter treats at Mary's candy store. We complain about outrageous property taxes -- more than $30,000 for them -- and the new traffic light on Valley Road that seems designed to snarl traffic.
We are equally disillusioned by the public schools and send our children to a private academy. We like the pasta in Rispoli's, the internecine bickering over the Iris Gardens, the way the big clock by the bank looks down on Valley Road.
The couple came to town six years ago from Manhattan. They wanted a place to raise children; they wanted a place to settle down. They looked for texture and rough edges, not a pampered enclave for the rich.
"We didn't want to live in East Egg or West Egg drinking martinis," she said. "That's not us. I like to pick up the sticks in the yard." Now they have the same profound sense of belonging as the rest of us.
None of this is to say that they are just folks. The Governor comes for dinner; the State Attorney General drops by for a few sets of tennis. And yet there's something familiar on the hill. The pattern of life in the manor house and the unseen forces that have shaped it are not that different from the tangled dynamics that drive the lives in the valley below.
The man of the manor is the second of four sons of immigrant parents who were confined in a labor camp by the Nazis during World War II. After the war, the family drifted for a while, landing finally in a large city in the Midwest.
The father worked on a road gang at first, then in a battery factory, then began a modest business. This odyssey of survival and success became a kind of parable, a legacy left to instruct his son.
"I understood early that American society was based on business and wealth and your ability to make money," the son said. So after a degree in engineering, he went to a well-known business school, then worked for an investment firm on Wall Street. But a job yields only a paycheck, and he "wanted to become the center of society, a player, a doer."
He took the lessons of his youth, his ambition, $10,000 in savings and a lot of borrowed capital and bought a mechanical parts company. He worked a hundred hours a week, every week of the year, turned enough profit to buy another company, then another and another until he was able to come to our town and spend a million dollars to put his family in a house on the hill.
On the night of my visit, he was at a turning point. We were sitting in the great room at a Charles X table, nursing drinks in crystal glasses and arguing the ontology of wealth.
He's through with leveraged buyouts and corporate resuscitations. "It isn't fun anymore," he said. "As you get older, you get interested in other things -- the life of the mind and the spirit."
He thinks the fortune he created has made him its victim. "If you set out to get it as I did, then you become a captive of the ideology that created it. Your entire happiness depends on the score." Which, in part, is why he collects painting and sculpture. "All day you're an economic animal. One of the things that humanizes you is art."
Perhaps, like the men his age in the valley, he has simply reached the point in life when one either steps aside or is carried away in the flow. He's gone from poverty to wealth, from bedrock Republicanism to Democratic activism, from guarding the status quo to calling for change. He can afford another turn now. "When you don't have to worry about taking care of your stomach," he said, anything is possible.
Besides, he has luck, and luck is everything. "I have many people working for me who have great talent, energy and imagination. The difference between me and them is pretty much luck. I have a friend who was the president of a major bank. He just got fired. Last year he was making a million dollars. Now he's making zero. Luck."
Maybe something more, too. His car is a late model sedan, the kind favored by factory workers and bus drivers and postal employees. The car is a kind of homily.
One day a long time ago, the immigrant turned battery mechanic took his son with him to his place of work. On the way inside they passed a new Cadillac at the curb. The car caught the boy's fancy, and later in the day, he carefully approached his father and asked, "Why don't you own a car like that?"
The old man suddenly turned dark, grabbed the boy by the ear and dragged him to a window. A strike was under way, and the street was lined with pickets. Some of their cars were on either side of the Cadillac. "Which one," said the father, pointing to the line of cars, "which one do you think belongs to the boss?"
The lesson was clear: don't flaunt good fortune; don't advertise success.
"It's dumb," the son says today, to stand beside the have-nots and "stress the difference." So he drives what his wife calls "sardine cans."
He also keeps quietly -- inconspicuously, one might almost say -- to his manor on the hill, thanking his luck and his God for a good marriage and healthy children, for his wealth and his power and his "damn interesting" life. And if he should ever forget his provenance, his father is likely to bring him back.
No one in the family can forget what the old man said the first time he came up the drive and saw the stone manor with the peaked arches, the 29 rooms -- more or less -- and the tennis court, the swimming pool, the artworks, the rare wines, the golden glow of all that money can buy and some of what it can't.
"My stupid son," he said, "you did all right."

HEADLINE: A Woman's Quest for Her 3d World Championship in Karate

BYLINE: By PHILIP GOOD

DATELINE: FORDS

 BODY:
WHEN Debra Bressaw aims a deadly kick at her husband's head, he doesn't seem to mind it at all. For Bill Bressaw, it's all in an evening's work. His days are spent practicing law in Woodbridge, but he's also the owner and operator of Bressaw's Middlesex Karate School here.
As for Ms. Bressaw, she has a black belt and has twice won the world championship in the women's lightweight division of a karate style called shukokai. On Saturday in Coimbra, Portugal, she is scheduled to start another quest for the championship, held every two years. 
 For weeks Ms. Bressaw, 31, has trained six hours a day, at 90-minute classes in the dojo, or school, or pounding a punching bag at the school or in the basement of her home in Edison. She will be competing against women from 13 countries, some of whom operate their own schools.
Beside her bed, as motivation to get her up and practicing each morning, she keeps photographs of her competitors. "I have to train harder because I know there are other people out there training," she said.
 
A Bow to the Teacher
 One recent evening, there were 14 students in the dojo, standing barefoot on a large blue mat and dressed in white uniforms. They bowed to Mr. Bressaw, their sensei, or teacher, and simultaneously sounded a series of "oos," a martial arts greeting.
Their first assignment: to perform the kata, an ancient routine of movements that resembles a dance. Each breath was taken to correspond precisely with a step and extension of the arm. Then they practiced punching, kicking and blocking as well as throwing an opponent.
Ms. Bressaw's partner, Ray Gatarz, who holds a third-degree black belt, blocked one punch but missed a high spin kick. In each case, the blows stop short, doing no damage.
Eventually, the students watch individual sparring matches, with Mr. Bressaw awarding points for successful blows or blocks. And then they kneel in a closing meditation ritual that speaks to the mental aspect of their art.
Shukokai differs from most karate styles, Mr. Bressaw said, "in our quest for knowledge and the fine points." He added: "We have taken the technique to train each muscle in the body. We try to learn which muscles should be relaxed and which should be used on a punch."
The style was introduced in the United States 23 years ago by Shigeru Kimura, who runs a dojo in Tenafly. He is the organizer of the international championships.
"She's going for a third time and that's going to be a record," he said of Ms. Bressaw. "I think she has to overcome the pressure within herself. The enemy is within herself. She's working very hard to get that pressure off to bring her better results."
Ms. Bressaw's road to karate started when she was a student at Douglass College at Rutgers. "I would work in the library till 2 in the morning, and I didn't feel safe walking in the parking lot," she recalled. "When I saw a course in self-defense was being offered, I took it."
She moved on to Middlesex County College in 1981 and signed up for karate, taught by Mr. Bressaw. Eventually, she received a bachelor's degree in economics and married her sensei. They have three children.
 
Black Belt at 30,000 Feet
 Ms. Bressaw won her first championship title in 1989. Flying back from the tournament in Finland, Mr. Kimura presented her with her black belt. She had won the championship while still holding a brown belt. "I always tell people I got my black belt at 30,000 feet," she said.
Skill in karate is indicated by the color of the belt; black is the highest in the color rankings. Further expertise is indicated by degrees, or by stripes in lower-ranking colors. The highest is an eighth-degree black belt, which Mr. Kimura holds.
At the next tournament, in 1991 in Switzerland, Ms. Bressaw successfully defended her title.
Her pregnancies didn't seem to slow her down. With her first child she trained until the eighth month. She received her brown belt in 1987, not knowing at the time that she was pregnant with her third child.
All three children study karate. Christopher, 7, has a green belt; Nicole, 6 1/2, has a yellow, and Alison, 4 1/2, has a white belt with a yellow stripe.
"Sometimes I ask myself, how did I do all this?" Ms. Bressaw said. "I just think it was a real roller-coaster ride. I remember sensei Kimura once said to me, 'If you want to get something done, you give it to a busy person.' "
Ms. Bressaw acknowledges that her husband's skills have helped her competitive career in karate. "I have an advantage because I respect his abilities," she said. "He really brings out the best in me."
Mr. Bressaw sees another championship in his wife's future. "I think she'll do it again because her punch has improved," he said. "Remember in karate it's not so much the muscle but the technique, and Debbie has the technique." She is 5 feet 6 1/2 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds.
He also thinks, he said, that female competitors have "a greater emotional drive" than most of the men.
Ms. Bressaw agrees. "I feel when the females are competing, they have a little more fire in them. I rough it up every day with the guys, and the girls in shukokai are tough."

County Seeks To Sell Offices

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

 BODY:
MONTGOMERY COUNTY is renewing efforts to find a buyer for the Stony Creek Office Center here, a 50,600-square-foot project it took over three years ago because it had guaranteed a loan for its renovation.
The county has been auditioning brokers and property managers since choosing to accept bids from companies that say they can find new ways to cut expenses and lure bidders. It has already rejected two offers as inadequate. 
 The complex was built in the 20's as the home of the Adam Scheidt Brewing Company. Brewing ended in 1974 and the property was idle until a major subsidized rehabilitation in the 80's produced a seven-story glass-block and aluminum office tower.
The tower, the former brewhouse, with 38,600 square feet, is 88 percent rented at about $12 a square foot a year. Other buildings on the 5.5-acre property, 20 minutes by car from downtown Philadelphia, remain as 12,000 square feet of small office or warehouse space.
Led by Montgomery County, the rehabilitation was done with a $2.6 million loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development through the Montgomery County Development Corporation and a $1.2 million Urban Development Action Grant from Norristown Borough. The developer, Windon Capital Management, made a $2.5 million equity investment, which qualified for Federal tax credits because the building is a historic structure.
When Windon defaulted on its loan in 1990 the county took over the property and continued the leasing, hoping to raise rents enough to increase its market value.
The hope in 1986 had been that the renovation would be a catalyst for Norristown's west end, an area of small, underutilized factory and office buildings and private residences. But many of the tenants were county agencies, with existing offices principally in the county courthouse two blocks away or private buildings nearby.
Jerry Birkelbach, the county's director of Economic Development, said income from Stony Creek had been repaying some of the loans, but he would not disclose the amount outstanding. He said the county's search for a new broker was intended to speed up a sale.
It has been suggested that the complex be retained for county offices. The county's day-care center leased 3,200 square feet last summer. Other tenants include Mr. Birkelbach's department, other agencies and a few private companies.
Arthur Weisman, president of Keystone Real Estate, which manages the property, said that the county's asking price for Stony Creek began at $3.9 million last year. Recent offers of about $1.5 million were not seriously discussed, he said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Can Tokyo Shake Off a Soaring Yen?

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
INVESTMENT analysts here have come up with their own version of a classic joke to describe the stock market's latest gyrations. How do you invest in Japanese stocks when the yen is rocketing out of control? Answer: very carefully.
The soaring value of the yen last week, to a postwar high against the dollar, took some of the steam out of the stock market's first convincing bull run in a year. With lingering memories of the market's many failed attempts at recovery since 1990, there was something of a collective groan as investors confronted a new set of scenarios and counted the stronger yen's toll on the economy. 
 Exporters could be hit hard, some fear, stifling the recovery from a recession almost before it begins. Will this prove yet another occasion for share prices to slide back into a rut?
Even after a harrowing week, most analysts say no, that the rally is here to stay. But, they generally add, care must be taken in approaching the Japanese market. There could be some knocks ahead if the yen races much higher -- it briefly hit 110 yen to the dollar last week -- and some sectors may perform poorly. Yet analysts' confidence in this rebound remained unshaken.
"This won't hurt the market too much as long as it doesn't get too much out of hand," said Jeff Bahrenburg, a senior stock market analyst with Merrill Lynch Japan. "I'm not lowering my ratings on this market yet, and if stocks do take a hit from another surge in the yen, we'd double up on them."
Kathy Matsui, the strategist here for Barclays de Zoette Wedd Securities, generally agreed. "This isn't as negative as some people are playing it up to be," she said. "The speed of the yen's rise and the volatility has a lot of people very concerned, but it's not that bad in our view."
She added that she is sticking to her forecast that the Nikkei stock market index will reach 23,000 before the end of the year.
Getting there will require some recouping of recent losses; the Nikkei index peaked on April 13 at 20,740.29, its highest level in more than a year. Since then it has lost 5 percent, closing Friday at 19,704.15.
In a way, the shudders that spread through the market last week and caused the decline were understandable, because they were spread mostly by the Government.
As the yen crashed through a series of postwar highs, partly as a result of comments by President Clinton that appeared to encourage the movement, concern turned to fear that the Government had lost control of its own currency. The bottom line was that there was a policy conflict between Japan and the United States over the currency's value, and America won -- at least for now.
The Clinton Administration has pushed for a stronger yen as a means of reducing Japan's yawning trade surpluses with the United States; it encourages Japanese imports by making foreign goods cheaper here, and makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad, thus discouraging them.
The Japanese Government says it agrees with yen appreciation as a means of reducing its massive surpluses, but it opposes the run-up that has occurred. Throughout the last week officials from the Prime Minister on down warned that too steep a rise in the yen would nip the economic recovery in the bud.
Private analysts and economists agree that there will be some downward pressure, but add something that Government officials involved in the verbal tug of war with Washington did not: the Government is expected to take strong countermeasures to insure that the economy does expand smartly this year. If the yen does rise further, say to 100 yen to the dollar, most expect the Government to reduce interest rates or to increase a previously announced public works program to stimulate growth.
"The higher yen rate has created the opportunity for short-term interest rates to decline," said Susumu Kato, the economist here with CS First Boston (Japan). He added that the Bank of Japan may lower its official discount rate a half-point, to 2 percent, which would be bound to add a fillip to the economy and counter the impact of a stronger yen.
The basic reason for the optimism is the view that the economy has hit bottom and that corporate profits have only one way to go after four straight years of declines: up, and fast. The strong yen simply has not changed that, although it has made some wary of the stocks of companies that rely heavily on exports.
The overall ratio of share prices to expected earnings per share of the stocks on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange is currently 70, about three times the level on Wall Street. But analysts say they are not concerned because of the expected surge in profits next year.
"When you're at a point in the cycle when earnings are so distressed, there's room for a real snapback," said Mr. Bahrenburg. "This is the time when stocks do well. We still believe that." He said that he is projecting the Nikkei index will hit 22,500 in the next several months and 27,000 by mid-1994.
Even some of the more vulnerable stocks, such as electronics companies, which are heavy exporters, are doing reasonably well.
Steven Myers, an electronics industry analyst for Jardine Fleming Securities here, commented: "The strong yen obviously will have some impact because a lot of these companies are not sufficiently hedged. They didn't expect such an abrupt movement in the currency. But the market seems to think this won't be prolonged. The stocks aren't doing badly."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Rails Warn That Business Is Weakening

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IS this a recovery that won't pick up speed?
Signs that the economy is slowing again have begun to appear, and while it is possible to dismiss some of them as reflecting bad weather in March, that is not true for all of them.
Some of the earliest indicators of industrial health come from the railroad industry, where the pickup after the March blizzard on the East Coast turned out to be brief. "The week prior to Easter was very strong, but it did not come out of Easter as strong as it had in the past," said Howard Keen, chief economist for Conrail. 
 Conrail, heretofore a Wall Street darling, jolted investors last week when it reported its earnings. It wasn't that profits were so bad, but the company warned that revenue apparently would grow much less this year than was expected.
The biggest part of that problem is coal. Exports are down sharply, largely because of Europe's recession, and domestic utilities have been paring inventories. But those trends are well known. What is new is the sluggish pickup in business in other areas. "There is not the spark we are all looking for," reports Mr. Keen. An increase in industrial traffic in January soon vanished, and Mr. Keen says that unless that turns around soon he expects to see industrial production begin to suffer.
Rail stocks are among the most economically sensitive. Their good performance beginning in the fall of 1990 signaled the economy had bottomed, and a renewed surge last fall began just as investors discovered the economy was starting to grow. But last week the Standard & Poor's rail index fell 5.7 percent, far more than the 2.7 percent drop in the
 S.&P. 500. Conrail tumbled $6.50, or 11 percent a share, to $52.625, but it is still up 56 percent from its low last October.
By no means are the signs all negative. The auto industry has picked up, and steel is doing acceptably well, notes Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, a railroad analyst for First Boston. Or, as Robert Fort, a spokesman for Norfolk Southern, put it, "the economy is sluggishly picking up." But Friday's report of a fall in durable-goods orders in March, coming on the heels of a drop in housing starts, provides ample reason to wonder whether the steam is going out of the recovery.
There is an optimistic way to view this, one that sees slow but consistent growth for years to come. With luck, such growth will not push up interest rates, but will allow corporate profits, and stock prices, to make solid, if unspectacular, gains.
The trouble with that forecast is that it ignores the impending tightening of fiscal policy. President Clinton's puny proposal for economic stimulus was talked to death by Senate Republicans last week, but his plans for new taxes are still on track. Such taxes are no doubt needed someday if the budget deficit is ever to be controlled, but they will slow the economy. It would be nice if the economy could pick up some speed before the fiscal brakes are applied.

HEADLINE: Changing Course at American Airlines

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
He spreads his hands in frustration. He openly admits that he does not have the answers. He is impatient with strategies that have worked before. Only now and again, as when he talks about a new route to London, does the old confident, ebullient Robert L. Crandall burst through.
Mr. Crandall, the hard-charging chairman of American Airlines, led his industry on an expansionary binge in the 1980's that has now come back to haunt him and the industry. He was the one who pioneered the frequent-flyer program, innovative discount fares and a two-tier wage system that enabled the airline to cut costs while it expanded. And he was the one who built a dominant computer reservation system that often made his airline the first choice of travel agents. 
 Yet instead of the cocky corporate titan and industry champion, he's now more like the bewildered general who led a successful charge against an enemy, only to end up encircled by new and unknown forces. And so he has begun a retreat that is slow and painful and full of danger. When it's over, the airline he built into the largest carrier outside of Russia will be cut and perhaps seriously weakened.
Although executives at other airlines are staring at some of the same problems that beset American, only Mr. Crandall has been so vocal about the pain.
"It is a very hazardous time," said Mr. Crandall. "I am profoundly worried."
The wrenching reorganization through which he is now prodding the airline and its parent, the AMR Corporation, is far riskier than anything he has done before. Although last week's earnings report for the first quarter showed some recovery in American's operations, it didn't change Mr. Crandall's assessment. He believes he has a serious long-term problem; its name is American Airlines.
To help solve it, he plans to focus more on subsidiary businesses, like helping other carriers with such services as data processing, where earnings are more reliable.
He also believes he must make the airline smaller. He is stopping or stretching out the delivery of many aircraft, grounding or retiring some of its existing planes, pruning capital spending and dropping some short-haul flights that bleed cash. He is contemplating closing some of American's hubs. And in a move that jacked up the anxiety in the ranks, American said recently that it would lay off 500 pilots and 400 mechanics, the first layoffs since the early 1980's.
 
Making the Cuts
 Yet how far can Mr. Crandall cut before the airline becomes too small to sustain itself -- and leaves too many new opportunities for rivals big and small? What torments him is that he is not convinced any of his strategies will work. His anguished -- and at times public -- soul searching seems to generate more questions than answers. He is so frustrated by the process that he has been turning to outsiders for help: professors, critics, journalists and analysts, even industry gadflies he wouldn't have gone near years ago.
One thing is clear. Because more than 90 percent of AMR's revenues come from the airline, "he has to fix the airline," said Julius Maldutis, airline analyst at Salomon Brothers. He and other analysts are skeptical of Mr. Crandall's comments that he will largely abandon the airline business if he cannot produce higher returns. But Mr. Maldutis believes the non-airline segment of the business will rise to 20 percent of revenues in five years, double what it is now.
Mr. Maldutis also thinks that by the end of the decade, American Airlines will rely more heavily on international routes and remain a major competitor on transcontinental flights, fed by strong hubs like Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. Weaker hubs, like Raleigh-Durham, N.C., San Jose, Calif., and Nashville, may well be shut or scaled back, and American will pull out of many of the smaller markets it now dominates. That could offer rivals the short-haul routes that now feed into those hubs, and make for livelier competition and perhaps lower fares. Indeed, those rivals might then weaken the hub-and-spoke system -- and change the flying patterns of millions of Americans -- by offering more nonstop flights to medium and small cities instead of flights that stop in big cities.
Mr. Maldutis also believes that American's fleet will be smaller, although he will not estimate by how much, and that it may consist mainly of medium-sized jets. A possible source for the supply of those planes is Russia, which is eager to sell its new planes -- some equipped with Western avionics and engines -- to win a foothold in the private aviation market.
Mr. Maldutis and other analysts believe that American could emerge as a highly profitable carrier. It would, however, be more vulnerable to events that devastate international traffic, like the Gulf war, they added.
 
'Impossible Situation'
 As change sweeps through his airline, Mr. Crandall continues to raise troubling questions. Some regard his public vulnerability with cynicism, calling it an orchestrated plan to soften up his unions for concessions down the road. But it is at odds with the management style he has cultivated over the years and he has little to gain from being so embarrassed so publicly. He likes to put his cards on the table and let the other side know exactly what he wants. The problem is that the cards often come up blank these days.
"He is caught in an impossible situation," said Robert W. Iverson, chairman of Kiwi International Air Lines, an upstart, Newark-based carrier poised to move into markets that Mr. Crandall may be forced to abandon.
So is it time for the 58-year-old Mr. Crandall, who has led the airline for 13 years, to step down? His board and his management appear to be behind him. Even his critics say he is firmly in control, of his company and himself. But the appearance of such a high-profile corporate leader raising such serious questions is, to say the least, quite rare -- especially when other airline chiefs, like Stephen Wolf at United, seem more optimistic that they can ride out tough times with such proven methods as winning concessions from unions and cutting costs and unprofitable routes.
"The problem for chief executives is that their egos prevent them from reaching outside their own spheres," said Paul Dempsey, professor of law at the University of Denver, who has been advising Mr. Crandall. "Crandall is bright enough and has the self-confidence to go to the outside. That speaks well of him."
The news for American and the rest of the industry has been a bit better lately. Airline traffic for the industry has been up in recent months and that is expected to continue through the summer. Last week's first-quarter report at AMR showed a net loss of $22 million, which some analysts said was less than expected. In fact, its operating earnings were up 1.8 percent and costs reduced about 1 percent, even in the face of higher fuel costs. "This underscores our continuing commitment to control every possible expense," Mr. Crandall said.
Still, he believes the company is earning an inadequate return on its investment and sees "a continuing proliferation of discount fares of every type" and a continuing recession in many overseas markets. The company's stock rose $6, to $71.25, the day the first-quarter results were announced, but the numbers did little to change Mr. Crandall's downbeat assessment. He calls his problems more fundamental and says they grow out of forces beyond his control.
 
Threats From All Sides
 Consumers, he says, will continue to demand lower fares. Huge foreign carriers, like British Airways, are trying to elbow their way into more domestic markets. Hobbled airlines operating under the protection of bankruptcy courts -- Continental, Trans World Airlines, America West -- are emerging as healthier rivals.
What's more, not since the early 1970's have so many small upstart airlines taken to the skies. And fare wars have been cropping up recently and more are likely. Just last week, Northwest Airlines cut fares sharply on domestic routes and some Atlantic markets, forcing American and others to match.
Washington, too, poses a concern. For the first time since 1979, the Government has started to flex its muscles on industry issues; it recently moved to protect an upstart carrier, Reno Air, against price-cutting moves by Northwest.
The turmoil that these changes have produced -- fueled by Mr. Crandall's reaction to them -- is evident everywhere at American. Some mid-level executives and rank-and-file employees say they are confused and concerned by all of Mr. Crandall's public probing.
Last spring, for example, employees saw him suffer a major loss of face -- and a sharp drop in profits. In response to a temporary sale by Northwest, Mr. Crandall cut all discount fares by 50 percent and dropped restrictions. That set off the largest spree of ticket buying in industry history -- and a spate of huge losses.
Legal troubles are also cause for concern. Several carriers, including Continental, T.W.A. and America West, have filed suits against Mr. Crandall, charging him with predatory pricing to drive them out of business with last spring's fare cuts. Although Mr. Crandall is normally willing to blast other carriers, he is now very cautious when talking about other airlines that could use his remarks against him in their lawsuits.
Some employees are troubled. "You have to watch out for yourself," said one flight attendant, who asked that she not be identified. She has been with the carrier five years and has begun to build up a decorating business on the side.
Sherry Brownell, a flight attendant for 23 years, said she has started studying retailing, "just in case," even though her seniority will likely keep her job safe.
Some top executives have tried to explain the current turmoil as a manifestation of Mr. Crandall's long-time management style, which is open and frank and intended to allow new ideas to percolate. The Crandall style, said Don Carty, senior vice president of finance and strategic planning, is "to challenge what you are doing as you are doing it."
 
From Optimism to Pain
 Mr. Carty conceded, however, that there are some conflicting feelings about the current course. Shifting from quick growth to retrenchment can be disconcerting. One strategy, after all, is full of optimism; the other is simply painful. And the shift away from building an airline to increasing investment in less visible businesses -- say, computer reservations systems -- is also less exciting, he said.
Yet the shift, he stressed, must be made. "There is an ambivalence about how we feel," he said, "but no ambivalence about what we must do."
While it is relatively easy to cut flights and even to close hubs, it takes much longer to cut the remaining overhead to make up for the loss of revenue. "The fixed cost of buildings does not change," Mr. Crandall said.
Rising labor costs are a problem, but Mr. Crandall is reluctant at this point to go to his unions for concessions because he believes they would seek an equity stake in the airline.
The unions have shown little willingness to give concessions. To the contrary, Randy Edwards, a spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which is in talks to replace the contract that expired in December, said that union negotiators are looking to reap some benefits as a payback for concessions they agreed to 10 years ago. American's other major contracts, for the pilots and the machinists, expire in August 1994 and March 1995, respectively.
Labor costs now make up about one third of the carrier's costs. They have increased about 11 percent since 1988 while revenue has risen only about 6 percent. And they are hardly the only costs that are up. Fuel expenses, for example, have risen about 14 percent since 1988. Although American has about $800 million in cash, it had losses of $240 million in 1991 and $278.2 million last year.
 
Weighing the Hubs
 One way to cut costs is to sell off hubs or parts of them. American is thinking about selling off the relatively new terminal at its hub in Raleigh-Durham, which was built only six years ago for $150 million. It is also studying whether to close or cut back in San Jose.
Mr. Crandall "has to give up market share and get out of hubs where they are not making money," said Ray Neidl, an analyst for Furman Selz Inc. But, he added, "this gives a chance for the new low-cost carriers to get stronger to challenge the big guys."
This is even a bigger risk because of the more activist stance that the Government is taking toward the industry. The new Secretary of Transportation, Federico Pena, has shown in the Reno Air case that he will intervene to give new carriers a better chance against their bigger brethren, vowing to enforce antitrust laws that were largely ignored by the past two Republican Administrations.
As Mayor of Denver, Mr. Pena witnessed some of the destructive aspects of deregulation first hand. It was in Denver that Frontier Airlines met its demise during a frenzy of takeovers, and it was there, too, that United and Continental battled in brutal fare wars that helped put Continental into bankruptcy.
Professor Dempsey, from the University of Denver, said he believes the industry is ready for more Government intervention to help find its way out the hole it has dug. Mr. Crandall and other industry leaders have expressed support for a new Government commission that is charged with trying to find solutions to some industry problems.
But Mr. Crandall still believes that the company's fate is largely in its own hands, making it that much more urgent to find the right strategy for the long haul.
"I'm not entirely satisfied with the answers," he said. "We have to keep probing at every front if we're going to meet the challenge."
 
 
 
THE GADFLY HAS HIS DAY AT 58,000 FEET

DONALD PEVSNER, a Florida lawyer who has filed numerous suits on behalf of flyers to get lower fares and better service, is hardly the sort of person Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, would consult.
Yet just such an odd arrangement began in April 1990, when Mr. Pevsner and Mr. Crandall were on the same Concorde flight to London. Mr. Pevsner sent Mr. Crandall a note, baiting him. Is it time, he asked, to regulate airlines again?
To Mr. Pevsner's surprise, Mr. Crandall came back to his seat. At 58,000 feet over the Atlantic, the two men wrangled over deregulation and other issues. To Mr. Pevsner's greater surprise, Mr. Crandall gave him his card with his private phone and fax numbers and made a request: Could he travel as American's guest -- for up to 12,000 miles on different routes -- and report back his impressions?
Over the next year, Mr. Pevsner sent Mr. Crandall hundreds of faxes and then met with top executives. He told them that fares in many markets were too high for business travel and that discount fares carried too many restrictions, inhibiting travelers from impulse trips. He also said that there should be more direct flights between cities and that the hub system often caused "too much of a hassle for travelers."
Mr. Crandall said his managers factored Mr. Pevsner's suggestions into their thinking. And Mr. Pevsner was impressed. "He wanted an outsider to troubleshoot," he said. "That was a relatively creative step. No other C.E.O. but Crandall would have done something like that."
But unwilling to let his critic's role lapse, Mr. Pevsner said he felt little came of his suggestions.
"I was banging my head against the wall," he said.

HEADLINE: Ikea's New Realities: Recession and Aging Consumers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: JARFALLA, Sweden

 BODY:
It is a cold, gray morning in this suburb of Stockholm, but hundreds of people are lined up for the opening of a vast new Ikea store.
"Welcome to cheap land," says Anders Moberg, the genial president of the Ikea Group, using a pun based on Smaland, the name of the region of Sweden where the furniture retailer was founded. Then he cuts a large yellow and blue ribbon and watches, smiling, as the crowd rushes past in search of sofas, tables, beds and other goods that the company aims to sell for 10 percent to 30 percent less than other furniture retailers. 
 Ikea, virtually unknown outside Scandinavia two decades ago, has grown accustomed to opening-day crowds as it has pushed rapidly into Europe, North America and Asia. Along the way, it has built something of a cult following, especially among young, price-conscious consumers.
But Ikea executives have fewer reasons to smile nowadays. After an expansion binge that nearly doubled the number of stores and nearly quintupled sales in less than a decade, the company is stopping to catch its breath. And as it looks around, what it sees is not entirely encouraging.
The worldwide economic slowdown has hit the company's most important markets especially hard. Germany, which accounted for 29 percent of Ikea's sales last year, has slipped into a downturn, and Scandinavia, with 22 percent of sales, has been unable to pull itself out of a two-year slump.
Worldwide sales this year should be roughly flat, excluding revenues from new stores, Mr. Moberg said. And there is no way of knowing whether the downturn will end soon or deepen. "Since we have such a chaotic situation in the world it's difficult to make predictions," Mr. Moberg said.
Ikea is also facing demographic shifts that are forcing it to try to broaden its appeal to older and wealthier consumers.
It plans to open 11 stores this fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, down from 17 last year. And it has no immediate plans to add to the existing 12 stores in the United States. Openings will drop even lower over the next several years, and Ikea executives are pausing to take stock. "Of course growth is important," Mr. Moberg said. "But the first priority for me is to take care of existing Ikea."
From 10 stores in five countries in 1974, Ikea will have grown by the end of this summer to 119 stores in 24 countries.
Millions of customers have gone to the stores -- large showrooms next to huge self-service warehouses usually situated just outside of large cities -- and lugged home heavy cartons of Ikea furniture, which is packed and sold unassembled to keep the company's costs and prices low. They have spread out the dozens of pieces and stared hard at the sometimes incomprehensible instructions, wondering whether the savings are worth the hassle of do-it-yourself assembly.
Some have muttered, "Never again." But enough have kept going back for the moderate prices, the simple Scandinavian designs and the large selection of colors, styles and materials to make Ikea one of the world's fastest-growing retailers.

WHILE Ikea has no direct rival in store size and selection of goods, its designs and pricing strategies have been widely imitated.
Sales in the last fiscal year were reported at $3.2 billion at current exchange rates. A nonprofit Dutch foundation set up by Ikea's founder, Ingvar Kamprad, owns Ikea and does not disclose its profits. The foundation, Stichting Ingka, sometimes makes investments outside of the Ikea Group. It recently acquired the Habitat chain of home furnishings retailers from Storehouse P.L.C. of Britain (except for the Conran's Habitat stores in the United States). It will operate them separately from Ikea.
Company executives said the bulk of any profits go back into Ikea itself, financing its growth and keeping debt levels low. Ikea's challenges will not end with the recession. Most of its customers are relatively young and its furniture has always been designed with their tastes and financial limitations in mind. But worldwide the population is aging. Ikea is already expanding its product line to include more traditional -- and more expensive -- styles favored by older consumers -- fully assembled sofas, for example, that customers can order with a wide choice of fabrics and have shipped to them directly from the supplier.
But in trying to broaden its appeal, Ikea risks diluting its identity and becoming just another big furniture retailer. "We can't have something for everybody," said Mr. Moberg. "But we will have a reasonably wide range, enough to be an option for 40 or 50 percent of any country's population."

IKEA was founded in 1943 by Mr. Kamprad, who was then just a teen-ager, to serve very price- and quality-conscious neighbors. Sweden at the time was a relatively poor nation, particularly the residents of the central region known as Smaland.
A native of the region (the name Ikea comes from his initials plus the first letter of his village, Elmtaryd, and his parish, Agunnaryd), Mr. Kamprad developed a furniture line to meet those needs. He sold it first through a catalogue and then through a showroom in 1954. The first real store didn't open until 1958, in Almhult, the Smaland town that remains the headquarters of Ikea's Swedish operations and its spiritual home.
As Ikea became successful, and Mr. Kamprad grew older, he confronted a common problem in Sweden: extremely high inheritance taxes. Concluding that the company would have to be broken up or sold off if it remained Swedish-owned at his death, he set up the Stichting Ingka foundation in Amsterdam, with himself as chairman, and transferred to it 100 percent ownership of Ikea. He moved the company's international headquarters to Denmark. He himself moved to Switzerland.
Today, at 66, Mr. Kamprad -- whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $2.8 billion -- is a Sam Walton-like figure. He appears unannounced in stores for a look around. He oversees product development and purchasing operations. He guards against any weakening of the corporate culture he imposed, a culture that spurns hierarchy and bureaucracy and virtually outlaws perks. (Mr. Moberg, the president, and all other top executives travel coach class and stay at budget hotels. At dinner the night before the store opening in Jarfalla, Mr. Moberg and his top lieutenants discussedwhich bus to take from the airport to save a few dollars.)
Nowhere is penny pinching more important to Ikea than in its dealings with its 1,800 suppliers. Ikea does little manufacturing of its own, so is always seeking ways to exert more influence over the companies from which it buys the furniture it sells. Its sheer size helps. But Ikea executives said they were increasingly becoming more active in helping the suppliers to become more efficient.
Goran Stahlgren, Ikea's top purchasing executive in Sweden, recalled a recent meeting at which the company decided to help the suppliers shop around for better quality materials, lower prices, or both.
"Maybe they have the competence, but they don't have the time or the temperament to search the world for raw materials," Mr. Stahlgren said. "We can help with that."

IKEA also sends people to study suppliers' operations and to suggest more efficient methods. At Brantorp, a Swedish maker of wooden drawers and doors for kitchen cabinets and bureaus, Ikea recommended that the supplier move up to two shifts a day, and helped justify the change by ordering larger quantities. The move allowed Brantorp to reduce its unit costs. Ultimately, Ikea executives said, the change should lower the supplier's prices by 15 percent to 20 percent.
Some Ikea executives said the company had sometimes concentrated too much on what its suppliers could build efficiently rather than on asking consumers what they wanted to buy.
In the United States, for example, Ikea made a classic outsider's mistake by selling beds only in European sizes, which standard American mattresses and sheets don't fit. It later stocked compatible sheets in some stores, but sales were not good, so it recently decided to simply order American-sized beds.
That's the kind of shift in thinking, said Marvin S. Traub, the former chairman of Bloomingdale's, that will help Ikea as it expands into markets farther and farther from its home base. "They're learning more and more about the U.S. market," said Mr. Traub, who last fall purchased the American stores of Conran's Habitat. "There will be opportunities for them to grow."
Because Ikea has continued to open new stores even as other battered retailers slowed or stopped, Mr. Moberg said his company could benefit some from the continued economic sluggishness.
"I see this as a good opportunity to take market share," he said. "Value for money is very important to the consumer."
 
 
 
THE AMERICAN CONNECTION
 "The United States has been a good market for us, and there's a huge potential there," said Anders Moberg, president of the Ikea Group.
"But when as a Swede you go to a huge country like the U.S. and say, 'Ooh, markets, markets, markets,' it can be dangerous," he added. "It's not one market, it's a lot of different markets. We have to concentrate on areas rather than trying to be everywhere."
Unfortunately for Ikea, its biggest American market is the Los Angeles area, which has five of the company's 12 American stores. California has seen few signs of the recovery that seems to be taking hold in much of the nation.
Since establishing a beachhead outside Philadelphia in 1985, the Ikea Group has also opened stores near New York -- in Elizabeth, N.J., and Hicksville, L.I. The other American stores are outside Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Houston.
"They've put together a critical mass of furniture and furnishings," said Walter K. Levy of Levy Kerson Associates, a retail consulting firm in New York. "It's value priced and pretty well made. It's ubiquitous-contemporary in style. The chances of finding what you want are pretty high -- and you can take it home with you. That's a pretty good formula." One that is very hard for competitors like Crate and Barrel and Pier 1 to match.
The company plans to spend the rest of this year concentrating on improving its supplier relationships in the United States and improving its distribution system.
Only then will Ikea consider expanding, Mr. Moberg said, most likely on the East and West Coasts, where the company has good distribution and invested in marketing efforts to build up its name.

THE ECONOMY
 
Isn't That Bob Dole, With Democratic Feathers in His Mouth? 

This round goes to Bob Dole. The Senate minority leader held his troops firmly in line last week to kill off President Clinton's economic stimulus bill, rejecting all compromises aimed at ending a Republican filibuster. But Mr. Dole, far from gloating, even seemed a bit embarrassed that he'd won -- making light of it as "just a bump in the road" for the President. That's a far cry from his recent colorful snipings. But the Democrats, furious at this Republican ambush, unleashed a harsh volley, with Senator Robert Byrd saying Republicans would accept "billions for unemployment, not one cent for jobs" and calling them "guardians of gridlock." And George Stephanopoulos, voice of the White House, said that for Mr. Dole, "playing politics is a lot more important than putting people to work." As the dust cleared, though, maybe there was a lesson for Mr. Clinton on how to deal with those folks on Capitol Hill.
 
Greenspan Sees Low Inflation
 
If Alan Greenspan has anything to say about it -- and he has a lot to say about it -- there'll be no burst of inflation any time soon. In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, the Federal Reserve chairman said inflationary pressures were "difficult to imagine" with bank lending subdued and labor costs under control. And he vowed not to repeat the mistakes that led to high inflation in the late 70's. He clearly sees low inflation as crucial to a strong economy, saying that it has helped businesses focus on productivity, not raising prices -- and that the resulting jump in productivity could signal a lasting trend. Maybe in another year you'll be refinancing that mortgage yet again.
 
In the meantime, the economy took another stumble. Durable-goods orders -- a key barometer of industrial health -- fell a surprisingly large 3.7 percent in March, the biggest decline in 15 months.
 
$60 Million Gift for Columbia
 
John W. Kluge knows what minority youths sorely need: a good education. And he's putting a good chunk of his fortune where his heart is. Last week Mr. Kluge, chairman of Metromedia and one of the nation's richest people, gave Columbia University $60 million for minority scholarships. That will work out to yearly grants of $10,000 for 300 students. But what Mr. Kluge does not need is a campus building with his name on it. Columbia and other colleges have offered it, repeatedly, "but I'm not interested," he said. What he's interested in is minority scholarships, because, he said simply, "the need is there."
 
A Greener President
 
When the hard choices come, how much will Clinton stick up for the environment? Early signs weren't good, as the President backed away from a shift in Federal land policy and allowed a toxic waste incinerator in Ohio. But maybe a bit of Earth Day spirit got into him last week. Reversing two key Bush policy positions, Mr. Clinton said the United States would sign an international treaty protecting endangered species and would act to reduce global warming. Environmentalists, including Vice President Gore, cheered. "President Clinton has brought America back into step with the rest of the world on environmental protection," said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.
 
Law Firm Pays Its Keating Dues
 
In 1989, the Government paid $2.5 billion to mop up after Charles Keating and his pals at Lincoln Savings. Uncle Sam was not happy. The Government got Mr. Keating behind bars, and keeps trying to get some money back. Last week, Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the giant law firm, agreed to chip in $51 million just before a trial was to begin to decide whether it should pay a lot more. Back in 1986, Jones, Day did some work for Lincoln -- and, a Government lawyer said, was told in "graphic and detailed terms" about Lincoln's shenanigans. It was a prime opportunity "to stop Mr. Keating in his tracks," he said.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Fiat Says Yes, There's a Problem
 
Maybe a healing process is beginning in Italy. For the first time, Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, publicly acknowledged corporate corruption and urged investigators to get on with it. For over a year, the scandal has mushroomed, with more and more tales of bribes to politicians for contracts, and Fiat, the giant of Italian business, was at the heart of it. Mr. Agnelli's admission was seen as an attempt to head off further damage.
 
Eurotunnel's Coming, Someday
 
Some cynics, surely, think there will never really be a tunnel linking England and France -- believing England is destined to remain that sceptred isle, standing aloof from the rest of Europe. Cynics, take heart. Last week the planned opening of the delay-plagued Eurotunnel was delayed yet again. It was supposed to be Christmas, but now -- amid a dispute over $1 billion in costs -- it looks more like next year. So for a bit longer, that fortress built by nature is unscaled by engineers.
 
A Trade Issue of Clinton's Own
 
Bill Clinton has talked tough on trade, but until now there's been no true taste of Clinton action. There have been disputes on autos and computer chips, but those were holdovers from the Bush days. Last week, the first trade issue taken up by this Administration came to the fore, and the result was mixed. There was an accord with Europe on contracts for work on electric utilities, but Europeans will be barred from bidding on other contracts.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
I.B.M.'s Been Down So Long . . .
 
Investors have gotten so used to large-scale grim news from I.B.M. that they looked at last week's $285 million quarterly loss and said, well, it could have been worse -- and bid the stock up by $1.375, to $50.625. But the news was bad -- as the market soon realized, with the stock slipping to $47.75 by week's end -- because the fine print showed that I.B.M.'s mainframe business had serious, lasting problems. These big machines have always paid I.B.M.'s bills, and though companies still buy them, competitive pressure has pushed prices down 30 percent in a year -- and there's no end in sight. On the plus side, I.B.M. cut operating costs by a sharp 9 percent in the quarter, but Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the new chief executive, still has a huge task ahead.
 
Goodbye House, Goodbye Garden
 
Maybe home decorating, like housecleaning, is an endangered art as hassled multicareer families have less time to fuss about the nest. Maybe magazine advertising is not bouncing back all that quickly. Or maybe it's just that Conde Nast did not want to compete against itself. But whatever the reason, HG (born in 1901 as House & Garden) is no more. Conde Nast, which just bought HG's healthier rival, Architectural Digest, said last week that HG's July issue would be its last. The publisher's financial reasons were certainly sound, but many found it hard to see an institution die. "It's the end of an era," one designer said. And one shocked journalist added, "It was like the death of a friend."
 
Trade Center Tenant, at a Price
 
BankAmerica may have qualms about moving into the World Trade Center, but it wasn't admitting them last week when it signed a 15-year lease for eight floors. With improvements made since the February bombing, it is "the safest building in New York, and perhaps even in the country," the bank said. Pretty strong words. But then again, it was given some pretty strong incentives to sign that lease -- two years free rent, among other things. Fearing that other tenants might flee when their leases end, local officials badly wanted this new tenant -- and were willing to pay the price. "BankAmerica is sending an important message," Gov. Mario Cuomo said, seizing on the symbolism. "The World Trade Center is back."
 
McDonnell Clings to the C-17
 
This much is clear: McDonnell Douglas badly wants to keep making the C-17 cargo plane, and the Air Force badly wants the plane, to replace an outdated model. But then it gets murky. At a hearing last week, House members accused John F. McDonnell, the chairman, of conspiring with the Government to bail out his company. But Mr. McDonnell strongly denied any wrongdoing. Even the company's earnings were questioned. On the eve of the hearing, McDonnell had reported a strong comeback, but some on the House panel expressed doubt about its recovery.
 
A Five-and-Dime It's Not
 
What, exactly, is a store? A place to buy what you need and then quickly get on with your life? Get real. These days, "people are looking for fantasy and entertainment from retailing," a market researcher says. True, there are still those driven souls who dart into a department store for lipstick or a tie, but Takashimaya turns up its nose at them. "Jewelry and cosmetics on the main floor are tired concepts," said a merchandise manager for the Japanese retailer. So, out with tired concepts! Last week, Takashimaya opened a Fifth Avenue store whose first two floors are devoted to an art gallery and a soaring atrium. Will hurried New Yorkers make time for this? We'll see.
 
Look Who's Back: Sears
 
Six months ago, Sears, Roebuck posted its first loss since the Depression. It was smarting from an auto-repair scandal, its Allstate Insurance unit had taken a hurricane beating and its merchandising business was floundering. But last week those clouds vanished: Aided by a new vigor at Allstate and strength in retailing, Sears reported the highest first-quarter profit in its 106-year history. The stock, in the low 40's in October, closed the week at $53.50.

 BODY:
WAYNE NEWTON'S unlikely enshrinement into the hallowed halls of hipness began with a Las Vegas-style existential crisis. Gazing into his bathroom mirror one fateful day during the winter of 1991, Mr. Newton refused to look below as the first half of his infamous pencil-thin mustache swirled down the drain. Was it too late, the singer fretted, to reconsider his decision to finally lose his Valentino-via-Vegas look?
"I stared at what was left of my mustache, and thought very hard about what it all meant," said the 51-year-old casino crooner, whose collected monikers over the decades include "Mr. Excitement," "the Midnight Idol," "King of the Strip" and, most often, "Mr. Las Vegas." 
 In the preceding days, Mr. Newton's closest friends had told him he was nuts to even think of shaving off his trademark. To the millions of fans who had made Mr. Newton the highest-paid nightclub singer ever, the mustache was as integral a part of his persona as Groucho Marx's greasepaint or Gabby Hayes's whiskers. Of course, to the cognoscenti who had long lampooned Mr. Newton as the ultimate ham-boned lounge lizard, his mustache had become a symbol of Las Vegas vulgarity itself, as unctuous an icon of Sin City as Liberace's candelabra or Sammy Davis Jr.'s medallions.
Staring in the mirror, Mr. Newton took final stock. "I said, 'If all I am is a mustache, then that's not enough. A mustache isn't a person, it doesn't have a soul.' " And so, with a steely grip Wayne Newton shaved off his remaining sliver of facial hair.
Two years later, that razor stroke reverberates as the beginning of an astonishing counterrevolution of perception wherein Mr. Newton, and the town he embodies, is suddenly hip. More young people are coming to Las Vegas than ever before: last year, according to the city's Convention and Visitors Authority, 31 percent of the city's 22 million visitors were under 40, and 14 percent were under 30.
And the new clientele aren't all coming from trailer parks, or why would Wolfgang Puck have just opened a Spago in Caesar's Palace? True these visitors aren't monolithic in their tastes: several Hollywood brat packs have led the charge to Las Vegas, accompanied by their polar opposites from the anti-rat-race worlds of alternative music and Generation X.
To be sure, part of Las Vegas's new appeal is based on the historic appreciation of fine pop cultural cheese by the baby boomers. Still, young people are putting their money where there irony is: there are enough Armanis and skinny sideburns in casino showrooms to indicate that Las Vegas no longer belongs just to the legions of blue-haired and mutton-chopped Americans who had been scaring off the style-conscious for decades.
Las Vegas's reputation has rebounded among even the most self-consciously cool chronicles. Not long after Mr. Newton shaved, Spy magazine toasted him with a laudatory feature; Spin, the glossy bible of alternative music, ran a lengthy appreciation, topped off with the sentence: "Wayne Newton is, for lack of a better word, God." He even made it onto a popular Zippy the Pinhead button, where the countercultural comic hero elliptically exclaims, "I'm under direct order from Wayne Newton!"
Mr. Newton, meantime, unbowed by decades of critical abuse or a recent bankruptcy, has remained pleasantly shocked at his change in status. "Suddenly the same things I was doing five years ago that were considered pure corn are now perceived to be in," Mr. Newton said at his home in Las Vegas. "I've even got teen-age fan clubs." He paused, and then laughed. "It's a wonderful satisfaction to finally be hip."
Las Vegas chic has spread beyond Nevada. Among the popular party schemes for the young sets in New York or Los Angeles this season are get-togethers based on Tom Jones themes. Mr. Jones, a 52-year-old Welshman, continues to thrill his new audiences at Bally's, his home base, with surreal-sounding renditions of Prince's "Purple Rain" and Junior Walker's "Shotgun."
Among Mr. Jones's most devoted young fans are Luke Perry and Jason Priestley, stars of "Beverly Hills 90210," who recently flew to Las Vegas to see their hero perform. "I heard the fellows were fans, so I said let's get together," Mr. Jones said.
Traditionally, Las Vegas has been where brilliant talents have landed after their gifts have corroded. Few recall with fondness Billie Holiday's gigs at the Dunes, a bloated Elvis Presley at the Hilton or Orson Welles aping himself at the Riviera. Now, even the most current rock acts can prosper on the Strip; last month, Soul Asylum appeared with Keith Richards at Bally's . . . albeit billed in neon below Tom Jones.
"There's not a whole lot of difference between a Las Vegas club crowd and a Seattle club crowd," said Lori Barbero, the dread-locked and tattooed drummer for Babes in Toyland, who recently came to town on a double bill with Faith No More.
Las Vegas square has also been reborn as 90's cool on records and in books. Today, compact disks of the late Louis Prima and Keely Smith, the ultimate Vegas lounge act, are suddenly popular among the young in Hollywood, while Dean Martin, the consummate smarmy Vegas crooner, was recently recast as a totem of hipness via the critically acclaimed biography "Dino," written by the rock-and-roll chronicler Nick Tosches.
"It used to be that you wouldn't be caught dead telling anybody that you were going to Las Vegas on vacation," said Dick Mammen, 42, who was recently dubbed "the hippest man in city hall" in Minneapolis.
Yet, when he left his government job as an adviser on inner-city affairs to set up his own public-interest consulting firm, Mr. Mammen said he had only one thought of where to celebrate his new life. Accompanied by a stack of Frank Sinatra tapes, he drove his 1969 Cadillac convertible to Las Vegas.
"It was a gas," Mr. Mammen said. "You used to go there and feel like an alien from another solar system. Now, you'll run into people who actually look like you."
Las Vegas's last bout with hipness ended in the winter of 1960. Around this time, Frank Sinatra had called upon his show business cronies to convene in Las Vegas for a "summit of cool" to coincide with the filming of "Oceans Eleven," the ultimate "rat pack" movie. John F. Kennedy, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, flew into town to watch Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and other assorted swingers cavort on stage at the Sands Hotel.
According to Nick Tosches's book "Dino," Peter Lawford told the author that after the show, a million dollars in cash was said to have been given to the Kennedy campaign in a leather satchel by a consortium of Las Vegas hoteliers. The next morning, according to "Dino" and several other books, Sinatra introduced the candidate to Judith Exner, who would reportedly serve as mistress to both President Kennedy and the Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana. This wasn't Camelot, and Las Vegas, for all intents and purposes, was over.
By decade's end, Sinatra had a new friend, Spiro T. Agnew, and Las Vegas was so square that in 1968 Jim Morrison, visiting the city, was arrested and charged with vagrancy for failing to identify himself to police. By the 1970's, the city was seen as a blight to spirit and soul. "The Strip was an idiot Disneyland of architectural parabolas, overloaded utility poles, celestial hamburger stands and gimcrackery fairy palaces," wrote John Gregory Dunne in "Las Vegas: Memoir of a Dark Season" (Random House, 1974).
THE popular conception of Las Vegas probably reached bottom in the 80's and was embodied in the film "Lost in America," Albert Brooks's 1985 comic fable of a prototypical Los Angeles yuppie who has dropped out to find his soul. "We don't want to stay in Las Vegas!" Brooks tells his wife when she asks to check into a casino hotel. "This represents everything we left behind."
But by 1991, the earth had moved. Steve Wynn, a casino owner, opened the stately Mirage, proving that Siegfried and Roy could be even better attractions for a casino than "Nudes on Ice." Barry Levinson filmed "Bugsy," a stylish hagiography of the psychotic gangster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegal, who invented modern Las Vegas. And Mr. Newton shaved his mustache.
"Aging baby boomers have the money to travel -- and they're realizing that there are certain things in the United States that they simply have to see in their lifetimes," said Jim Kilby, professor of gaming studies at the University of Los Vegas. "If you don't see Mardi Gras, the Kentucky Derby or Las Vegas, you've lived an incomplete life."
The city at large has boomed as much as the Strip. According to the 1990 census, Las Vegas is the fastest-growing major city in the country. With the sprawl, however, have come urban problems ranging from street gangs to pollution to water shortages.
Nothing, though, is scaring away the weekend crowds. In the current recession, many visit for practical reasons. "Las Vegas is the cheapest vacation in the world," Professor Kilby said. "You can still get a room for $18."
And betting isn't even a necessity for many young visitors. Several months ago, Rob Bragin, 37, joined a pack of fellow Hollywood television writers in a pilgrimage to Las Vegas. "The lure isn't gambling," Mr. Bragin said. "I'll bet a dollar, then get bored. But for me, and a lot of writers I know, the point is trying to temporarily re-create that kind of rat-pack feeling where you walk into a casino wearing a shiny suit while your mental soundtrack is playing Frank Sinatra singing 'Summer Wind.' It's nostalgia for things we were too young to be aware of at the time."
For some members of the even younger Generation X, rejection of baby-boom nostalgia for the 60's is behind the new appeal. "The rat pack may have all been chauvinist pigs, but there's still something romantic about that Vegas-in-the-50's aura," said Maria Larson, 27, a Manhattan-based dealer of vintage movie posters, who has visited Las Vegas three times in the last few years. "I'd so much rather hear Dean Martin sing 'That's Amore' then Fleetwood Mac doing 'Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.' "
A trip through the "new" Las Vegas should perhaps begin at the Graceland Wedding Chapel, situated not far from downtown's Glitter Gulch. Graceland has become one of the premier rock-and-roll marriage spots in the world. Taking the vows can cost as little as $45, and the Elvis impersonator who serves as a witness for each wedding is free.
Jon Bon Jovi began the parade of the famous to the chapel in 1989, when he married his high-school sweetheart outside on the steps. Last March, Phil Joanou, the director of the U2 concert film "Rattle and Hum," tied the knot in a ceremony that was rebroadcast from the stage every night of the band's last American tour. Last winter, three members of Def Leppard showed up at Graceland's door, one to get married and two to renew their vows. You don't have to be famous to get married at Graceland. Around 45 ceremonies are performed a week, a pace that seems to be frazzling Norm Jones, the Elvis impersonator in residence.
"I heard I was on MTV a couple weeks ago, but I haven't had time to watch," Mr. Jones said, escorting a newly wedded couple out the door as another pair arrived. "And Def Leppard asked me to play with them in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve, but things were so busy I couldn't get away."
Moving from camp to the visionary, the next stop is the Mirage, the 29-story, 3,000-room hotel-casino that Steve Wynn opened in 1989 in an attempt to do away with the sameness of the typical Las Vegas casino. At the Mirage, there is no garish neon outside, no shoebox layouts inside and no headdress-and-breast shows in the theater.
Off the casino, patrons can walk through a tropical rain forest stocked with 90-foot-high trees or admire almost two dozen white tigers kept behind glass in a roomy habitat. But the Mirage's best-known feature -- indeed the city's single most popular attraction -- is a throwback to old Las Vegas spectacles that sits in front of the hotel. There, Mr. Wynn built a 50-foot-high volcano that erupts every 15 minutes into a Gilligan's Island-style lagoon of grottos and waterfalls.
While the Mirage represents Las Vegas's future, the Strip's past can best be seen a block away at the recently shuttered Dunes. When it opened in 1955, the resort, topped by a 30-foot plexiglass sultan, was hailed as the world's most luxurious hotel. The hotel was, in fact, Las Vegas at its most vulgar: in 1957, the Dunes made history when it offered "Minsky's Goes to Paris," Las Vegas's first topless burlesque.
Last November, Mr. Wynn purchased the hotel and announced he planned to tear it down and build another project. The closed Dunes still stands, however, and by day, one can still make out the words on the darkened sign in front: "Las Vegas -- City of Change."
The most popular Las Vegas daytime attraction off the Strip is the Liberace Museum, a dizzying collection that includes every diamond-encrusted automobile, piano and hot-pants outfit used by "Mr. Showmanship." By night, the draw is the "Legends" show at the Imperial Palace, where the world's finest Neil Diamond impersonator gives way to a faux-Madonna who seems to dance even more fluidly than the original.
Among the most sought-after Las Vegas tickets for the self-consciously cool are those for high-profile boxing matches. For years, fans like Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, and Billy Crystal have come to the desert to watch the fights. Now, they have been joined ringside by a growing number of Hollywood's younger stars. "You have a group of young actors who aren't interested in boxing, but in the spectacle of a big championship match in Las Vegas," said Seth Abraham, president of HBO Sports. "It's sexy women, sexy jewelry, sexy entertainers, sexy names. Many of these younger people are voyeurs who want only to see -- and be seen."
The hottest ticket, week in and week out, remains Wayne Newton. His show at the Hilton retains all his favorite chestnuts, including "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" and "Mack the Knife." But also woven into the act are unexpected gems, ranging from a Sam Cooke medley to "Hard to Handle," the rhythm-and-blues classic that the Black Crowes turned into a big hit a few years ago.
After a recent show, Mr. Newton recalled once again his inspiration to shave his pencil-thin mustache, a decision he says he believes led directly to his current position as an icon of the Las Vegas arrivistes. "A convert," Mr. Newton said, shaking his head, "is the best audience you'll ever have."

HEADLINE: Conversations/Mark Winston Griffith;
Into the World of Banking Comes a Hip-Hop Credit Union

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
AS the president of the newest Federally chartered lending institution in New York City, Mark Winston Griffith cuts a striking figure across the gray and gritty blocks of central Brooklyn. Sporting natty dreadlocks and a loan officer's bright tie, the 30-year-old is a poet among community activists and an iconoclast among bankers.
"Bring the noise! We're 'bout to take it to ya face," he said concluding his speech at the April 17 opening of the Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union in the Bedford Stuyvesant community. 
 In January Mr. Griffith was part of a cadre of young black community activists to be granted a Government charter for the credit union. It was the first such charter granted under the Administration of President Bill Clinton, who has proposed the creation of more than 100 similar community development banks in impoverished American neighborhoods. The new lending institution opens amid widespread acknowledgement that commercial banks have been unable, and often unwilling, to provide adequate services to poorer neighborhoods in New York and other cities.
The credit union's organizers -- all schooled in political activism and the legacy of a civil rights movement that they now consign to the scrapbook of an earlier generation -- makes it quite clear they intend do things differently. With a level gaze, Mr. Griffith calls his not-for-profit financial services venture "the world's first hip-hop credit union."
If Mr. Griffith's language is obscure to the banking establishment, the community development strategy he embraces -- using existing law and political muscle -- is less so. Within three months of its inception, the new Federally insured Brooklyn credit union has received deposits and other commitments of financial support from Republic National Bank, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust Company, the Municipal Credit Union and others.
Nor is the Brooklyn venture unique. In a spurt of enterprise that experts say was a response to the riots in South-Central Los Angeles, credit unions set up solely to provide services in poor areas received Federal charters last year in Omaha, Denver and Los Angeles. Now, with the Clinton Administration's support, others are being planned.
 
A Credit Boomlet

 
 "Since the day after the election, we have all sensed a new atmosphere and things have greatly accelerated," said Clifford N. Rosenthal, executive director of the New York City-based National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, which advises such institutions. He said he expects six new charters over the next six months, paving the way for credit unions in Camden, N.J., Washington and other cities.
Mr. Griffith's credit union has so far raised $600,000 in deposits, a paltry sum compared to most commercial banks. But it hopes to attract at least $5 million, much of it to be used for personal loans and small business financing in Brooklyn.
"No other bankers could pull off what we are doing," Mr. Griffith added. "Our success is predicated on living in the neighborhood, being known by the people and being an organic part of this community."
Mr. Griffith, a graduate of Brown University who received a master's degree in Nigerian poetry from the University of Ibadan in Nigeria in 1988, was born in Bedford Stuyvesant. He lives across the street from the credit union's temporary quarters in a brownstone owned by his parents.
His co-founder is the credit union's treasurer, Errol T. Louis, a 30-year-old Harlem native and Harvard graduate who received a master's in political science from Yale and whose doctoral dissertation is on the role of credit in urban development. Mr. Louis is also an associate director of Mr. Rosenthal's credit union group.
"People in the traditional banking community question our background, but I am convinced it has helped," said Mr. Griffith, a former member of Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr.'s staff. "We do not represent business as usual, and we bring a certain freshness."
Both Mr. Griffith, whose mother is Jamaican-born, and Mr. Louis, whose grandparents emigrated from Trinidad, say their Caribbean ancestry has given them a greater understanding of the needs of the thousands of West Indian immigrants who have settled in Brooklyn since the mid-1970's.
Mr. Griffith and Mr. Louis began their efforts in 1991 after the failure of Freedom National Bank, New York City's largest minority-owned lender. A critical source of support has been the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which gives watchdog groups and others power to question the lending practices and service of commercial banks in poor neighborhoods. Under the law, which was strengthened in 1990, banks that fail to provide adequate service can be challenged when they seek regulatory approvals for mergers, new branches and other new business ventures. Most large lenders have responded by establishing new guidelines for loans and even hiring executives with political savvy in seeking out investments in economically depressed areas.
 
Penny on the Dollar
 Mr. Griffith and others first conducted a study comparing the amount of deposits large banks received from their neighborhood and the amount committed to the area in home loans. "For every dollar they took out of Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights, they gave back one penny in home lending," Mr. Louis said.
Armed with the potentially damaging data, and using his close ties to other activists, Mr. Griffith said he began a campaign of arm twisting and polite entreaties that attracted the support of big banks. "In a way, I suppose, we were political opportunists," he said, adding that his negotiations with the large banks "have often been like straddling the fence. I've had to play the tough guy, but also show them that we are reasonable people who can deliver the goods."
A strong working relationship with commercial banks is likely to be crucial to any success the embryonic Brooklyn credit union will have. So far most of the deposits have come from the larger Manhattan-based lenders.
At this stage no loans have as yet been made. "We are making arrangements to extend our own reach," he said. "We will be able to vouch for people in our community, and we think the commercial banks will respond."
Amid that unusual blend of allegiances -- to the poor streets of central Brooklyn and the board rooms of Manhattan banks -- Mr. Griffith said he had adopted a set of priorities that might not have seemed practical to black activists of past generations. "I don't think there needs to be a distinction between political energy, black empowerment and economic development," said Mr. Griffith, who is also executive director of the Central Brooklyn Partnership, a neighborhood housing and social service agency.
But what does hip-hop have to do with it?
"There is a new generational consciousness," Mr. Griffith said, adding that the economic development strategy he has adopted in central Brooklyn is as far removed from the civil rights protests of the the 1960's as hip-hop music is from the rock-and-roll ethos.
"The civil rights movement has died, its spirit passed, and we have to move to a different form," he said.

HEADLINE: Does the World Still Recognize a Holocaust?

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
LADY THATCHER, in her scorching indictment of Western inaction over Bosnia and Herzegovina two weeks ago, said: "I never thought I'd see another holocaust in my life." And then to her fellow Tory, Prime Minister John Major, she gave the unkindest cut of all. During the Battle of Britain the country was overwhelmed and inadequately prepared, she said, but at least it had "a Prime Minister with a lion heart." The implication was unmistakable: Mr. Major is no Churchill -- he is Neville Chamberlain.
Not for half a century has the world witnessed events in Europe that have stirred such an agonizing echo of past horrors. The television footage of houses reduced to rubble, the bombed-out churches and mosques, the lined-up bodies and mass graves -- they all evoke the flickering black-and-white newsreels of World War II. The words "genocide," "massacre," "holocaust," "civilian bombing" and "ethnic cleansing" haunt everyday speech and stir up guilt-ridden memories like smoke rising from a crematorium. 
 For European leaders and now, especially, the Clinton Administration, the ever-worsening events in what once was Yugoslavia throw up difficult questions: When does dithering negotiation turn into appeasement? Is it finally time for intervention?
Last week the questions were thrown into the sharpest relief by a letter from 12 State Department officials to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, telling him that the course of diplomacy followed so far had failed and urging him to advocate the use of military force to save the Muslims of eastern Bosnia. The stakes were larger than Bosnia alone, the letter said, because failure to take military action there, it said, "would teach would-be conquerors and ethnic bigots throughout the world that their crimes will go unpunished."
Throughout the conflict, the most compelling argument for not getting involved in the defense of Bosnia against Serbian nationalists has been that outside meddling might only raise the general level of suffering and death. But just in the last two weeks, Western suffrance for the Serbian nationalists has been strained more than ever as they relentlessly hammered Srebrenica to the point of submission. And there now seems less reason than ever to hope that the way to contain the evil let loose in the Balkans is to let the conflict just play itself out. Last week, even as Serbian ethnic cleansing went unpunished in the east, Croats and Muslims who had been nominal allies fell upon each other in spasms of their own ethnic cleansing, rending villages where Croats and Muslims had long lived side by side.
By coincidence last week, Poland commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising -- the insurrection against the Nazis by several hundred Jewish fighters that is the 20th century's most powerful example of heroic resistance against insurmountable odds. But it also carries a message of universal reproach, for during the uprising, which led to the razing of the ghetto and was a critical chapter in the extermination of Poland's Jews, the world stood by and did nothing. A parallel to ships filled with Jewish refugees searching for a harbor can be found today, when refugees from the fighting in Bosnia and Croatia are kept out of most European countries and form huge crowds outside embassies in Belgrade in hopeless quests for visas.
The point was made Thursday at the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, when Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize-winning author and survivor of the Holocaust, stopped talking about events of 50 years ago during his speech and said to President Clinton: "And Mr. President, I cannot not tell you something. I have been in the former Yugoslavia last fall. I cannot sleep since what I have seen. As a Jew I am saying that. We must do something to stop the bloodshed in that country." An ironic footnote to the opening of the museum came when Mr. Wiesel and Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, objected to an invitation to Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's President, pointing out that a 1988 book he wrote claimed that only 900,000 Jews, not six million, died in the Holocaust.
 
Grand Disillusionment
 Behind the guilt lies grand disillusionment, for the generations that grew up in the shadow of the Second World War came to terms with the concentration camps through an unspoken assumption that never again would evil of that magnitude be tolerated. Not war itself, which was perhaps unavoidable, but war waged ruthlessly against everyday civilians who are selected for slaughter solely on the basis of ethnicity or religion -- that would be ruled out of bounds for all time.
With the collapse of Communism, one hope was that the demise of superpower rivalry might allow foreign affairs to be conducted around a fulcrum of morality, with more focus on economic development, the conservation of resources and the discouragement of anti-democratic petty tyrants.
It has not worked out quite that way. In the matter of long-suppressed ethnic identities, it appears in retrospect, Communism acted as something of a hermetic seal. Once the seal was broken, acts of hatred and ethnic crimes from 40 years ago, when exploited by unscrupulous leaders, lose the distance of history and are experienced as if they happened yesterday.
Under Marshal Tito, the expression of ethnic sentiment in Yugoslavia was a crime. Memories of the ugly deeds of the Nazi state of Croatia, where thousands and thousands of Serbs perished in concentration camps, were suppressed. Mass graves were covered over by concrete. The recent opening of those graves by Serbs who carefully reburied the heaps of bone was not only an act of reverence for the dead. It also was a fanning of the flames of insecurity for Serbs who lived outside Serbia, in the Krajina area of Croatia.
Western diplomats based here agree that Serbs have every reason to recall their barbarous treatment at the hands of the Croatian Ustashe. They note that in the current conflict there is an ample record of atrocities on all sides -- Serbian, Muslim and Croatian. But they will also acknowledge that the prime mover of Yugoslavia's descent into chaos has been the engine of Serbian nationalism as driven by President Slobodan Milosevic. Its mission is to draw together the Serbs in other former republics of the now-defunct federation -- the "precani," meaning literally "the ones across the river."
 
Warnings
 The first alarm bells should have gone off six years ago when Mr. Milosevic took his now famous trip to Kosovo, the southern region that nurtured Serbian nationalism but where Albanians now constitute 90 percent of the population. Appearing before a crowd of thousands of Serbs, who were pushed back by police truncheons, he declared, "No one has the right to beat you!" The frenzied response taught him the power of the force at his disposal.
Several former ambassadors from European countries privately expressed frustration to Western journalists during the ensuing years. They said their cables to their home offices warning about the genie that Mr. Milosevic had freed from the bottle were being ignored. In 1991, the secession of Croatia and Slovenia precipitated the Serbian-Croatian war that turned, a year ago, into civil war in Bosnia. The Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia, now control about 70 percent of the territory.
The time for effective intervention, many people now argue, was in May or June of last year, when the Serbian siege of mostly Muslim Sarajevo was getting under way. It might have given pause to the Serbs before they felt the power of their own dominant position, before ethnic cleansing had advanced so drastically and while there still was a semblance of civil society in Sarajevo and cities like Mostar. Now, Mr. Milosevic is at the peak of his strength despite a trade embargo against Serbia that is almost a year old, a year of war in Bosnia and an on-again, off-again war with Croatia.
These days, with reports of atrocities continuing and nightly footage on international television of wounded and orphaned children, the pressure for some form of action to stop the slaughter is building. Once again, diplomats are contemplating the lesson of Chamberlain's umbrella: Move in quickly and stamp out the infection, because otherwise the pathology will spread exponentially.
 
Two Faces of the Facts of War
 FOR weeks now, the fate of Bosnia has seemed intertwined with the fate of one eastern town, Srebrenica. Perhaps 50,000 Muslims, including refugees and defenders, remain surrounded there by Serbs who had besieged and all but captured the town before a cease-fire was worked out by the United Nations. The truce put the town under U.N. protection to allow the disarming of the Muslims and some evacuations. At the climactic moment last weekend, when Srebrenica appeared on the brink of surrender following ferocious Serbian shelling, the newspaper readers of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and Belgrade, Serbia's capital, were offered radically different versions of the events. In these excerpts, Tanjug refers to the Yugoslav news agency; Republika Srpska is the name Serb nationalists give to their self-proclaimed government in Bosnia; Karadzic is Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs; Milosevic is President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and Mladic is Gen. Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, sometimes called Chetniks.
 
In Sarajevo
Tomorrow, a Canadian battalion serving with the United Nations Protection Force should enter Srebrenica as a result of negotiations between Lieut. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of the U.N. force, and the war criminal Karadzic. A Golgotha continues for the citizens of Srebrenica . . . Zlatko Lagumdzija, the Deputy Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has told the world that Mladic's army, that is Milosevic's army, has to be stopped, that the only thing that the aggressor army understands is force, and that the only way it can be stopped is by confronting it with a greater force. . . . The aggressor forces continued their offensive at Srebrenica throughout the day yesterday with undiminished intensity, and the people of the town continued to give a heroic account of themselves in resisting the attempt by the more numerous and better-armed attackers to penetrate the town's outskirts. Besides their push across the front lines, the Chetniks continued to use their heavy artillery to shell the center of Srebrenica, massacring civilians. During the morning hours alone, the Chetnik artillery killed six people and injured 15, including several children. In Tuzla . . . local and foreign reporters were presented with a transcript of an intercepted radio-telephone conversation between war criminal Mladic and the Chetnik commanders in the area . . . in which he ordered them to press their attacks so as to enter Srebrenica before he began his negotiations on a cease-fire.

In Belgrade
 In spite of the fact that the Muslim armed forces are facing a total military defeat, they again launched attacks this morning from various directions from the territory of Srebrenica. According to Tanjug reporting from this region, the Muslim units are using all their artillery and firing equipment. The Serbian sources say that Serbian defenders had tens of dead and wounded following attacks by Muslim forces which lasted for days. The army of the Republika Srpska was forced to respond strongly in a counterattack and it has reached strategically important peaks around Srebrenica. The Serbian lines are only about one kilometer by air from Srebrenica. Using the fact that the Serbian side is not undertaking any action against Srebrenica itself, the Muslim extremists continued to attack. During the morning the most severe attacks of the Muslims were launched on Ratkovic, Zeleni Jadar, Podravanje and Milici. According to Tanjug, the Serbian sources are reporting that Muslim soldiers have started surrendering arms yesterday. There were such individual cases in the region of Skelani, Bratunac, Derventa and Podravanje. The Muslim extremists are in a hopeless situation from the military point of view. They are still reluctant to surrender because they were the ones to destroy 56 Serbian villages near Srebrenica, Bratunac and Skelani and on several occasions have killed in a most brutal way more than 1,300 Serbs, mostly women, children and aged people.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The G.O.P. Can Win, But It Can't Gloat

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is something President Clinton and Senate Republicans seem to agree on. Both say it's not all that important that the Republicans killed his economic stimulus bill last week.
From the President, it was normal enough to say, as he did Friday, that "Everything has been passed except the stimulus program, so I think we're doing fine." Anybody who loses likes to think it didn't matter all that much. 
 But the motivations were a little more complicated when Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader, kissed off the event, saying that this defeat, "in the course of human events, is not but a flutter of a hummingbird wing near a honeysuckle."
Modesty was not his prime motive. Political tactics and realities mattered more. There were tactical reasons for him and other Republicans like the less poetic Bob Dole ("just a bump in the road for President Clinton") to play down their success.
First, they are dealing with a newly elected President whom the public wants to see succeed. They don't want to be seen as obstructing for the sake of obstruction. They went to great lengths to invent new definitions of "gridlock" and "filibuster" to avoid the public impression, as Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution put it, that they were "politicians getting their kicks by denying Clinton a vote on his package."
Second, they didn't need to brag. Newspapers and television stations had already made a major event of their blocking action on the President's $19.5 billion proposal.
Finally, despite the difficulties Mr. Clinton faces on issues from homosexuals in the armed forces to tax credits for investments and a new energy tax, the Republicans don't expect to beat him often.
They won't always want to beat him, either. Mr. Dole and Mr. Simpson are eager to help pass aid to Russia, for example. And even when they want to fight, the Democrats will sometimes pick off a few Republicans and get the 60 votes it takes to end debate. So Republican leaders have little interest in dressing themselves up as suddenly invincible, and thereby making the defeats they foresee seem startling.
The unity they achieved not only stunned the White House, which had not expected an all-out assault this early. It also surprised the Senate Republicans, especially since some of the most vociferous opponents of compromise included moderates who sometimes vote with the Democrats, senators like John Chafee of Rhode Island and John C. Danforth of Missouri.
 
Distracted by the House
 The Administration had been worrying more about the House, a simpler body with real rules, but one that needs attention anyhow. The Administration never got around to cultivating malleable Republicans beforehand, and it let G.O.P. resentments build up over everything from consultation on health care to Senator Robert C. Byrd's parliamentary tactics on the floor.
Mr. Dole skillfully molded those irritations into unity. Republicans reassured one another that if there is one thing they all agree on, it is opposition to increasing the deficit. That opposition seems considerably stronger now that a Democrat is in the White House.
The Clinton Administration was "schizophrenic," as one highly placed Administration aide put it, in trying to pry Republicans away. It alternated between quiet, serious approaches and lumbering denunciations, apparently unaware that nothing makes a senator seem more important and independent than being attacked by a President.
But the slickest Congressional liaison effort imaginable might not have been enough to break up that Republican coalition once it was formed against the $19.5 billion package. Mr. Clinton's offer to drop it to $15.4 billion found no Republican takers.
Then Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, could not get his colleagues to go along with an $8.7 billion proposal. They had more or less offered it when they left for spring break April 5, but when they returned after cheers from their constituents, they offered only a $6 billion plan, knowing the Democrats would not take it seriously.
In the end, only $4 billion, for extended unemployment benefits, survived.
Where can the Republicans take their opposition, and what can the Democrats do about it?
At one end of the spectrum there is the charge from House Democrats like Representative David Obey of Wisconsin that Republicans are trying "to keep as many dollars out of the economy as possible" and to "knock the sheen off Clinton" in order to see that the economy weakens by next year's elections.
And at the other end is the hope among some moderate Republican senators that after a month or so to cool off, a handful of Republicans can break ranks and let through a package of about $5 billion more for various obvious job-producing projects.
They may insist on its being "paid for," with compensating cuts in other programs. Even though such cuts weaken the stimulative effects of the spending, the Administration was willing to go along with some offsets last week and may accept more of them to get increased spending for summer youth jobs and accelerated highway spending.
Mr. Dole is likely to continue delaying most domestic measures on the floor for at least a day or two. He has done that for a couple of years, probing to see where Republicans seem ready for tough fights and where to back off. At the very least, delay diminishes the number of Democratic bills the Senate can consider.
But the spring legislative agenda is likely to offer fewer chances for all-out Republican filibusters. "We don't anticipate that our program is going to invite that kind of problem all the time," said Howard Paster, the chief White House lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
Legislation dealing with issues like education, apprenticeship and national service tends to attract some of the moderates who stood firm against the jobs bill. The Democratic senators who handle such measures, like Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, are accustomed to enlisting Republican allies before they take bills to the floor.
Moreover, Administration officials maintain that they are indeed alert to the need to seek out Republican help. If they weren't last month, they certainly have seen its importance demonstrated. Republicans sound hopeful. "He's going to need us and we're going to be there on things like Nafta and health care," said Mr. Chafee, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. "They haven't sought us out, but they will."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Nation's Capital Eagerly Awaits Urban Remedies

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE week before his inauguration, then President-elect Bill Clinton took a walk up Georgia Avenue, a stroll many saw as a symbolic outreach to the city of Washington and to its black population in particular.
The symbols have continued. Last week Janet Reno, the new head of the Justice Department, comforted students in a school in a Northwest Washington neighborhood plagued by a drive-by gunman. And Mr. Clinton named a native Washingtonian, Loretta Avent, as liaison to the local regional government council. 
 Mr. Clinton's attention to his urban neighorbhood bodes well for the District of Columbia, two-thirds of whose residents are black, and sends a signal that cities and urban affairs, largely neglected for the last 12 years, are once more a White House priority, if not yet the focus of fully defined policies.
The attention comes none too soon, in the view of many who have watched the urban agenda slip off the national scope during previous administrations. To them, the tensions in Los Angeles over the beating of Rodney G. King underscore the neglect that has turned American cities into powder kegs. Though tensions have been defused after the conviction last weekend of two of four Los Angeles police officers accused in the beating, they haven't been dispelled: a long list of pressing urban problems awaits Mr. Clinton.
Just how challenging getting to that agenda will be was illustrated last week when Senate Republicans killed Mr. Clinton's economic-stimulus package. The package contained a considerable amount of aid that would have benefited cities, including public works funds and money for summer jobs, and its defeat suggests how much more difficult it would be to get an urban legislative package through Congress even though a host of urban problems defines the wards abutting the seat of national power.
Prominent among the problems is crime, vividly illustrated most recently by the series of nighttime, drive-by shootings that left two people dead and terrorized Columbia Heights and surrounding neighborhoods before the arrest of a suspect last week. The shootings were another setback for a city struggling to rebuild an image damaged in recent years not only by social ills but by controversial administration under former Mayor Marion Barry (elected as a City Councilman last year in a political comeback following his 1990 drug conviction).
Yet its image notwithstanding, Washington is not particularly troubled in comparison with many cities. It is because the district offers examples of the problems plaguing many others -- but in relatively mild form, among a relatively small population of 700,000 people -- that it could make an ideal, easily observable testing ground for the Clinton urban policy makers who work and in many cases live there.
"The police department is per capita the largest in the nation," said Peter Reuter, an economist with the Rand Corporation who did a study on street drug dealers several years ago. "The criminal justice system by most standards operates relatively effectively. It's a fairly wealthy city. What is peculiar about it is the extraordinary homicide rate. It was moving along at about 200 a year and then suddenly, in the mid-80's it skyrocketed to around 450, and it hasn't gone down. And no one knows the reason."
 
An Urban Laboratory
 Even public schools in the District of Columbia, though not without problems, are not as severely troubled as perceptions suggest. Although President Clinton chose to send his daughter, Chelsea, to private school, city school students by many yardsticks match or exceed the national average in academic performance. And violence in schools is significantly lower than in most urban systems.
Washington nevertheless suffers from homelessness, crime, infant mortality, a declining middle class, a shrinking tax base, concentrations of low-income people, pollution, boarded-up public housing, a struggling public school system, job displacement and other ills. Washington is more than ever a city in which blacks and whites function after working hours in separate worlds, a pattern underscored by its housing, which shows it to be one of the 10 most residentially segregated cities in the nation. (The city's substantial numbers of affluent and middle-class blacks demonstrate, however, that this segregation does not always mean poverty.)
Even the longtime assumption that Washington was recession-proof in terms of jobs is proving erroneous. Despite the presence of the Federal government as a major employer, there is a growing disparity among its workers.
"It has all the problems of the new service economy and the split between highly paid people and poorly paid people," said Margaret M. Weir, an urban scholar with the Brookings Institution.
The fate of the District of Columbia has always seemed especially intertwined with national urban policy because it has long come under direct Federal oversight and responsibility.
The city, now governed by Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and a 13-member City Council, has the right to raise taxes, but still labors under restraints. Congress must approve its budget and can override any of the city's legislation. The city is often called "the last colony" because it is not independent and there has been a push for at least a decade for home rule.
 
Seeking Independence
 Many, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting Representative for the District of Columbia, think this is the best time to pressure Congress for statehood and are heartened by Mr. Clinton's apparent interest.
"I am so encouraged by the extent to which the President appears to identify with the district that I've written asking him to make the district a city in which he tries out his considerable ideas and models for restoring the urban agenda," she said.
For now, urban policy in the Clinton Administration has taken a back seat to its focus on the economy as a whole. Mr. Clinton has no urban legislative package yet, nor has Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, unveiled his plans for enterprise zones to develop inner city businesses. The Administration has already, however, proposed making permanent a tax credit for private developers of low-income housing, a step long advocated by housing advocates. The law, introduced as a temporary measure in 1986, was used in overhauling Washington's Whitelaw Hotel into a home for 35 low-income families.
And within Mr. Clinton's five-year budget blueprint unveiled this month are the broad outlines of how the President intends to remedy urban woes: tax incentives for small and inner-city businesses and higher outlays for job training and employment programs, housing assistance, food stamps, nutrition programs, early education for poor children, childhood immunizations and the like.
Still, budgetary and other constraints are already apparent, for example at HUD, which has sought billions of dollars in new spending just to continue housing the families it is now assisting, not to mention the growing numbers of needy renters.
Nonetheless, many see Mr. Clinton's gestures toward Washington as a harbinger of good for all the nation's cities.
"Even in the most symbolic way, his interest shows that he has a concern for cities all over the country," said Ms. Weir of Brookings. "It's important to change the symbols and the rhetoric because the predominant images of cities in the last decade have been so negative."

HEADLINE: China's Crackdown on Births: A Stunning, and Harsh, Success

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 24

 BODY:
She should be taking her 2-month-old baby out around the village now, proudly nursing him and teaching him about life. Instead, her baby is buried under a mound of dirt, and Li Qiuliang spends her time lying in bed, emotionally crushed and physically crippled.
The baby died because under China's complex quota system for births, local family planning officials wanted Ms. Li to give birth in 1992 rather than 1993. So on Dec. 30, when she was seven months pregnant, they took her to an unsanitary first-aid station and ordered the doctor to induce early labor. 
 Ms. Li's family pleaded. The doctor protested. But the family planning workers insisted. The result: The baby died after nine hours, and 23-year-old Ms. Li is incapacitated.
 
Lowest Fertility Ever
 That episode in Hunan Province, described in a classified Government report and confirmed by the local authorities, is one outgrowth of a major nationwide crackdown by the Chinese family planning authorities. While the crackdown has been under way for two years, information about it is only now emerging as the authorities release population statistics showing a stunning decline in the birth rate.
The latest data suggest that through compulsory sterilization and other measures, China has lowered fertility to by far its lowest level ever here. The statistics for 1992 -- showing many fewer babies even than during the harsh crackdowns of the early 1980's -- amazed population experts, for the family planners achieved targets that they had not expected to reach until the year 2010.
 
Problem for Clinton
 Ms. Li's persecutors had a reason for going to such extremes to enforce population quotas: they were protecting themselves under a new "responsibility system" that the Government has introduced as the mechanism for the crackdown. Under this system, central leaders hold local officials personally responsible for reducing births in their jurisdictions, and punish them for failing to do so.
The evidence of a far-reaching crackdown presents a direct challenge to the Clinton Administration. President Reagan had cut off United States financing of the United Nations Population Fund because of concerns that its work was intertwined with a coercive family planning program in China, but President Clinton announced last month that he would end the boycott.
Now the new evidence of a crackdown is likely to embarrass Mr. Clinton as he tries to restore funds to the United Nations program. Moreover, criticisms in the United States about forced sterilization in China are likely in turn to inflame Chinese sensitivities and could create new tensions in Chinese-American relations.
To be sure, some Chinese -- particularly city-dwellers -- support a tough family planning policy. They say the drop in fertility is helping to produce a historic economic boom and a rise in the nation's education and health standards.
By restricting couples to one or two children each, they say, the Government is helping to lead China out of poverty and into a modern, industrialized future. They note that one reason why China's long-term development prospects may be better than Bangladesh's or Kenya's is that Beijing appears to have defused its population bomb.
Peng Peiyun, the 64-year-old minister of the State Family Planning Commission, acknowledged in a rare news conference on Wednesday that it was mainly Government efforts that had brought down the birth rate.
"Why did fertility drop so drastically?" asked Ms. Peng, who two years ago persuaded the Politburo to order the crackdown. "Above all because party and Government officials at all levels paid greater attention to family planning and adopted more effective measures."
The indications of a drop in fertility come in a raft of statistics announced by Ms. Peng, printed in the official Population News or disclosed by Chinese officials. Among the figures are these:
*The birth rate dropped to 18.2 per 1,000 population in 1992, down from 21.1 in 1990 and 23.33 in 1987.
*Based on last year's birth data, each Chinese woman can expect to have an average of 1.8 or 1.9 children in her lifetime -- about the same as in the United States or Britain. China's total fertility rate, as this statistic is known, was 2.3 in 1990 and had never before dipped below 2. In contrast, the average Indian woman has 4 children.
*Only 9.6 percent of all births in 1992 were third, fourth or subsequent children. In 1988, the figure was 15.4 percent.
*The proportion of couples of child-bearing age who are sterilized or use contraception rose to 83.4 percent in 1992, up from 71.1 percent in 1988.
"It's what would be called saturation contraception in any other country," said Judith Banister, a specialist on China's population at the United States Bureau of the Census. "You can't get much higher than that."
China already has 1.17 billion inhabitants, 22 percent of the world's population on 7 percent of its arable land. Even at present fertility levels, the Chinese population will continue to soar because the age structure is very young and many Chinese have yet to enter their child-bearing years.
Some experts believe China's population will peak at almost 1.9 billion in the first half of the next century before stabilizing and then gradually declining again.
 
The Methods
Sterilization Made Efficient
 To Chinese peasants, who account for nearly one person in five on the planet, almost nothing is so important as bearing children, particularly sons. Many peasant couples feel that they have failed in life's mission, that they have dishonored their ancestors, if they do not extend the male line.
In the early 1980's, there was a storm of international protest when it became clear that the local authorities sometimes dragged women to abortion clinics if they did not have permission to become pregnant. Interviews in a dozen provinces in the last few years suggest that such use of physical force is now less common.
Instead, the focus of the crackdown has shifted to the more efficient method of compulsory, organized sterilization, so that women do not have the option of becoming pregnant again.
Typically, local cadres swoop down on each village once or twice a year, taking all the women who have already had children to a nearby clinic. There they are fitted with IUD's or else undergo sterilization.
Some women manage to get pregnant again before they are sterilized; others flee the village on the day they are supposed to go to the clinic. When the authorities discover an unauthorized pregnancy, they normally apply a daily dose of threats and brow-beating.
Some women buckle and accept an abortion, while many others simply flee to a relative's village, returning only after the child is born. In such cases, fines equivalent to hundreds or even thousands of dollars -- per capita income in the countryside last year was $135 -- are imposed. Peasants in many different provinces say homes are routinely knocked down if the fine is not paid.
 
Worst-Case Abuse
Local Officials Get Carried Away
 The report about Ms. Li, who is crippled after the induced labor, is an example of how local officials became carried away in the current crackdown. The three-page account, classified "secret," describes how Ningxiang County decreed in September that women should normally be allowed to give birth only after reaching the age of 24.
The problem for the local authorities was that they had already given some women "pregnancy permits" even though they were under 24. Some of these women were pregnant. Nine of them -- including Ms. Li -- would not give birth until 1993, the first full year in which the new age limit took effect.
"Some district and township officials feared that they would be fined for not meeting the family planning targets, or would not receive their bonuses," the report declares.
So at the end of December the family planning officials formed an "early birth shock brigade" to round up all nine women so labor could be induced. When the team showed up at Ms. Li's home, her mother-in-law pleaded with the officials.
"My daughter-in-law's health isn't good, and she may not be able to get pregnant again," the report quotes the woman as saying. "So let her have one baby, someone to look after her and my son when they grow old. It doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. After it's born, she'll go get sterilized."
The officials rejected the plea. And at the first-aid station, when the doctor said Ms. Li was too frail to undergo induced labor, they swept his protests aside and ordered him to proceed. She bled severely, fell unconscious and almost died along with the baby.
Her family took her to the township clinic, which saved her life. Now she has returned home, but the report says she is crippled, without specifying the nature of her injuries.
The report deplores the actions of the local officials and calls for Ms. Li to be compensated for her medical expenses. But a county officer, reached by telephone, said that so far nothing had been done, except that the officials responsible for the "early birth shock brigade" have been summoned to a meeting and told not to induce labor in the future.
 
The Motivations
Insistence On Meeting Targets
 In retrospect, it is now possible to piece together how the crackdown came about. Interviews with Chinese and foreign specialists, and examination of materials published in China, indicate that Ms. Peng and other senior officials became increasingly concerned in the late 1980's that enforcement was growing lax and that China would miss its targets.
In early 1991, Ms. Peng convinced Prime Minister Li Peng and the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, that the matter was urgent. The standing committee of the Politburo, the highest decision-making body, unanimously resolved to tighten family planning work.
Most important, the new "responsibility system" galvanized provincial leaders to pass warnings all the way down the chain of command: family planning targets had to be met! Otherwise, those in charge of the area would be fined or even dismissed.
A result was a 25 percent surge in the number of people sterilized in 1991, to 12.5 million. The number declined in 1992 to 6.5 million, apparently because most women of child-bearing age already had been sterilized by then.
The scope of the crackdown became visible only after the State Family Planning Commission released data from a sample survey conducted in October. The data for 1992 startled almost everyone.
"We were very surprised by these numbers," said Sterling D. Scruggs, the China director of the United Nations Population Fund. "We didn't expect statistics approaching these levels for several more years."
Western diplomats said they believed that a crackdown was the only plausible explanation for the new statistics. They said Ms. Peng herself seems willing to take credit for the drop in the birth rate.
 
The Missing Girls
Some Newborns Seem to Vanish
 One prime concern among demographers is that hundreds of thousands of newborn Chinese girls seem to vanish from the statistics each year. Biology dictates that for every hundred female births there should be about 105 or 106 male births. But in 1989 for every 100 reported girl births, there were 113.8 births of boys.
That ratio implies that about 8 percent of newborn girls appear to have vanished from the statistics. In China that amounts to 900,000 missing girls each year.
Ms. Peng refused to release the sex ratio in 1992. An aide in charge of statistics, Zhang Erli, said the 1992 survey did not collect such information.
In fact, experts say the survey did gather the data and found a sex ratio of 118.5. But the sample size was small and the margin of error very high, so it is not clear how meaningful the difference is.
Zeng Yi, a leading Chinese demographer, said that the problem of the missing girls is very serious but that most of them are probably alive and never reported to the authorities. Parents who are allowed only one or two children may not want to use up their limited ration on a girl; instead they do not report the birth and try again.
A second factor, according to Mr. Zeng and many other experts, is the growing use of ultrasound equipment in Chinese hospitals. Peasants find out from the doctor -- usually with a small bribe -- whether a fetus is male or female. If it is female, they get an abortion and start all over.
A final factor, which Mr. Zeng argues is much rarer, is simply infanticide: on instructions from the parents, the midwife keeps a bucket of water beside her, and if a girl emerges, she drowns the baby immediately. It is reported as a stillbirth.
Mr. Zeng and other Chinese experts deplore all such practices. But ultrasound equipment is spreading rapidly, and so many specialists fear that the sex ratio is likely to become increasingly skewed.
Mr. Zeng cautioned that part of the apparent decline in fertility may simply be the result of under-reporting, particularly of girls. The figures were already adjusted upward by 7 percent to compensate for under-reporting, but Mr. Zeng believes that may not have been enough.
To some diplomats, what the new statistics underscore above all else is how little is known of what happens the Chinese countryside.
"We had almost no idea that this was going on," a Western diplomat said, shaking his head in perplexity. "Even those who follow these things just had no clue."

HEADLINE: Bagels Are Now Fast Food, And Purists Do a Slow Boil

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
The bagel, that chubby, chewy staple of New York life, has rolled across the country. First, it took over the frozen-food counters of supermarkets, then made its way onto menus at McDonald's and Burger King. Now, it has started pushing aside muffin and croissant stores in malls everywhere.
"The fast-food industry is always looking for the next hamburger, and right now the smart money is riding on bagels," said Steven Finn, the president of Bruegger's Bagels, a chain of 65 bagel stores whose headquarters are in Burlington, Vt. 
 This proliferation should be good news to bagel junkies, who have bemoaned the scarcity of the chewy rolls west of the Hudson. Instead, they are incensed. In their eyes, the integrity of the bagel has been undermined.
 
'No Character'
 "Increasing numbers of bagels resemble dinner rolls," said Nach Waxman, owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters, a cookbook store in Manhattan. "It's an outrage. No crust, no character, no nothing."
Buoyed by its healthful, low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature, as well as its accessibility and relatively low cost, the bagel is poised for its own Horatio Alger story. While precise sales figures are difficult to calculate, Ron Wirtz, a researcher for the American Institute of Baking in Manhattan, Kan., estimates that Americans consumed fewer than a half-million bagels in 1962 but more than five million last year.
"The bagelry is your new pizzeria," said John DePalo, manager of Bagel Oasis, an old-fashioned bagel bakery in Queens. "We used to be one of the only games in town. Now there's a bagel shop in every neighborhood."
Some aficionados have come to accept the industrialization of the bagel, which was previously shaped by hand and boiled in a kettle before baking. "The reformulating that mass-marketing requires does toy with perfection," said Marilyn Bagel, author of "The Bagel Bible" (Globe Pequot, 1992), which she wrote with her husband, Tom Bagel. (Bagel is their real name.) But she added that the softer texture and diminished crust that is characteristic of mass-produced bagels must be weighed against the increasing accessibility of her favored bread.
Still, the sociological and economic factors that inspired the soaring popularity of bagels make her fear the future. Bagels, she whispered, could become a new Wonder bread.
George Rosenbaum, who analyzes food trends for the Leo J. Shapiro Company in Chicago, said her concern was well grounded. "A bagel is a doughnut with the sin removed," he said. "If you can become a doughnut, or a doughnut proxy in the fast-food market, you are no longer an ethnic food. You are as American as pizza."
Bagelites perish the thought. The object of their desire has long been called "a cement doughnut," and purists relish the characteristics that make this a well-earned title.
 
A Royal Thank-You
 It's believed that bagels were invented by a Jewish baker in Vienna in 1683. To thank King John III Sobieski of Poland for saving the city from Turkish invaders, the anonymous baker crafted a hard roll in the shape of a riding stirrup, in honor of the king's favorite hobby. The bread's original name was "bugel," from the German for stirrup.
After the bread spread to Jewish communities throughout Eastern Europe, its name evolved, but its formulation -- a thrifty and unembellished blend of yeast, malt syrup and flour -- remained unchanged for three centuries. After being brought to America by Jewish immigrants in the early 20th century, the recipe was fiercely safeguarded by Bagel Bakers Local 338, a union of 300 workers based in New York City. By limiting admission to sons of members, the union insured perpetuation of the time-honored technique -- and a perpetual shortage of the bread.
"My father ran a bakery in Brooklyn, but he never made a bagel because he couldn't get into the union, and they would have broken his legs if he made bagels without being in the union," said Michael Yoss, who owns Royal Bagel in Atlanta. Bagel Bakers Local 338, Mr. Yoss said, was to the floury, steamy world of bagels what Jimmy Hoffa's teamsters were to the road.
 
The Machine Age Dawns
 The closed shop, with its closely held bagel secrets, wasn't broken until the early 1960's, when Dan Thompson, the Canadian scion of a European bagel baker, introduced the Thompson Bagel Machine, which rolls and shapes bagels. This innovation reduced the dependence on union bagel makers -- the union is no longer active -- and paved the way for mass production.
"The machine rolls 200 to 400 dozen bagels an hour," Mr. Thompson said from the Los Angeles headquarters of the Thompson Bagel Machine Manufacturing Corporation. "You used to have two guys hand-shaping and boiling and baking who could turn out maybe 120 bagels an hour. With the machine and now the new ovens, I have one baker putting out 400 bagels an hour."
Officials in the industry agree that Lender's Bagels, a bakery opened in 1927 by a Polish immigrant, Harry Lender, in New Haven, turned "bagel" into a household word. In 1962, he began using the Thompson machine and getting his packaged, frozen rolls into grocery stores nationwide. The proliferation of the machine paralleled the slow spread of bagel savvy.
 
How Much Is That . . . ?
 In fact, as late as 1974, when Mr. Yoss first put a sign in his Atlanta window advertising bagels, "people would come by to talk about dogs," he said, because "They thought we were opening a beagle kennel."
Mr. Thompson estimates that there are 200,000 of his machines in operation. Other companies have introduced ovens that steam and bake the bagels, eliminating, in many bakeries, the traditional boiling kettle. Although the steam ovens are more efficient, they are the nadir of Old Bagledom.
"Steam! Industrial Steam!" Mr. Waxman, the New York bookstore owner, said. "That's what's making all these soft bagels. Mushy! No crust! Nothing more than dinner rolls!"
But others say industrial innovations have improved bagels. "The cement doughnut was extremely chewy and dense," said Mr. Wirtz of the baking institute. "But it was limited. All you could do was eat it.
"The softer bagels are more versatile. You can make sandwiches out of them, little pizzas, even slice them and bake them to eat like taco chips."
In the trade, he said, the softer, steamed bagel is called a California-style or sandwich bagel -- and it is a runaway success.
But no American success story would be complete without pathos and nostalgia. Like the affluent parent recounting his childhood trek through snow to school, the typical Old Bagelite recalls the halcyon era of cement blocks, embellished with nothing more than a "shmeer" of cream cheese.
 
Symbolic of Society
 To these traditionalists, the softness of modern bagels is a metaphor for modern society. California bagels, they say, are not merely emblematic of fading connoisseurship, but also represent a significant and worrisome shift in political and economic life that should be redressed legally.
The demise of the traditional-bagel way of life has been furthered by additional ingredients that make the counters of slick, new bagel shops resemble those of Ben & Jerry's. Spot Bagel in Seattle offers blueberry swirls. The Bagel and Bagel shops in the Kansas City area cannot bake enough whole-wheat honey bagels. Raisin and cinnamon bagels, egg bagels. Even cheddar cheese bagels are becoming common.
But Mr. Waxman said innocent citizens should be protected. "This kind of perversity," he proclaimed, "should be prohibited by law."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Amid Setbacks, Clinton Team Seeks to Shake Off the Blues

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN with MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
At the White House meeting on Tuesday, the chief of staff tried to cheer up the Clinton team. Sure, President Clinton was having some problems, Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty 3d told the group, but Ronald Reagan's poll ratings also dropped after his first few months in office and it was only when he got shot that his popularity soared.
"Ah, Mack, what are you suggesting here?" deadpanned Rahm Emanuel, the political director, as the room broke up in laughter. "Things aren't that bad." 
 Black humor and a hint of paranoia were the fashion at the White House this week, as the President and his staff tried to pull themselves out of their first big slump. Seared by criticism about his judgment and political savvy in dealing with his economic stimulus package, Congress, Bosnia, the Branch Davidians and the gay march in Washington this weekend, the President summoned his top staff members for a "jam session" on Friday to evaluate where the Administration is headed, and he held a news conference in which he acknowledged he had "misgauged" some things.
"I hope that I can learn something," Mr. Clinton added. "I've just been here 90 days."
 
Low Approval Ratings
 Indeed, the young, energetic team that so relentlessly controlled the agenda during the Presidential campaign has lost focus on its central economic message. The laser is looking more like a strobe light, and youthful idealism is looking more like inexperience.
His job approval ratings, just under 50 percent in several national polls, are worse than any other modern President's at this point in a Presidency.
By the end of the week, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, had a battered look about him and a bristling tone.
Asked why the Administration seemed a little wobbly lately, he replied: "On the campaign trail, you can just change the subject. But you can't just change the subject as President. You can't wish Bosnia away. You can't wish Boris Yeltsin's troubles away. You can't wish David Koresh away. You can't just ignore them and change the subject."
Others in the West Wing were taking more of a this-too-will-pass attitude. Mark D. Gearan, the deputy chief of staff, said with a smile that he knew that the White House had done a poor sales job on the stimulus package when a sympathetic Congressman began talking to him about "the stimulation package."
But while the Washington chatterers are chattering about how the Clinton team has lost its focus, in a way, the President himself -- with his master strokes and miscalculations, his good days and bad -- may actually be coming into focus.
 
Comparison With Bush
 Unlike Mr. Bush, who began his Presidency with the politics of minimalism and few stated goals, Mr. Clinton is trying to lasso the moon. And unlike George Bush, whose personality was more straightforward and transparent, Bill Clinton offers a complicated, contradictory portrait, vexing at times to allies and foes alike.
Although the Clinton team came into office saying it intended to emulate the concentrated, hard sell that Ronald Reagan used on his economic plan, some top officials now privately admit they are falling into the Jimmy Carter syndrome of a laundry-list Presidency.
"We're trying to do too much at once," worried one of the President's closest friends in the Government. "We've laid the intellectual framework for all sorts of major initiatives -- national service, welfare reform, campaign finance, the budget, health care -- but we don't quite have the political strategy to implement them. When you have so much out there, it makes it easy for the Republicans to define it as just more Democratic spend-spend-spend."
Edward J. Rollins, who worked on selling President Reagan's tax cut, agreed: "Clinton is a good communicator but he's all over the map."
 
Undisciplined Style
 While Mr. Clinton intellectually understands the virtue of a clear, simple agenda, he cannot contain himself, aides say. He has an undisciplined personal style, a desire to please all sides, a mind stuffed with 30 years of policy ideas he wants to try, and a party full of clamoring interest groups who think that this is their moment.
"I think there is a tension in Clinton between the student of Presidential power and the student of policy," said Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard University political theorist. "As a student of the Presidency, he knows he should keep it simple, but as a student of policy he can't. The risk is that he knows too much. Reagan did not have that problem. For Reagan, a thematic Presidency was easy because he did not know very much. All he had were broad themes on three-by-five cards. Clinton has a CD-ROM in his head."
There is still a sense that the American people really want Mr. Clinton to succeed and support his basic direction on the economy and health care, although the polls also reflect a slight erosion of trust.
"The guy in the street is hearing about an energy tax, a regressive tax, a value added tax, some taxes they've never even heard of before and don't understand," said Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming.
 
'Blips' and 'Bumps'
 Although White House officials did their best to diminish recent miscalculations, referring to the defeat of the stimulus package by rejuvenated Republicans and the disaster with the Branch Davidians as "blips" and "bumps," these events have offered a glimpse into the President's contradictory impulses and operating style.
For instance, Mr. Clinton has managed to get his biggest domestic and foreign policy initiatives through Congress in record time: a $1.5 trillion budget outline with unprecedented deficit cuts and unprecedented new aid for Russia. But at the same time he bungled his $15 billion jobs bill and has been casting about elsewhere for a single success in foreign policy.
His aides present him as a master of detail and student of history. Yet, in the Branch Davidian affair, he ignored the first lesson learned by his idol, John F. Kennedy, who felt he had made a mistake in leaving the Bay of Pigs attack on Cuba in 1961 to the experts. Mr. Clinton devoted only 15 minutes on the phone to Attorney General Janet Reno's suggestion that they use tear gas to force the Branch Davidians out of their compound near Waco, Tex. He never explored the details of the plan or other options, entrusting the decision to an Attorney General in office only six weeks and an Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations whom many believe he would like to force out.
While Mr. Clinton has shown boldness in tackling budget deficits and health care, issues sidestepped by a succession of Presidents, he has also shown flashes of his campaign problem of ducking responsibility for his words and actions.
 
Decision to Break Silence
 Mr. Clinton was silent for almost a day as Ms. Reno was left to answer to the public, uttering the phrase made famous by a Democratic President: "The buck stops here." Only after an internal debate did the President come out and take responsibility.
Even now, though, White House officials insist that Mr. Clinton made no mistake, that polls show the American people supported his decision and that it is simply a problem of perception by opinion elites.
"Fundamentally, we are not as cynical as you think," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "The President was not ducking anything. He was letting Janet Reno do her job."
In reality, though, while the White House painted anyone who questioned the President's handling of the Branch Davidians as cynical, it was pure political calculus that motivated aides to advise Mr. Clinton not to go on camera for 24 hours.
Whatever their wider resonance, such incidents nevertheless have the potential to reinforce certain character doubts about the President with key constituencies. Like President Bush, Mr. Clinton came into office with question marks about his ability to be tough in a crisis. Mr. Bush dispelled such doubts with his showdown with Saddam Hussein. But Mr. Clinton has yet to erase them, particularly with his own Pentagon.
 
Military Emotions
 Last Tuesday, there was a goodbye party at the Pentagon for Lieut. Gen. Martin L. Brandtner, the popular director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All the Pentagon's top brass turned out, as well as former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
After introducing everyone on the dais, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, turned to Mr. Cheney, who was sitting in the front row, and said with a twinkle in his eye, "Welcome back, boss."
With that, the audience of military officers and Pentagon employees erupted with applause that went on and on. As one Pentagon official recalled, the reception for Mr. Cheney was both "touching and telling, like striking a match to dry tinder."
In some ways Mr. Clinton is a victim of his own political skills. His ability to charm and connect with people is so potent that they come away feeling that he sees the world just as they do. But, as one aide put it, "they don't always hear the fine print" (which is sometimes hard to find). Then when Mr. Clinton strikes the inevitable political bargain, people feel betrayed.
 
What's in the Fine Print
 It was striking that after Mr. Clinton met with leaders of gay and lesbian organizations at the White House nine days ago, they emerged from the meeting glowing. But many of those who got only a second-hand report felt that Mr. Clinton was backing away from his support for the organizations' goals and should have at least stayed in Washington on Sunday for the gay march.
As David Mixner, a Los Angeles consultant and longtime Clinton friend, told the Sacramento News and Review: "He has wonderful instincts, but we've seen that he must be constantly pressured."
White House officials are privately fuming that the interest groups that had helped to elect Mr. Clinton will not practice more patience.
"The gays are crazy to go after him now," a Presidential aide said. "They should just sit back and let him get his feet on the ground and work quietly with him."
 
Problem With Idealism
 Such is the fate of any politician who infuses his campaign with starry idealism. After President Kennedy's first year, James Reston, the New York Times columnist, wrote that the magic was gone. The sense of "great perspectives ahead," he said, were "outdistanced by events; not that there is no momentum but that it is not fast enough to keep up with the pace of history at home and abroad."
Now it is the teen-ager who once shook President Kennedy's hand who wrestles with that balance between pragmatism and idealism.
The conservatives have already begun their Cassandra chorus, warning that the President is just "a baby-boomer version of George Bush," as one puts it, who has been willing to compromise on any principle and goal. But those who work with Mr. Clinton every day say he is inspiring because, while he will cut deals where he has to, or disappoint constituencies when he needs to, he has his eye on the prize.
"The real test is that at the core of everything he does, he is pushing a really pervasive set of changes that are embodied in the budget," said Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary.
Mr. Babbitt found himself publicly undermined when the President decided to cut a deal with Western senators on grazing and mining fees to win their votes for the budget. But Mr. Babbitt now says it was merely a tactical change.
"The President hasn't put any gag on me," he said. "After I was on the floor and took that pounding, he said: 'Look, dust yourself off, get back up and keep after it. We will still get it done.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Asked to Control Prices of Drugs It Develops

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
With health costs continuing to soar, some economists and health-care experts think the Government should try to restrain prices on a costly group of drugs over which it has some nominal authority. These are drugs developed by Federal researchers but marketed by pharmaceutical companies.
These experts argue that the companies, in marketing drugs the Government discovers, should be required to charge no more than a "fair" price, as called for in contracts they sign. And they say that when the Government pays for research on drugs owned by private companies, the price of the drugs should reflect the public's investment. A thorny issue, however, is who should determine what a fair price is and how. 
 Dr. Alan Garber, an economist and internist at Stanford University, said the public paid twice when drugs were developed with generous help from the Federal Government. It paid first for research and development, he noted, and then again to buy the drugs.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads a House health subcommittee, is planning hearings on the issue soon. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is preparing a policy statement.
 
Treatment at $300,000 Yearly
 Critics of the current policy complain, for example, that Ceredase, a drug used to treat a rare inherited disorder, Gaucher's disease, which causes anemia and severe bone pain, can cost $300,000 a year. Yet the drug was discovered and developed by Federal scientists and academic researchers supported by Federal grants before it was turned over to a small Boston company, Genzyme, to market.
Genzyme said the high cost reflected the expense of making the drug, which is extracted from human placenta.
Another drug, levamisole, which was marketed for years to cure sheep of worm infestations, has turned out to be a stunning success in treating colon cancer. The studies that determined its effectiveness against cancer were conducted entirely by Government scientists.
But Johnson & Johnson, which markets both versions of the drug, charges a hundred times as much for the human version as it does for the identical drug for sheep. The drug costs cancer patients an average of $1,200 a year.
Johnson & Johnson points to the extra cost of training doctors to use levamisole as a reason for the higher price for the human version.
 
Companies See Justification
 Representatives of major drug companies were unanimous in asserting that the present system for setting drug prices was necessary to cover the high costs of research on new drugs and of training doctors in their use. The companies say that if the Federal Government controlled the prices of the drug it paid to develop valuable drugs might never come to market and others might be delayed.
The National Institutes of Health, in accord with its mission to discover new therapies and speed them to the market, invites pharmaceutical companies to market the drugs. The agency awards exclusive licenses for the drugs based on criteria like the company's manufacturing ability and speed of delivery. The price the company will charge is not considered.
The agency also invests heavily in developing drugs already owned by pharmaceutical companies. The system provides strong incentives for the companies to bring important new drugs to the market but few incentives to hold down the prices.
"Everyone feels these prices are just too high," Dr. Bernadine Healy, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a recent interview. "That's an appropriate response. But then you have to step back and say, 'What can we do about it without wrecking a very important system?' The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is the envy of the world."
 
A Doctor's Outrage
 In the case of levamisole, Dr. Charles Moertel, a cancer researcher at the Mayo Clinic, protested that the drug's development "was paid for just about in full by the American taxpayer." Dr. Moertel said he was outraged when he was told by a scientist working with a Johnson & Johnson affiliate that the drug would be marketed in Europe at a price "considerably lower than in the U.S."
"It just infuriated me," said Dr. Moertel, who argues that the Government should control prices of the drugs it helps develop. "It is so unfair. To put this burden on American cancer patients when our country paid the bill in full for development and to give Europe a bargain just sent me up a tree."
Robert Kniffen, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, said that the company deserved credit for discovering the drug and that the price of the human version had to include the cost of training doctors in its use.
Dr. Moertel and other critics dismiss the training costs as advertising and promotion.
 
U.S. Hand in Important Drugs
 According to a study by James Love of the Center for the Study of Responsive Law, a public interest group founded by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the majority of what the Food and Drug Administration deemed the most important and innovative drugs coming to the market in 1990 and 1991 were developed with substantial help from the National Institutes of Health.
The study also found that 34 of 37 cancer drugs that have come on the market since 1955, when the National Cancer Institute began its intensive search for such drugs, were developed with significant Federal financing.
Dr. John Beary, who is senior vice president for science and technology at the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said most of the drugs that Mr. Love cited were for treating AIDS and cancer, for which the Government has special programs to develop drugs, and rare diseases.
Drugs that benefit only a small number of patients are less important to drug companies, Dr. Beary said. For that reason, companies and the public "expect a lot of Government interest and a lot of Government support" for those drugs, he said.
 
Fair-Price Clause a Reaction
 Since 1989, the National Institutes of Health has inserted a clause in its contracts with pharmaceutical companies that requires them to charge a "fair" price for the drugs they develop with the Government. This clause, Dr. Healy said, was a reaction to outrage on the part of the institute's scientists at the price of AZT, the primary drug for combatting AIDS, which was discovered at the National Cancer Institute.
Burroughs Wellcome, which marketed the drug, initially set its price at about $10,000 a year per patient. The recommended dose of AZT has since been reduced, as has its price, so that it now cost a patient about $3,000 a year.
It is this fair-price clause that some health experts are suggesting the Government enforce to reduce drug prices. But Dr. Healy said the National Institutes of Health had no way to ascertain whether a price was fair and no way to enforce a fair price even if it knew what one was. Dr. Healy, who is leaving as director of the health institutes on June 1, said the agency, in view of its mission, was not even the appropriate one to enforce fair pricing.
Other Government experts agree. Dr. Michael Gluck, a senior analysts at the Office of Technology Assessment, said his agency had concluded that the National Institutes of Health "had neither the legal authority nor any true procedure or perhaps even the incentive to implement that policy as it needs to be implemented."
But an advocate of Government enforcement of the fair-price concept, Peter S. Arno, a health economist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, said he had a possible solution. He said companies that enter into cooperative agreements with the Federal Government should be required to open their books, allowing economists to decide whether the price of the drugs was fair.
"A monopoly is not a gift," he said. "It is a social privilege. We confer it for the sole aim of stimulating innovation. But if the innovation is by Government scientists and paid for by the taxpayer dollars, where's the drug company's innovation?"
 
Better Investment Return
 A different approach suggested by some health-care experts, among them Dr. Gluck, is to drop the notion of a fair price and focus on having the Government get a better return on its investment in drugs.
Instead of handing out licenses to market its drugs, the health institutes could, for example, hold an auction or charge higher royalties. Although the Federal Government can ask for royalties when it grants licenses to drug companies, it has received very little from such royalties, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
From 1981 until 1990, for example, the Government collected $26 million in royalties, of which $22.6 million was from two licenses. These were for the test for detecting antibodies to the virus that causes AIDS and the hepatitis B vaccine. In 1990, the health institutes collected $5.84 million from its patents, which was less than four-tenths of 1 percent of the amount it spent on research and development by its own scientists.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Policy Makers Debate, States Move Ahead on Health Care Overhaul

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
The governors and legislatures of the 50 states are not waiting for the Clinton Administration to find a fresh approach to health care.
Squeezed between rising demands for care and soaring costs, and fearful that Congress will act too slowly or wrongheadedly on whatever the President finally recommends next month, states are determined to go ahead on their own to improve matters. 
 "The health care crisis out in the states is so pressing that we can't wait any longer to see what the Federal Government is going to do, if anything," said Casper R. Taylor Jr., the leading advocate for an overhaul of the health care system in the Maryland Legislature, where he is a delegate. "A lot of individuals can't afford care. The cost of providing care to workers is breaking some of our businesses. Other state needs are being neglected because of the health care budget. The heat is on."
Like President Clinton, the states intend to insure a minimum level of coverage for all and to halt the steep climb in medical costs. But there is no unanimity on how to reach the goal and no guarantee that every state program will mesh with the package that eventually emerges from Congress.
 
Variety of Approaches
 The President has indicated he favors a mix of price competition and regulation. The states are taking varied, piecemeal approaches that in many cases are in the trial stage. Some have proposed programs but have not yet arranged financing for them. A number of states are trying to expand coverage to the poor and children and to control doctor and hospital fees. Others are trying to regulate insurance costs, mandate benefits, limit malpractice suits and revamp Medicaid.
Still others are pushing preventive care, eliminating duplication and unnecessary procedures and are seeking ways to slash administrative costs.
Hawaii has already made insurance available to almost all its residents. Several other states, including Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont and, most recently, Florida have enacted varying programs intended to provide universal coverage. And just Friday, the Washington State Legislature approved a plan that would phase in basic coverage for all residents by 1997.
Several states, most recently Maryland, have enacted insurance regulations intended to end discrimination against the aged and those who are chronically ill. Several other states, with Maryland again being the latest, have also adopted rules intended to hold down doctor fees and limit malpractice suits.
 
Success in Maryland
 Maryland successfully put caps on hospital costs a decade ago, and several other states are now trying to impose similar caps.
Many states are trying various strategies to hold down Medicaid costs, the most burdensome medical load. Tennessee recently proposed hiring private contractors to run its program.
New York has been a leader in state efforts to hold down administrative costs, developing a standard, simplified claim form.
For the most part, states are driven by their need to control health care budgets, which are rising 15 percent to 20 percent annually, mostly reflecting their share of ballooning Medicaid costs.
On average, one of every five tax dollars collected by state governments goes for health care, as against one in seven dollars at the national level.
The states know they risk being undercut by Clinton health care initiatives and mandates. But they hope the Administration will be flexible and let many of their efforts stand.
 
State Must Take Action
 Still, state officials say they have no intention of halting their efforts and waiting for action by the President. They contend that they must do something now or face bankruptcy, since unlike the Federal Government, states must have balanced budgets.
"We just can't wait," Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida declared recently.
Besides, state officials add, the harder that states push for change, the more influence they are likely to have on the Federal debate and the more likely they will be able to meet new Federal mandates on schedule.
The Clinton Administration has not tried to discourage innovation, and in fact, officials say they are taking a close look at state programs as possible models for a national overhaul. They are also studying the political alignments in the states, hoping to prepare for the battle on Capitol Hill.
"There's a lot to look at, and we're looking," said John Hart, a White House aide who specializes in state-Federal relations, especially health care issues.
 
Support for Managed Care
 The National Governors' Association, whose support could be important to Mr. Clinton, recently endorsed the managed-competition concept of health care that the President frequently mentions. Under this concept, the Government would help individuals and businesses in a particular area form a single health care purchasing pool that would buy fixed packages of benefits from networks of doctors and hospitals in the area.
But whether or not managed competition ends up as one of the main components of Mr. Clinton's plan, state officials say they should be given great flexibility and extra Federal money to meet new Federal mandates. In the past, they say, Washington has been too restrictive and too parsimonious in dealing with the states on health care, particularly when it comes to highly expensive plans, like Medicaid, in which the states are responsible for part of the cost but the Federal Government sets the standards and rules.
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, the vice chairman of the governors' association, emphasized the need for flexibility and Federal-state cooperation during the group's annual winter meeting a few weeks ago. The meeting was dominated by health care and featured a talk on the subject by President Clinton, who promised flexibility.
 
Ex-Governor as President
 "I'm going to do everything I can to work with you," Mr. Clinton said, adding that as a former Governor he was aware that the health care crisis was "threatening to bankrupt many of you."
Congressional leaders have also called for flexibility. "We do need comprehensive reform, but that should not be an impediment to state action," Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said when he addressed the governors shortly before the President spoke.
And many states are pushing ahead on their own.
Maryland's new package, passed early this month, contains provisions to slow rising doctor fees and insurance premiums. It also includes reins on malpractice suits and controls on insurers who cancel policies of the seriously ill or flatly deny them coverage.
A week before the Maryland plan was enacted, Florida adopted a sweeping health plan intended to guarantee care for all Floridians, mainly through managed competition.
"We would like to be able to chart the way for the Federal Government," Governor Chiles said.
But like officials in Maryland and in most other states that have recently enacted health care programs, Mr. Chiles was unable to say when his plan might take full effect. Nor was he able to put a dollar figure on the savings expected from it, though he said the plan would eventually free up money for other state social programs.
"We've got to stop the spiraling increases, and then we'll talk about savings," Mr. Chiles said when the plan passed.
At least a dozen other legislatures are working on health care proposals, and more and more governors are speaking out.
 
Burden of Medicaid
 In Tennessee, Gov. Ned McWherter said the burden of helping to pay for Medicaid and of meeting all Federal mandates had become too onerous, a common complaint by states. Mr. McWherter wants to stop taking part in the program and, with the help of Federal support, to contract out care of the poor to monitored private groups of doctors and hospitals.
In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has suggested that his legislature consider capping doctor fees and setting up regional health care networks in which community leaders, hospitals and doctors would work together to control costs, a variation of managed competition.
"We must do all that we can for ourselves while we await something better from Washington," Mr. Cuomo said. Besides, he suggested, such action might influence the debate in Washington.
Although many state health care programs are new or have not yet been started, some have been around long enough to be judged.
Among the notable successes is Maryland's decade-old effort to slow increases in hospital costs. A specially drawn package of regulations and caps has cut the annual rise in the state to less than half the rise nationwide.
In Hawaii, the first state to mandate universal access to health care and to back it up with money and regulation, 98 percent of the people are covered, compared with 85 percent nationally.
But there have been failures, too.
A few years ago, Massachusetts passed a broad "pay or play" plan that required employers to pay into a fund to provide insurance for their workers if they did not arrange their own health-insurance plan for their workers. The state also guaranteed coverage for the unemployed and others in need.
But the plan stalled after Massachusetts was hard hit by the recession. The startup date, initially set for 1992, was moved back to 1995, and state officials have not ruled out a further postponement.
Among state initiatives now being started after considerable delays, the Oregon plan is among the most interesting. It guarantees coverage for every citizen but, at the same time, limits the type of coverage offered, a kind of rationing many states have ducked thus far, though many health care experts believe rationing is inevitable.
Initially, Federal health care officials blocked the Oregon plan, saying the rationing would violate laws that protect the rights of disabled people.
After the Clinton Administration took office, Federal officials relented, raising hopes in state capitals of a significant change in Washington. "We believe the Federal Government must give the states the flexibility to solve their local problems," the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, said in allowing Oregon to proceed.
All in all, in one form or another in recent years, states have tried to deal with almost every health care issue that Mr. Clinton has expressed concern about.
"There's hardly anything that at least one state hasn't tried or is getting ready to try," said Trish Riley, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonprofit study group in Portland, Me.

HEADLINE: Hunt's Fall Can't Hurt Alabama Politics' Reputation

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 23

 BODY:
Politicians seem to be held in low esteem everywhere these days, but things may have hit rock bottom here.
In a state with crushing problems of poverty and education, the felony conviction and removal from office of Gov. Guy Hunt this week is seen less as an outrage and more as yet another indication of how government here has routinely failed its citizens. 
 The most common reaction seems to be speculation about how many other officials could be vulnerable if held to the same legal standards that were used to convict Mr. Hunt of converting $200,000 in money raised for his inauguration for his own use.
"You know how in Alabama they say, 'Thank God for Mississippi' and in Mississippi they say, 'Thank God for Alabama?' " said Phil Norton, who owns the Farmers Market Cafe here, referring to each state's ability to save the other from monopolizing the bottom of various national rankings. "I don't know if we can say that anymore."
 
'This One Just Got Caught'
 One of his customers, Sammy Mobley, a carpet installer, added: "There's two kinds of politicians in Alabama: the caught and the uncaught. This one just got caught."
Mr. Hunt's removal from office brought calls for new ethics and campaign standards for the state, and some believe the trauma could help revitalize state government. But almost no one believes that will be an easy task in a state still waiting for someone, anyone, to move it outside the shadow of George C. Wallace, who dominated the state's politics for a quarter century.
"This is the only Deep South state yet to elect a New South Governor, either Democrat or Republican," said Bill Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama. "There used to be a hope, a false hope as it turned out, that if we just could get through the turmoil of the 1960's, just get on the other side of racial change, that a brighter day for Alabama politics was at hand. It just didn't happen."
It was not always that way. Fifty years ago, Alabama produced some of the most savvy and progressive politicians in America, including Hugo L. Black, a Senator until he became a Supreme Court Justice in 1937.
 
The Wallace Factor
 But the political fallout from the battles over segregation hit harder and lasted longer in Alabama than anywhere in the South. From the time he was elected to his first term as Governor in 1962 to the time he ended his fourth in 1987, Mr. Wallace dominated Alabama politics so completely that no one could emerge from his shadow. Most experts say they believe his quarter-century of primacy stunted the state's political development.
Some say Mr. Hunt artificially extended the process when he was elected to succeed Mr. Wallace in 1986. A farmer and lay Primitive Baptist preacher with a high school education, Mr. Hunt was nominated as a Republican sacrificial lamb but became Governor after a fratricidal Democratic primary in which the winner was removed from the ballot by the courts. Mr. Hunt went on to win re-election in 1990 and supporters say his low-key, pro-business approach has been good for Alabama's economy.
But his critics say Mr. Hunt has been an ineffectual Governor who has dealt with none of the state's main problems. Those include a tax code that is widely seen as in need of drastic revision to alleviate inequities, an educational system that is being forced by a sweeping state court ruling this month to upgrade the state's schools and how they are financed, and a system of campaign financing so lax that a major element of the Governor's defense was that everyone else uses campaign money for personal use.
Alabama ranks 44th nationally in per capita income and 47th in the percentage of residents who have graduated from high school.
 
Poilitics and Race
 In addition, the state's racial politics are among the most combative in the country. "In the State of Alabama, it is very seldom that the white politicians will do things on their own initiative to eliminate racial discrimination," said State Representative Alvin Holmes, who is black. "In 99.9 percent of the cases, if something is done, it is ordered by the Federal courts or the Federal Government."
Looming over it all is a political system with a racially divided, philosophically neutered Democratic Party and a Republican Party still struggling to establish itself. Only two Republican candidates have been elected to statewide office since Reconstruction: Senator Jeremiah Denton, who won a single term in 1980, and Mr. Hunt.
"No one has been saying, for example, that if Guy Hunt were found guilty that education reform is down the drain, or if he is exonerated that we'll get tax reform on the table again," said Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College. "It's not that kind of politics here. It's just about who's winning and who's losing. It's a football game."
But some see some positive developments. Professor Barnard said the state's economy had become less dependent on industries like mining or timber, which has given corporate interests far more reason to care about education and economic development than in the past.
"You have increasingly, especially from the banking and financial community, business leaders with a stake in the economic and social well being of the state in a way the timber barons never did, the absentee-owned steel mills never did," Professor Barnard said. "And you're getting some leadership willing to work really for the first time with the leaders of the education forces."
 
Like Father, Like Son?
 But there is much doubt whether the new Governor, Jim Folsom Jr., the amiable, conciliatory son of a former two-time Governor and populist firebrand, James E. (Big Jim) Folsom, can be the the dynamic force the state needs. And some see the return of one of the state's storied names to the Governor's office as a reminder that in Alabama politics, everything can change and nothing can change at the same time.
"I think if they'd been on the other Governors like they got on Hunt, they'd have got all of them," said Sam Perry, who works for a local utility company, as he ate lunch at Charlie's Restaurant here.
And Phyllis Smith, a waitress, recalling Big Jim Folsom's two terms, from 1947 to 1951, then from 1955 to 1959, said: "You know what Folsom, his daddy, said: that the first time he did things by the book, and if he got back in there, he was going to get all he could out of it. This one will probably be the same way."

HEADLINE: Guido Carli, Economist, 79, Dies; His Firm Hand Led Italy's Growth

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Guido Carli, for decades Italy's foremost economic leader and an influential figure in international finance, died in Spoleto on Friday. He was 79.
Official news reports said he died on the way to the hospital after a heart attack. 
 Mr. Carli guided his country's economic recovery after Italy's in World War II, and became a cornerstone of stability for revolving-door governments. Twice he was credited with rescuing the nation from financial ruin.
 
A Strong Leader
 His leadership continued in recent years as Western European nations linked their economies and the Soviet bloc disintegrated. Mr. Carli sometimes outspokenly criticized the United States for a failure of leadership, as he did when oil prices soared in the 1970's. But he also defended the United States when other Europeans tried to limit American investment as a threat to their autonomy.
 Mr. Carli, who was born in Brescia and educated at the University of Padua, was the son of an economics professor. A friend of the family (who later became Pope Paul VI) won Mr. Carli a job at a state holding company. There he interned under two men who later headed Banca d'Italia, the central bank, and he succeeded them in that post.
In 1944, at the age of 30, he represented Italy at the Bretton Woods Conference, which planned post-war reconstruction by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He joined the I.M.F. managing board in 1947.
 
Two Rescue Operations
 During his term as governor of the central bank, from 1960 to 1975, Mr. Carli exercised strong influence on the Treasury Ministry, on Government planning, on the budget and on the stock market. When Italy's economy faltered in 1964, he was credited with reviving it through emergency actions, including a mission to Washington that netted $1.2 billion in aid.
A decade later, he defied pessimistic experts by arranging a similar rescue of the economy through budgetary austerity, a reduction in inflation and an expansion of foreign trade, a package he called shock treatment.
In 1983 Mr. Carli, a Christian Democrat, was elected to the Senate. He served as Treasury Minister from 1989 until last year. Since then he worked as a consultant.
Mr. Carli is survived by a son, Andrea.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
When Is a Fact Not a Fact? When It's a Statistic.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Democratic mayoral primary is still five months off, but accusations -- accompanied by statistical jousting -- are already flying up. Mayor David N. Dinkins and his chief Democratic opponent, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, squared off last week on a point that Mr. Stein has been pressing for months: his contention that the Mayor has cut more than $700 million from the city's schools over the last four years.
Mr. Stein has argued often that Mr. Dinkins has let down the city's students, and perhaps even imperiled the city's future, by underfinancing the school system. "This administration has cut more than $700 million from the Board of Education," Mr. Stein said at a Democratic candidates forum last week in Brooklyn. "That's a fact." 
 But the Mayor insisted that it is not. He maintained that, even in the midst of the worst recession in a generation, he had made sure that the city's contribution to the Board of Education's budget "has increased each year that I have been Mayor."
Who is right? As is often true in politics, each candidate has a legitimate statistical basis for his claim.
According to financial data provided by the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, the city's contribution to the school board increased each year from 1989 to 1992, and is tentatively set to go up again this year. In 1989, the city gave the schools $2.98 billion; by 1992, $3.42 billion.
Mr. Stein is so adamant on the point that, after going to his car at the end of the candidates' meeting, he returned to a cluster of reporters outside the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in downtown Brooklyn, where the forum was held, to reiterate his claim. He said, in response to a question, that the Mayor had reduced, in actual dollars, the city's contributions to the schools each year.
But Mr. Stein's aides said the next day that the Council President had meant to say that the Mayor had reduced the city's contribution each year from the amounts it had planned to give to the school board in the city budgets approved each June. These cuts were part of a broad effort by the Dinkins administration to trim costs in virtually all city agencies.
The city's cuts against its own plans -- which amounted to $777 million in the last three years -- caused the Board of Education to slash programs, including reducing supplies and the numbers of guidance counselors, said Susan Wiviott, an assistant to Mr. Stein. "What they've cut is program money," Ms. Wiviott said.
 
Awaiting Cuomo's Nod
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has yet to speak about whom he will recommend as the next chairman of New York's Democratic Party, but names have started to emerge from his aides and political associates.
Mentioned most consistently is Al Gordon, a longtime Cuomo aide who is currently the Governor's director of legislative and intergovernmental affairs. Mr. Gordon has been involved in most of Mr. Cuomo's campaigns and served as the director of the Dukakis campaign in New York in 1988.
Other possibilities include Judith Hope, the former first vice chairwoman of the state party, Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, and Edward Szczesniak, the Democratic chairman of Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse.
The Democratic State Committee plans to meet on May 15 to ratify Mr. Cuomo's selection. The new chairman will succeed John A. Marino, who is joining a Manhattan investment firm.
The Cuomo aides said the Governor could also choose someone not being mentioned prominently at this time. And they said his decision would depend largely on whether he chooses someone to serve simultaneously as chairman and executive director, as Mr. Marino did, or he divides the tasks between two people.
 
Joining in the March
 The march may be in Washington, but so will be many New York City voters.
Several political figures from the city say they will take part in today's demonstration for equal rights for gay Americans, which is expected to draw 300,000 people to the nation's capital from the New York area.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and his likely challenger in the Democratic mayoral primary, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, say they will attend, as will Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President.
They will be joined by Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick of Manhattan, the Legislature's only openly gay member, and Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who is also gay.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins's likely Republican opponent, is staying in New York City to raise money for his campaign, his aides said.
 
Hitting the Screen, by Mail
 The race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in New Jersey has been run with the kind of stealth and scramble for strategic advantage that once marked the cold war.
It began with a build-up of press releases delivered by hand, mail or fax machine from each of the three major candidates: Christine Todd Whitman, Cary Edwards and James Wallwork. The fight has moved to community-access cable television channels and to the radio airwaves, where the candidates have pounded one another and Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat.
All of this is leading toward a blitz in the final weeks before the June 8 primary, when expensive television ads will air on New York City and Philadelphia stations because there is no single television outlet that covers all of New Jersey.
Late last week, Mr. Edwards introduced an intermediate weapon that he hopes will help him overtake Mrs. Whitman in the polls: his campaign began mailing videotapes to registered Republicans across the state. The cover of the tape shows a harsh visage of Mr. Florio, with the caption, "Retire this guy: only one Republican can (Hint: Cary Edwards)."
On Friday, the chief political strategist for the Edwards campaign, J. Brian Smith, gave journalists in Trenton a preview of the 9-minute, 29 second video. It opens with a string of attacks on Florio policies on taxes, crime and education, then touts Mr. Edwards's virtues before ending with a scene showing Mrs. Whitman with a tennis racquet under one arm and luggage on the other.
Mr. Wallwork is ignored.
Mr. Smith declined to say exactly how many videotapes were being mailed. But he said the number was more than the 100,000 videos Mr. Edwards sent out four years ago when he finished second in the race for the nomination.

HEADLINE: A Dealer in Art and, Some Say, a Dealer in Secret Police Data

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 24

 BODY:
Roy E. Bullock has recently become one of the best-known collectors in the Bay area, but it is not his Japanese wood block prints that has attracted attention. Rather, the collection that is raising curiosity and anger is his data base of 12,000 people and 500 organizations, including some culled from confidential police files.
Like any careful collector, Mr. Bullock sorted and labeled what he had, dividing his world into categories: "ANC" for supporters of the African National Congress in South Africa, "Skins" for right-wing extremists like skinheads and neo-Nazis, and "Arabs" for critics of Israel. The rest fell under two headings: "Pinkos" for liberals and "Right" for conservatives. 
 Then, critics say, he began to spread his collection around. Law-enforcement investigators here say he sold and traded the names and other information to police agencies, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and at least one foreign government.
The collection, which Mr. Bullock acknowledges he has been compiling for more than 30 years, has drawn accusations of domestic spying and invasions of privacy.
 
Lawsuit and Investigation
 Although no criminal charges have been filed, his activities are the subject of a civil lawsuit and are being investigated by the District Attorney's office here, which says the Anti-Defamation League has people like Mr. Bullock in cities around the country who have close ties with some law-enforcement officials.
Barbara S. Wahl, a lawyer for the league, says that the group does have a network of "researchers" and that they do have close ties to law-enforcement agencies in many cases. "But the A.D.L. does not run a spy ring nationwide," she said.
As reports of Mr. Bullock and his intelligence-gathering emerged in news accounts over the past four months, they began to raise eyebrows in largely liberal San Francisco. And when a flood of documents supporting government search warrants became public two weeks ago, the case began to evoke cries of outrage.
Part of the District Attorney's investigation involves Mr. Bullock's relationship with Thomas Gerard, a former police inspector here who has been accused by plaintiffs in the lawsuit of tapping into law-enforcement and government computers and feeding the information to Mr. Bullock.
Exactly what Mr. Bullock, 58, does do to support himself is hazy. He is often described as an art dealer, and he says most of that part of his life involves Japanese prints. He calls himself a researcher, but the evidence available in public documents indicates that his steadiest work seems to be on contract to the Anti-Defamation League, collecting information about people.
 
Trading and Selling Information
 He has admitted in court papers and in an interview that he is not a passive information gatherer, having infiltrated racist groups, tapped into telephone message systems and paid informers. In addition, according to public documents, he has traded information with law-enforcement officers, who gave him motor vehicle records and criminal rap sheets. And he says that for four years he sold some of his information to a man calling himself "Louie," who he said was an agent for the South African Government.
There is nothing illegal about collecting information that is in public records, which is what makes up most of Mr. Bullock's data. But the District Attorney's investigation is aimed at finding out how far Mr. Bullock and Mr. Gerard went beyond that, including whether they used police authority to obtain the names of postal box owners.
The investigation began in December, when the District Attorney's office began looking into Mr. Gerard's use of official information. A short time before that, Mr. Gerard retired from the police force and moved to the Philippines. The authorities are now trying to find him for questioning.
"The heart of this investigation is the violation of privacy and individuals' rights to exercise First Amendment freedoms," said District Attorney Arlo Smith. "People should feel free to go to assemblages without the fear that their license numbers will be taken down in the parking lot and classified information about them given out to private individuals."
 
'Massive Spying' Charged
 Mr. Smith said the investigators are trying to determine if there had been violations of California's laws on privacy, eavesdropping and disclosure of confidential records.
The civil lawsuit was filed April 14 by 19 people who have been publicly critical of Israel and South Africa. It is a class action, on behalf of everyone affected by the gathering of such information, and it charges Mr. Bullock, Mr. Gerard, the Anti-Defamation League and the head of the league's San Francisco office with violating the plaintiffs' privacy.
The suit also says a "massive spying operation" was run to discredit people and cause them "loss of reputation, jobs or economic benefit."
"If I thought this was just about finding out who the skinheads were, I wouldn't object," said Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey Jr., a former Republican Congressman from California who is representing the plaintiffs, including his wife, Helen.
Another plaintiff, Yigal Arens, the son of former Defense Minister Moshe Arens of Israel, said, "I've never done anything more than sometimes in public, sometimes in private, said what I think."
The case has caused confusion for some liberals because the Anti-Defamation League, an organization they believed was keeping tabs on racist or violent groups, has now been accused of spying on them.
 
'Outraged' by Pinko Listin
 "If it were the White Ayran Resistance and the Klan they were spying on, I probably wouldn't get upset about it," said Anne Poirier, who is involved with groups supporting anti-apartheid efforts in South Africa and is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. "But because it was about me, I care. I'm outraged that I'm on the Pinko list."
The Anti-Defamation League was founded 80 years ago to gather information about anti-Semitic groups. Since then it has thrown a wider net, opposing all forms of hate groups.
Melvin Salberg, the league's national chairman, flew here from New York on April 15 to defend the group. "We have been in the trenches fighting for civil rights," he said in an interview. "We have it as our mission to find out what racist groups are doing and saying so we can properly combat them."
Mr. Bullock said in an interview that he had not done anything wrong. His motivation, he said, has been a "repellent interest in hate groups, religious bigots, assorted kooks and radicals," an interest he said he developed in high school.
Although the laws have changed in the past 40 years to restrict spying by law-enforcement agencies on citizens, Mr. Bullock's methods have remained the same throughout his career. He said he had infiltrated organizations by passing himself off for months at a time as a white supremacist or as a sympathizer to Arab causes.
Despite the lawsuit and investigation, Mr. Bullock aggressively defends his activities. "I feel I have rendered a service to fight bigotry in every form," he said. "I'm very proud of what I've done."

HEADLINE: EIGHT TONS OF AID SAILS OFF TO CUBA

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., April 24

 BODY:
In an effort to ease the worsening shortages of food and other necessities in Cuba, the first of a dozen boats set out for Havana today loaded with eight tons of vitamins, food and hospital supplies.
Food rationing and the resulting nutritional problems have become severe in Cuba since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the loss of $5 billion in annual Soviet subsidies. Early this month, the Cuban Health Ministry announced that there was an epidemic of a blinding eye disease caused, in part, by the lack of Vitamin B in the daily Cuban diet. 
 The flotilla shipment includes 32 boxes of Vitamin B complex pills.
"They are our neighbors down there," said the flotilla organizer, John J. Young of Key West, who calls his group Basta, which is Spanish for "enough." "What we're concerned about is getting medicines and as much as we can down there."
 
9 to 12 Boats to Go to Cuba
 Still, the gesture has divided this small resort island 90 miles from Cuba, with some Cuban-Americans saying the shipment will fall into the hands of President Fidel Castro.
Depending on the weather, 9 to 12 boats are expected to make the trip this weekend. Mr. Young said the group planned to arrive in Cuba by Sunday afternoon. A ceremony is planned for Monday at Havana Children's Hospital for the donation of the over-the-counter drugs, bed linens, reading glasses and other items.
The Commerce Department granted the license for the shipment on the condition that the goods be given to a group other than the Cuban Government. Mr. Young said the shipment would go to the Cuban Red Cross, the Ecumenical Council and the Baptist Convention.
But with the Cuban Government organizing the transport of the aid once it arrives in Cuba, some Cuban-Americans have their doubts.
"I worry that that help will go to the Cuban Government," said Alfredo Aguero of Key West, who formed a protest group called Basta de Basta, or Enough of Enough.
On April 10, Basta de Basta organized a motorcade of about 50 cars that drove through Key West with signs and flags protesting any aid to Cuba. The protesters said the aid would go to the Cuban Army, Cuban political leaders or foreign tourists.
 
Debate Over Aid to Cuba
 On Thursday, a small fire was set at the warehouse where the supplies were stored, but Mr. Young said they were not damaged. Mr. Aguero said his group had nothing to do with the fire.
The flotilla has underscored a growing debate among South Florida's Cuban-Americans, who are divided on whether they should send help to their former countrymen or stand behind the hard-line position that no aid be given while Mr. Castro is in power.
"I think 99 percent of the Cuban community agrees with aid to Cuba," said Mr. Aguero, who works at a local transit home where all Cuban refugees to the Florida Keys are processed. But, he added, "everyone who comes from Cuba, including doctors, says it goes to the Government."
Agents from the United States Customs Service checked some of the boxes as they were being loaded onto boats today to confirm their contents. Treasury Department officials from Washington were also there to remind captains and crew members that they are not permitted to spend any American dollars while in Cuba.
 
Helping the Children
 So the group will not have to spend any money, Mr. Young said the Cuban Government has promised not to charge a fee for docking at Marina Hemingway, a tourist compound a few miles west of downtown Havana.
For the boat owners, the reasons for going to Cuba are simple. "I'd like to see kids get the humanitarian thing," said H. T. Pontin, a 70-year-old retired tugboat captain, who lives near Key West on Ramrod Key. His 53-foot sailboat is one of the largest in the fleet sailing to Cuba, which includes vessels as small as 24 feet and as large as 72 feet.
"The two countries are playing their own ball game, and I'm just a boater in the middle," Mr. Pontin added.
A Key West writer, John Leslie, who oversaw the storage of the goods for Basta, had more political goals. "The more openness we can get going, the greater the chance that the embargo can be lifted," Mr. Leslie said. "Once the embargo is lifted, Castro is gone."

HEADLINE: PAKISTAN IS FACING TERRORIST LISTING

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Aware that the step could shatter what was once a close relationship, the Clinton Administration is debating whether to add Pakistan to its official list of nations that support terrorism.
The proposed declaration has stirred deep misgivings within the State Department and in Congress because of the danger of a backlash of anti-American feeling in another Islamic country and because the alleged offenses mainly involve support for separatist guerrillas in the disputed Kashmir region. 
 But senior Clinton Administration officials say that Federal law will give them no other option unless Pakistan can present evidence that it has severed its ties to separatist groups that employ terrorism as a weapon.
"If circumstances don't change, it's going to happen," a senior State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, warned separately this week that Pakistan was "on the brink" of the designation, which would mean heavy costs for the country's economy.
 
A Spur to Fundamentalists
 But several other United States officials in both Washington and Islamabad say that such a decision would be counterproductive and perhaps unjust. It would strengthen the hand of Islamic fundamentalists in the region and would punish Pakistan for backing guerrilla action in neighboring Kashmir that is sometimes more comparable to ethnic strife than a clear-cut example of terrorism.
Direct economic and military aid to Pakistan was suspended in 1990 in retaliation for its development of nuclear weapons. If it is judged to be supporting terrorism, Pakistan would face an automatic halt to the indirect American assistance it has continued to receive as well as new barriers to trade between the two countries. The United States assists Pakistan through the Peace Corps, the Export-Import Bank and development organizations.
Officials from both countries say the step would all but end the decades-long cooperation between the United States and Pakistan, which reached its height during a 14-year campaign by Muslim guerrillas to unseat a Communist regime in Afghanistan.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned a special Pakistani envoy this month that the United States expected Pakistan to take specific "action" to cut its ties to groups that engage in terrorism. Yet some American officials say the debate on Pakistan's status has raised questions about whether the criteria used in assessing terrorism remain appropriate as ethnic violence spreads to an increasing number of countries.
 
No Room to Differentiate
 The countries placed on the terrorist list have usually been regarded by Washington as outcasts, for example Iran, Libya and Iraq, whose main offense was said to be support for attacks on American targets or on American allies.
If Pakistan is added to the group, the United States would primarily be punishing the country for its backing of Kashmiri separatists who use terrorism as well as more conventional tactics of protest in their rebellion against India's central Government.
The law passed by Congress in 1979 to require punishment of nations supporting terrorism allows no room for differentiation among them. But the circumstances of Pakistan's actions and the potential consequences of its punishment have caused some American officials in both Washington and Islamabad to question whether it truly meets the terrorist test.
"They are not blowing up planes, or seizing half the Cabinet like North Korea did in Burma, or seizing American hostages, or giving refuge to Abu Nidal," the mastermind of a Palestinian terrorist group, said a senior American official in Islamabad who opposes Pakistan's designation as a terrorist state. "What they are involved in is what we did in Afghanistan," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But Mr. Woolsey, who backs a strict approach, told Congress this week that not only Kashmiris but Sikh secessionists had "found safe haven and other support" in Pakistan.
 
Arms Flow Called Stemmed
 In a recent interview, a very senior Pakistani intelligence official contended that Islamabad had stemmed the flow of arms and guerrillas into Kashmir directly in response to American threats.
With the Clinton Administration is skeptical about such claims, Pakistan has also sought to call Washington's attention to the Islamic radicals inside the country who are intent on making the schism with the United States permanent. Adding Islamabad to the terrorist list would "throw Pakistan into the hands of mullahs and clergy," Malik Zahoor Ahmad, a Pakistani diplomat in Washington, warned in an interview this week.
He also repeated Pakistan's contention that the United States is overlooking the support India has given to Tamil separatists, who have used terrorism in their violent campaign for independence in northeastern Sri Lanka.
The most recent State Department list of state supporters of terrorism, issued in January, includes Cuba, North Korea and Syria as well as Iran, Libya and Iraq. Although the law allows the department to amend that list at any time, Administration officials said they hoped to reach a decision by June about Pakistan and the Sudan, which is also facing a threat of American sanctions.

HEADLINE: President Sees Many Gains in His First 100 Days

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
President Clinton awarded himself high grades today for his first 100 days in office, saying in his weekly radio address that he had changed the nation's direction, tackled the budget deficit and helped small businesses and struggling families with children.
Mr. Clinton spent much of today meeting with Senate Democrats at a weekend retreat, as he taped the speech on Friday. The President and the senators are trying to figure out how to regroup after Senate Republicans defeated his jobs bill this week. 
 Facing an onslaught of Republican criticism that his first 100 days have gone sour, Mr. Clinton devoted much of his radio address to putting a positive spin on his record.
He noted that Congress had approved the broad outlines of his economic program. He added that he had taken steps to make more credit available to small businesses and farms, provide more Federal aid to working families with children and set up programs to help people who had lost their jobs because of cuts in the military.
 
'Good News Lately'
 Mr. Clinton expressed pride that the stock market was at an all-time high and that long-term interest rates were very low. "There's been some good news lately," he said. "After about 100 days as President, we've begun to change the direction of America."
In a rebuttal, the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, agreed that Mr. Clinton had changed the direction of America, but toward higher taxes. Mr. Michel's speech was part of a stepped-up Republican strategy to hammer Mr. Clinton over his proposals to raise taxes, through a new energy tax, higher taxes on Social Security benefits and a possible value-added tax.
"The President himself has said one of his top priorities is creating jobs," Mr. Michel said. "But higher taxes don't create jobs. They kill jobs."
In his radio address, the President lashed out at Senate Republicans for their filibuster that blocked his package to stimulate the economy.
"A lot of those people think they've scored a victory by killing a chance to put nearly half-a-million Americans to work," he said. "I don't think that's much of a victory. I think that's letting the American people down."
After the President arrived with his family in Williamsburg, Va., the White House announced that he had signed into law the one part of his package that he had salvaged: $4 billion in extended unemployment compensation benefits to about 1.9 million people without jobs. The Senate approved the measure on Wednesday.
The closed session with senators was described by White House and legislative aides as a strategy session on promoting the agenda of the President and the senators.
The President spent much of the morning visiting Jamestown, the nearby historic settlement, with his daughter, Chelsea; his mother, Virginia Kelley, and her husband, Dick Kelley. He was also accompanied by his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, whose husband died April 7.
While they were sightseeing, Hillary Rodham Clinton was busy speaking with the Democratic senators about the Administration's plans for health-care reform.

HEADLINE: Celebrities Join Ohio Congressman in a Fast

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Representative Tony P. Hall, who is nearing the end of his third week of a protest fast, was joined Friday by 40 celebrities around the country in an effort to raise awareness of hunger and to protest a House decision to abolish the Select Committee on Hunger.
Mr. Hall, a Democrat from Dayton, Ohio, began fasting on April 5 after the House voted to cut its budget by eliminating the hunger committee, which he led, as well as special committees on aging, children and narcotics. 
 "It's not some kind of crazy guy who's fasting trying to get his way," the actor Jeff Bridges said Friday, from his home in Montana. "This is a well-respected Congressman. I wanted to help him sound the horn and get the message out."
Mr. Bridges said he helped organize the one-day celebrity fast in hope that people would pay attention to the 35,000 people who die of starvation in the world each day. He is also hoping to get the attention of members of Congress.
"I hope this will put some fire under their tails and they will find a way to replace the committee now that it's gone," Mr. Bridges said.
Since beginning his fast, Mr. Hall has lost about 20 pounds. The Congressman, who said he is drinking only water, said he would break the fast early next week, after Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy announces a plan to coordinate the work of Federal agencies that handle programs to combat hunger.
Mr. Hall said the fast had given him empathy for the famine victims he had seen in Somalia, Ethiopia and elsewhere. "I know how they go days without food," said Mr. Hall, who has continued his work schedule, "but how do they walk? I walk a block and I am winded."
William Stanton, the senior adviser for external affairs at the World Bank, said Mr. Hall's fast had inspired officials of the development bank to promise a series of worldwide "hunger summits," beginning with a symposium in the United States this fall. The bank spends about $1 billion a year on nutrition programs, he said.
But Linda Elswick of the World Sustainable Agriculture Association said famine-relief groups had mixed views about World Bank programs.
She said some groups complained that developing nations had been encouraged to grow crops for export rather than crops that feed local people. Others complained that the money went to local governments but did not reach the people that needed it the most, she said.
Mr. Hall's fast has inspired one-day fasts on college campuses around the country, as well as the celebrity fast, which the actress Valerie Harper helped Mr. Bridges organize.
The actors who said they would take part included Brooke Adams, Steve Allen, Beau Bridges, Gary Busey, Michael Cole, Bruce Davison, Shelley Fabares, Andy Garcia, Cynthia Geary, Scott Glenn, Deidre Hall, Harry Hamlin, Mel Harris, Michael Jeter, Carol Kane, Perry King, Stepfanie Kramer, Michael Learned, Jayne Meadows, Rob Morrow, Edward James Olmos, Susan Ruttan, Susan Sarandon, Connie Stevens, McLean Stevenson, Brenda Vaccaro, Lindsay Wagner, Lesley Ann Warren and Sam Waterston.
Others who announced fasts on Friday included the former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the musicians Graham Nash, Mary Travers and Peter Yarrow and such personalities as Phyllis Diller, Dick Gregory, Casey Kasem, Cassandra Peterson and Olden Polynice.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Stephen A. Douglas's Style Tips and Other Errors

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 24

 BODY:
Though it has been only a week since the official start of the gubernatorial races, there has been more than time enough for political truisms to be driven home to candidates in both parties.
Lesson No. 1: Do Not Give Up Your Day Job. 
 If you are going to run for governor, it's wise to make sure that you: a) are wealthy enough to need no job; b) have the proper political and business connections, so that finding another line of work is of no concern, or c) make it a part-time mission.
This was supposed to be the year that John Budzash bought a boat -- a sleek $10,000 speedboat paid for with a $4,000 down payment from his Federal income-tax return and a small monthly note that his post office salary would comfortably cover.
But instead of going boating this summer, Mr. Budzash, 42 years old, decided to run for governor, challenging the incumbent, Jim Florio, for the Democratic Party's nomination.
 
New Haircut, No Mustache
 To gear up for the race, Mr. Budzash quit his $32,000-a-year job as a letter carrier, switched his party registration from Republican to Democrat two days before the filing deadline, had his hair professionally cut for the first time in 20 years (he had been cutting his own hair, he said) and shaved the mustache he had worn for half his life. (Someone on his grass-roots campaign staff had told him about a theory that facial hair was a negative for candidates.)
Democratic Party leaders have charged that Mr. Budzash, who was propelled into New Jersey politics as an antitax maverick in 1990, has the covert financial and political backing of Republicans and/or the National Rifle Association, which has vowed to defeat Governor Florio over the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons. Mr. Budzash denies such ties and said he quit his mail job with no other prospect except to be Governor.
And now he will have no spot on the ballot either, after a successful Democratic challenge to his candidacy petitions. On Friday, Secretary of State Daniel J. Dalton, who is a Florio appointee and confidant, upheld a ruling by an administrative law judge that his petitions were flawed.
 
Soldiering On, but No NavyXx
 Unbowed, Mr. Budzash pledges to soldier on, campaigning for write-in votes, although he conceded, even before he was tossed off the ballot, that the economics were shaky. "Now that I don't have a job, my income-tax refund has got to help me live for the next few months and no boat!" he said. "And on top of that, I have to sell my Corvette."
Lesson No. 2: If Possible, Avoid Sharing the Stage With Children or Animal Acts.
It was once de rigueur for politicians to kiss babies. But unlike party underlings and campaign staff members, children cannot be counted on to toe the line.
Consider the carefully staged re-election announcement by Governor Florio, which was made at a community center in Edison April 13.
Just before the announcement, Mr. Florio posed for a campaign videotape in a side room with his wife, Lucinda, in the midst of a roomful of children wearing T-shirts with the message: "Florio for Governor."
 
Fidgeting and Yawning
 The children then trooped into the auditorium and sat behind Mr. Florio. They were intended to provide visual and symbolic background as he defended controversial policies of his first term, including a $2.8 billion tax increase, as good and necessary for the future of New Jersey.
But Mr. Florio quickly found that he was competing for the attention of the press and television cameras with the fidgeting, yawning and otherwise distracted children who were not captivated by his message -- hardly the image he had envisioned.
Lesson No. 3: Be Punctual!
Very few politicians adhere to this rule. But for those who try, it is important to learn that it applies to both sides of the hour hand.
This has best been demonstrated by J. Patrick Gilligan, a candidate for the Republican nomination whose entire campaign has consisted of infrequent, one-page messages, written in arching longhand and sent via a fax machine at the American Stock Exchange, where he is a consultant.
 
Accidentally Too Early
 "My failure to keep a 9:30 A.M. press conference on March 24th at the time I entered my petition for the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey was not an intentional affront to the press," Mr. Gilligan said in a message that arrived, via fax, more than three weeks after the events. "It was an accident."
"I arrived early by chance, went through the procedure and finished shortly after 9:15 A.M," he said. "Seeing no press, I mistakenly assumed they were not interested and left. I should have waited and I apologize to whomever I offended."
Lesson No. 4: You Can Be Too Rich.
From the earliest days, Federal and state leaders were generally learned, landed and loaded.
But Christine Todd Whitman, a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, has found her campaign bedeviled by a wealth of embarrassments over her wealth.
The latest blows landed last week when Ms. Whitman and her husband, John, disclosed that they had an estimated income of $3.7 million in 1992. Ms. Whitman said she and her husband, a financial consultant, had paid $1,028,569 in Federal taxes and $255,000 to the state.
 
Those Immigrants Again
 The financial information she provided revived past controversies, particularly her admission that she had hired illegal immigrants and had not paid their taxes, a problem she shared with Cary Edwards, another Republican gubernatorial candidate.
Another problem arose over a much more trifling amount: $1. It was reported this week that on her state tax return for 1991, Ms. Whitman, who has qualified for the maximum $1.6 million in state matching funds for the primary election, checked "no" on the section of the form that asked if the taxpayer wanted to divert $1 of their tax dollars for the election fund.
A campaign spokesman, Joe Justin, explained to The Asbury Park Press that the Whitmans felt that their contributions of money and time for political causes more than made up for the checkoff.

HEADLINE: Waste Management, American Style

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To suggest we can aim at recycling and reusing up to 72 percent of our packaging strikes me as unrealistic. 
 Today, we are recycling about 21 percent of our waste, but for a host of economic, technical and practical reasons, we're never going to approach 70 percent. The practical upper limit for recycling in the United States is probably about one-third of our trash. This is a ceiling, not a near-term target. A good recycling range for most communities is more like 20 to 30 percent.
Why can't we achieve higher rates? We have already reached high recycling rates for the more valuable, easy-to-collect items. For example, we're recycling 65 percent of aluminum cans, nearly 60 percent of cardboard boxes and 50 percent of newspapers.
To think we can triple our current rate by relying on things that are expensive to collect or have no market value is naive.
We need to stop trying to convince ourselves that recycling is the only way to deal with trash. Rather, we should encourage communities to tailor integrated waste management programs to their own local circumstances. The unique mix of source reduction, recycling, incineration for energy production, and landfilling that makes the most sense in each local situation is the best way to handle our trash.

HEADLINE: A Vote for Investment Professionals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"At Tax Time, Thoughts of I.R.A.'s" (Mutual Funds, April 11) spoke to the point that much of the I.R.A. money flows into exactly the wrong places, because "most people do not understand the real risk of investing for several decades: inflation." It then proceeds to extol the virtues of 18 "no loads" with five-year track records "that reflect a controlled level of risk." Investor needs are neatly categorized by age. What if these needs were addressed individually by an investment professional who could help select an appropriate fund or funds that may carry a sales charge, or "load"? Is it possible that this advice might indeed put money in the right places? 
 Several growth and income funds with outstanding 30-year records are available through investment professionals. Clearly, investors who held such funds during this period enjoyed substantial investment success and do understand the risk of inflation. Do you really suppose they say to themselves today, "If only we hadn't paid that sales charge?"

HEADLINE: Bob Dole Versus Political Reform

 BODY:
First Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, strangled the President's economic stimulus plan. Now the Dark Prince of Gridlock has pledged to give the same killing treatment to Mr. Clinton's long-promised campaign finance reform package. So sure of his antipathy is Mr. Dole that he has not even bothered to wait for its unveiling, which could happen any day now. If you're dead set against cleaning up politics, there's really no need to read the legislation.
But well-meaning Republicans and the Democrats should not let Mr. Dole's pre-emptive hostility deny serious political reform to the American people. To do so is to taunt an electorate already angry over the mortgaging of their democracy to wealthy influence peddlers. They want a better, freer Congress. This is a fight Mr. Clinton can win -- if he will stiffen his resolve and use his communication skills to show up Mr. Dole's rhetoric for what it really is: shilling for a corrupt status quo. 
 In a positive development, both chambers now seem poised to take up the campaign finance issue before Hillary Rodham Clinton's task force delivers its proposal and health care reform takes center stage. This means that House Speaker Tom Foley, who seemed bent on deferring the issue until the summer or even beyond, has listened to the voters.
The lingering question is whether the plan Mr. Clinton and Democratic leaders have been crafting in protracted negotiations will be one worth fighting for. That's still unanswerable, and that's where Mr. Clinton must use the weight of his office to whip resistant legislators into line. Here are some clear tests that he can apply:
Does the plan, strengthening the bill vetoed last year by President Bush, contain adequate public funds to break incumbents' dependence on special-interest money and allow challengers to wage competitive races? Does it sufficiently curb the political action committees, or PAC's, which now dominate in Congressional fund raising?
Does it shut down the evasive system that pumps soft money through the Democratic and Republican national committees? Has the bundling loophole, which permits special interests to magnify their clout by aggregating checks, been shut tight?
To Mr. Dole, it seems, these details are unimportant. He's ready to brand any bill that contains public financing and spending limits as an incumbent-protection scheme, a new form of welfare for politicians. And some Democrats, loath to see that line carried in an opponent's 30-second spot, are clearly scared.
But, in fact, there's no way to reduce the role of special interests and help Congressional challengers without a public financing system. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll suggests Americans are willing to support the idea, if the money comes from eliminating the tax deduction for lobbying -- the transfer favored by Mr. Clinton.
As for incumbent protection, nothing beats the current system. In 1992 senators running for re-election raised an average of $4.8 million for their campaigns -- nearly triple the average raised by challengers. Mr. Dole, who accepted $8 million in taxpayer money in his two failed Presidential campaigns, surely knows all this. But his determination to thwart the public will -- and the public interest -- on this issue is strong.
Mr. Dole is said to be putting heat on three Republican Senators -- Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, James Jeffords of Vermont and John McCain of Arizona. Each voted for public financing legislation in 1990, 1991 and 1992 and for overriding the Bush veto. Mr. Dole wants them to abandon their principles and join in killing whatever plan Mr. Clinton and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, serve up.
In assessing his first 100 days on Friday, Mr. Clinton gave himself high marks on campaign reform. He hasn't really earned them yet, but he can by breaking the Congressional gridlock on raising the ethical standards of American politics.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Clinton As Carter?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
From Washington and around the world, the grumbling has begun about President Clinton's leadership, his ability to wield power and his willingness to do what's necessary to prevail.
To combat this, he has to gain control quickly of two keystone issues, mastering Congress on the budget and mustering Europeans behind a plan for bold action on Bosnia. Otherwise, his Administration risks becoming what it fears most -- a repeat of the Carter Administration. 
 Much of the grumbling is politically motivated, premature and unfair. But it does contain a growing kernel of truth.
Tellingly, the criticisms come not just from Republicans and attack journalists, but from Democrats who desperately want him to succeed.
In the last weeks, friends and foes alike have been taking the measure of the man in the White House and are finding him wanting. Most troubling is that he's losing control of the budget, the carefully crafted economic plan he set before Congress to wide acclaim barely two months ago.
Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, savaged the President's grab-bag economic stimulus package. Mr. Clinton struck back, arguing that the package was critical. Mr. Dole held fast. The President offered a quick compromise. Mr. Dole dug in. Within days, Mr. Clinton caved.
In the game of power perceptions, Mr. Clinton's collapse cost him dearly. Either he shouldn't have made the issue a test case, or he should have cracked heads to make sure he had the votes to win.
Now the President must regroup and refocus on what was most applauded and needed in the budget -- the energy taxes, the higher taxes on the rich and deficit reduction. And he has to push the budget through Congress before midsummer, before the even bigger battle that looms over health care reform.
Mr. Clinton's ability to do this is absolutely essential to his international power. What foreign leaders admired most about him two months ago was his courage in tackling America's massive debts and his seeming capacity to command Congressional and popular support. They know, as Mr. Clinton knows, that America's power abroad rests on America's economic good health.
But the President's standing abroad also hinges on his handling of the Bosnian crisis. Most of the fault for this situation rests on the Europeans. They would not stand up to Serb aggression at the outset.
Now the Europeans want it both ways on Bosnia. They want to avoid military intervention, and they want U.S. leadership to quell the crisis. Foolishly, Mr. Clinton tried for months to dodge hard decisions about force and follow Europe's cynical policy of feeding the Muslims while doing nothing to prevent their slaughter.
It makes no sense, however, to endlessly berate the hapless Europeans. They know they can't lead, and Americans know they can't lead. Their leaders haven't got the political strength or the military power.
To make matters worse, Mr. Clinton seemed to lose control of his own Administration on Bosnia. Defense Secretary Aspin talked publicly about using force. Secretary of State Christopher publicly ruled it out. Madeleine Albright, the U.N. envoy, sent Mr. Clinton a private letter calling for the use of force. Twelve Balkan experts in the State Department did as much, and leaked it to the press.
Finally, on Friday, Mr. Clinton showed signs of stepping up to the challenge. Now he must unite his own team and then NATO behind realistic and understandable objectives: not bringing the Serbs to their knees military, which would require a massive land war, or even forcing them to make concessions at the negotiating table, which they won't do. But raising the costs of genocide to the Serbs and giving the Muslims a better chance to defend themselves. These goals can be met by using NATO air power and by arming the Muslims, and would call for minimal ground troops to guard safe havens.
If Mr. Clinton will lead in this direction, Europe will follow. The path leads not to another Vietnam, but to a fighting chance for the victims of genocide and to the reassertion of basic Western values.
The Clinton Presidency is on the line in Bosnia and Congress. With Mr. Clinton's formidable political skills and dazzling mind, he must know that he cannot afford to appear weak, that he must take clear stands and risks -- and lead.

HEADLINE: Conflict in the Balkans;
Serbs Again Reject Vance-Owen Peace Proposals

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, April 24

 BODY:
Courting the risk of allied air strikes and virtually assuring that new international sanctions will descend on Yugoslavia on Monday, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs said today that a proposal to link Serbian enclaves in Bosnia with a demilitarized corridor was not acceptable.
 After meeting for three hours with Lord Owen, who is trying to mediate an end to the Bosnian war, the Serbian leader, Radovan Karadzic, said the latest version of the peace plan "is absolutely anti-Serb" and "didn't meet a single Serbian need." 
Western diplomats said more talks could be held on Sunday, when Lord Owen is to return from an overnight trip to Zagreb, Croatia.
 He is also supposed to meet again with Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, who is widely assumed to call the shots for the Serbs in Bosnia. The ability of the Serbs in Bosnia to continue their battle for territory depends on the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro.
 
Among the Dandelions
 With the United Nations deadline for acceptance of the plan creeping closer, diplomats could not rule out an 11th-hour move by the Bosnian Serbs to wrest some final concessions that would lead them to a grudging acceptance of the peace plan.
 But most thought that was unlikely, given the vehemence of Dr. Karadzic's rejection, and they viewed his stand as a critical step toward deeper international involvement.
 The meeting today took place in a villa on the outskirts of Belgrade, a pale yellow stucco house with drawn shades and an overgrown lawn resplendent with yellow dandelions. As the talks wore on, more and more maps -- ever larger --were sent for and delivered.
 But when Lord Owen left, he pushed through a mob of reporters, his face drawn. Asked if any progress had been made, he responded with a curt no.
 
Plugging Loopholes
 The rejection means that sanctions mandating the seizure of all Yugoslavia's assets abroad and prohibiting the transshipment of goods across Yugoslavia will automatically come into effect on Monday. These steps are expected to plug major loopholes in a trade embargo imposed a year ago that is already choking the Yugoslav economy.
 At the same time, the intransigence of the Serbs will test the patience of the Clinton Administration, which is under growing pressure to take military action to end "ethnic cleansing" and to support the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
 President Clinton said on Friday that he was giving serious consideration to air strikes against Serbian positions, adding that he expected that European allies would join Washington in such an action.
 The foreign ministers of the European Community met in Denmark today to weigh military action. For Britain and France, which both have troops with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, a decision to bomb Serbs could expose their soldiers to retaliation.
 Any decision on military strikes could also be complicated by the long siege of Srebrenica. Under a cease-fire agreement, Muslim defenders surrendered some weapons to United Nations troops there, or slipped through the encircling Serbian lines. Now all that is protecting a desperate and hungry civilian population of some 30,000 Muslims from attack by Serbian artillery is a lightly armed 145-member United Nations force from Canada.
 
The Offer of a Corridor
 The five-day mission to the region by Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, had the air of a last-ditch attempt to win approval of the peace plan that he devised with Cyrus R. Vance, who was the United Nations mediator. The plan would carve Bosnia into 10 semiautonomous provinces virtually parceled out among Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
 The Croats and Muslims have signed the agreement. In an effort to overcome the objections of the Serbs, Lord Owen has proposed a 6-mile-wide, 50-mile-long corridor patrolled by United Nations forces that would link the Serbian area around Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia with the Serbian province in the east, which borders the republic of Serbia in Yugoslavia.
 The corridor, while not under Serbian sovereignty, would at least provide a transit link, as the Berlin corridor linked the city to West Germany during the cold war, Lord Owen said.
 Dr. Karadzic rejected both the corridor and the historical analogy.
 "The German corridor went through Germany," he said, "but that is not the case here," meaning that the Bosnian corridor would traverse territory held by Croats. Without a more solid corridor under their own jurisdiction, the Serbs living in the northwestern Bosnia would flee in terror, he suggested.
 
'We Should Be Separated'
 "We asked Lord Owen, where are we going to put 500,000 Serbs who would run away?" Dr. Karadzic told reporters. He said that he took the threat of Western air strikes very seriously, but that he had no alternative to rejecting the proposal.
 Insisting that Serbs, Croats and Muslims had been fighting for centuries, he castigated the West for pressing a plan that would force them to live in the same country. "Why are you pushing us together, like a dog and a cat in the same box?" he asked. "We can't live together. We should be separated to be good neighbors."
 This statement pointed toward the resolution preferred by the Bosnian Serbs. They want to sit down with the Croats and perhaps the Muslims and simply cut the country into three parts.
 The Serbs, who control about 70 percent of Bosnia, would be in a dominant bargaining position. They would most likely try to arrange a trade with the Croats that would give the Serbs their corridor in exchange for a more consolidated Croatian area around Mostar and other towns in the southwest.
 
'Greater Serbia'
 The Serbs have other objections to the Vance-Owen map. They feel it deprives them of major industrial areas and power stations. They also want more territory around Trebinje in the south and in the northwest.
 The self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs is meeting today and Sunday in Bijeljina, in northeastern Bosnia, to reconsider the Vance-Owen plan, which Dr. Karadzic said he would present without recommending acceptance or rejection. The parliament, which is even more militant than he is, already turned it down on April 2.
 The parliament voted to establish an assembly between Serbs in Croatia and Serbs in western Bosnia, a step that Croats and Muslims are bound to regard as a provocative move toward creation of a "greater Serbia."

HEADLINE: Conflict in the Balkans;
Weighing Strikes in Bosnia, U.S. Warns of Wider War

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
As President Clinton weighs military action in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the danger of the war spreading elsewhere in the Balkans is emerging as a dominant issue in the deliberations, Administration officials say.
 The C.I.A. has told the White House that any spillover of the fighting in Bosnia could ignite a regional war that might ultimately bring in Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, against each other. 
Although both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have warned Serbia in recent months that any signs of aggression beyond Bosnia's borders would bring an immediate, military response, a number of senior United States officials now say those warnings have been undermined by the West's inaction on the civil war in Bosnia.
 In a recent letter to the White House, the United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, argued that air strikes in Bosnia were needed both to save civilian lives and to convince Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, that the West is serious in its warnings against pushing the conflict beyond its current borders, Administration officials said.
 Washington warned Mr. Milosevic this year against driving ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, a province of Serbia in which Serbs are a small minority. Clinton Administration officials have since expanded what one called a "red line" to include any move by Serbs against Macedonia, one of the new countries that emerged from the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia.
 "Probably Milosevic doesn't believe it," one senior Adminstration official said. "I worry about that. I'm afraid we don't have a great deal of credibility on Kosovo because of what we've shown on Bosnia. And there is already a lot of Serb pressure on Macedonia."
 Macedonia's representative in Washington, Ljubica Z. Acevska, said few in the Balkan region were taking the American pledge to protect her country seriously. "After Bosnia, it is a sham," she said.
 Many Administration officials believe that military action against Bosnian Serbs would deter the federal Serbian-led Yugoslav Government in Belgrade from undertaking or financing Serbian nationalist military campaigns elsewhere. On the other hand, officials believe that if the West does not act now -- after President Clinton's public acknowledgement that he is considering air strikes --Serbian nationalists will be further emboldened.
 President Clinton and his top aides frequently invoke American interests in discussing the possibility of a wider Balkan war. Appearing before a House Committee in March, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said a Serbian move toward Kosovo or Macedonia could even set off a world war.
 "We fear that if the Serbian influence extends into either of these areas, it will bring into the fray other countries in that region -- Albania, Greece, Turkey -- and from there, on it could extend very broadly," he said.
 "So the stakes for the United States, are to prevent the broadening of that conflict to bring in our NATO allies, and to bring vast sections of Europe, and perhaps as happened before, broadening into a world war."
 Although 1.7 million ethnic Albanians live in Kosovo, forming an overwhelmingly majority, the territory is also prized by Serbian nationalists as the site of the Serbs' apocalyptic last stand against Turkish invaders in 1389.
 Mr. Milosevic, a former Communist, began his career as a nationalist firebrand in 1987 with a speech in Kosovo in which he decried what he contended was mistreatment of local Serbs by ethnic Albanians. Belgrade has since transformed the province into a virtual police state with huge contingents of Serbian police officers and army troops there to keep order.
 The Albanians in Kosovo have so far generally refrained from violent resistance, although clashes broke out between Serbian security forces and Albanians in December 1992. The skirmishes led led Bush Administration officials to worry that Mr. Milosevic was setting the stage for a new round of "ethnic cleansing," according to a former Bush Administration official.
 
A C.I.A. Scenario
 The C.I.A. has warned that Albania's military is poised to respond if ethnic Albanians are pushed across the border into Albania. On Dec. 15, President Bush's Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, said in a speech that the fighting in Bosnia "has the frightening potential to spread."
 Mr. Gates said that the C.I.A. told President Bush in private briefings that any Serbian move in Kosovo would destabilize Macedonia, which has a large Albanian minority.
 Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia, all of which have at various times asserted territorial claims to Macedonia, would seize parts of that country as the violence increased, according to a possible scenario suggested by the C.I.A.
 Turkey and perhaps other Muslim nations might then jump in to support Muslim Albania, such thinking goes, while Orthodox Greece would ally itself with the Orthodox Serbs.
 Mr. Bush's warning was delivered on Christmas Day, and Pentagon planners drew up an extensive list of targets -- from key military bases to communications links -- that would be hit if the Serbs did not comply The former Bush Administration official said the United States planned on organizing passage of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council authorizing such action.
 When Mr. Clinton took office, he endorsed Mr. Bush's warning on Kosovo but decided to rely on economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to end the war in Bosnia.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK
How the Apartment House Transformed
the Life of the City (1869-1930).
By Elizabeth Hawes.
Illustrated. 285 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $30. 
 COMPARED with other American cities, New York thrives at its center. Its citizens complain of crime, dirt and taxes, but the fact is that Manhattan, with its bustling sidewalks, efficient public transportation, crowded stores and, most important, its substantial middle- and upper-income population, is unusual in the United States. The rest of the nation is relentlessly suburban, and its dominant urban model is that of a doughnut -- a depressed central city with little vitality surrounded by hundreds of square miles of shopping malls, office parks and subdivisions.
How did Manhattan come to be so different, so European, so un-American? Elizabeth Hawes, formerly a staff member at The New Yorker, suggests that high-rise living, a once-novel idea, may be responsible for the singularity of the Hudson River metropolis. Before 1869, she argues in "New York, New York: How the Apartment House Transformed the Life of the City (1869-1930)," all respectable residents, in New York as elsewhere, lived in private, single-family houses.
Although bourgeois Parisians had been living on "shelves" since the days of the ancien regime, any American household of even modest aspirations considered a multifamily building to be sexually racy, a "stage set for adultery." After all, busybodies could not monitor the comings and goings of visitors when private entrance ways did not front on the street. Before the Civil War, the word "tenement" described any dwelling that housed three or more families, and the term "apartment building" was unknown.
Change began when the first upper-income apartment building in the United States was built in 1869 by the architect Richard Morris Hunt for Rutherford Stuyvesant, one of the most respected men in New York. Offering residents the security and convenience of a full-time concierge, the Stuyvesant Apartments at 142 East 18th Street overcame the risque image of the "French flat" and attracted couples of impeccable social standing. General Custer's widow moved there after her husband fell at the Little Bighorn.
The Stuyvesant's success encouraged others. In 1884, the most lavish residential structure yet seen was put up on a corner of 72d Street and Central Park West. Known as the Dakota because it was so far from the center of things that one wag said it might as well be in the Dakota Territory, it was richly ornamented and featured separate servants' entrances, service stairways and service elevators.
In the last two decades of the 19th century, even as the private mansions of the Vanderbilts and the Villards continued to march uptown, new apartment buildings were transforming the public perception of high-rise living. William Dean Howells, according to Ms. Hawes, had particular significance, not only because the author's move from Boston to Manhattan helped make New York the intellectual capital of the United States, but also because his choice of an apartment, not a house, typified a larger residential shift.
The great boom in apartment-house construction came after the turn of the century, spurred by the opening of the subway in 1904. Focusing on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, where new buildings sprang up like wildflowers, "New York, New York" gives special attention to the biggest of the residential behemoths, places like the Ansonia, the Apthorp and the Belnord. Technically, many were apartment hotels but, whatever the name, by 1929 they had transformed New York.
Indeed, by the onset of the Great Depression, Ms. Hawes estimates, 98 percent of affluent Manhattanites lived in apartment buildings, some of them so elegant that they rivaled the private palaces that once held sway on upper Fifth Avenue and on Riverside Drive. Mrs. E. F. Hutton's apartment at 1107 Fifth Avenue, for example, had 54 rooms.
Written for a general rather than an academic audience, "New York, New York" does not break new scholarly ground, and students of architectural and social history will find little that is not already accessible in Andrew Alpern's "Apartments for the Affluent" (1975); Elizabeth Cromley's "Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments" (1990); or Richard Plunz's "History of Housing in New York City" (1990). Moreover, Ms. Hawes, by focusing on Manhattan, neglects the middle class in favor of the wealthy, and ordinary apartment buildings in favor of famous ones. But she is an engaging stylist, and her vivid prose and the book's excellent illustrations escort the reader into the lavish interiors of New York's grand residences and help us to understand "the conversion of the rich." With economy and grace, "New York, New York" explains how, in a short period of feverish activity, the nation's metropolis assumed its modern shape.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
At the Shubert, 'Will Rogers Follies'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
JUST a week ago, a musical about the showman Mike Todd opened in New York, making a gasping attempt to live up to a reassuring but ultimately misleading title: "Ain't Broadway Grand."
About to enter its third year on Broadway, a block away from the doddering new show, which had a Connecticut tryout last year, "The Will Rogers Follies" delivers the elaborate production numbers, the feel-good songs and the sentimentalized biographical outline that "Ain't Broadway Grand" vaguely promised. 
 Now the "Follies" can be seen at its near best, in the national touring edition, with the original star, Keith Carradine, at the Shubert all week, and it's proving a point about the dearth but not the death of musical comedy.
Once the norm, the lighthearted American song and dance show -- rooted in traditional family entertainment values, Broadway style, with a brassy big time Broadway score -- comes around in the post rock-and-roll age perhaps every decade or so. Before "Will Rogers Follies" (1991), the last such exemplar of extravagance, pizazz and frivolity was "La Cage Aux Folles" (1983).
More throwback than innovation, "Will Rogers Follies" is blessed with the ingenuity of Tommy Tune's direction and choreography to celebrate Broadway's past with witty, teasing references to and variations on dance steps, many his own, that epitomize the Broadway musical.
Given the largesse and extraordinary detail of Willa Kim's shimmering costumes, one wonders whether the real Ziegfeld shows had as much esthetic intricacy. Perhaps the Ziegfeld shows had outrageous headgear and more flamboyant accessories, but it's hard to imagine outdoing the taste and bounty of Ms. Kim's creations on this scale. And Tony Walton's set designs invent the chic open interior space to match the wide open spaces that were Will Rogers's birthright. Realistically, who is going to dream up a show that looks as sumptuous as this one, down to the deep red sequined curtain and splendid staircase glowingly lit by Jules Fisher.
One of the delights of catching a current musical passing through has to do with the contagion of adrenaline that flows through a company on the move, ever readjusting to new audiences, in contrast to the routine, the rote performances, that all too often set in during a lengthy static run.
It's cheering that Mr. Carradine has chosen to tour in the super part that finally defines him as a stage star. He is handed a spectacularly built-up entrance ("Howdy") and he rates the treatment, right on to his last curtain chat with the crowd, and an irresistible country interpretation of "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," the Cy Coleman-Betty Comden-Adolph Green anthem that's guaranteed to make us forget all exceptions to the title, for a few minutes of benevolent escape.
Mr. Carradine's closest support, Dee Hoty, is encumbered as Betty Blake (Mrs. Will Rogers), a role not only as vapid as Mrs. P. T. Barnum in another musical about a big star and his dutifully submissive wife, but bigger. Leigh Zimmerman propels the show from number to number and from scene to scene as Ziegfeld's favorite, more with mechanical competence than performing flair. For other diversions, a roper and a dog act are really neat and germane, personal taste aside.
In its single, shallow dimension, the conceit of Peter Stone's book -- Rogers's life is presented "in revue" -- works as novelty, with Wiley Post, the pilot on the plane crash that killed him and Rogers in Alaska in 1935, seated in the box, urging Will: "Let's go flying." Characters step out with coy asides to the audience, as when Will's father says: "I don't get to be lovable till somewhere in Act II."
For all that, the rise of Will Rogers, from featured act in the St. Louis World's Fair Wild West Show to the biggest star of stage, talking pictures, radio and newspapers -- and a stab at Presidential candidacy in 1928, is cheerily chronicled. He was the Oklahoma Philosopher, the Droll Cowboy, the Sagebrush Sage, the Lariat King (as in "Poet Lariat") and America's Favorite Humorist. And we hear a fair dollop of apothegms: "A man makes a living by what he gets; he makes a life by what he gives."
In one jolting number, "Presents for Mrs. Rogers," a triple threat triumph for director, choreographer and costume designer, a promenade of glitter -- Ms. Kim at her showiest -- is abruptly halted by the announcement of the Depression: "a general economic collapse." The bejeweled new Ziegfeld girls are suddenly draped in burlap. Mr. Carradine's calming address (at President Hoover's request) about homelessness, unemployment and unjust distribution of wealth -- house lights up -- catches an audience off guard. It's 1931: an intrusion of conscience, in Rogers's very words, after the shakedown of the previous scene.
After such an infusion of social consciousness, an upbeat finale is actually more deserved than contrived. So here it is: Broadway showmanship at its most warming. Truly grand it is, giving momentary credence to the stock starry-eyed definition of musical comedy: the two most glorious words in the English language.
"The Will Rogers Follies" at the Shubert Theater, 247 College Street, New Haven; 624-1825. Remaining performances today and next Sunday at 2 and 7, Tuesday through Friday at 8, Saturday at 2 and 8.

HEADLINE: The View From: Mansfield;
With the Loss of an Anchor, a Mall Looks for a Life Preserver

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE announcement that the 104-year-old Sage-Allen Department Store chain would be closing all its stores over the next several weeks will probably have its greatest impact at the East Brook Mall in Mansfield.
The mall already has several empty storefronts, and the closing of the 37,000-square-foot Sage-Allen store, which occupies about 15 percent of the mall's space, will create one of the highest vacancy rates in a Connecticut mall. 
 While the loss of one of the mall's two largest tenants (the other is Caldor) could force other smaller tenants out of business, there is also the possibility that a new tenant could reinvigorate the nearly 20-year-old mall, which has not fared well against the opening of regional malls within a 40-minute drive.
"It's going to do us a lot of harm," predicted Frank Prague, owner of two shoe stores in the mall and who also owns shops in 30 others. "We're going to lose a lot of traffic that the other stores depend on. The mall managers had better get that place rented."
But Mark A. Silvares, who opened his Hot Tees Custom Airbrushing shop on March 20, after the closing announcement, questioned how many customers a store like Sage-Allen was bringing in.
"A lot of the big stores aren't adapting to the economic time," Mr. Silvares said. "Even their best sales, with 20 or 30 percent off their regular prices, are no bargain. People are going to K-Mart and the other discounters."
"If we get one of those discounters in here, Sage-Allen's closing could actually help the mall," Mr. Silvares said. "They get the right tenant in there, and they'll bring a lot of new business in."
 
'Short-Term Negative Effect'
 Others, like Kevin M. Tubridy, who runs Tubridy's women's shop in the mall, are taking a wait-and-see attitude. He estimated that perhaps one in five of the customers at the mall come in to visit Sage-Allen and often stop by other stores while they are at East Brook. "It's going to have a short-term negative effect -- we'd be foolish not to acknowledge that," Mr. Tubridy said. "But if they can get a stronger tenant in there, it will benefit the rest of the mall in the long run."
Town officials in Mansfield, where the East Brook Mall has been one of the major taxpayers since its opening in the mid-1970's, have expressed their concern.
Gregory J. Padick, the town planner, said he had started working with the Windham Regional Planning Agency to develop a network of sidewalks, bikeways and bus stops that would serve nearby residents.
"We're talking about making it more accessible to the people who use the mall now, by making it easier for them to get there," Mr. Padick said. "I don't think these plans will bring any new customers to the mall."
Mr. Padick and others say it is important to take a realistic look at the mall. Because it draws from a shopping population of about 70,000 people in northeastern Connecticut, it will never attract a retailer like Bloomingdale's, which wants a draw of at least 250,000.
"We don't view ourselves as a regional mall," said Elizabeth Fourar-Laidi, director of marketing for the mall, which is managed by Landau and Heyman Inc. of Chicago. "We fill a particular need in this community, providing one-stop shopping close to home."
She said the mall was negotiating with several potential tenants for the space, a process that started months ago, when it was clear the chain was in financial trouble. She said she was hopeful of filling the Sage-Allen store before the Christmas shopping season.
 
Opportunity in New Tenant
 "Everyone's a little sad about the fact that Sage-Allen has been here since the mall opened, and now it's closing," Ms. Fourar-Laidi said. "But we also see it as an opportunity to bring in someone new and exciting."
She said that the closing at least came at a time when there were signs of an economic turnaround in the state; if Sage-Allen had pulled out three years ago the store might still be empty.
Sage-Allen, which employs 1,653 people at its eight stores in Connecticut and Massachusetts, is a subsidiary of Sage-Dey Inc., based in Syracuse, N.Y., which has been in bankruptcy since November.
The Connecticut stores to be closed are mostly at malls. Besides East Brook, there are Sage-Allen stores at the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester, Farmington Valley Mall in Simsbury and Avon, the Hawley Lane Mall in Trumbull, and the Westfarms Mall in Farmington. There are free-standing stores in Old Saybrook and Wethersfield.
Allan R. Travis, a spokesman for Sage-Dey Inc., said all the closings were scheduled for early next month. The company has hired a broker to find substitute tenants for the stores it will be leaving.
"Once the liquidation process is complete, the buildings would be immediately available for new occupants," Mr. Travis said. "The process is going smoothly. We're negotiating with other stores that might be interested in their space, but nothing is at a point where we can talk about it."
 
In Business Since 1889
 Sage-Allen opened in Connecticut in 1889 in Hartford, selling soft goods like clothing, hosiery and linens. Top managers bought out the company from Sage-Allen Corp. in December 1987 with financing from GE Capital, an arm of General Electric Inc. In 1989 GE Capital provided additional funds to expand the store, then a year later it helped Sage-Allen hire a management team that set up the merger with the Addison-Dey chain.
In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, the department store chain determined that liquidation of the Sage-Allen stores was its best hope to pay off $48 million in debt to nearly 800 creditors.
The closings came as a bit of a surprise since Sage-Dey listed $54.2 million in assets on its bankruptcy papers and had originally said it would sell off the former Addison-Dey chain of department stores chain in upstate New York so it could keep the more financially healthy Sage-Allen stores open.
Anthony B. Zehnder, a spokesman for GE Capital, said the company did what it could.
"We worked with and supported Sage management in their attempt to find a way Sage could survive," Mr. Zehnder said. "Those efforts didn't work," so GE Capital helped Sage-Dey work out a plan that provided for maximum payout to employees and creditors, he said.
Retailing experts tend to agree with Mr. Zehnder that it would have been difficult, and expensive, to save Sage-Allen.
"What happened to Sage-Allen was years in coming," said Mary Ellen K. Brigham, a professor of marketing at the University of Connecticut School of Business Administration.
Sage-Allen was classified as a "junior department store," because it carried no hard lines, like furniture or large appliances. Those types of stores were strong from the 1950's to the 1970's in smaller community shopping centers, she said. While most other junior department stores grew up, Sage-Allen never abandoned its approach, she noted, thus, "Sage-Allen really didn't bring in any new customers, and that's where their troubles began."
Four or five years ago Sage-Allen tried to change its appeal, but it was too late, Dr. Brigham said. Also, Sage-Allen's technology was outdated. Modern retailing operations are computerized for quickest turnover of stock, and purchasing and warehousing are controlled tightly. Sage-Allen still did a lot of its record-keeping on paper.
 
Competitors Too Close for Profit
 It also hurts that East Brook is nestled between Buckland Hills and the Crystal Mall, each a short drive away, Dr. Brigham said, and that a new Wal-Mart store is coming into neighboring Windham.
"A place like East Brook is going to really have to be creative to get someone to take that real estate," Dr. Brigham said. "As far as a big department store going in there, it's not going to happen."
The mall managers would do better looking for a discount shop or general merchandiser like a Filene's Basement, a Marshall's, or a T. J. Maxx, she said. At Vernon's Tri-City Mall, Sage-Allen left during a retrenchment three years ago, and T. J. Maxx took over, she said, and now that mall is doing better than ever.
Clearly, the East Brook Mall could use a boost. Shoppers entering from the south must walk by a dark, empty restaurant that has a warning of a sheriff's tax seizure posted in foreboding black block letters on the window. Inside, four other stores are closed, including the Fleet Bank office that closed in November 1991.
 
Only One Restaurant Left
 There is only one concourse shop, where there were several in the mid-1980's boom time. And there is only one restaurant left, a pizza parlor, where shoppers only a few years ago had their choice of three.
Mr. Prague, who runs the two shoe stores at East Brook, said many of the newer tenants were single-shop operations, which rely heavily on the advertising budgets of the anchor tenants to draw customers.
"There are merchants in here who are right on the brink," Mr. Prague said. "They're not going to last that long."
Others were not so pessimistic. Darryl J. Lowen, manager of the General Nutrition Center in the mall, which opened last year, said Sage-Allen's dwindling customer base hurt everyone.
"Someone's going to come in who's going to appeal to a wider customer base," Mr. Lowen said. "I'm not all that upset at this point. The only thing I'm concerned about are the Sage-Allen employees. But for the other shops, it won't be long before we're recovered."

HEADLINE: An Army of the Faithful

BYLINE: By Robert Sullivan; Robert Sullivan is a writer who lives in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
Usually, Christie Adkisson stays home when it snows. But on this particular snowy day, a Saturday at the beginning of January, she and her husband, Jim -- founding members of the Oregon Christian Coalition -- jump in the car for the 45-minute trip into Portland. They pass a few lonely cars along the way, but when they arrive at the downtown Red Lion Hotel they are more pleased than surprised to see the parking lot stuffed with the cars of Oregon's most prominent Republicans. After all, the day is being billed by all concerned as the battle for the soul of Oregon's Republican Party.
Within minutes of the vote for state party chairman -- a contest between two local businessmen -- Bill Witt, a conservative, and Randy Miller, who is only slightly more moderate -- the political skirmishing begins, and the delegates find themselves wrangling over obscure rules and complex voting regulations. "They disenfranchised us twice before," Jim Adkisson says of the party regulars, "but now the shoe's on the other foot." Still, like every other conservative in the room, he is worried about 10 crucial swing votes. "It's going to be close," Adkisson says, pacing past urns of coffee in the back of the Red Lion conference room. 
 Christie Adkisson, sitting up front, is much cooler, for she figures her side will eventually win no matter what the outcome of this contest. After years of tedious legwork, networking through the less glitzy channels of politics -- in malls, at kitchen tables and in the sticky plastic chairs of local churches and schools -- she and her husband and their friends have moved the mountain of political debate in Oregon miles to the right. "This has been a great education," she is saying to the people around her, "and the greatest thing I've learned is that the power of the individual precinct person is tremendous. This is where the rubber meets the road."
If there was one thing the conservative wing of the party didn't want that day, however, it was the coverage the local press was splashing on Bill Witt, their man at the top of the ticket. Witt had helped found the Oregon Christian Coalition the previous fall; yet, when he announced his candidacy for the chairmanship, he also withdrew from the coalition, calling himself "a consensus candidate." To the Oregon press, as well as to frightened Republican moderates and liberals, this sounded ominously like the "stealth tactics" employed by many Christian Coalition members running for school boards, state Republican parties and city council seats around the country last year. ("You should never mention the name Christian Coalition in Republican circles," reads an organizational manual of the Pennsylvania Christian Coalition.)
Employing another well-established tactic, Witt counterattacked by questioning the motives of his critics and the press. "I find it curious that when Christians want to get politically involved, people start asking questions," he says. "There seems to be some special scrutiny."
But this whole issue, as Christie Adkisson already knew, was almost beside the point. Randy Miller, the ostensibly moderate candidate, was anti-abortion and was even opposed by many gay activists. For once, the Christian conservatives felt, the battle was being fought on their terms; that groups like the Christian Coalition could finally force a halt to what they see as a militant homosexual agenda and the decline of traditional morality.
"People are concerned," Christie Adkisson says. "They care. They recognize the importance of their involvement now."
THE CHRISTIAN COALITION WAS spawned in 1989 from the mailing lists of Pat Robertson's failed 1988 presidential campaign. Since then, under its director, Ralph Reed, 31, it has grown into a group with 350,000 members, 750 local chapters across the United States, full-time staff in 15 states, a lobbyist in Washington and an annual budget of $8 million to $10 million.
Though it claims tax-exempt status as a religious-education organization (an exemption that is currently under review by the Internal Revenue Service), its critics argue that its political-training seminars, its fund-raising techniques and its support of causes that are apolitical only on their face (the battle against homosexuals in the military, for example) prove it to be nothing less than a miniature political party -- and one with large ambitions, to boot. "We at the Christian Coalition are raising an army who cares," Pat Robertson wrote in a 1991 fund-raising letter. "We are training people to be effective -- to be elected to school boards, to city councils, to state legislatures and to key positions in political parties." Later in the letter, he added, "By the end of this decade, if we work and give and organize and train, THE CHRISTIAN COALITION WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA."
A lot of Republicans insist the strength of the coalition is greatly overrated. "Never has so much been conjured about something with such little political impact," says Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant. "I mean, I think the Vietnamese have more influence."
But as the best-run organization within what has been called the New Religious Right, the Christian Coalition is a growing force, intent on quietly winning the least visible and vied-for of America's political offices. Under the savvy direction of Reed, a former political consultant, the coalition has managed, in just four years, to prove the potency of a relatively small, highly committed group, in this case a mixture of the evangelical, fundamentalist and charismatic Christians.
For the religious right, the Christian Coalition is the second grass-roots try at modern politics. The first, with groups organized in the style of the personality-driven Moral Majority of Jerry Falwell, dissolved in the 80's when many of the leaders (but not Falwell) fell in a wave of scandals.
This time around, the emphasis is on the rank and file and political nuts and bolts, rather than on personality cults. Those who track its activities claim the Christian Coalition had about 20 members and 8 allies on the 165-member platform committee at the Republican National Committee and controlled seven state delegations at the convention -- including 42 of the 46 Iowa delegates, three-fourths of the Oregon delegation, the majority of South Carolina's and Alaska's delegates and one-third of California's. According to a study by the Institute for First Amendment Studies, a group that monitors the activities of the religious right, seven winners of 1991 congressional races had direct connections to the coalition and 64 others were given 100 percent ratings in voter-education guides distributed by the group.
Taking advantage of low voter turnout and a national decline in party identification, the Christian Coalition has managed to win, by one estimate, 40 percent of the races it has targeted, all with the old-fashioned legwork that had until now been supplanted by mailing lists, computers and media consultants. Says Skipp Porteous, president of the Institute for First Amendment Studies: "People look at TV evangelists and think that's the religious right but it actually has little or nothing to do with it. It's like they have a union hall in every town."
For national Republicans, the emergence of the Christian Coalition represents the latest flare-up in the chronic struggle between the party's conservative and moderate wings. In this latest episode, moderate Republicans charge that the seeds of George Bush's defeat were sown at the Republican National Convention in Houston, with its emphasis on abortion and Pat Buchanan's right-wing rhetoric. In response, members of the Christian Coalition point out that its members provided the former President's only solid electoral support. Says one activist, "Ralph Reed said it best when he said that blaming the Christians for losing the election is like blaming the guys who were shoveling coal on the Titanic."
Nevertheless, recent surveys show that the public now associates phrases like "rigid," "right wing" and "restrictive" with the Republicans. And with Republican voter identification in decline, new groups of moderate Republicans are popping up nearly as quickly as Christian Coalition chapters, each trying to keep a particular segment of the Republican middle from running off with the Democrats or Ross Perot.
At the moment, though, it's not at all clear that any of these new groups will succeed. "The moderates who had stayed with the Republican Party stayed mostly for economic reasons, and put up with the right-wing social agenda, found that in 1992 the economic issues weren't there anymore, so they left," says William Schneider, a political analyst for the American Enterprise Institute. "Now the question is, Is there going to be a civil war in the Republican Party?"
IF THERE IS A CIVIL war, and families like the Adkissons are the infantry, then Darrell Fuller, 27, will be one of the lieutenants. In a double-breasted suit on the floor of the Republican-controlled House, the executive director of the Oregon Christian Coalition looks like another state senator debating health care, a representative talking deals in the house. On weekends, with his wife, he looks for antiques for their apartment in Salem, or drives up to Portland to take in some classical music or, say, the latest traveling Andrew Lloyd Webber play. At the Hi-Ho Diner, wearing polo shirt and khakis, discussing modern politics and natural law, he orders ice cream on his berry pie. He stands as the opposite of the Northwest's well-publicized tendency toward grunge.
Fuller became involved in politics as a student at Willamette University in Oregon, where he worked on local campaigns; when he graduated, he began his own political consulting business. For a while he was a field coordinator with the Oregon Citizens Alliance, the group that sponsored the notorious anti-gay No Special Rights Initiative. The measure, which was defeated last November, would have amended the state constitution to label homosexuality as "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse . . . to be discouraged and avoided."
Now, since the organizational merger of the alliance and the Christian Coalition (the director of the alliance, Lon Mabon, heads the Oregon Christian Coalition's board), Fuller is the coalition's full-time executive director. Because of the merger, critics say, the coalition is strong-arming its way into the political process, capitalizing on ignorance and fear, and equating equal rights for gay men and women with equal rights for pedophiles. But Fuller says he simply wants to give Christians a political voice. "If you're an African-American you have the N.A.A.C.P.," he says. "If you're a small business you have the National Federation of Independent Business and if you work for the government you have the public employees union. Practically all the groups have their lobbyists, except evangelical Christians."
Like many Christian Coalition members, Fuller talks most about what he calls "the militant homosexual agenda," the point of battle in what conservatives call the great cultural war. "I don't care if you believe in evolution or creationism." Fuller says, "Either way, homosexuality is unnatural for government to be sanctioning."
Fear that gay people are becoming the predominant political force in the country is only one concern of Fuller and his members; they also see an overall national decline. "It's a moral degeneration," Fuller says. "The existing values that founded this country aren't represented anymore. And the symptoms of this degeneration are all over the place. Forty years ago in schools the biggest problems were spitballs and bubble gum. Now, it's pregnancy and teen suicide, and we have metal detectors."
Fuller's is a world filled with the social, economic and political problems described in Pat Robertson's books -- a world where the United Nations is on its way to constructing a one-world, godless government, a socialist state, crippled by political correctness, with no place in it for the traditional family. In this light, Fuller and his members see themselves as the last hope, as taking a desperate final stand to keep God as the linchpin of their country. "Everyone's talking about conservatives pushing these issues but conservatives are reacting to the issues," Fuller says.
In fact, like Fuller, most Christian Coalition members around the country became involved in politics for fear of all the more terrible things that might happen if they didn't. As Fuller sees it, it is his task to provide his people with the tools to reverse the decline -- tools like political training seminars, instruction in public relations techniques, voter education guides or whatever else his expertise as a political consultant can offer. "We provide the quote unquote little people with good information," he says, "and we find that when you give good people good information, they make good decisions."
THE POLITICAL party apparatus is organized in such a manner that it makes it very easy for it to be taken over by zealots because they have a cause," says Craig Berkman.
Berkman, a successful Portland entrepreneur, left his chairmanship of the Oregon Republican Party ostensibly to run for the national Republican Party chairmanship, won eventually by a Mississippian, Haley Barbour. Many people in his state, however, believe that Berkman ran for national office because conservatives had enough power in the Oregon Republican Party to prevent him from winning re-election, a charge that Berkman dismisses. Whatever his reason, Berkman, seen as a liberal city slicker by the Christian Coalition and its mostly out-of-Portland kind, is not too friendly toward his party's most conservative wing. "The scripture, as I read it, says that you should be truthful and these people try to tell untruths and disinformation," he says, "and this is the opposite of being Christian to me."
During his four-year tenure, Berkman brought the party out of bankruptcy. But, while the liberal and moderate Republicans were out fund-raising, the conservatives were out winning the precinct seats. Now, like moderate Republicans elsewhere, Berkman has begun to consider ways to counterattack. He is campaigning to have the party organization changed to include its elected representatives and financial donors, so that party activists -- in this case, religious conservatives -- aren't the only ones with a say. He also hopes to require runoffs in state elections that include more than two candidates when no candidate has 51 percent. Unconcerned by his adversaries' charges of elitism, Berkman says simply: "Somebody has to step up and stop this."
Berkman's concerns are shared by moderate Republicans in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and especially Texas. There, Steven Hotze, a proponent of the death penalty for homosexuals (based on a narrow and literal reading of the Bible) is the de facto chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, the third-largest county Republican Party in the country and the home Republican Party to President Bush.
Berkman's concerns are also shared by moderate Republicans watching things like teachers' organizations in Pennsylvania fighting to introduce a state curriculum that the religious right says is anti-God; or a woman running for county sheriff in Louisville, Kent., who the local Pro-Family Coalition says is insufficiently pro-family and who, in any event, "ought to be a man." In New York City, the symbolic heart of godless liberalism, the coalition is backing scores of school-board candidates and has enlisted the Roman Catholic Archdiocese to distribute voter guides in its 213 parishes.
Using the motto "Winning Elections by Inclusion," Burt Day, a moderate Republican from Iowa, has begun Pro Party, a group of Republicans who feel the religious right is involved in politics more for the sake of their key issues (abortion, gay rights) than for the sake of the Republican Party. Having watched the coalition seize control of the Iowa central committee's seats in 1992, Day sees an unremitting political threat. "Republicans in other states say to us, 'Oh, you've got to get along with these people because you can't win elections without them,' " he says. "But they don't understand that these people are very well organized and that their 51 percent becomes 100 percent. They're in it for the long run. They're not going to go away."
Much of what people like Berkman and Day are proposing is being proposed on the national level as well. As is often the case after they lose the White House, Republicans want to make their "Big Tent" big again, which would mean a compromise on abortion. "What the party's got to do is broaden its focus," says Tommy G. Thompson, the moderate Republican Governor of Wisconsin. "People who have certain morals and ethics are welcome as they always have been, but we also have to be more tolerant. We have to take in people who vote with us only 60 percent of the time."
But such appeals, commonplace in Republican circles, go nowhere among social conservatives, for whom there is no compromising on abortion. If moderate Republicans succeed in ripping the anti-abortion plank from the platform, the conservative Christians could leave in force. And that, as moderates well know, could inflict deep wounds on election day.
"The voice of the religious right is a voice that you can't ignore," says Senator Nancy Kassebaum who, with two former legislators, Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Tom Campbell of California, has set up the Republican Majority Coalition. "It's a voice that in many ways comes from people who feel they've never been part of the political process, and they've won their precinct positions fair and square. If we want them back then we've got to go back in there and win them. I don't think that you can just stand back and wring your hands and say, 'Look what's happened!' "
In a recent Wall Street Journal article titled "The Coming 'Conservative Century,' " Irving Kristol, editor of The Public Interest, argues that the key to the future of the Republican Party lies in appealing to the religious voter in the same way the Democrats appealed to European immigrants at the turn of the century. "The Democrats are never going to be able to welcome the religious, but if the Republicans keep them at arm's length instead of embracing them, and shaping their political thinking, a third party and a restructuring of American politics are certain," he warns. The problem is, embracing the religious right -- and its anti-abortion position -- also risks creating a third party, or perhaps a new Democratic majority.
Aware of all this, Craig Berkman has lately made frequent overtures to his party's right wing. Last year, he made a pilgrimage to Ralph Reed's office, where they both promised to work together; and on his final day in office, Berkman called for reconciliation for the sake of winning. For the moment, power in the Oregon Republican Party is in the hands of the conservatives. But the moderates think conciliation on both sides is necessary for the party to survive. "We have to take the steps to be the party of the open door," Berkman said at the Red Lion, in his final speech as party chairman, "not of exclusion and division."
THE ADKISSONS' home outside Portland is something of a Christian conservative's dream world. It is a big patch of rolling land with a cute red farmhouse and a quiet little creek. Their two girls play with the three dogs outside; the new Christian American newspaper is in the den, and family publications are arranged neatly on tables around the house.
Sitting down to reminisce about the past few months of electioneering and grass-roots work, the Adkissons are as proud of their quick and fruitful entry into politics as they are fearful of America's future. For them, the election of the county officers at the Red Lion was the high point of a political involvement that began slowly, if not reluctantly, about five years ago when they helped oppose a state executive order that sought to protect gay rights. Around that time, they'd begun to realize that their way of life was in jeopardy.
"I finally understood that I was in someone's cross hairs," Jim says, sitting in his big-backed comfortable chair. "The things that I believe in and that are important to me, I felt were being targeted. It's like when I was in Vietnam. When someone was targeting you, you knew."
"Obviously," says Christie, speaking of homosexuals, "in the last 20 years since they wrote their homosexual agenda, they have had a methodical plan. That's why we've had to wake up."
Since the Adkissons have begun their political involvement, almost everything they have seen has convinced them of their work's inherent worthiness. Early on, Christie says, she watched Act Up members throw condoms at her and her friends' small children, who then picked them up thinking the condoms were gum. ("A baptism by fire," she calls the experience.) They have been shouted at while collecting signatures in malls; people once came to protest in their own driveway but were scared away when the two Adkisson girls came running from around the house with their BB guns, innocently checking to see what was going on.
Christie's trip to a training seminar for teachers has confirmed her worst fears: that the seminars are designed to advance the gay agenda among children. Likewise, her experience in counseling sessions for homosexuals (she believes homosexuality is an illness that can be treated) has given her hope that, with more work, things can be changed. She believes she is simply doing what any good Christian would do. "This is one of the greatest gifts that I can give my children," she says. "To be what I say I am."
In the meantime, the Adkissons marvel at how they are stereotyped. Jim Adkisson is the president of a software and database company, with a degree in international business. Christie has a B.A. in education and has taken courses in international business. They both hear all the talk about the poor, undereducated Christian voter and laugh.
"I think it's impressive to see," says Christie, in telling about Jim's background and her own, "so that people don't think we're dumb hicks."
Jim says: "In the press the slant is that we're the radicals, we're the crazies. I guess the untold story is that it's not so much that the so-called religious right or social conservatives or whatever brand you want to put on them, it isn't that they're trying to change anything; the untold story is that they're running around trying to put their fingers in the dikes."
The Adkissons are taking a little time to rest these days, feeling worn down by the rigors of the past election. But they remain involved with the coalition, in which they have a great moral investment. "The thing about the coalition," Jim says, "is that it is telling people to stop talking about it and get involved." Sometimes Jim seems to get a little depressed considering the stakes. "The reason I get so emotional," he says, "is that the things I held dear are just not what they were -- our court system, our schools. I don't have the same patriotic allegiance because it's been destroyed by the reality of what these lofty institutions have turned into."
Christie, on the other hand, appears to remain strong and always assured, whether at home or speaking to an audience, moving herself to tears in a small church. Her talks on the infiltration of the gay agenda in the schools are beginning to be recorded and passed around the state. She takes consolation in such things as the fall of Joseph Fernandez, the outgoing chancellor of the New York City Schools, who fought for condom distribution and a controversial Rainbow curriculum. The Adkissons regularly pray that homosexuality will one day be considered wrong in the eyes of the law. To them it is just a matter of realigning man's law with the laws of nature and God.
"Any Christian that tells you that on some of these issues it's all a matter of perspective just doesn't read the Bible," Jim says.
BY MIDMORNING on that snowy winter day in the Red Lion conference room, it was clear to all the party's conservatives that their candidate was going to lose. When the vote finally was taken, Randy Miller beat the conservative candidate, Bill Witt, by just seven votes. "This is a victory for the Republican Party," Craig Berkman said. Then, relinquishing his chairmanship to the barely masked joy of the conservatives, Berkman got into his car and drove away.
The remainder of the election was something of a duck shoot for the Christian Coalition, whose candidates won the remaining seats. To some extent, this was because of the inclement weather: in many cases, the conservatives had managed to outwait the moderates who had to drive -- and, in some instances, fly -- back across the icy state before dark. But it also seemed to have to do with political trickery.
The moderate candidate running for treasurer, for instance, assured by Bill Witt he would have no opposition, discovered a slate backed by the Oregon Citizens Alliance too late in the game for him to start campaigning. It wasn't typical political sour grapes that brought on accusations of lies when Monday morning quarterbacking time came around. All through his campaign Bill Witt was fooling the people who believed he had only incidental connections to the Christian Coalition and the alliance.
Even Witt's loss of the chairmanship felt a little like a win to the conservatives. Lon Mabon, the head of the Oregon Citizens Alliance and the key conservative power broker, announced that he would be able to work with Randy Miller, in light of Miller's anti-abortion stance; he said Miller was nearly a conservative. Jim Adkisson, for one, was pacing a little less now. "The irony is seeing these liberals support Randy Miller when they wouldn't have sat at the same table with him two months ago," he said when it was all over.
Similarly, Darrell Fuller left the hotel thinking to himself that the Oregon Republican Party was now being run by a man who shared many of the key tenets of the Christian Coalition, a fact that would make his life as the coalition's local representative a little easier: in addition to telling people of the cultural havoc being wrought by the Clinton Administration, Fuller could now point to actual political inroads made by the coalition. In fact, minutes after the chairmanship had been lost, quite a few coalition members and other conservatives were beginning to say that Bill Witt could have won by avoiding the fatal stealth label and embracing his membership in the Christian Coalition.
It was getting dark by the time the conservatives were pulling out of the Red Lion's parking lot, and the political fires were dying out; the slush, long ago pushed to the sides of the road, was beginning to creep back and freeze to ice. The Adkissons were two of the last people to leave the Red Lion conference room. Now, finally, after a long and tedious day, Christie could drive home in the car alongside her husband, pull into her driveway, kiss her two daughters hello and know that she had rolled up her political sleeves, stood up for what she believes in and made the world more like the kind of place that she had grown up in -- more the kind of place that she wants her two girls to grow up in, too.
 
 
 
FAITH HEELERS
The Christian Coalition is expanding rapidly across the country, with plans to run two-day political seminars, or Leadership Schools, in 33 states this year. Under the motto "Think Like Jesus . . . Fight Like David . . . Lead Like Moses . . . Run Like Lincoln . . . ," each seminar is designed to teach people how to run campaigns, put together grass-roots organizations and influence local policy making -- using, for example, simple phone trees to pepper legislators with hundreds of phone calls in a matter of minutes.
Calls might be triggered by one of a number of issues that attract the coalition's attention. These include: legislation, municipal or state, that might protect gay men and lesbians from any kind of discrimination; condom distribution in schools; school prayer or the pledge of allegiance, and curriculum changes that mention phrases like "problem solving" or "tolerance," both of which coalition members generally label "new age."
The Christian Coalition has already made its mark in a number of states and regions.

CALIFORNIA. After quietly winning school-board seats in San Diego County, the coalition is becoming more active in Los Angeles. In a fund-raising letter last summer, Sara DiVito Hardnan, the group's California director, wrote: "We are currently involved in a campaign to take back the L.A. school board for pro-family values. . . . We will raise up pro-family candidates to break up the school board."

ILLINOIS. The coalition has recently defeated a proposal for casino gambling in Chicago, is fighting the display of Madonna's book, "Sex," in public libraries around the state and has criticized what the Illinois coalition members call "new age mentalities" in school districts. "You can teach any religion today in public schools as long as it's not Christianity," he said.

PACIFIC NORTHWEST. In Oregon, Washington and Idaho, the coalition is supporting the work of the Oregon Citizens Alliance as it opens affiliates in the region and pushes for state amendments that would make homosexuality unconstitutional.

NEW YORK. A half-dozen Leadership Schools are scheduled to open in 1993, and the coalition plans to run candidates for most of the 288 seats opening up on the New York City school board. The city's Roman Catholic Archdiocese will distribute at least 100,000 of the coalition's voter guides before the school-board elections. These guides typically cast candidates as strictly for or against the family, abortion and "cutting spending rather than raising taxes to balance the budget," as one such guide recently put it.
The coalition's impact has been felt in numerous smaller settings as well. In Lafayette, Ind., it successfully campaigned against a city ordinance designed to protect gay men and lesbians from employment and housing discrimination. In Louisiana, the local coalition director, Sally Campbell, recently opposed the appointment of
Ginger Berrigan, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, as a Federal district judge, calling her a "Hillary-style woman." In Virginia, in addition to sending out filing forms for local Republican Party conventions -- the I.R.S. takes a dim view of such activities by a putatively nonpolitical group -- the coalition sent its members a phone number for information about winning seats in the Virginia Democratic Party.

HEADLINE: Changes in Military and Health Spending Would Slow Job Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
President Clinton's plans to cut Pentagon spending and revamp the health-care system would slow two of the engines of job growth that powered the boom of the 1980's: the military and health care.
Because there has been little job growth in other areas of the economy, Administration officials admit they have little idea where the new jobs will come from over the next decade. Indeed, some officials worry that the overhaul of defense and health care could jeopardize the President's promise to create eight million jobs by the end of 1996. 
 "If you take these two big chunks out of the job-growth picture, it's not at all clear how this vacuum will be filled, especially given the sluggish job growth we've had since 1989," said Jeff Faux, director of the Economic Policy Institute, a research group.
But the President hopes that overhauling military and health-care programs will produce a more competitive economy in the long term. Cutting spending in these two areas will reduce the deficit and interest rates, Administration officials say, helping to fuel new investment that should create new jobs. But these gains may take years to show up, and with the unemployment rate around 7 percent, many Americans are not eager to wait that long.
 
Into the Next Decade
 From 1980 to 1987, when Pentagon spending peaked, the boom in military-related and health-care employment produced one in four new jobs. By some measures, the explosion in health-care spending accounted for all of the nation's job growth over the last four years.
But the Labor Department now predicts that by 1997 military-related employment will have plunged by almost 1.9 million people, or 30 percent, from 1992 levels because of the cuts in Pentagon spending.
As for health-care employment, the Labor Department expects it to continue to grow, but economists say that any aggressive effort to contain health costs could hold down job growth to far lower rates than in recent years.
Over all, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an increase in the number of jobs of 1.2 percent a year from 1990 to 2005 -- just over half the 2.3 percent rate from 1975 to 1990 -- partly because the labor force will be expanding more slowly.
 
Who Will Fare Better?
 Some businesses are expected to fare better as those that depend on the military and health care do worse. The bureau predicts that the service sector, including health-care jobs, will account for almost all of the 25 million new jobs it foresees from 1990 to 2005. The bureau forecasts that health-care jobs will continue to grow, though far more slowly than in the 1980's.
The bureau sees large numbers of additional jobs in retail sales, government (especially education) and business services, like "temp" agencies. For job seekers wanting to know where the fastest employment growth will be, the bureau points to such fields as data processing, public relations, library work, travel agencies and elementary and secondary education.
"To offset the one-third cutback in one industry, defense, there will be a broad array of pluses in others, with a whole bunch of industries growing 2 to 5 per cent," said Roger Brinner, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economics consulting firm.
Although Administration officials acknowledge that the changes in the military and health areas will disrupt the job market in the short term, they say the changes are necessary responses to the end of the cold war and the spiraling costs of health care. And they argue that the results should be seen before long, as money is shifted into more productive sectors.
 
Some Predictions Are Hazy
 "Cuts in defense spending and changes in health care will help hold down the budget deficit and interest rates, which should help lead to a higher investment, higher-growth economy and more -- and more higher-paying -- jobs," said Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist.
While the proposals on military spending are clear -- cutting the Pentagon's budget by 14 percent over five years -- the Clinton health plan is still being drafted, making it hard to predict how it will affect job growth, many economists say. On one hand, the plan is expected to involve some strong measures to hold down costs, but many experts say overall health-care spending will still continue to rise, although at a slower rate, because the Administration has signaled that it would provide medical coverage to 35 million Americans without health insurance.
"There is still potential for growth in medical services, but it just won't be as strong if the cost-containment measures are effective," said Kurt Karl, an economist with the WEFA Group, a consulting firm.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that unless there are sharper-than-anticipated cuts in health-care spending, some health-care occupations will continue to grow strongly, principally because of the aging of the population. The bureau sees relative rapid job growth for nurses, residential-care workers and medical office workers.
 
What Changes in Medicine?
 Because the Administration is expected to attack high-technology medicine and administrative costs in its efforts to hold down health spending, many experts foresee changes in the makeup of health-care employment. "Many people believe that successful health-care reform will involve reducing the number of medical specialists and claims processors in the insurance industry and increasing the number of generalists and nurse practitioners," said Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The lower interest rates resulting from cuts in the budget deficit are expected to weaken the dollar, and that should spur exports. But few economists see much growth in export-related manufacturing jobs -- or in manufacturing jobs over all -- because they expect continuing increases in productivity.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that employment in the manufacturing sector will fall to 18.5 million jobs by 2005, from 19.1 million in 1990. Among the reasons for this decline are cutbacks in military spending and increased productivity, meaning layoffs to hold down costs.
 
Reagan BuildUup Recalled
 Largely because of the military buildup under President Ronald Reagan, employment in military-related manufacturing soared to 1.86 million in 1987, from 1.09 million in 1977. Norman Saunders, a senior economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, forecasts that military-related manufacturing jobs will plunge to 812,000 in 1997. He anticipates sharp drops in producing missiles, missile engines and ships.
To cushion the effects of the military-related layoffs, the Clinton Administration has begun a conversion effort that is intended to provide job training and help factories shift toward civilian production.
"The most compelling reason for defense conversion is the disgrace when someone trained as a scientist has to give up that profession," said Gene Sperling, deputy adviser to the President for economic policy. "Our goal is not to do defense conversion as a government jobs program, but to do investments in civilian technologies," like high-speed rail or new air-traffic control systems.
"That will help economic growth," he said, "and to the extent it helps defense conversion and injured communities, it will be a double winner."

Big companies could serve as their own health insurers under a plan being worked out by President Clinton's health policy advisers. The plan drew strenuous objections from labor unions.

HEADLINE: As States Rush Into Gambling, Experts See Risks

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss., April 20

 BODY:
The nation's riverboat gambling industry, hesitantly resurrected from Puritanical oblivion two years ago by Iowa, is now booming forth on the waters of cutthroat interstate competition that gambling experts warn could prove ruinous for revenue searchers and bettors alike unless the states establish boundaries and common wagering standards.
Fifteen casino boats are already afloat on the Mississippi and Gulf Coasts, and at least 30 more are expected this year as states and localities scramble to benefit from a vastly altered public attitude toward gambling. 
 "We are clearly in a speculative bubble right now, with people lining up on the Mississippi coast exactly the way they did when Atlantic City opened 15 years ago," said I. Nelson Rose, a gaming-law professor at Whittier Law School in California. He cautions governments rushing into the gambling business to remember that seven of the 13 Atlantic City casinos eventually had to seek bankruptcy protection.
In the states' competition to corner gambling revenues, Mississippi has already lured two of Iowa's pioneer boats to steam down to this revivified gulf port, where four dockside, 24-hour casinos will soon be joined by four more. Mississippi has some of the most relaxed gambling and tax rules in the nation, dropping requirements that boats actually have to set sail or have betting limits or even be true boats with engines.
Converted barges are serving as casinos too, tapping into some of the growing national action in legalized card, dice and slot games that have enabled small-town America to exploit what are for now rich, casino-free markets from Chicago to New Orleans.
 
Cannibalizing Profits
 But those two cities are considering huge land casino and hotel projects. These waterfront redoubts against the revenue-trawling boats could turn current easy profits into sudden deficits for communities that have floated bonds and budget obligations along with their casino boats.
"The tragic thing is governments aren't cooperating and are cannibalizing each other. They will have to go through a few budget cycles to realize that gambling isn't going to do it for all of them," cautioned William N. Thompson, a gambling and public administration expert at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He says that either interstate compacts or Federal controls will eventually be needed to settle the competitive chaos.
Gambling boats, which operated outside the law in the frontier era, are being resurrected from turn-of-the-century prohibition by economically hard-pressed state and local governments. The boats offer politicians an off-shore way to raise revenue while obeying the dictate of "no new taxes" at a time when gambling and drinking have been overshadowed by issues like abortion as the main target of moralistic politicking.
Since Iowa opened the modern era of riverboat gambling, Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi and Louisiana have joined the legalization and a dozen other state legislatures are considering dockside or water cruising casinos. The very first riverboat casino opened only two years ago in Fort Madison, Iowa, a community of 12,000 on the Mississippi that saw its emporium, the Emerald Lady, jilt Iowans last summer for the more go-go market in Biloxi.
"Iowa needed to appear to retain some moral qualifications," Professor Rose explained, referring to state mandates for real cruising and $5 maximum bets and $200 maximum losses per bettor. The limits, he said, crimped the lucrative industry phenomenon known as Gamblers' Ruin: with enough time and betting leeway, a casino will win all gamblers' stakes but still leave them relatively satisfied with the memory of occasional winnings.
 
Taxes and Lost Jobs
 The pioneer Iowa town, left in Emerald Lady's wake with 350 lost gambling jobs, had to approve an emergency property tax increase to meet this year's $55,000 debt payment on a new, now empty, dock and riverfront development built with a $2.5 million bond.
"But we have another boat coming in eight months," said Mayor Arlene J. Carlson, saying the new investors promise not to leave for frothier wagering waters. "We feel it's a viable industry for us," she insisted, even after a bill to liberalize betting limits died this week in the Iowa legislature. Ed Ernst, an Iowa resident who moved the Emerald Lady and joined it to another boat at dockside here, said he was sorry to leave Fort Madison, but there were profits to consider. Amiably defending the industry's vagabond quality as his games whirred, beeped and clattered here, Mr. Ernst remarked, "Like they say, you got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them."
Over at a stud poker table, the talk grew terse but players were hardly wide-eyed as the pot moved beyond $43,500. At the slots, Cheryl Battiste, fresh from the morning line at a fish cannery, resolutely pumped away $1 tokens until she lost $60 in 90 minutes. "I needed that added excitement," she said, darting out to the city's glaring, 26-mile beachfront that is being improved with gambling revenues.
The Iowa boats' annual losses of $7.5 million up North have been more than turned around handsomely here, said Mr. Ernst, who is busy with expansion plans. The Diamond Lady is soon to move on to Vicksburg, opening another Mississippi gambling spa.
Mississippi's edge in the interstate competition is exemplified by the good ship Splash, fitted last year into a manmade trench removed from the mighty waters and the need to ply them. It has become a stationary bonanza for Tunica, which has been one of the poorest hamlets in the nation. Instant profits have sparked voters to approve gambling initiatives in 14 of 18 Mississippi waterway counties. Even in DeSoto County, where voters have said no to gambling three times, speculators are building a riverboat dock in hopes of turning the local tide.
But even as Tunica exploits the nearby rich market of Memphis, politicians in Tennessee are pursuing the now familiar course of debating whether to protect their interests and with their own projects.
The riverboat revival was made easier by the widespread acceptance of state lotteries and the reduction of the sense of scandal about gambling. No less a factor has been an even larger boom in casinos on Indian reservations. Supreme Court rulings extended considerable gambling sovereignty to the tribes and now there are close to 150 Indian casinos nationwide.
Now, dozens of states and cities are considering land casinos in a competition against both tribe and riverboat. There have already been casualties: in Colorado's free-rein venture in three mountain towns more than 60 legal casinos rushed to open; one-third of them closed in little more than a year.
 
Liquid Assets
 The boats have already demonstrated an advantage in being able to change ports as markets dry up. They can be put in operation so much more cheaply and quickly than land casinos that they are attracting investment from gambling industry companies in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. This, combined with the states' frenzy for revenues, means that the risk grows of a glut in the market.
"This is not economic development," said Professor Thompson. A region needs strong additional attractions to weather overdevelopment of gambling, he said; otherwise it will lose the critical element, tourist money, and wind up essentially taxing its own residents at increasingly unpopular casinos.
"A Las Vegas or a French Quarter is a natural development across time," he said. "The government doesn't will these things into being and make them attractive."

HEADLINE: Loan Fund In Danger At S.B.A.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The Small Business Administration's popular loan-guarantee program will run out of money this week, a victim of the Clinton Administration's inability to push its economic stimulus package through Congress.
Demand from small businesses for the guaranteed loans has been growing much faster than the budget for the program, and beginning on Tuesday the agency will stop approving the loans until Congress acts to increase the budget, an agency official said Friday. 
 Under the program, businesses borrow from banks or other financial institutions, not from the Government, which guarantees 90 percent of the loans. Without those guarantees, many small businesses cannot borrow on affordable terms. The commercial lenders said they were hoping that Congress would restore the money.
"We just don't know," said Anthony R. Wilkinson, president of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. "The jobs bill was the vehicle for the S.B.A. to get its supplemental appropriation, and as of this moment in time I'm not aware that any other vehicle is moving through Congress."
 
A Pledge of Repayment
 The Government guarantee pledges repayment of up to $750,000, and the loans are commonly made at close to market rates. But the program also provides other favorable terms, like long repayment periods, that are often not available to small businesses.
Some lenders said they would continue to take applications, but not for long.
"In two weeks, if there does not seem to be a prognosis for a supplemental appropriation, the industry is going to shut down," said Bailey Barnard, president of the Heller First Capital Corporation of San Francisco, the small-business lending subsidiary of Heller Financial Inc.
"It's just mind boggling that Congress and the Administration would let this happen," he said.
Members of Congress, including Republican Senators who acted to block the stimulus package, said they believed that the small-business loans were valuable and that a way would be found to restore them for the balance of this year.
"I am urging that Congress act on that separately, and to pay for it as we go," said Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota and a member of the Small Business Committee.
Under the program, the S.B.A., must put a small amount of money into reserve for each loan it guarantees. The S.B.A. has written so many deals since the fiscal year began in October that it has now used up practically all of this year's money and will have to stop approving loans. It would take $141 million of additional appropriations to support an additional $2.5 billion in loans over the $3.6 billion in the budget, the agency says, bringing total lending up to $6.2 billion for the year.
 
Problems for a Separate Bill
 The S.B.A. loan provision in the stimulus bill would have been paid for with borrowed money. But budget rules require that any separate appropriations bill be offset by tax increases or spending cuts in other programs. That would make a separate bill more difficult to enact.
When the loan program was in danger of running out of money last year, the Bush Administration initially proposed financing additional guaranteed loans by cutting other programs. After the proposed cuts proved politically unpalatable to Congress, the Administration acquiesced to an emergency bill that increased the Federal deficit.
This year, however, Republican Senators steadfastly refused to give the same emergency status to the Clinton stimulus package, of which the S.B.A. program was a relatively small part.
On Friday, Ed Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, said the group would step up its lobbying for the guarantee program and other measures intended to spur lending to small businesses.
"Everyone talks about helping small business, and this really does go in the opposite direction at this point," he said.
 
Cutbacks for Next Year
 Lenders noted that the Administration was planning to scale back the guarantees next year to save money, and said that would result in many small businesses being unable to qualify.
The Administration's budget would cut financing for loan guarantees by 12.5 percent. The guarantees would be cut to an average of 75 percent of the amount borrowed, from the current average of 81 percent, and when banks resold the guaranteed parts of the loans to investors, as is commonly done, an annual charge of one-half of a percentage point would be levied. That would cut the Government's costs to $155 million for the year, while allowing it to guarantee a total of $6.6 billion in loans during fiscal 1994.
Lenders said that these proposals contradict President Clinton's longstanding promises to spur growth among small businesses, which he considers the most effective job-creating strategy.
"The Bush and Reagan Administrations proposed the same thing every year, and it got voted down," said Mr. Barnard of Heller First Capital. "But then it was a Republican Administration that we knew was against the program. Now you have a Democrat saying basically the same thing. For all Clinton is talking about supporting small business, he's not."
The problems for the loan program come at a time when many banks have cut back on risky loans to small businesses in an attempt to repair their own balance sheets.
 
The Surge in Demand
 From 1991 to 1992, the S.B.A. experienced an increase of 37 percent in loan demand. For fiscal 1992, Congress initially appropriated funds to support $4.2 billion in loans, but eventually raised the guaranteed amount to $5.6 billion. For fiscal 1993, the Bush Administration received its requested funding to support $3.6 billion in loans, in the last budget enacted before Mr. Bush was voted out of office.
Since the fiscal year began in October, however, demand for the loans has again outstripped supply. Lenders, pointing out that loan demand is usually highest in the second half of the year, contend that borrowers could use as much as $7.2 billion this year if Congress would support the program.
In December, having spent all the funds available for the first three months of the fiscal year, the agency briefly stopped approving guaranteed loans. In January, it resumed at an even faster pace, on the assumption that President Clinton would shortly win his planned expansion of the program. The Office of Management and Budget gave the agency permission to spend as quickly as it liked, reserving nothing for the last six months of the year.
The Clinton Administration has estimated that replenishing the fund would create more than 12,000 jobs by the end of 1994.
Next year, according to Congressional testimony, the S.B.A. plans to make about 26,000 general business loans, not counting disaster loans.

HEADLINE: President Asks for Time and a Little Tenderness

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 25

 BODY:
Offering an edgy accounting of his first 100 days in office, President Clinton told newspaper executives meeting here today that he has been judged too early and too harshly by his partisan opponents and by the press.
"When people say to me, 'Well, what did you do in your first 100 days?' -- well, what did the other guys do in their first 100 days?" Mr. Clinton said in a rambling, largely unscripted speech in which he offered a belated but vigorous defense of the economic bill that Congress blocked last week. 
 "You can't expect instant results," he told a college student who said that young people were disappointed in his Presidency. "It took 12 years to get into the situation that I found when I took office. It takes time to get things done.
"That's why you get a four-year term, not a three-month term."
 
'Idea Battle' With Republicans
 Acknowledging in a speech to the Newspaper Association of America, a group of newspaper publishers, that "it's been a long week," Mr. Clinton said he is engaged in an "idea battle" with Republicans in Congress who rejected his call for increased spending to create jobs and spur local development.
"For those who serve in government and for those who watch government up close in Washington, it's all too easy to concentrate on the daily events and the inside stories, to worry about who's up or down or in or out, who won or who lost the moment's battle, too easy to forget about the real people whose real lives will be changed for better or worse by what we do or do not do," Mr. Clinton said.
The tone of the President's remarks betrayed some of his irritation over coverage of his Administration's missteps, which he said overshadowed its victories. The White House today issued a glossy brochure titled "Season of America's Renewal: First 100 Days" that detailed what were described as its early accomplishments, including speeches, bill signings and every meeting Mr. Clinton held with Congressional leaders.
"We cannot solve the problems of this country if every last issue that comes up -- just because the President recommends it -- becomes a source of a filibuster in the Senate," he said. "Or, frankly, attracts only members of my own party. I don't want that. I want us to debate these ideas anew, to look at them anew, to take our blinders off."
 
'Piously Talking'
 Mr. Clinton's speech was a far more concerted defense of the defeated package than he ever offered in formal speeches when he was trying to win support in Congress.
He said today that it had never been his intention to make the plan a major goal of his Administration. And he said that lawmakers who rejected the section of the measure that would have paid for free vaccines for children were placing politics over progress.
"There is such an incredible gulf in this country between what we say and what we do, it is an awful burden to bear if you're a serious American citizen," Mr. Clinton said. "You hear all this talk about how much we care about our children. Well, I'll tell you something. We make over half the vaccines in the world in this country, and we have the third worst immunization record in the Western Hemisphere.
"And everybody goes around piously talking about how all this government stimulus program was a bunch of pork barrel," he continued. "It wouldn't have been pork barrel for the kids we would have immunized against preventable childhood diseases."
 
Echoes of the Campaign
 Mr. Clinton seemed surprised at his own verbosity, remarking near the end of his 45-minute speech that he had spoken longer than he intended.
He also recycled some of his favorite phrases from the campaign, giving the appearance of a captain intent on reorienting a ship gone off course.
"We ought to be guided by three simple things," he said. "How can we create opportunity, how can we require all of us to behave more responsibly, and how can we build a stronger American community. And I don't believe the answer necessarily has a partisan tinge."
Mr. Clinton said his Administration has "begun to fundamentally change the direction" of the Government by winning passage of a budget resolution that reduces the deficit and presiding over the reduction in mortgage interest rates.
The President largely avoided the overt criticism of Congress that he voiced during the days leading up to the defeat of the economic package. But he professed bewilderment at the partisan nature of the attacks on his economic program, especially the barbs directed at his support of a community development program.
"You know, all we did was change the party or the personality of the White House," he said. "We didn't change the party or the personality of the governors and the mayors. I don't know what happened that that program was such a bad idea all of a sudden."
And while he was careful to praise the newspaper executives for their independence of thought, he also scolded reporters for paying what he considered to be far too much attention to the Administration's setbacks.
"The defeat of the $16 billion stimulus package got 50 times the press coverage of the passage of the multitrillion-dollar budget resolution," he said. "Why? Because we won."
Shunning the prepared remarks and prompters that have become customary when he delivers formal speeches, Mr. Clinton appeared mostly interested in stating unequivocally what was on his mind.
"If people thought I'd be President, and 90 days later every campaign commitment I made would be written into the law, and everybody's life would be changed, I think that's just not realistic," he said.

HEADLINE: Buying Barnegat Bay For Natural Necklace

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORKED RIVER, N.J., April 25

 BODY:
Piece by piece, salt marsh by salt marsh, environmentalists and the Federal Government are pushing to preserve the last tracts of undeveloped shoreline along Barnegat Bay, the shallow 75-square-mile estuary that is one of the least heralded but most important coastal resources in the northeastern United States.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, aided by local and national conservation groups, has expanded its Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge northward along the New Jersey coast to acquire open marshland squeezed between condomimiums and expensive waterfront homes that have spread along the rim of the bay over the last four decades. 
 Some 7,000 acres have been approved for purchase, pending Congressional appropriations, and another 6,600 acres are being studied for acquisition for the Forsythe refuge. The refuge already includes 40,000 acres of wetlands in separate clusters, like an emerald necklace. It is the second largest in the service's Northeast region of 13 states between North Carolina and Canada, after the Great Dismal Swamp refuge in Virginia and North Carolina.
While some hunters, boaters and clammers chafe at the restrictions in the refuge, environmentalists and officials are eager to preserve more shoreline and say the current recession and decline in real-estate prices are aiding their effort.
 
'Window of Opportunity'
 "The last few years have been a window of opportunity to add valuable land to the refuge," said Rose Harvey, regional vice president of the Trust for Public Land, which acquires environmentally important land for the public. "The opportunity may not exist in the future."
Housing and recreational development, which accelerated during the 1980's, degraded water quality and imperiled tidal wetland along Barnegat Bay's 30-mile length. The bay is a crucial link in the Atlantic flyway for migratory waterfowl, Federal and state officials said.
The entire bay, from Bay Head in the north to the Long Beach Island causeway in the south, and most of its watershed lie in Ocean County, the fastest growing county in the nation's most densely populated state. The year-round population of the county is about 450,000, up from 56,000 in 1950. In the summer, when visitors flock to the beaches and weekend boaters jam the broad bay and estuaries like the Metedeconk River, Toms River and Forked River, the population doubles to about one million.
Even with this tremendous growth, and with New York City and Philadelphia barely 90 minutes away by car, Barnegat Bay seemed to retain its natural charm and beauty. It endured heavy recreational use in the summer, but recovered over the winter, residents and visitors believed. With a few exceptions, there was no industry to pollute local waters.
 
Flyway Habitat Damaged
 But changes were taking place over the years that damaged the flyway habitat for tens of thousands of migratory birds, said Willy deCamp Jr., president of the Izaak Walton League of Ocean County, an environmental group instrumental in obtaining wetlands for the refuge.
By the 1970's Federal and state laws had slowed down the wholesale draining and filling. Dredging permits were no longer routinely issued so houses and marinas could rise behind bulkheads, manmade barriers to keep the shore from eroding.
By this time, however, bulkheads had been built along most of the northern bay and its estuaries, preventing water from washing onshore and filtering out impurities, and the marshes and meadows had been replaced by waterfront cottages and expensive homes. Ocean County lost 30 percent of its tidal marsh acreage between 1953 and 1973.
Two strokes of fortune helped preserve the bay shoreline north of Barnegat Inlet, the sole break in 30 miles of barrier island separating the bay from the ocean.
In the early 1950's, the state bought the Phipps Estate, an 8-mile long section of the barrier island immediately north of the inlet, and made it a public park left essentially in its natural state, now called Island Beach State Park.
The other factor was the bay's shallow waters, which range from 1 to 13 feet in depth. Mud-covered shoals and marshes discouraged building along the waterfront if no channels opened to deeper water. It is these undeveloped waterfront lands, for the most part, that are sought for the refuge.
 
From Pines to Commuters
 But the lands behind the wetlands were developed for housing, roadways and shopping centers. Brick Township on the mainland just west of the upper bay went from scrub pine woods to a community of more than 65,000, and many of the residents were daily commuters to northern New Jersey and New York. Other subdivisions spread through Dover, Berkeley, Lacey, Ocean and Stafford Townships to the south along the bay, while Manchester Township, in the headwaters of the Toms River, filled with retirement communities.
"The major culprit now is the runoff of gasoline products, fertilizers and animal wastes from roadways and lawns," said Mr. deCamp, who owns a summer home in Mantoloking. "It all ends up in the bay."
Environmentalists say the stakes in Barnegat Bay are considerable.
These wetlands serve as the winter home for 35 percent of the entire Atlantic flyway population of black ducks and 70 percent of the flyway's American brant population, according to Fish and Wildlife estimates. Further, the bay is an important feeding, nesting and migratory habitat for 287 other species of waterfowl and birds, officials said.
 
Pollution Reduces Catch
 A decline in water quality has also hurt fish and shellfish in the bay, reducing the recreational and commercial catch and forcing many of the area's traditional baymen to abandon clamming and seek other work in a county where unemployment is above 9 percent.
There is also concern that increased boat traffic in the summer causes turbidity that blocks sunlight from reaching eelgrass on the bay bottom that forms an important part of the local food chain.
These issues, while not exclusive to the area, are showing tentative signs of uniting Ocean County residents who have always been separated by water, economics, summer or winter residency and even preferences like motorboats over sail.
"Concern over the bay is beginning to knit together a whole new pattern of people," said John Sly, a retired educational consultant in Forked River. A total of 33 local governments have some authority in the bay and its watershed, and this often makes consensus difficult on what action to take, he said.
"It drives me insane when people say they're only worried about what happens in their neighborhood," said Mr. Sly, 67.
The bay, all 75 square miles of it, is at everyone's front door, he said, and what affects one corner of it will eventually affect another corner of it.
Mr. Sly's backdoor looks out across 350 acres of salt marsh that the Federal wildlife officials are investigating, along with 10 other mainland tracts and six bay islands, for inclusion in the Forsythe refuge.
If the purchase is approved, it may take years for Congress to appropriate funds under the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965. To aid the sales, conservation groups like the Trust for Public Lands may act as a middleman, buying the properties and conveying them to public agencies as funds become available.
Not everyone is thrilled with the expansion of the refuge.
Some people, chiefly hunters, are unhappy with refuge management policy, which they say is too restrictive on the shooting of ducks, geese and other animals in an area with a tradition of gunning clubs and duck blinds on marshes previously in private hands. Boaters and clammers also complain that the refuge, with its boating and clamming limits, shuts them off from many areas that made living near the bay so enjoyable.
Generally, though, these same critics agree they would rather see the tidelands protected than undergo the kind of development that has transformed land surrounding the bay from a semi-rural wilderness into a hodgepodge of single-family houses and strip shopping centers.

HEADLINE: Army Deploys Tanks in Peru in Challenge to New Congress

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 25

 BODY:
In what perhaps is the first severe test of Peru's new Congress, the army sent tanks onto the streets of Lima last week to challenge a Congressional investigation.
The Congress, recently elected as part of President Alberto K. Fujimori's restructuring of the Government after he seized extraordinary powers, is investigating the army's role in the killings of nine university students and a professor at Enrique Guzman University last year. 
 They were said to be suspected members of Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group. The army commander, Gen. Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, has refused to answer questions about the matter.
In an angry response to the investigation, the army issued a communique labeling some members of Congress as allies of terrorists, then drove Russian-built tanks through Lima in a show of force. The commanders of the navy, air force and police all aligned themselves behind General Hermoza.
President Fujimori, who suspended the seated Congress and the Constitution last year, has tried to play the role of conciliator in the current conflict. He needs the support of the military to continue buttressing his Government. But he has been told by the United States and the Organization of American States that if he fails to bring the country back to a democracy, all economic aid to Peru will be cut off.
 
A Call From Washington
 The military's saber rattling so concerned Washington that Bernard Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, telephoned President Fujimori on Thursday, warning him that the conflict in Peru was a potential threat to both the democratic process and to international aid.
Lourdes Flores Nano, an opposition member of Congress, said: "This could have been disastrous for us here. This was the army essentially saying it did not regard the Congress as part of the Government."
The incident underlies the fragility of the democratic process here and the continued fear that if it is pushed too far, especially in the area of human rights, the armed forces could step in and take control.
Western officials here said the army's reactions reflected a frustrated military that has been battling the Shining Path and has made significant gains, but is loath to confront charges of human rights abuses by troops.
"The army feels that it has been the front line against the Shining Path and should be above criticism by Congress, despite periodic abuses," a Western official said. "Some disappearances and extrajudicial killings are necessary, they say, and that no one has the right to question the integrity and dignity of the institution."
 
Army Morale Low
 The actions of the Shining Path were one reason President Fujimori gave for seizing special powers.
Western analysts said the army was having morale problems fueled by low salaries and by bitterness against the President for installing officers loyal to him and bypassing the institutional system of promotion.
The investigation into the killing of the students and the professor began last month when a member of Congress, Henry Pease, received an anonymous document, supposedly from dissident members of the army, describing the July 17, 1992, raid on the university.
According to the document, the students and the professor, all suspected of being members of the Shining Path, were taken to a local field, executed and then buried with the approval of the high command of the army.
The next day, according to the document, the officers involved exhumed the bodies and buried them in what was considered a more secure location.
The document, which Western officials say is credible, is unusual in that it names people supposedly involved in the killings and gives considerable detail about the raid.
 
Document's Validity Denied
 The Clinton Administration has warned President Fujimori that the fastest way to have aid from Washington cut off is by permitting human rights violations in Peru's war on terrorism.
But when General Hermoza was asked about the document in a congressional committee hearing on Tuesday, he denied its validity and refused to answer key questions.
On leaving the Congress, he said in an impromptu news conference: "A group of Congressmen who opposed the Government have started a campaign to disparage and insult the Peruvian army and armed forces, which can put in danger the stability of the country. We are not going to tolerate this game under any circumstances."
On the next two days the army sent up to a half a dozen tanks onto the streets.
By week's end, the Minister of Defense, Gen. Victor Malca, addressed the Congress and said that the armed forces "did not intend to threaten the Congress."
Miss Flores Nano, however, said that while many might say the incident was past, the integrity of the Congress needed to be reaffirmed. She said that this week she intended to call General Hermoza to testify again.

The publishers of the nation's major newspapers are meeting here today and this is some of what they are talking about: selling advertising in telephone books and using new technology to supply soap opera updates.
Many publishers have found that they cannot make as much money as they were accustomed to making the old-fashioned way, so across the country they are entering businesses that are sometimes so far from the traditional that they barely involve news -- or even, for that matter, paper. 
 Newspapers are supplying marketing services, helping race tracks and pizza delivery companies, for example, select readers who might be interested in a wagering afternoon or a pie with anchovies. Newspapers are direct-delivery agencies that compete with the post office, they are sellers of faxes, sources of personal-computer data, printers of special-interest magazines and publishers of telephone books that compete for advertising with the listings by the phone company.
Nearly a third of all major newspapers are now "audiotext" suppliers, letting telephone callers dial up not only news and weather, but also classified ads read by a computerized voice, stock-market information, loan rates, race results, lottery numbers and soap opera updates. (Press "1" to find out how Mimi's pregnancy is going and whether Lee declared her love for Terry).
"We are at the beginning of a time when the newspaper as it is historically viewed will take on a broader role," said Cathleen Black, the president of the Newspaper Association of America, the publishers' trade organization, which is holding its annual convention here. "It doesn't only have to be a traditional newspaper as we know it."
The new newspaper ventures began largely when advertising plummeted during the recession. Though most newspapers now say business is better, there is general agreement that some types of advertising are probably gone forever. Without changes, many in the industry say, newspapers will never return to the profit levels of the mid-1980's.
Few of the new ventures are big money makers yet, but most offer promise. Many of the 465 newspaper audiotext systems in operation work, for example, by encouraging readers to make free telephone calls to listen to recorded messages that follow 15-second paid commercials. The Washington Post says its three-year-old Post Haste telephone system getss 800,000 calls a month.
 
Loss of Focus?
 As newspapers adapt to the new enterprises, they are changing sharply as commercial and journalistic institutions. In the process, some in the industry fear, newspaper people risk losing track of a once-popular notion that advertising was merely the means to the end of disseminating information, not the end itself.
The flood of new ventures, some of the critics say, has created a dangerous shift in priorities at many newspapers. Instead of gathering information only because it might interest readers, many newspapers now gather information, like Government records and data on reader preferences, with the hope of reselling it.
"It is dangerous to the kind of public-interest journalism we are obliged to practice if we accept the protection of the First Amendment," said Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for journalists at Harvard University. "There is the risk that the news decisions are made on the value of the information for resale, rather than on the value of the information to the reader."
But many publishers say the objective is not merely to return to what were unusually high financial returns of the 1980's. They say long-term trends indicate that many newspapers must fight to keep their business niches or they will wither.
For years there have been steady signs of declining reader interest in many newspapers, although there are some that continually increase their circulation despite business trends. Also, because of such changes as the demise of big retailers and the growth of new advertising vehicles like cable television and direct mail, many newspaper advertisers have simply vanished.
Some publishers say many of their new businesses, like selling marketing information about readers and local residents, are needed to enhance demand for advertising. "The demand is dropping -- demand for basic, plain-vanilla newspaper advertising," said W. Stacey Cowles, publisher of The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Wash. "We're not selling space anymore. We're really trying to find marketing solutions for our customers."
 
Newspaper as Marketer
 For the last decade or so large media conglomerates have been investing in new media services and exploring new ways of selling information.
The Spokesman-Review, owned by Mr. Cowles's family, recently helped a local store turn premium dog food into a hot item with a marketing scheme that newspaper executives say is likely to become popular.
Northwest Feed wanted to sell dog food. From a computer, Mr. Cowles's staff produced information gleaned from a reader survey that identified 10,000 Spokesman-Review readers who were dog lovers.
The dog-loving newspaper subscribers then received letters alerting them to watch for newspaper ads with coupons and get-your-pet-photographed offers. Northwest Feed told Mr. Cowles that it won 600 new customers and was persuaded that The Spokesman-Review knew how to tap its market.
Across the country, Pizza Hut has been especially active in using such newspaper marketing programs.
Newspaper executives say they hope to increase revenues. But many say that even if the new ventures only produce modest profits in the short run, newspapers cannot afford not to start them.
If newspapers allow other businesses, like telephone companies or national marketing companies, to erode their position as the primary supplier of information to communities, they say, newspapers could lose their special place forever.
"I'm going to be No. 1 in my city in providing information, so nobody else can come in and take this away from me," said Tim Gallagher, editor of The Albuquerque Tribune.
For the last three years, Mr. Gallagher's newspaper, like about a dozen others in the country, has been supplying what it calls an "electronic supplement to the newspaper" -- a data service accesssible by personal computer that gives readers access to volumes of information not printed in the newspaper.
In addition to full texts of news wire services purchased by the newspaper, Electronic Tribune subscribers can read old restaurant and movie reviews, drunken-driving court records and information on local landlord-tenant disputes.
 
New Alliances With Old Rivals
 The new business climate is prompting newspaper people to shelve old rivalries and stretch old rules. For example, in a once unthinkable practice, some newspapers are now forging alliances with their old television and radio enemies.
The Sarasota Herald-Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company, has a new pact with the local ABC television station under which the newspaper supplies the station with some of its following day's articles. When the station uses the news, it advises viewers to pick up the next day's Herald-Tribune for a fuller account.
In an arrangement that was opposed by some journalists, Milwaukee newspaper readers this winter received added coverage of professional hockey and indoor soccer. The Milwaukee Journal and Sentinel, its spokesman, Bob Dye, said, promised half a page a week of new coverage for each of those sports after the two local professional teams complained about lack of coverage.
The newspaper, Mr. Dye said, promised to add that coverage if the two teams would each buy a half-page of advertising every week. "To be an independent successful publisher," Mr. Dye said, "you need advertising. But we're not succumbing to advertiser pressure."
 
Building Good Will
 To be sure, many of the new ventures offer newspapers opportunities to polish their images. In Evansville, Ind., The Courier is proud of Schnucks' Homework Hotline, which uses the newspaper's audiotext system to give parents the chance to check by telephone on their children's homework assignments. Schnucks, "the friendliest stores in town and your food for thought," paid for the audiotext message and every teacher in town now has a voice mailbox on The Courier's system to report on class assignments.
The Courier also ran a marketing and advertising campaign for a local race track. The campaign included instant race results on The Courier's telephone system and traditional newspaper advertising. In addition, people the newspaper's data base identified as interested in racing received on their doorsteps packages of reduced-admission coupons and promotional material.
When asked, The Courier's editor and president, Thomas W. Tuley, said he had never considered whether such close public identification of the newspaper with its advertisers might erode the newspaper's independent voice. He said the new services were not much different from the simpler display advertising that newspapers have always carried.
But Mr. Tuley said it was clear that the long-term trends showed business growth to be nearly impossible for newspapers that refused to change.
"As a business, if you're not growing, you're going backward," Mr. Tuley said. "Do you keep taking steps backward? And if you do, when do you go out of business?"

HEADLINE: Perot Urges Calls to Clinton Denouncing Economic Plans

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 25

 BODY:
In a technique reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan in the first months of his Administration, Ross Perot issued an appeal tonight for Americans to flood the White House and Congress with telephone messages opposing President Clinton's policies on taxes, health care and military cuts.
Mr. Perot made his appeal at the conclusion of a 30-minute appearance he bought on NBC. 
 He provided the telephone numbers for the White House and Congress, and said, "You've got to keep calling until you get through because this is really important."
Mr. Reagan, in selling his first budget against a Democratic majority in the House, went on national television with charts and a pointer, and urged Americans to flood their representatives and senators with telephone calls and telegrams. The tactic was effective, and Mr. Reagan got his way.
 
Complaints of Spending
 Intensifying the harshness of his attack on the Clinton Administration, Mr. Perot accused the President of misleading voters. He cited spending increases in Mr. Clinton's budget that the Administration estimates will raise the Federal debt by $900 billion, to $5 trillion, by 1996; the mentions of a new national tax, the value-added tax, as one way of paying for a revised health-care system, and the proposed jobs-creation program, which Mr. Perot estimated would cost taxpayers $89,000 for each new job.
Mr. Perot was the only speaker on the prerecorded program. An NBC spokesman said tonight he could not find out how much the network charged for the 30 minutes, but a half-hour that Mr. Perot bought on NBC on March 21 cost $500,000.
Mr. Perot appealed to viewers to contribute $15 to his organization, United We Stand America, and said,, "The money is spent on programs like this."
 
Wants Debt Reduced
 Reprising themes from his Presidential campaign last year, Mr. Perot made sweeping assertions about Americans' desire to curb Government spending and cut the Federal deficit. "The problem is not going away," he said. "It's getting worse."
He declared that most Americans would accept higher taxes only if the money were committed to reducing the Federal debt, which exceeded $4 trillion last year and which, he said, continues to rise by $1 billion a day.
He derided Mr. Clinton's economic plans, saying the Administration did not know how it could pare the military budget by 20 percent. "They just pulled the number out of the air and now they're trying to put it together in a rational way," he said. "That's not the way you do business, folks."
He said the Clinton White House, like the Administrations of Mr. Reagan and George Bush in the previous 12 years, was bending to the demands of foreign and domestic lobbyists "and other special interests who paid for their last campaigns."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Barnes & Noble Superstore Prompts Volumes of Worry

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Not for nothing did the writer and Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer spend most of his life on the Upper West Side. From Lincoln Center in the south to Columbia University in the north, the neighborhood has long crackled with the passions, ideas, disagreements and noises defining the intellectual life of America's largest city.
From the perspective of one of the nation's top booksellers, the message emerging from all this cacophony could not be more distinct. 
 "The Upper West Side is clearly one of the best markets for books in all of America," said Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes & Noble Bookstores, which on Friday will open a block-long, architecturally striking store offering 225,000 books, free gift-wrapping and an espresso bar, on Broadway between 82d and 83d Streets, in the heart of the neighborhood. "I have never been more excited about a store opening."
 
Other Booksellers Scrambling
 Not everyone shares his enthusiasm. Owners, workers and some customers of Shakespeare & Company, the idiosyncratically sprawling bookstore a block away, are seething, and other neighborhood book merchants are scrambling for retaliatory strategies. And residents feel torn between their loyalty to the existing neighborhood stores and excitement over Barnes & Noble's immense selection and steep discounts.
"I hope that Shakespeare doesn't close," said Jeanette Rausch, a city economic development official who lives nearby and loves to browse for books. "But I'll probably end up going there less."
What is happening on the Upper West Side is part of a sea change in the way Americans sell and buy books. In less than two years, Barnes & Noble and the Kmart Corporation, operating through its Waldenbooks and Borders chains, have salted the nation with what are called "superstores," bringing to books the same revolution Toys "R" Us and The Home Depot have brought to other segments of the retail business.
Mr. Riggio says the effect will be to raise sagging national literacy levels within a decade. "People who are predisposed to buying books will buy more books in a greatly expanded book space," he said. "These stores create the idea of the importance of books, of possessing books."
But skeptics predict that such stores will force hundreds of independent bookstores out of business, giving Americans fewer choices and leaving publishers at the mercy of a few very large buyers.
"It would be disingenuous to say there is not a lot of anxiety out there," said Charles Robinson, the owner of an independent bookstore in Bellingham, Wash., and president of the American Booksellers Association, whose members include both Barnes & Noble and Shakespeare.
It is difficult to predict how such a megastore will fare in the singular environs of the Upper West Side. The giant Zabar's at 80th and Broadway, a fiercely independent purveyor of gustatory temptation, does a booming business year-in and year-out. But Kiddie City Toys, a block away at 79th Street, died early this year despite the seeming advantage of being located in an area bustling with young children.
The 32,000-square-foot Barnes & Noble store at 2289 Broadway is one of 135 so-called superstores that the company has opened in the last two years as part of a careful strategy of offering amenities to encourage more customers to linger, and thus increase the chances of making a sale.
The store will carry 1,500 magazines and newspapers, offer a children's theater and be decorated in gold leaf wallpaper. Gift-wrapping will be free, and customers will be welcome to lounge all day in Shaker-style furniture, even as they sip cappuccino and peruse $100 art books. Titles will be discounted at least 10 percent and some as much as 80 percent.
Despite its size, the Broadway store will still be smaller than Barnes & Noble's flagship store on Fifth Avenue at 18th Street, the world's largest bookstore at 154,250 square feet.
 
A Direct Challenge
 To the people at Shakespeare & Company, so named for the legendary Paris book emporium whose owner first published James Joyce's "Ulysses," those kinds of amenities are a direct challenge to their store's existence. Although Shakespeare has over the years spread into adjoining and overhead spaces, growing from perhaps 800 square feet to nearly 6,000 square feet in 12 years of existence, its owners fear the new superstore will be too big and too dominant. It is, they say, entirely different from the two small Barnes & Noble shops that long competed nearby, the nearest of which is across the street from the new store and will now close.
"The big monster bully store is here to knock us out," said David Wetter, Shakespeare's mass market buyer. "On a gut level, I want them to go away and leave us alone."
Some customers feel the same way. "I can't imagine that I would not come to Shakespeare anymore," said Katie Fraser, a graduate student in comparative literature at City University of New York. "They have more of the unusual things that I would be looking for, like literary criticism and poetry journals."
But others in the neighborhood welcome the new store. "I'm happy," said Ronald Bario, a special education instructor at a junior high nearby. "More books, more intellectuality."
Ernest Fernandez, a computer designer who likes books on life in other galaxies, said: "I spend a fortune in bookstores. This is fabulous."
 
Trend Toward Giant Stores
 Experts say the growth of what Mr. Riggio calls "complete and unabridged" stores is part of a nationwide trend away from conventional shopping malls and toward giant stores that offer huge selection and discount prices.
The result, said Bill Kurland, one of two brothers who owns Shakespeare, is "the Wal-Marting of America," the phenomenon of chain-store culture and values that he says has spread to "even the streets of New York."
Other bookstores in the neighborhood are also watching the new store and making plans to respond. At the elegant Endicott Booksellers at 4500 Columbus Avenue, between 81st and 82d Streets, Encarnita Quinlan, the owner, said she viewed the newcomer with "trepidation" and was prepared to expand, eliminate or strengthen whole departments.
"I see why a person would walk a block for a $10 discount," she said.
At Eeyore's Books for Children at 2212 Broadway, between 78th and 79th Streets, a special 25 percent-off sale will be offered on all books to coincide with Barnes & Noble's opening. But the owner, Joel Framm, said he doubts a chain store can match his meticulous service, which occasionally includes advising customers against particular purchases. "Buyers of children's books will suffer," he said.
By contrast, Gryphon Bookshop at 2246 Broadway, between 80th and 81st Streets, which specializes in antiquarian titles, welcomes the Barnes & Noble superstore. Tony DePauw, the day manager, said, "It will make this even more of a book neighborhood."
 
Asking for Suggestions
 Shakespeare itself is responding by encouraging its sometimes brusque clerks to be friendlier, something some customers say is overdue. "It's sort of big and impersonal and they don't do much to warm it up," said Alan Brinkley, a Columbia history professor who said he had spent upward of $1,000 there.
Indeed, Ruth Liebmann, a Shakespeare manager, has been asking customers what the store can do to improve. One was still smarting over the time a clerk corrected his pronunciation of Proust five years ago, while another suggested additions to "the Mom table," made up of books suitable as gifts to mothers.
"They're Upper West Siders and they all have dislikes," Ms. Liebmann said with a smile.
Barnes & Noble is attacking the neighborhood with near-abandon. Area authors and poets have been invited to read months into the future. Peter, Paul and Mary, Tom Paxton and others have been booked to perform free concerts. Events are being set up with such local cultural institutions as Symphony Space.
The question hanging over all the anxiety is whether the superstore can coexist with its neighbors. "It remains to be seen how much the market will be expanded, and when there will be a shakeout," said Mr. Robinson, the booksellers president. "Shakespeare may find it difficult to draw the same traffic."
For his part, Mr. Riggio says studies show that 70 percent of the business generated in superstores, even those with close neighbors, is new. "The size itself creates sales," he said.
His point seems at least partly supported by the experience of several major independent stores in other parts of the country. The Tattered Cover in Denver, a 40,000-square-foot bookstore than began in a single room 17 years ago, has seen its sales increase despite being surrounded by five Barnes & Noble superstores.
"Would our sales have gone up even more if they weren't there?" asked Pat Gunckel, general manager. "We don't know, but we're not hurting."

HEADLINE: A Fare Card For Transit Is Lagging

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Installing computerized fare boxes in New York City's buses at the same time that computerized turnstiles were being put into subway stations once seemed like a good idea to transit officials. But it is no longer a feasible one.
Metrocard, the plastic fare-card system that is expected to replace tokens, is still scheduled to debut in a few subway stations in December and to be operating in 69 stations by the time it is formally introduced next March. 
 But putting automated fare collection equipment aboard the city's 3,450 buses will not be completed until late 1995, according to a report by the Transit Authority that was released last week. That is a full year later than was predicted in January.
 
New Fare Box Needed
 The principal snag, officials said, is the need to redesign, retest and retool a new fare box. Flaws were found in the design and the reliability of a sample fare box tested on the Bx55 line in the South Bronx between October and January, and a new prototype is being built by the Cubic Corporation, the San Diego-based company that is also making the turnstiles.
"There are some fairly substantial design changes that we need," said Charles J. Broshaus Jr., senior vice president for operations support. "That's going to take time."
The new model will require a rider to insert the fare card into a slot in the box, where it will be ingested, read electronically and expelled. Originally, planners favored a model with an open slot through which a rider would swipe the card, like some supermarket credit-card readers.
The new machines are scheduled to be tested in the summer of 1994. Some bus depots and buses will be equipped to use Metrocard by April 1995, according to the current schedule, and installation will be completed by the end of that year.
 
Delay in Discounts
 That could be accelerated by up to nine months, Mr. Broshaus said, if the Transit Authority decides to begin ordering parts for the fare boxes before all of the necessary modifications are known, on the assumption that any changes would be minor. That would entail some financial risk for the agency, however, if it were later determined that major changes were again needed.
The disparity between Metrocard's starting dates for the subway and buses, Mr. Broshaus conceded, means a delay in conveniently granting discounts to riders who transfer between systems. Many now pay two fares, or $2.50 each way, to get to or from work, something officials have said they hope to eliminate through use of the Metrocard.
The additional work needed to solve the glitch in the fare boxes, and other problems, such as delays in deliveries, is expected to cost $20.7 million, the Transit Authority report said.
Even with that, Mr. Broshaus said, the overall cost of installing the system by 1997 is now estimated to be $660 million, or $30 million less than was budgeted. Most of the saving is due to lower-than-expected inflation, he said.
But one of the most sensitive issues connected to Metrocard -- how much it will cost riders -- is yet to be resolved.
One possibility is for a Metrocard to allow an unlimited number of rides for a single price, like a weekly or monthly pass. Another configuration would be a stored value card, with a set price, and charges deducted as each trip is taken. A variation would allow Metrocard users to pay different fares during peak and off-peak hours.
A survey on possible pricing schemes is scheduled to be completed in June. The results will be presented to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent organization, which could adopt any or all of the possibilities, officials said.
Another unpredictable factor in Metrocard pricing is the possibility of a fare increase in 1995, when the automated fare system is partially operating. Earlier this month, New York State leaders agreed to preserve the $1.25 fare in 1993 and 1994, but left open the possibility of an increase in 1995.

HEADLINE: No Quick Gain From Stronger Yen

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is proclaiming the dollar's latest plunge against the yen as a windfall for America -- one that should finally shrink the nation's painful trade deficit with Japan. "The stronger yen is the best single thing that could have happened to the trade deficit," a senior Administration official said last week.
But improvement is not likely to come quickly, even though a stronger yen pushes up the price of Japanese goods sold in United States while enabling American products to be sold for less in Japan. Indeed, the yen might have to stay strong for two years or more, many experts say, to have much impact on American-Japanese trade. The reason is that both American and Japanese companies are resisting any adjustment in prices to reflect the changing values of their currencies. 
 Cooper Industries, for example, exports spark plugs and crankshafts to Japan, but as with many American companies, Cooper says it will not cut the yen prices of its products.
Robert Cizik, chairman of Cooper as well as the National Association of Manufacturers, explains why Cooper will not act, and therefore why a change in the trade deficit will be slow to be realized.
"Japanese companies don't change relationships with their suppliers that fast," he said. "And these currency changes are temporary. You may get aberrations from time to time, as we are getting now. But the customer relationship has to be based on quality and delivery, as well as price."
But the stronger yen and weaker dollar certainly give American companies a pricing advantage in their competition with the Japanese, if the companies want to use it. In two months, the dollar has fallen 11 percent against the yen, to 110 yen to the dollar, compared with 124 in February. At 110, the level is the lowest since World War II. That means that an American-made spark plug sold in Japan for 124 yen now brings the manufacturer $1.11, rather than the $1 collected in February. That leaves room to cut the yen price, which could increase sales in Japan.
The Japanese, conversely, must raise dollar prices in the United States to collect the same number of yen once the dollars are exchanged for the Japanese currency.
 
Some Raising Prices
 A few companies, including Honda and Nissan, announced price increases this month. Honda, for example, added $100 to $450 to the sticker prices of its various models, most of them assembled in the United States with some parts made in Japan. And in Tempe, Ariz., Mother Board Warehouse Inc., which distributes computer components, raised the price of memory chips from Japan by 10 percent, to $40 to $45 apiece.
"Any computer with Japanese memory chips -- and that is many computers -- is likely to go up in price," said Alan Gifford, Mother Board's sales manager.
But most Japanese companies, including the giant Matsushita Electric Corporation, say they are reluctant to raise prices, fearful that higher prices might reduce sales. At Matsushita, whose Panasonic VCR's and video cameras are exported to the United States, James Reilly, a corporate spokesman, said, "If the current trend continues in the yen-dollar exchange rate, price hikes on some products might be inevitable, but there are no plans for such hikes yet."
 
Counting on Yen's Strength
 Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration is counting on the yen's strength to shrink a trade deficit with Japan that rose to $50 billion last year from $44.3 billion in 1991 -- mostly because of a spurt in Japanese imports. Administration officials even cite a trade theory that says that for every 1 percent increase in the value of the yen, Japan's trade deficit will eventually decline by $5 billion.
The Boeing Company's transactions with Japan tend to support this theory. Boeing prices the planes it sells to Japan in dollars, not yen. So now the fall in the value of the dollar means that the Japanese can spend less in yen to buy the dollars to buy the planes.
"We sell planes under long-term negotiated contracts, and we don't expect any impact on prices from the latest currency changes," said Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman. Boeing, the nation's single biggest exporter, sold the Japanese $2.5 billion in commercial airliners last year, or 5 percent of total American exports to Japan in 1992. The shipments to Japan will be similarly large this year -- and less costly to the Japanese in yen, which could encourage them to buy more planes.
But Clinton Administration officials say that the exchange rate advantage is not sufficient by itself to solve the United States trade deficit and that political pressure needs to be used to open Japan to specific American products and to try to get Japan to change rules that are barriers to trade and foreign investment. Talks on these subjects are scheduled for July, Administration officials said.
The Japanese Government, also concerned about the American trade deficit, waited until last week before it finally reacted to the rising value of the yen. The Bank of Japan bought big quantities of dollars in an attempt to strengthen the dollar's value, and a bank official criticized the Clinton Administration for encouraging the appreciation of the yen. But some Japanese find a silver lining in the yen's rise.
"The stronger yen will not solve the trade gap with Japan, but it may reduce the public pressure" on the Clinton Administration to take action to open the Japanese market, said Michiharu Maeda, a vice president of Adi-Ichi Life International Inc., an insurance company with an investment office in New York.
 
Japanese Investing Less
 The yen's appreciation has come almost by chance since Mr. Clinton took office, and involves several factors. With the Tokyo stock market rising again, Americans and Europeans have been buying yen to buy Japanese stocks, a process that bolsters the yen. The Japanese, on the other hand, are no longer offsetting this process by buying dollars in huge quantities to invest in United States Treasury securities, in new factories and in real estate in the United States.
Also driving up the yen is the Japanese Government's recent announcement that it will spend more than $100 billion on public works and other projects to stimulate the economy. That has created the expectation that Japan's economy will grow more robustly and that Japanese interest rates will rise to control inflation.
The higher rates, in turn, make yen investments more attractive. And "that is happening just as our economy appears to have weakened, putting downward pressure on interest rates in the United States, and making American investments less attractive," said Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant.
In the late 1970's and again in the late 1980's, the dollar fell sharply against the yen. But each time, the dollar also declined against the German mark and against other European currencies. That brought the danger of rising inflation, partly from price increases for goods imported from Europe and Japan. To avoid inflation and strengthen the dollar, the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates, which as a side effect, slowed the American economy.
 
'Orderly Rise' Seen
 While Japanese imports totaled $96.9 billion last year, that is not a large enough part of the huge American economy to have much impact on the inflation rate. With only the yen involved, the Administration seems willing to sit tight.
"We are not facing a generalized rapid decline of the dollar, but an orderly rise in the yen against not only the dollar but every major currency," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. "That is a huge difference from what happened to the dollar in the 70's and 80's."
Some economists, among them Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, argue that a strong enough yen will by itself correct the trade deficit with Japan -- once the dollar drops to 100 yen or less. But others, like Mr. Bergsten, say that as the dollar has fallen in value, Japanese companies have found ways to cut costs and improve efficiency, thus avoiding major price increases for exported products. One method has been to shift some labor-intensive production to low-wage Asian countries.
American exports did double in the late 1980's, as the dollar fell in value against the yen. But partly as a result of the efficiencies achieved by the Japanese, imports from Japan also rose sharply -- and the trade deficit, which was $43.5 billion in 1985, was still roughly at that level when the decade closed.

HEADLINE: Review/Theater: Blood Brothers;
Separated at Birth, Mainly by Social Class

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
Hardened New York theatergoers who expect British musicals to hit town powered by big bucks, Technicolor spectacle and deafening amplification may be taken aback by "Blood Brothers," the latest West End export to reach Broadway. "Blood Brothers" opens with a tableau of its title characters laid out as corpses. The eveninglong flashback to follow unfolds largely in the dank brick welfare housing of depressed northern England. The offstage band is small and tinny enough to hold forth in a garage. There is not much dancing, or, for that matter, much to dance about.
Which is just how Willy Russell, the author of the show's book, music and lyrics, wants it. First produced in London in 1983, "Blood Brothers" is a Thatcher-era attack on the British class system that wears its austerity on its sleeve, bourgeois frills be damned. Mr. Russell, the Liverpool-born author of "Educating Rita" and "Shirley Valentine," would rather be sincere than slick. His musical has the rough-hewn proletarian flavor of British dramas of the angry-man era of the late 1950's and early 60's, and that authentic chips-with-everything spirit has been transferred to the snug Music Box Theater without any infusions of Broadway glitz. 
 Whether the appealing, pungent atmosphere will carry less class-conscious Americans through the musical's nearly three hours is another question. "West Side Story" this is not. Easy as it is to like "Blood Brothers" on egalitarian principle, it is rousing theater only in spurts. Mr. Russell milks a melodramatic tale peopled with agitprop characters exclusively for didactic ends. His score is tuneful (and impressive coming from an essentially amateur composer) but spread thin. One song, typically, has four reprises, and even so the evening seems to have too little music and too much talk.
At center stage is a heroine like Mr. Russell's Rita and Shirley: a woman ground down by economic deprivation and men. Mrs. Johnstone (Stephanie Lawrence), as she is called, is a single mother of nine who decides to give up one of her new twin babies to a wealthy woman (Barbara Walsh) for whom she cleans house. The boys, who later become best friends without learning that they're brothers, grow up on separate social tracks that eventually lead to a tragic reckoning seemingly inspired by "Carousel."
But not before the author pounds in his deterministic conviction that nurture always wins out over nature, that the rich brother (Mark Michael Hutchinson) is inevitably bound for success while his impoverished counterpart (Con O'Neill) is destined for the skids. Such is the rigidity of the show's simplistic ideological scheme that the rich mother is barren and her husband (Ivar Brogger) asexual while the poor folks all radiate fecundity and erotic swagger.
As indulgently directed by Bill Kenwright and Bob Tomson, "Blood Brothers" seems to be pitched at audiences with time on their hands, tourists perhaps. Mr. Russell makes each plot point several times, with the utilitarian dialogue, songs and doom-laden narrator (Warwick Evans) all chiming in. (Should anyone's mind wander, the most portentous lines are italicized by drum beats, growling synthesizer chords and lurid lighting cues.) Both acts come to dead halts for completely excisable sequences of child's play that seem to exist only to jolly up British matinee audiences eternally nostalgic for "Oliver!" In Act I, the neighborhood children, cloyingly played by adult actors portraying 7-year-olds as if they were toddlers, act out attenuated games with cap pistols and slingshots. In Act II, the same lengthy attention is devoted to the now teen-age characters' first fumbling forays into puppy love.
The scenes that actually advance Mr. Russell's plot are more often enlivened by his music, which recalls both old-time Liverpudlian rock and American country, than by the banal lyrics about bright new days and long Sunday afternoons. (An opening-number simile about Marilyn Monroe is pushed into inanity by overuse by evening's end.) The performers, British and American alike, all sing and act forcefully, even when, like Ms. Walsh, they must animate the most abject caricatures. Mr. Evans's prophet-of-doom turn as the narrator boasts an insinuating Macheath quality, and Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Hutchinson bond as sympathetic brothers once they are allowed to play roughly their own age. Jan Graveson is a fine Shirley Valentine-in-waiting as the feisty young woman who loves them both.
Ms. Lawrence played the sad mother for two years in the 1988 West End revival of "Blood Brothers," which is still running. She lacks the touchingly frayed warmth that the pop singer Barbara Dickson brought to the original production. But she is a clarion belter in the West End manner of Elaine Paige, and her saintly, bone-weary survivor's smile is the very soul of a musical that reveres underdogs as unequivocally as its splashier London competitor canonizes cats.

1st Quarter Report

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The White House press office provided, at taxpayer expense, a handy-dandy guide to the first 100 days of the Clinton Administration, while the President went to Boston to press his 100-days defense on the nation's newspaper publishers.
I refuse to be so manipulated by an arbitrary number; instead, here is my "take," as with-it pundits say, on the first of the 16 quarters of Mr. Clinton's term. 
 1. The Fraud That Didn't Fly. With audacity and flair, the new President persuaded a majority of the public to accept higher taxes to reduce the deficit -- and then, in a classic bait-and-switch, proceeded to apply the anticipated new taxes to more spending.
"Double-cross!" shouted those of us who half-believed his promises of being a new-kind Democrat who would reform welfare and not further burden the middle class. His Election-Day conversion to liberal economics went down well with editorialists delighted with the unexpected plan to redistribute wealth, but in time reality dawned on sold-out centrists: not only was the deficit not to be cut in half, but even more new taxes were to be demanded for a huge health-care subsidy.
The Senate minority found itself representing majority opinion in the nation, which enabled reunited Republicans to block spending that would deepen the deficit. After the first big budget battle was won by filibuster, Ross Perot came galloping on the field last weekend to shoot the liberal wounded.
The leftward lurch of the new President's economic proposal was a historic miscalculation; Clinton, who thinks it was merely a mistake in tactics, still doesn't get it: Americans are prepared to sacrifice for the next generation by reducing the deficit, not for this generation by continuing it.
2. He Goes Home With the Partner What Brung Him. On the issue of abortion, which caused so many defections in Republican ranks, Clinton moved with alacrity to deliver on all his promises. He remembered, too, how homosexuals fervently supported his candidacy, and has done all that can reasonably be expected to associate himself with their causes.
Loyalty has its costs. Feminist leaders have short memories; homosexual activists focus on the shortcomings of those in power; and the desire to accommodate Friends of Bill and Hillary has led to delays in making appointments -- even the Justice Department's Criminal Division remains headless.
3. The Comeback Kid Rides Again. Clinton showed in his first quarter an ability to get up off the floor: his sobriquet may be The Great Recoverer.
His first formal news conference was a flop; not having done his homework, he was both overconfident and uncertain. But his second was much improved, notwithstanding his throat trouble, with a memorable passage about "real debates over ideas" and his wish to "open the floodgates for debating these ideas." That moving justification for experimentation should have been his answer to Mary McGrory's softball about his assessment of the 100 days, instead of the laundry list he memorized.
He quickly recovered, too, from having gone A.W.O.L. after the Waco disaster. His Attorney General de jure, having acquiesced in the wrong judgment, became St. Janet overnight by saying "The buck ends on my desk" when of course it ends on the President's.
Anybody with political savvy could have told him that the best way to get people to say "It wasn't really your fault" is to insist gallantly, "I take full responsibility." The most important job his wife has is to spot and stop his tendency to flinch from responsibility; Hillary failed him this time.
4. Awesome Burden Time. Clinton marshaled allied support for Boris Yeltsin, which George Bush failed to do, but he matched his predecessor in dithering about the Serbian rape of Bosnia. That handwringing about military "compellance" (sometimes spelled "compellence" on the analogy of "deterrence") is to end this week, after the sweeping Yeltsin referendum victory -- if the Serbs don't blink.
Then we will see if Clinton acts incrementally or resolutely. He will have to choose between apologizing for having to take a painful, limited action, or forthrightly calling a free people to a moral cause. The way he rallies compatriots to costly world leadership, and not the way he got his sea legs in the White House, will be the first true measure of his young Presidency.

HEADLINE: A Value-Added Tax;
It Could Pay for a Health-Care Plan And Then Some, but the Hurdles Are High

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
The value-added tax being considered by the Clinton Administration faces challenges beyond the political ones. It would also be difficult to set up, expensive to administer and hard to make equitable, because it would hit poor Americans hardest.
But, boy, what a revenue raiser. 
 The vast sums that such a consumption tax -- akin to a national sales tax -- would rake in make it alluring to an Administration that is scrounging for revenues for its health-care plan, which the President's aides say could cost $30 billion to $90 billion a year.
Two weeks ago, the Administration acknowledged that it was considering a value-added tax, and since then many political analysts have said it would face an uphill battle in Congress if it was included as a revenue-raising measure in the President's health-care plan.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 5 percent value-added tax would, if placed on all goods and services, raise more than $100 billion a year. At that level, such a tax not only would handily underwrite the Administration's health plan but would also be a potent tool to cut the budget deficit. A small increase in the tax, to 6 percent from 5 percent, could cut the deficit by an additional $20 billion to $25 billion a year.
Any of the many revenue options being considered to pay for the health plan are bound to meet resistance. But a value-added tax would have to surmount one more sizable hurdle: Many Democrats fault such a tax as regressive, hitting high-income households more lightly than other Americans as a percentage of income.
Because the poor spend such a high percentage of their income on basic consumption, the 20 percent of households with the lowest income would pay three times as high a percentage of their income in a value-added tax as the richest fifth of Americans, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office. Households in the lowest 20 percent would pay 4.8 percent of their income in a 5 percent value-added tax, while those in the highest quintile would pay 1.5 percent.
"The biggest opponents of a consumption tax are the left wing and the right wing -- the left yells it is regressive, and the right yells that it is a money tree for Big Government," said David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy at Ernst & Young.
Most economists, however, like a value-added tax, saying it would help tilt the economy away from its consumption binge and toward increased saving and investment. This, they say, should ultimately raise the nation's long-term growth rate.
A value-added tax is imposed on businesses at each step in the production process according to how much value each business adds to the product. One thing that attracts politicians and economists to the tax is that it is largely invisible; consumers pay it, but often do not see it, because it is usually incorporated quietly into the final retail price rather than tacked on visibly at the end like a sales tax.
Beyond the politics are some nuts-and-bolts difficulties.
Some Administration officials have talked of raising about $30 billion a year from a value-added tax. But because the tax would cost so much to administer and comply with -- perhaps more than $8 billion a year -- some economists say the Administration should not bother unless it plans to reap considerably more than $30 billion from it.
 
High Administrative Costs
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost the Government $750 million to $1.5 billion a year to administer the tax and that it would cost businesses $4 billion to $7 billion a year to pay the accountants and clerks needed for the additional paperwork.
"It's not worth thinking about a value-added tax at 1, 2 or 3 percent," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now director of economic studies at K.P.M.G. Peat Marwick. "In light of the Administration's costs, you should think of at least 6, 7 or 8 percent."
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman acknowledged recently that it could take two to three years to get a value-added tax up and running.
Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said the delays would come on many fronts: "It requires new tax forms; it requires development of a new tax staff. You'd have to train new I.R.S. personnel. You'd have to set up new computers at the nation's banks and businesses. You'd have to hire new people to handle them."
 
Less Paperwork in Japan
 Some advocates of a value-added tax are backing the version adopted in Japan, which requires less paperwork than the version now used in Europe. In Europe, businesses pay the tax based on each transaction; in Japan, a business pays on the yearly total of its transactions -- on the difference between the value of its inputs, including raw materials and machinery, and its total sales.
The United States is the only major industrial nation that does not have a value-added tax. Most Western European nations adopted the tax more than two decades ago because it is a big revenue raiser and because they saw it as a straightforward way to replace a welter of confusing and overlapping business transaction taxes. In France, the standard value-added tax is 18.6 percent, in Britain 17.5 percent and in Germany 15 percent.
Many European officials say the value-added tax is preferable to the sales taxes common at state and local levels in the United States because it is harder to evade. Retailers often avoid paying sales taxes by under estimating their receipts. It is less easy to evade a value-added tax, however, because at each step of the production chain there are two companies keeping scrupulous records of each transaction -- the company that having finished its processes passed the product on and the company that received it.
One reason the United States has balked at a value-added tax is that state and local governments worry that it would interfere with their sales taxes. Some economists suggest that a value-added tax could replace state and local sales taxes and the Federal Government could share its value-added revenues with states, as is done in Germany.
Despite Europe's social democratic traditions, there are few complaints among Europeans that the value-added tax is unfair to the less well off. The reason: European governments embrace the tax to finance generous social programs, including government-supported health care and high levels of unemployment compensation.
According to Mr. Steuerle, if the Federal Government adopts a value-added tax to finance a health-care plan that insures the 37 million Americans without coverage, that might defuse protests that the tax is regressive.
"The value-added tax is usually thought of as mildly regressive," he said. "You can solve that problem by how you distribute the benefits. Then the net impact will be progressive."
To make their value-added taxes less regressive, several European countries established a higher value-added tax on luxury goods, like furs. And many nations have exempted certain basics like food, housing and medical care from the tax.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, if Washington were to exempt these three basics, a 5 percent value-added tax would collect about $60 billion a year -- or about half as much as with those three items included.
Eager to keep compliance simple, many economists assert that using such exemptions and differing rates greatly multiplies the paperwork and headaches for companies seeking to comply. Nonetheless, many European leaders see such exemptions as politically necessary.
"I'd argue that there are better ways to make a VAT fairer," Mr. Penner said. "You can increase food stamps or use a bigger earned-income tax credit."

HEADLINE: Economy Aids a Compromise Over Developing Forest Land

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUXEDO, N.Y.

 BODY:
Here on a spread as vast as all of Manhattan, a Swedish insurance company wants to build a utopian city for 35,000 inhabitants and 20,000 workers, a complex that would dwarf all but a few towns between New York City and Albany.
That vision for Sterling Forest, a privately held woodland 40 miles north of New York City, is diametrically different from one preservationists have long had for the thousands of rugged acres of hemlock and white cedar that are home to black bears, coyotes, bobcats, foxes and timber rattlesnake.
 
A Deal Is Under Way
 Both visions, however, are running up against the sour economic reality of the 90's. In the 1980's, developers could dream of projects on a mighty scale, and preservationists could plan Arcadias for hiking and fishing and the protection of wildlife. But the 1990's, with a sputtering economy that impoverishes both landlords and public park preservers, is forcing a new approach: compromise. 
 State officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say a deal for under $50 million may soon be struck to make most of the Sterling Forest part of the Palisades Interstate Park System. It would leave the developer perhaps a quarter of Sterling Forest's 17,500 acres for housing and office buildings. The deal, now in negotiation, would require tapping pools of Federal and state money in an arrangement as intricate as a leveraged buyout.
"We continue to have discussions with representatives of the corporation for a possible acquisition of a portion of the property," was all Robert Binnewies, executive director of the Palisades Interstate Park System, was willing to say.
Publicly, the developer, the Sterling Forest Corporation, which is controlled by a consortium led by Trygg-Hansa SPP Group, the largest insurance company in Scandinavia, has said it would sell the entire property -- for $150 million or more.
Robert E. Thomson, chairman of the forest corporation, says that his company has been losing $2 million a year through taxes and maintenance, and it needs to exploit the property or bail out.
"The only exit strategy is to begin to develop it," he said. "There's no other way to get out of the property."
Some critics see his price tag as a kind of blackmail and accuse the company of brandishing development as a way of manipulating a top-dollar sale. Others say Mr. Thomson is simply bargaining in public. But these critics express hope that the more difficult economic outlook will prompt the corporation to grab a sure offer.
For one thing, the office market in the suburbs and beyond is generally glutted, so prospects for still another glistening business center are hardly rosy. Similarly, the housing market is flat. And while the full-scale Sterling Forest project still faces formidable legal hurdles, area towns apparently would welcome modest development. All that suggests the company would be satisfied with half a loaf.
John Humbach, head of the Sterling Forest Coalition, a corps of environmental and other groups fighting the development, said the public needed to understand the importance of preserving Sterling as a forest.
"As we look forward to the year 2050, when the megalopolis will have expanded through Orange County and beyond, people will be grateful to us for preserving a green oasis like Sterling Forest, just like people of New York City are grateful for Central Park," he said.
 
Hamlets and Clusters
 The developer's master plan foresees five hamlets that would sprawl like an archipelago through the forest, with separate clusters of housing and office buildings to minimize destruction of timber. Condominium apartments and homes would be built over 25 to 30 years and range in price from $100,000 to $600,000.
Energy-saving jitneys would carry residents to their jobs within the forest. And there would be amenities galore: three shopping centers, three golf courses, a 250-room conference center and a Main Street hub with its own theater and library.
The fate of Sterling Forest has galvanized the passions of this town as well as Warwick and Monroe, the other towns that embrace the forest.
Supporters of a large development argue that Orange County already has enough green space, with Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks on its southeastern border. What the county really needs, they say, is more taxpayers and more jobs.
 
Supporters Welcome Business
 Rosalie Gaudiello, owner of the Market Basket, a grocery in Greenwood Lake just west of the forest, left the hurly-burly of New York City 21 years ago. But she thinks the area has become too sleepy and needs an infusion of businesses that would hold youngsters after they grow up.
"There's nothing here for the kids," she said. "My daughter went to school in Bergen County and she's not coming back."
Tuxedo, a once posh town that lent its name to the formal evening suit after a local plutocrat wore a prototype in 1886, also needs new growth, said Annette Dorozynski, its supervisor. Tuxedo may be a picture postcard place for New Yorkers, she says, but its population has dwindled to 3,069, stores have closed, and jobs have been lost with plant closings by the International Business Machines Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and International Nickel.
The town does not get enough taxes to support services for its aging population. Yet Ms. Dorozynski worries that the scale of the proposed development would clog the roads and strain the police and firefighting forces, so she would support a somewhat more modest complex.
"You're going to pay now or pay later," she said. "If you don't want progress, the infrastructure is still going to decay, so you're going to have to pay for it anyway, with a smaller tax base."
The Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which oversees 23 parks in New Jersey and New York, and the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning group that has monitored the forest for decades, treasure Sterling as a crucial link in a verdant corridor running from the Hudson River to the Delaware River.
Many species need the unbroken swath of wilderness for their migrations. The forest's streams also supply the drinking water for two million residents of northern New Jersey. The forest hugs the Appalachian Trail and has eight lakes.
The Palisades Commission has pressed for a deftly mapped purchase that would protect the flow of clean water, expand trails for hikers, yet allow scaled-back development.
Sterling Forest is not virgin land. Hidden among its trees are the ruins of 19th-century smelters, miners' shacks and railroad cuts that testify to a once-thriving iron industry. The property was purchased in 1895 by the Harriman family, whose wealth stemmed from railroads. The family sold it in 1953 for $750,000 to a real-estate developer that set up the Sterling Forest Corporation.
 
Cashing In on an Asset
 Large chunks of the forest have already been turned into homes for 250 families and offices for 2,000 workers. But the forest has barely been developed, benefiting the insurance affiliate only as a holding against which policies can be written.
Yet Mr. Thomson, the forest corporation's chairman, maintains that the spread of suburbs beyond Westchester and Rockland Counties and the rapid growth of Orange County may make the forest prime for profitable development.
"This is a unique property," Mr. Thomson said. "There aren't a lot of 17,000-acre properties essentially intact this close to New York City."
Mr. Thomson, a genial and witty Californian, has been working to disarm his opponents rather than wear them down. He boasts that, unlike other developers, his company has not tried "to do it in secret and cram it down the community's throat."
 
Opponents and Skeptics
 The Sterling Corporation has already received approval of the project's concept from the towns of Tuxedo and Warwick. An assessment of the development's environmental impact must also be completed. The corporation hopes to get full approval from all three towns sometime next year to break ground.
Mr. Thomson has promised that 75 percent of the property will be kept as green space and a habitat for animal life. Opponents contend that green space will be so fragmented that the forest will essentially lose its value as a habitat.
Mr. Thomson has also pledged that the property will not increase the tax burden of town residents. But many are skeptical. They predict that the costs of schools, police, sewer and other services for 35,000 people will exceed the increase in revenue.
 
The Bottom Line
 Ron Nowak, editor of the Greenwood Lake News, argues that the development will double the number of students at the Greenwood Lake Union District schools without creating enough taxable housing to pay for them. He also worries that a school system that now has only 1,272 students will become impersonal.
"This is the kind of system where every kid is known," he said. "Nobody falls through the cracks."
The only compromise between these positions would require a purchase. Louis Heimbach, a former county executive of Orange County who is second in command to Mr. Thomson, says the company has been willing to consider a buyout, but has not seen one to its liking.
"Our response to the people who want to keep it green is, 'Show us your money!' " he said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SAYS U.S. MUST HARDEN LINE TOWARD THE SERBS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Only hours after the Bosnian Serbs once again rejected peace proposals, President Clinton said today that it was clear that the United States and its allies needed "a stronger policy" in the Balkans and promised to decide on a new course of action within the next few days.
A senior American official said the most likely strategy would be a program of limited bombing, intended to produce a cease-fire in place and a new round of negotiations. With European nations insisting upon American leadership, both Britain and France indicated over the weekend that they would probably prefer bombing to any of the other military options under study. 
 "The President wants a definable objective, not just a spasm of bombing, and a limitation of scope," the American official said. "We are prepared to lead, but not to act alone."
 
A Round of Consultations
 Mr. Clinton signed an order today aligning the United States with new, tougher United Nations sanctions that were scheduled to go into effect against Serbia at midnight, but neither the American Government nor its principal allies think they are likely to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina or the "ethnic cleansing" that many have described as near-genocide.
A second American official said a decision would follow talks between Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders and possibly one more full-dress meeting with his foreign-policy advisers. Its broad outlines would then be disclosed, the official said, speaking like his colleague on condition of anonymity, but details would be withheld pending negotiations with key allies such as Britain and France. Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, is expected to fly to Europe for those talks as soon as Mr. Clinton reaches his decision.
The President said last week that he would take no action unilaterally.
 
U.S. Public Divided
 Officials involved in the discussions of Bosnian policy warned that Mr. Clinton had made no final decision yet, and that because all the possible policies had evident disadvantages, he might yet avoid air strikes. One of the President's advisers said that "this is an absolute brute, this issue, with no answer that leaps off the page, and we've all changed our minds a lot."
Another adviser insisted that lifting the embargo on arms sales to the Muslims, though unpopular with the Europeans, remained under active consideration as an alternative to bombing.
Lord Owen, the European Community's peace negotiator, said in Belgrade today that "confrontation is now inevitable" between Europe and the Bosnian Serbs. The Serbs will be punished "economically, politically, and if they continue, in my view, militarily within the context of the U.N. Charter," he said.
Although there is little public pressure for action -- most recent polls show American voters equally divided between favoring and opposing military intervention -- other forces are pushing Mr. Clinton toward a decision.
Prominent senators of both parties, members of his own Administration and influential journalistic commentators are all clamoring for action, as are such figures as Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz called today for "a very large, sustained air- and sea-based attack" on Serbian positions.
The Russian elections, a potential complicating factor, are over, and the European countries made it plain this weekend that they would move only with reluctance and only under substantial United States pressure.
"The President had hoped the Europeans might go first, which would have given him some cover," a European diplomat said. "But it's going to have to be the other way around."
In London, Foreign Office officials stressed that Britain's overall goals in the Balkans remained unchanged: continued pressure on the Serbian leaders, including a blockade to enforce economic sanctions, to force them to accept either the peace plan devised by Lord Owen and Cyrus R. Vance or some other agreement. But the officials hinted strongly that they were inclined to go along with Mr. Clinton in his search for a policy with more force behind it.
 
No British 'Blank Check'
 "We have not signed a blank check," one British official said, "but I can say that any proposal that is put to us will be considered."
At a meeting of European Community foreign ministers in Denmark over the weekend, Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, made relatively favorable comments about air strikes, even though the ministers failed to reach agreement on a new policy. He emphasized, however, that in the event of bombing some method would have to be worked out to protect United Nations troops engaged in the effort to deliver relief supplies to besieged Muslim towns in eastern Bosnia.
Alain Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, ruled out a partial lifting on the United Nations arms embargo on all factions in the Balkan fighting to allow the Bosnian Muslims to close the gap on the better-armed Serbs. Mr. Juppe argued that such a policy would only widen the slaughter, but he said that France was ready to discuss what he termed "selective air strikes."
It is not clear how extensive the air strikes would be if that is what Mr. Clinton and the allied leaders agree upon. They could be concentrated on battlefield targets, such as ammunition dumps, the artillery emplacements from which the Serbs have rained fire on Bosnian towns and cities and the vulnerable mountain bridges which they need for resupply.
 
An Attack on Belgrade?
 Some, like Mr. Shultz, have advocated bombing targets in or near Belgrade, on the ground that such attacks would prompt the Serbian Government to bring pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. But several Administration planners said that was not likely, at least at the moment.
Mr. Clinton, who has been speaking with increasing bluntness about Bosnia in recent days in a throwback to his tough language during the 1992 election campaign, discussed the situation with reporters this afternoon during a White House ceremony to honor the University of Arkansas track team.
"It is now, I think, clear that the United States and its allies need to move forward with a stronger policy in Bosnia and I will be announcing the course that I hope we can take in the next several days," he said. "I think the time has come to focus on that problem and what it means for the United States and the rest of the world as well as for the people that are suffering there."

HEADLINE: Old Peril of Abandoned Mines Stirs Calls for Action in West

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COPPERTON, Utah, April 24

 BODY:
For decades, the West tolerated dangerous abandoned mines and piles of toxic mine wastes as necessary, if ugly, byproducts of an industry that provided thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for the region's economy.
But momentum is gathering in state capitals, in Washington and in mining communities like this one for new safeguards. Across the region, attention is focusing on new evidence of water pollution from mine wastes containing lead, arsenic and cyanide. There has also been concern over the number of people killed by falls into abandoned mines -- 73 from the late 1970's through 1991, by the Department of Interior's count. 
 This month, Gov. Bruce King of New Mexico signed the toughest mine-cleanup law in the country. It establishes a fund for cleaning up abandoned mines and sets new land-reclamation standards for those still in operation.
And here in Utah, the Kennecott Corporation is working with the state and the Federal Government on the largest voluntary project ever undertaken in the United States to clean up and entomb toxic dirt from lead-processing operations.
 
After the Ore Was Gone
 By any measure, such efforts are long overdue, said state officials and executives of Kennecott. Thousands of mines where gold, silver, lead, copper and other hard rock minerals were clawed from the earth were abandoned after their ore gave out. Many were left surrounded by tons of pulverized rock laced with toxic materials.
When it rains or snows, the water mixes with those materials, forming acidic solutions that have polluted, by some estimates, 10,000 miles of streams in the West. The abandoned mines and wastes, including residues from mineral-processing plants, represent another staggering environmental cost from industrial development in the United States.
Mine wastes now cover at least two million acres of private and public land -- roughly two-thirds the area of Connecticut -- according to studies by the Western Governors Association, two Federal agencies, Congress and the National Academy of Sciences.
The piles of waste, some with humps like great beasts, lie sprawled across the land. Not only does the runoff from these piles ruin streams and kill the fish in them, it also taints underground supplies of drinking water, according to the state and Federal studies.
The states estimate there are at least 500,000 abandoned mines in the West. In Utah, where three people died in falls at abandoned mines in 1985 and scores have been injured, state officials say filling in and sealing 17,000 abandoned mines will cost at least $174 million.
But the state can find only about $1 million to spend on the problem each year from state and Federal funds. "It's a pittance for a public health and environmental issue that affects every part of this state," said Mary Ann Wright, director of Utah's Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.
Over all, estimates of the cost for stabilizing the toxic wastes from mining and ore-processing, repairing the damage to streams and aquifers and closing abandoned mines across the West ranges from $20 billion to more than $70 billion, according to various public and private studies. Those estimates put the problem in the same category as toxic-waste and radioactive cleanups now under way on military installations, nuclear-weapons plants and abandoned chemical dumps.
The Federal Government alone will spend $10 billion this fiscal year to clean up the latter wastes, more than a quarter of all Federal spending on environmental protection, while total Federal and state spending on mine-related cleanups will total less than $250 million.
 
An Array of Proposals
 Next month, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, is to hold a hearing on mining in preparation for legislation to address toxic pollution on Federal land. Other members of the Senate and the House have put forward an array of proposals to establish environmental controls on mining.
The White House this month said it would support Congressional efforts to increase environmental safeguards at mines on Federal land, which represent about a third of the hard-rock mining industry. "This is an industry granted special favors that must end," said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.
But Mr. Miller and other House Democrats have questioned the White House's commitment in light of the removal last month from President Clinton's budget of a measure that would have required a 12.5 percent royalty on all hard-rock minerals mined on Federal land. Some of the royalties would have been used to set up a fund for cleaning up mine sites on Federal land.
The message that Congress and the White House may be ready to challenge the mining industry has not been lost on industry leaders. "There is a general consensus that mine wastes are a huge problem, and we better recognize that the only way to deal with it is with a collaborative program between Government and the industry," said G. Frank Joklik, the president and chief executive officer of Kennecott, which is based in Salt Lake City.
 
Some Surprising Results
 No other state in the West has tried more approaches than Utah, and some of the results have been unexpected. In Park City, high in the Wasatch Range 75 miles east of here, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to dig up a neighborhood that was built on lead and arsenic wastes from processing mills. The agency justified the proposal on the basis of the risk to children from eating lead-contaminated dirt.
After medical studies showed that the Park City children had lower levels of lead in their blood than the average American child, citizens rejected the E.P.A. plan. They chose a much less costly approach to safeguard their families. Their yards were covered with clean dirt, and they established a rule barring families in the neighborhood from planting vegetable gardens.
Across the Wasatch Valley, the town of Midvale is trying another approach under the Federal Superfund program, which is generally used to clean up abandoned chemical dumps. A lead-processing mill that operated at the center of town for most of this century poured 13 million tons of lead and arsenic wastes onto a 270-acre field along the Jordan River during its lifetime.
 
A $300 Million Pile
 The cost of cleaning up this enormous pile could easily exceed $300 million if the state gets its way and has the pile moved. Neither the state, the Federal Government, nor the mill's former owners want to pay for it, said Daniel Symonik, a toxicologist and manager of the State Division of Environmental Response and Remediation. "The Superfund law is not designed to get things done," he said.
Rob Walline, the top mining-waste expert at the E.P.A., agrees. "Superfund is not well suited to deal with mine wastes," he said by telephone from his office in Denver. "The costs are just too high. A new approach is needed."
The missed deadlines, lawsuits, community anger and regulatory deadlock that have accompanied the Midvale project are a constant reminder to the executives of Kennecott, who can see the yellowed pile of mine wastes across the valley from the flank of their open-pit copper mine here.
On the east face of the Oquirrh Range 15 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Kennecott produces 15 percent of the nation's copper from a hole where a mountain once stood. Almost 90 years after the company began digging here, Kennecott executives said they are out to prove that a newer approach to mine reclamation, involving collaboration with Government instead of litigation, can be successful.
In one phase of the project, millions of tons of lead and arsenic wastes are being picked up and moved into new, clay-lined repositories the company built on its property below the copper mine. In another phase, the company emptied a waste-water reservoir and scraped from the bottom millions more tons of sediments contaminated with toxic metals. Those wastes, too, are heading for the repositories.
 
Into an Aquifer
 The reservoir was the principal source of toxic metals that had seeped into an underground aquifer and contaminated the drinking water source used by thousands of residents along the Wasatch Front. The state and the company are negotiating how to halt the spread of the contaminants in the aquifer and determining whether other steps are needed to clean up the water.
Mr. Joklik and other top Kennecott executives said the project -- estimated by Kennecott at $150 million, even though state officials predict it will be considerably more -- was motivated primarily by a desire to avoid arguments with regulators that would cost the company even more money and sap the energy of the company's leaders.
"Why tie up management's time with trying to deal with all these wastes within a government bureaucracy?" said Gregory H. Boyce, the company's chief spokesman.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drop Again on Economic Concerns

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The stock market demonstrated a determined descent yesterday, having shambled downward last week, closing lower for the sixth consecutive trading session with barely a flicker of upward movement. All major indexes were down, and the only major gaining stocks were gold-mining companies, although less so than on Friday.
The market opened the week by largely ignoring good news about Boris N. Yeltsin's apparent victory in Sunday's Russian referendum, which would aid Germany and thus European economies. Investors paid more attention to bad news about the American economy. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes dropped 2.9 percent in March, nearly triple the 1 percent decline expected by analysts. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 15.40 points, to 3,398.37. In midmorning trading, it briefly swerved upward 12 points, then dived 26 points shortly before 3 P.M., then recovered somewhat.
Four Dow stocks -- Allied Signal, J. P. Morgan, General Electric and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- accounted for most of the drop. Allied Signal, a diversified manufacturing company, lost 2 5/8, to 63 5/8. Tending to lift the Dow was Aluminum Company of America, which closed up 1 1/2, to 65 3/8.
The Dow Jones transportation average closed down 37.47 points, to 1,580.55, posting its fifth decline in six trading days. UAL, United Airlines' parent, closed down 4 7/8, to 139 3/8, and accounted for nearly 8 points in the transport average's decline.
Big Board volume totaled 283.3 million shares, compared with Friday's volume of 259.8 million shares. Decliners outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1. The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed down 1.94 points, to 239.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 3.49 points, to 433.54. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.54 points, to 645.87.
Many major stocks were down on continuing anxiety about the economy. Bank shares, led by those of Citicorp and BankAmerica, and insurance companies, led by American International Group, were bid down on expectations that persistently low interest rates would hurt earnings.
Citicorp closed down 1 7/8, to 25 7/8, on heavy volume of 4.45 million shares; BankAmerica ended down 2 7/8, to 44 1/4, also on heavy volume of 4.18 million shares. Barron's, the business magazine, and analysts have questioned whether bank earnings, generally good, have peaked.
 Shares of Intel, already battered by prospective sales of a tiny rival's cheaper copy of Intel's microchip, were hammered again by word of a new and cheaper chip from Motorola, a more formidable competitor. Intel closed down 5 1/4, to 87 3/8, on volume of 11.6 million shares, the heaviest of the day.
Gold stocks were the striking exception among market performers for the second consecutive session, although there appeared to be some profit taking in the group. Traders followed the lead of the well-known investors George Soros and Sir James Goldsmith. Mr. Soros bought a 10 percent stake in Newmont Mining from Sir James for $400 million. Sir James reportedly used proceeds from that sale to purchase options to buy gold bullion, analysts said. Newmont shares rose 1, to $46 7/8.
Homestake Mining was the most actively traded stock on the Big Board, with 3.2 million shares, but it closed down 1/4 point, to 15 3/4, despite trading higher during the day.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. In a Deal In Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
After years of trans-Pacific trade frictions over telephone equipment, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced today that it had tentatively agreed to sell a dozen of its most advanced central office telephone switches to Japan's main telephone company.
The deal is the first instance of A.T.& T.'s selling telecommunications equipment to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company, which is the world's largest local telephone company and is two-thirds owned by the Japanese Government. Today's transaction came after years of pressure applied by the United States to get N.T.T. to break its traditional reliance on Japanese suppliers.
 
Under Washington's Eye
 In recent weeks, American officials had let N.T.T. and the Japanese Government know that they were closely watching the talks. 
 For separate reasons, American and Japanese Government and corporate officials played down the politics of today's announcement, which was also made by N.T.T. in Tokyo.
Randall L. Tobias, A.T.& T.'s vice chairman, contended that today's decision showed that A.T.& T. manufactured a competitive product. But he also said that officials at the State Department and other agencies "have certainly been helpful to us in engineering, as nearly as they could, a level playing field."
 
A Japanese View
 Seiichiro Noboru, the economics minister at the Japanese Embassy here, said that today's deal had "absolutely nothing to do with political pressure because N.T.T. has been continuously increasing its purchases since the early 1980's."
The Government has a long record of making concessions at politically opportune times, and this may not signal a broader opening of the Japanese market. Japanese imports of American telecommunications equipment dropped sharply last year, to $555 million from $699 million in 1991.
Anne Luzzatto, the press secretary for Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, declined to comment.
Today's announcement happened to coincide with increased activity in the Clinton Administration's review of whether to classify imported mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles as trucks instead of cars, a move that would raise import tariffs on them to 25 percent from 2.5 percent, helping to protect Detroit auto makers.
At a National Economic Council meeting on Friday of deputy Cabinet secretaries, Roger Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, presented a Treasury Department review of the advantages and disadvantages of such a move, a Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said.
President Clinton said at a news conference on March 23 that the Bush Administration's decision to classify the vehicles as cars was "a $300-million-a-year freebie to the Japanese for no apparent reason," a reference to the difference in what the two tariff rates would yield in annual revenues to the Government.
A possible compromise under discussion in the Administration and the auto industry would have the Treasury reclassify the mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles as trucks and then lower the truck tariff to 8.5 percent from 25 percent.
Mr. Tobias said that today's telephone switching equipment announcement had been in preparation for weeks and that the timing was not determined by politics.
N.T.T.'s purchasing practices have been the subject of trade squabbles since the Carter Administration, when the Japanese company's chairmen then, Tokuji Akikusa, made a comment that his company might "open procurement to the U.S. for buckets, rags, mops and miscellaneous office supplies."
The latest American-Japan agreement, in December, required that N.T.T. hold open and competitive bidding for its electrical power and construction contracts.
A.T.& T. and Nippon refused to discuss the value of today's deal. But Gregory Mesniaeff, an analyst at Northern Business Information, a New York consulting company, estimated that it was worth about $40 million, including installation.
"It's a notable achievement," he said. "Until recently, the whole N.T.T. market was off limits to anyone except Fujitsu and NEC."
Today's agreement is tentative because N.T.T. has insisted that it must make sure the programming is compatible with the Japanese telephone network.

HEADLINE: Panel Gives California Hope on Keeping Bases

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., April 26

 BODY:
The chairman of the Presidential commission that will determine the fate of scores of military bases has told state officials that bases elsewhere in the nation may be reviewed in the coming weeks as possible replacements for some in Northern California that are scheduled to be closed.
The possibility of expanding the scope of the commission's review was raised by the panel's chairman, James A. Courter, during a four-day visit to Northern California that included visits to eight military bases in the region and two days of public hearings here. 
 Mr. Courter's tentative offer is still subject to the approval of five members of the eight-member Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. But it was considered a small victory for lawmakers, leaders of community groups and military experts here, who brought thick reports, colorful pie charts and aerial photos in their 11th-hour plea to save local bases and the tens of thousands of jobs they provide.
 
'Very Sympathetic'
 Since saving jobs is not the mandate of the commission, however, the most effective pitches here were those that challenged the data and analysis used by the Department of Defense in recommending that certain bases be closed and others saved based on military preparedness.
In at least two cases -- the Alameda Naval Air Station and the McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento -- Mr. Courter said he was "very sympathetic, without pledging on a Bible," to suggestions that their military preparedness be measured against that of other bases that might be better candidates for closing.
"That logic is compelling to me," Mr. Courter said after hearing detailed challenges to the Pentagon analysis by groups representing the bases in Alameda, a naval enclave on the other side of the Oakland estuary, and Sacramento, where two other bases are already in the midst of closing as a result of earlier military cutbacks.
In the case of Alameda, the alternative would be Everett Naval Station in Washington State, a base now under construction that has no housing, hospital or piers for nuclear carriers, as the Alameda station does. In the case of McClellan, the alternatives would be Ogden Air Force Base in Utah, Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, Kelly Air Force Base in Texas or Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia, none of which would require the costly environmental cleanup necessary before the Sacramento base can be developed for nonmilitary uses.
Considering other bases, Mr. Courter said, would require a commission vote, which could come as early as next week, when the panel convenes again in Charleston, S.C., for further hearings, the third of nine such sessions nationwide.
The base-closing commission, which was set up to insulate Congress from angry constituents on such decisions, can alter the Pentagon's list by adding or subtracting bases. The panel must submit its final recommendations to President Clinton by July 1. Mr. Clinton, and then Congress, would have to approve or reject the entire package.
Dozens of witnesses, including Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the Oakland Democrat who is the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a longtime advocate of sharply reduced military spending, testified on behalf of keeping the Alameda station open.
Mr. Dellums did not make an economic argument for keeping the station open at a time when the state remains in an economic slump. Instead, he stressed the failings of the new base in Everett and the costs of making it the equivalent to Alameda.
"It will take hundreds of millions of dollars to replicate the situation we already have," Mr. Dellums said. "I am not a Ph.D. in mathematics, but the economics of that escapes me."
 
Piers for Nuclear Carriers
 Adm. Bob Foley, a former commander of the Pacific fleet and a one-time Assistant Secretary of Energy, testified that the three berths in Alameda for nuclear carriers would be difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate elsewhere. He said permits for such operations were extremely difficult to obtain.
Admiral Foley noted that the Navy's statistical comparison of bases had awarded more points to Everett for its gymnasium than to Alameda for its piers for nuclear carriers.
Witnesses supporting McClellan drew laughter from members of the base commission when they said the Sacramento base was downgraded because it was not near an aquarium. But it was testimony about McClellan's contaminated ground water and soil that elicited the most concern.
Gov. Pete Wilson testified that cleaning up McClellan would cost $3 million to $10 million. And Sacramento officials said they doubted if any developer would be interested in the toxic site or if any bank would be willing to loan money toward McClellan's purchase.
"There is no future for this facility," said Representative Vic Fazio, Democrat from the Sacramento area.
Harry C. McPherson, a member of the commission, said of McClellan: "You're filthy. Nobody can touch you with a 10-foot pole, or a 10-billion-foot pole. That's a pretty good argument to have to stay in business."

HEADLINE: Struggle to Survive in Town That Steel Forgot

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALIQUIPPA, Pa.

 BODY:
Molten metal still flows in a handful of buildings on the seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River bank here where a sprawling Jones & Laughlin steel complex once employed as many as 17,000 workers. But if the nation had a hospital for communities, this struggling town 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh would have been sent to intensive care.
The LTV Corporation, which bought Jones & Laughlin in 1968, has only 600 employees here now. They work in a tin mill that coats steel made elsewhere. Farther north, in a former LTV building, a machine maintenance and repair concern shares space with a small steel finishing company. Then there is J & L Structural Inc., a private concern that in 1987 acquired an LTV mill that makes 14-inch steel bars used primarily in mobile home construction, and a dock facility for shipping and receiving goods by water. It employs about 130 people. 
 Added up, though, the activity is a meager down payment on future prosperity of a town that was built by paternalistic steel barons earlier this century and has been dependent on the industry ever since. Most of the steelmaking operations have been carefully demolished. What remains are vast stretches of vacant, bulldozed land ringed by barbed-wire fences and No Trespassing signs.
The Aliquippa experience is a stark contrast to that of Kamaishi, Japan, a steel town that lost its leading industry when the Nippon Steel Corporation gradually shut its steelmaking operations there. Eager to preserve its lifetime-employment policy, Nippon created almost any new business it could for the jobless workers.
Aliquippa is only one of many American towns that were blasted by the contraction of the steel industry. There are about 167,000 workers in the industry today, down from a peak of 650,000 in 1953.
Many communities that depend on auto makers and military contractors have faced similar pressures. A few communities are equally dependent on military bases that are scheduled to close in the coming decade.
Occasionally, American companies that have left the communities they dominated economically have been willing and able to provide substantial transition assistance. More typically, though, the abandoned communities and various government bodies have been left to do the best they can with limited corporate support.
Hard-pressed steelmakers in particular have had little to offer towns like Aliquippa when they pulled out. Indeed, some like LTV have ended up in bankruptcy court where they sought to duck pension obligations and other support that workers had assumed would be theirs even in the event of shutdowns.
"It's not just LTV, although once Jones & Laughlin sold to them we became nothing more than a blip on a Texas computer," said Sylvester Greco, a longtime downtown merchant, referring to LTV's corporate headquarters in Dallas. "There was so many things that went wrong that I don't know where to begin."
Franklin Avenue, the main shopping street of the town during its heyday in the 1950's and 1960's, looks even more forlorn than the weed-pocked expanses where open-hearth furnaces once flamed. About 30 stores, including Mr. Greco's cheerful shop that sells bridal and women's clothing, survive in a shopping district that once had almost 300. Most storefronts are boarded up, empty or given over to social service agencies. There are gaps where entire buildings have been torn down but not replaced.
The woes of downtown Aliquippa are not entirely the fault of its shrinking steel industry. It has also been victimized by a migration to the suburbs of wage-earning families and the merchants who serve them. The population fell by 20 percent during the 1970's even though employment at the mill held relatively steady at more than 10,000.
"Aliquippa has been ghettoized," said Simon Simoni, a lawyer here for 35 years. "All that's left around here are the aged and those on welfare."
Many steelworkers retired to live on part-time handyman work and pensions after the layoffs. Union officials said that others had found jobs as baggage handlers and bus drivers at Pittsburgh's airport, as security guards at shopping malls, and in a variety of other service tasks that pay far less than the mill.
 
Surviving on Lower Wages
 Donald Maretti, who was laid off in 1984 after 19 1/2 years, just six months short of his pension, had a series of jobs that advanced him to the position of director of housekeeping at the Beaver Valley Mall about a 15-minute drive north of Aliquippa.
"I could have done anything when I came out of the Marines," Mr. Maretti said. "I chose the mill. I don't blame the Government, the company or the union for what happened."
Few of the workers have landed jobs that pay as well as the mill once did. "The pension plan is relatively liberal and helps a lot of people survive on lower wages," said Peter Eritano, the staff representative of the United Steelworkers International for Western Pennsylvania and the former head of the Aliquippa local.
A patchwork of training programs and social services provided by LTV, the union, churches and government agencies also cushioned the crash. Federally financed education benefits for workers who lost their jobs in industries like steel that suffered from imports helped some Aliquippans, as did extended unemployment benefits for those in training programs. An LTV-financed union program helped those without high school degrees get their diplomas.
 
Lack of Skills Training
 "The trouble is that there's not enough training to really upgrade people's skills and not enough high-tech jobs available even if they get the training," Mr. Eritano said. "The United States lags way, way behind other industrial countries in providing new opportunities for workers where plants are shut down."
Local development agencies and politicians have worked hard to recruit other major employers, but the effort has been futile. Indeed, it took millions of dollars of state loans, concessionary contracts from the unions and discounted utility rates simply to arrange the management buyout that saved the bar mill.
"And thank God for the Westinghouse Credit Corporation," said Howell A. Breedlove Jr., the chief executive of the business that bought LTV's 14-inch bar mill and the dock facility in 1987. "They loaned us about $8 million. None of the local banks would touch us."
Mr. Breedlove said LTV had also helped J & L Structural by lobbying the union to accept the new contract and by executing a "supportive" arrangement for dealing with the web of utilities, railroads, and roads at the site.
LTV officials said the decisions about shutdowns had been made from Cleveland, the headquarters of the LTV Steel Corporation, not Dallas, where the parent is based, and that it had taken a number of steps to cushion the blow. Those included continuing to pay property taxes for five years beyond its obligations and financing a union-run job search and career development center.
 
Union Is Not Critical
 LTV also spent more than $50 million to tear down buildings and clean up the site in an effort with local officials to attract new businesses.
"Aliquippa was the flagship," said Mark Tomasch, an LTV spokesman in Cleveland. "We put off closing it for years and when we did, it was an emotional blow for the company."
Union officials said that whatever its faults, LTV should not be criticized for its handling of the shutdowns.
Several organizations have been formed to revitalize the town's industrial and commercial base. The most ambitious has been the Aliquippa Alliance for Unity and Development, which has been addressing social and economic concerns since 1984. Its business incubator, a former bank building, currently is home to entrepeneurs offering services like landscaping, videotaping of weddings, greeting cards for the military market and computer-aided design.
One project backed by the alliance is an outdoor arts pageant scheduled for next month. It is aimed at celebrating the town's potential. "The more I talked to people, the more I realized there's a grieving for the past," said M. Michele Illuminato, the art show's organizer. "They miss their jobs and life style, of course, but they also miss the bonds of community that have been broken with so many people moving away."

HEADLINE: U.S. Congress, Glad Yeltsin Won, Ponders Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in the referendum on Sunday produced expressions of relief today from the White House, the State Department and Congressional supporters of the proposed $1.8 billion aid package for Russia, which would have been killed by a vote of no confidence.
"This is a very, very good day, not only for the people of Russia, but for the people of the United States and all the people of the world," President Clinton said today during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House where he greeted members the University of Arkansas track team. 
 The President, who spoke by telephone with Mr. Yeltsin this afternoon to congratulate him, also praised the voters who backed Mr. Yeltsin and his policies despite economic privations. "I think the reaffirmation of his policies really is a tribute to the farsightedness of the Russian people," he said.
 
Now, How Can U.S. Help?
 Approval of Mr. Yeltsin and his program gives an added boost for Mr. Clinton's proposal to aid Russia.
"If the vote had gone the other way, no matter how much political theory we could argue -- for supporting the democratic process and the economic benefits -- it would have been an almost insurmountable obstacle," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Appropriation Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Operations.
Still, with the air thick with talk of tax increases, budget deficits and cuts in Government programs, foreign aid faces formidable obstacles.
"I think it eventually can be put through," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader. "But there are tactical and substantive questions."
The aid package, announced earlier this month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during a meeting in Tokyo of foreign and finance ministers from seven major industrial nations, is in addition to $1.6 billion that was offered to Mr. Yeltsin during his summit meeting with President Clinton in Vancouver, British Columbia. The first $1.6 billion has already been authorized.
The additional sum is made up of $1.3 billion in direct aid and $500 million to be funneled through international agencies. In putting up the $500 million, the United States challenged other industrial nations to match or exceed that amount.
The President, who also spoke today to former President Richard M. Nixon on how best to proceed with Russia, used his photo opportunity with the track team to make his sales pitch for aid, tying support economic changes in Russia with America's long-term economic interests.
"They are a huge country with vast natural resources, with enormous opportunities for Americans to create jobs and to earn income and to reap the benefits of trade," he said.
 
A Litmus Test
 Backers of the aid say that failure to win Congressional approval would not only embarrass the Administration but also signal that Washington is not serious about supporting economic change.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which will be asked to approve any aid package, said: "This is the foreign policy issue. This is the issue that defines whether we're going to live up to our responsibilities to protect our own interests."
But so far the Administration has not said how it will raise $1.8 billion.
It could seek an emergency addition to the 1993 budget, a tactic that was used for the President's economic-stimulus package, which was blocked in the Senate.
The President could also try to amend the 1994 aid budget, which he has already submitted. That would mean cutting spending, probably from the Defense Department or aid programs. But the Administration is talking about spending more for things like refugee assistance, population control and economic development.
 
Domestic Intersections
 Mr. Obey and others say domestic politics, including the failure of President Clinton's economic proposals, complicates getting approval for aid to Russia. Republican lawmakers say that if the Administration tries to declare the aid an emergency addition to the 1993 budget, which would add to the deficit, it would suffer the same fate as the stimulus package.
On the other hand, Democratic liberals, especially those representing urban areas, say it is difficult to sell constituents on aiding Russia when Congress has refused to help the cities. Some Democrats also plan to make that point to embarrass Republicans, like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who killed the economic package but who support aid to Russia.
"Why is it easier to help stimulate the Russian economy than it is the United States economy?" asked Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. "My belief is that the Russian aid package is not as popular as they may have thought."

HEADLINE: Polo Returns to the Lawns of Long Island;
After Decades of Decline, the Sport Is Regaining Prominence

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERICHO, L.I.

 BODY:
Grab your mallets and your hip flasks. Have the groom saddle the ponies and tell the valet to chill the champagne. There is jolly sporting news, at long last, for Long Island's smart set:
Polo is back.
It isn't quite what it was from the 1920's to the 40's, when the gilded clans of the Gold Coast, the Whitneys and the Guests, the Hitchcocks and the Phippses, played matches in their own lavish backyards, when the Duchess of Windsor or the Maharajah of Jaipur might pop in to present a sterling silver loving cup or knock the ball around for a chukker or two on one of the Island's 50 polo fields.
 
U.S. Open in Polo Land
 Nevertheless, after decades of decline, during which polo clubhouses were bulldozed for expressways and fields subdivided for housing developments, the sport is being played again on vast, lush lawns from Old Westbury to the Hamptons. Strings of polo ponies are being put through their paces in paddocks along Long Island's North Shore. Membership in the Meadowbrook Club, the Island's premier polo club, has risen from 14 to 42 in three years, placing it near its goal of 50 and among the 10 largest in the country. Two new polo clubs have been established on the Island in the last few years. 
 And, in the most significant symbol of the sport's revival here, the organization that governs polo in the United States has selected Nassau County as the site of next year's United States Open, bringing the tournament back to Long Island for the first time in 40 years.
While the United States Polo Association's decision is unlikely to cause a stampede to local stores for bamboo polo mallets -- there are only about 4,000 active players in the nation -- local polo aficionados are ecstatic. They say the return of the Open, which will be played here in both 1994 and 1995, is what Long Island polo needs to build interest.
"I'm just so thrilled about it; it's just overwhelming," declared Albert V. Bianco, a Brooklyn-born developer who keeps 25 polo ponies on his 55-acre spread in Old Brookville. Mr. Bianco, president of the Meadowbrook Polo Club -- which is based here and bills itself as the oldest polo club in the nation -- is polo's No. 1 booster in these parts. Polo has become such a major part of his life that he has integrated it into his business, offering free club memberships to buyers of homes in an Old Westbury subdivision he is developing named Polo Estates.
Polo -- with its image as a tony pursuit of British royals and American industrialists who sound faintly British -- does not, of course, have the drawing power of hockey, tennis or even tractor-pulling. Opens held in Indio, Calif., and Lexington, Ky., in recent years drew only a few thousand spectators. Even so, Nassau County officials who have never swung a mallet are describing the tournament's return as a major coup.
 
'Tourism Revenue' for Nassau
 "The fact that the Open is coming here demonstrates, in the minds of many, that Nassau County can compete with other geographic areas in attracting such sporting activities," observed Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive, whose office supplied a helicopter to take the association's representatives on a tour of polo fields in Bethpage State Park and elsewhere to persuade them to select Nassau over sites in four other states.
Mr. Gulotta, who says he has been riding horses in amateur rodeos since he was 4, predicted that polo fever will bring the crowds to the monthlong Open in September 1994, and that the event will generate $6 million in "tourism revenue" each year. "We are anticipating up to 20,000 spectators," he said.
Still, officials acknowledge, the networks are not exactly lining up for the broadcast rights. Polo's peak predated the era of television. In the first three decades of this century, Mr. Bianco said, polo was a huge spectator sport on Long Island, where many of the game's greatest players, like Tommy Hitchcock and Alan Corey, got their start. In 1928, a three-day series of matches between the United States and Argentina, held on the original fields of what was then known as the Meadow Brook Club, attracted more than 100,000 people. Between 1916 and 1953, 28 of the 31 United States Opens were held at Meadow Brook, which was then in nearby Westbury.
"It was the heyday of polo when it was held on Long Island," said Allan Scherer, the executive director of the polo association.
 
Will Rogers and Harriman
 At first glance, polo may look like croquet on horseback, but it actually has more in common with such hardscrabble sports as hockey and soccer.
A match, played by two four-person teams on a field 300 yards long and 160 yards wide, is divided into six periods, or chukkers. Between each chukker, the players change horses, which are ridden at speeds of up to 35 miles an hour. Players, in helmets and knee pads, use the bamboo mallets, or sticks, to hit the wood or plastic ball into the opposing team's goal.
Will Rogers, who lived on Long Island when he appeared in New York with the Ziegfeld Follies, played at Meadow Brook, as did W. Averell Harriman, the former New York Governor, who was a formidable polo talent. The matches would pit rich men on horses against rich men on horses, and the matches were intense and tiring and dangerous, much as they are today. Mr. Bianco, who at 66 still plays, broke his wrist in a fall from his horse a few years ago.
"Genteel people can be rough," said Charles Leonard, 73, a retired stockbroker who grew up in Jericho and played in one of the last Opens held at Meadow Brook in the early 1950's. His younger brother, Hazard, was killed during a polo match in Aiken, S.C., in 1952.
 
Muscled Off the Island
 It was during the 1950's that polo was muscled off the island, its playing fields -- each requiring nearly 10 acres -- coveted as prime residential and office space. In 1954, the land under the Meadow Brook Club was taken by the state for a highway. The club's name lived on in the plans of Long Island commuters: the state called the new road the Meadowbrook Parkway.
A few diehards continued to play polo as the club moved to Jericho. But to many, the demise of the old club represented the passing of a way of life on Long Island. Membership declined as many of the old North Shore estates were broken up or sold off, and the younger generation turned to other distractions, like golf.
But now, even in the face of a slow economy, polo is muscling back, largely as a result of Mr. Bianco's energy and salesmanship. Having taken control of the Meadowbrook Club in 1984 -- the two words were combined during a 1961 reorganization -- Mr. Bianco has slowly tried to rebuild membership by developing new fields and training programs.
The polo fields remain the playground of the well-heeled: polo ponies, bred mostly in the western United States, start at $4,500 to $7,000 and go up to $200,000. And, Mr. Bianco says, you must have at least two. Full membership in the club, which employs a full-time polo pro, costs $4,300 a year for a season that runs from May to October.
There are, of course, other polo meccas. There are clubs from Greenwich, Conn., to San Antonio to Santa Barbara, Calif. And though polo got its start in the United States in the Northeast, Palm Beach, Fla., is considered by many to be the nation's premier polo spot.
"But there is no club in the world that has the heritage of Meadowbrook," said Mr. Bianco.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Warns of Sluggish '93 Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The world economy will experience sluggish growth for the third straight year and could suffer a new slowdown if the major industrial nations fail to take stronger steps to bolster growth, the International Monetary Fund said today in an economic forecast.
The I.M.F. said the United States economy would grow by 3.2 percent this year and next, but it predicted a dismal year of economic stagnation in Europe and unusually slow growth in Japan. 
 "The recovery of global economic activity after the 1991 downturn remains hesitant and uneven," the I.M.F said in its semiannual forecast, the World Economic Outlook.
The report said the Clinton Administration should have done considerably more to cut the budget deficit, saying its plan to reduce the deficit by $140 billion by 1998 -- to around $200 billion, or roughly 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- was inadequate.
 
Would Lower Rates
 I.M.F. officials said deeper cuts in the deficit would help lower interest rates in the United States and abroad and make more money available for private investment.
Perhaps the biggest negative was the forecast that the economies of former Soviet republics would again shrink, by a painful 11.8 percent this year, after having shrunk 18.5 percent last year. But the report said that if the former Soviet lands succeeded in controlling inflation and creating basic market economies, they could experience "an economic turnaround as early as the middle of the decade."
The I.M.F. said sluggishness was fueling trade tensions as worries about high unemployment mounted. Emphasizing the importance of economic cooperation, it suggested further interest rate cuts in Germany and Japan as well as additional budgetary stimulation by Japan.
"If the industrial countries do not seize the opportunity for effective action," the forecast said, "a further deterioration of the economic climate and rising tensions over trade might be difficult to avoid."
In an unusually pointed statement for an I.M.F. official, Michael Mussa, the fund's research director, said at a news conference today that it would be good for the American economy and for economies generally if the United States were to cut its budget deficit by almost twice as much as the Clinton Administration has sought.
Mr. Mussa noted that many economists said it was unsatisfactory when the Reagan Administration pushed the budget deficit up to 3 percent of gross domestic product, saying that having a similar budget deficit now is also unsatisfactory.
"Further measures will therefore be necessary," the I.M.F. report said, although it noted that the President had already made a "considerable effort."
A Treasury official responded by saying that President Clinton's "deficit reduction package was the largest ever put forward by an American administration." He added that the Administration believed that deeper deficit cuts would have endangered economic growth.
The report forecast that Germany's economy would do miserably this year -- shrinking by 1.3 percent -- while European economies over all would fail to grow. The forecast did see Britain slowly pulling itself out of its long recession.
For Japan, the I.M.F. forecast puny growth of 1.3 percent this year, the same as last year. With inflation low and the yen near a high against the dollar, the report said Japan had room to lower its interest rates further.
The I.M.F. forecast that over all, economies would grow by 2.2 percent this year, up from 1.8 percent last year. This year's forecast is a big reduction from the fund's prediction of 3.6 percent, made in October.
Although it emphasized that there were risks that could slow growth, like increasing trade tensions and shaky business confidence, the I.M.F. forecast that the world economy would improve next year, growing at 3.4 percent.
The brightest spot in the report was a forecast that developing nations' economies would grow by a robust 5.1 percent this year, led by stunning growth of 6.7 percent in the emerging countries of Asia.
In much of its report, the I.M.F. sought to sound the alarm about rising trade tensions and growing protectionism, saying, "The significant benefits from free trade now seem threatened."
It said that the failure to conclude the current round of negotiations aimed at creating more liberal world trade rules was adding to this tension. It also criticized industrial nations for imposing trade penalties on others and for adopting managed-trade agreements.
"They run the risk of triggering a spiral of retaliation and counter-retaliation, severely harming business confidence and prospects for recovery," the report said.

HEADLINE: Ho Chi Minh City Journal;
The Smiles for Americans, and Other Paradoxes

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
The contradictions of Vietnam are evident everywhere, as the Communist Government tries to combine a free-market economy with rigid, one-party rule.
But they are most palpable in this city, which has been Communist for 18 years. Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, has made rapid progress in the 1990's to undo the dour monotony imposed since 1975 by the stern party bureaucrats from the North, who came down to show their brothers the virtues of Marxism-Leninism. 
 It is not only that the restaurants today are more elegant than the best of the pre-Communist era. It is also that those who go there to dine and be seen do so with the self-assurance that only a very full wallet confers.
 
American Entrepreneurs Dine
 It is also that among the diners there are American business people whose main offices may be in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur or Hong Kong, in observance of the American embargo on trading with Vietnam, but much of whose business is done here.
Moreover, one may find among the guests men who for many years have been in the shadows because of supposed political unreliability. They include people active in politics under the old Saigon Government, as well as southern revolutionaries who fell into oblivion for resenting the North's dominance after 1975 or individualists difficult to incorporate into any authoritarian system.
The city also offers the sight of sailors from the first Communist country, whose ships no longer bring Soviet aid but serve as tramp freighters for cargoes from thriving Asian countries, stealing into the rear of shops on Nguyen Hue Street, bustling once more, to sell satchels full of contraband caviar for a pittance.
The Soviet Union was the country without which Vietnam might not have survived the enmity of the United States first and China later, and the reward for its extensive aid in war and peace is barely disguised scorn for the poverty of the few Russians still seen here.
The eagerness to welcome Americans in Vietnam, North and South, is one of the few things in which official pronouncements coincide with public opinion.
"We never felt bitterness toward the Americans," said Nguyen Tu Chi, a 67-year-old Hanoi anthropologist, combat soldier in the struggle against the French, and Communist Party member since 1946. "Maybe we have passed through too many wars. One gets used to it."
Visible as are the paradoxes of this city, they are equally strong in Hanoi. There, however, they strike the ear more than the eye. The lovely city of lakes, ringed by buildings of old Vietnamese, Chinese and French-colonial architecture, sadly run down, has changed little.
The paradoxes lie in the verbal gymnastics with which Government and party officials of the old school cling to justifications for an ideology that few others still believe.
While the ideology continues to be proclaimed and taught, throughout the North temples forced by the ideologists to be neglected for decades are being restored by villagers with their own hands and their limited money.
The face and voice of Pham Van Ngoc, an elderly carpenter in Xa Dong Tien, near Haiphong, trembled with modest pride as he showed the handsome dragons that he had copied in cement from another temple to decorate the classical roof of the village shrine. On an ordinary day, the restored temple was crowded with villagers praying, lighting joss sticks and bringing offerings of food.
At the opposite end of the widened ideological range, Vu Huu Ngoan, deputy director of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, and a senior colleague, Dao Duy Quat, took pains to assure a visitor that the demise of their sister institutes in Europe, along with the parties that trained their functionaries there, had served only to reinforce them in their faith.
"I don't believe the doctrine has collapsed," Mr. Ngoan said. "On the contrary, the collapse of those countries proves that the principles are right and they applied them wrongly."
But because of the declining standing of Marx and Lenin, some of whose ideas they said had proved erroneous, the institute last May took out a kind of dialectical insurance. Mr. Ngoan said the name of Ho Chi Minh was added to the school's title.
"Maybe their own gods are no ideological giants, but they are their own," a Russian diplomat said.
Tran Cong Man, an amiable retired major general and journalist, who often serves as informal party spokesman, conceded that there was an ideological crisis. But all the old ideas of the class struggle still apply, he added. "There must be state enterprises," he said. "If we don't control them, we don't control the situation."
"In our experience, it isn't too necessary to have many parties," he said. "We want to have more and more democracy every day under the rule of one party."
There was real pain in the voice of General Man, an old Communist, when he said two of the highest socialist ideals -- free education and free medical care -- had proved luxuries that Vietnam could no longer afford. Parents now pay fees for their children from secondary school on, and doctors and medicines must be paid for.
Prof. Vu Van Tao, assistant to the Education Minister, said, "Today, free education is utopian in Vietnam."

HEADLINE: Coke Plans to Buy 30% Stake In Mexican Soft Drink Unit

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 26

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it would spend $195 million to buy a 30 percent stake in the soft drink operation of Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A., the Monterrey-based company that holds Coke's biggest foreign franchise.
The move raises Coca-Cola's stakes in what has become one of the most important theaters of its global struggle with Pepsi-Cola International. Mexico's per-capita cola consumption is second only to that of the United States, and the nation's thirst is expected to grow for years, with or without ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 The proposed sale values the soft-drink arm of Femsa, as the Mexican company is known, at $650 million, or 15.8 times the division's 1992 earnings. The figure is considerably less than some beverage industry analysts had forecast, and the price of Femsa shares fell nearly 4 percent today to close at $3.86 on Mexico City's Bolsa de Valores.
Last month, Pepsi International announced that it would spend $115 million on equity stakes in its franchises in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Mexico City's suburbs and other parts of the country. Pepsi said it would spend another $635 million to expand its operations around Mexico over the next five years.
"To a large degree, this is a defensive move by Coca-Cola," said Carlos Laboy, an analyst at James Capel Inc. in New York. "But it's a good way to counter Pepsi's moves and it's a good way for Coca-Cola to acquire greater management control over its largest franchise in the world."
In a first rejoinder last week, Coca-Cola announced that its "system" would spend $3 billion in Mexico over the next five years. Half of the amount is to go into advertising and promotions, while the other half is to be invested in the renovation and expansion of Coca-Cola's bottling and distribution operations and the building of eight new plants.
By borrowing new money and selling shares, Femsa Refrescos S.A., as the soft-drink unit is called, will contribute a third of the money for improvements. Femsa's general director, Othon Ruiz Montemayor, said the soft drink unit would spend the money to build a "megaplant" in the Mexico City valley and a bottling plant in the southern state of Oaxaca, and to upgrade its distribution network, warehouses and other bottling plants.
Industry analysts said they expected Coca-Cola's investment in the Femsa subsidiary, the company's first equity stake in a Latin American bottler, to quickly turn the franchise into an even more important cog in Coke's operations in the region.
Officials of the two companies said Femsa Refrescos would be reconstituted as a debt-free company -- a factor that seemed to account in part for the unexpectedly low multiple of earnings reflected in the sale.
 
Latin American Foothold
 They said that in addition to spending $500 million over the next five years to modernize and expand production and distribution capacities, the unit might also buy or take over franchises in other parts of Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.
The soft drink unit is to get a separate listing on stock exchanges in Mexico and abroad. Femsa officials said they would soon offer as much as 19 percent of their share in the subsidiary for public sale; Coca-Cola's chairman, Roberto C. Goizueta, left open the possibility that Coke might try to increase its stake, but its executive vice president, John Hunter, said later that Coke had no such plans.
Under the sale arrangement, Coke is to have four seats on the board of the soft drink unit. Femsa gets five seats, including that of the chairman.
 Industry analysts have voiced concern, echoed privately by some Coca-Cola Company officials, that the conglomerate that owns 51 percent of Femsa, Valores Industriales S.A., or Visa, has not been focusing sufficiently on soft drinks. In October 1991, Visa's management led the purchase from the Government of the second-biggest bank in Mexico, Bancomer S.A., and used Femsa to borrow $610 for the deal. Visa has also been hunting for strategic partners for its other ventures in beer, packaging and convenience stores.
 
Market Share Claims
 Pepsi has been moving aggressively in Mexico, where it is believed to command about a quarter of all cola sales and slightly more than 20 percent of the entire market for soft drinks. (The competitors' claims of market share conflict, and there is no independent public estimate.)
The country's biggest Pepsi bottler, Grupo Embotelladora de Mexico S.A., or Gemex, stole away some of Femsa's market share in the Mexico City valley last year by producing a returnable 1.5-liter product more quickly and promoting it more heavily. Femsa has since won back the 55 percent share of the region's cola market that it previously enjoyed, but has had to scramble to keep up with Gemex's innovations in distribution and sales tactics.
 
 
No Call to Arms
 Coke and Femsa officials announced the sale at a Mexico City news conference at which they all seemed to be trying hard to sound as nondefensive as possible. Sitting behind a row of open Coke bottles -- from which none of them drank -- they scrupulously avoided terms like "Pepsi" and "war."
Referring obliquely to "all the recent noise made by some of our competitors," Mr. Goizueta said, "We sell more than twice as much as they do."
 
Battle Intensifies
 But neither he nor other company executives seemed to challenge the notion of many industry analysts that Femsa and Coca-Cola will have to fight harder and differently to keep their huge share of the market.
"Generally in Mexico, the advertising hasn't been nearly so competitive a process and the focus has been on distribution," said Timothy C. Davis, a Latin America analyst at Lazard Freres & Company in New York. "But as the distribution networks develop, the market will become more like the United States, where the major soft-drink producers battle over points of market share."
In comparison with most of the rest of the world, Mexico is already a cola seller's bonanza. According to Coke, only the average American (who drank 296 eight-ounce servings) was able to outdrink the average Mexican (who consumed 275 servings) last year when it came to Coke, Fanta, Sprite and other soft drinks produced by the company.

Selloffs by Italy Reduced To Olive Oil and Gelati

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, April 26

 BODY:
Amid the political upheaval in Italy, the Government is trying to sell some huge, state-owned companies including an ice cream maker and the producer of the best-selling olive oil exported to the United States.
The aims of the intended sales are to unravel decades of state involvement in the economy, reduce a $100 billion budget deficit and also take aim at the $1.2 trillion national debt. 
 Timed from 1992 to 1995, the sales of Government stakes in banks, food-processing companies, engineering firms, and energy and insurance enterprises were supposed to raise more than $25 billion, making the project the largest divestiture of state assets in continental Europe.
Thus far, though, nothing has been sold, and critics are suggesting that the plan was overly ambitious. The only transactions in a relatively advanced stage involve two food-retailing divisions owned by Societa Meridionale Finanziaria S.p.A., known as SME. That, in turn, is 62 percent owned by a giant state holding company, Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, or IRI.
The two divisions are Italgel and Cirio-Bertolli-Derica. What makes them attractive to potential buyers is both their profitability and their market position. Italgel is No. 2 in the Italian ice cream market with a 30 percent share, and No. 2 among all frozen foods with 18 percent.
 
A Big Name in Tomatoes
 In addition, Cirio-Bertolli-Derica leads the processed tomato-products market with a 27 percent share and is Italy's top canned-food producer with 22 percent. Their brand names, including Cirio canned foods and Bertolli olive oil -- also a market leader -- are household words in Italy. And Bertolli is the leading imported olive oil in the United States, with 24 percent of the market, a company spokesman said.
"The interest in buying into these companies is basically twofold," a food-industry analyst who spoke in return for anonymity said. For Italian companies, it offers a way of expanding their share of the market. For outsiders, it offers a point of entry into a very big market.
Italian news reports last week said 12 corporations, nine of them Italian, had survived a selection process to enter bids. Five bid for Italgel and the others for Cirio-Bertolli-Derica. They included some of the country's food giants, including Ferruzzi, Barilla and Parmalat. The foreign bidders were said to include Nestle, Unilever, Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain and the BSN Group of France.
The names of the bidders, however, have not been formally announced by the American merchant banker Wasserstein, Perella & Company, which is handling the deal. Details of the bids were not immediately known.
The auction has had its uneven stretches. Workers at SME headquarters in Naples occupied the premises for nearly three months this year until managers agreed that whatever happened to the company its headquarters would remain in Naples.
 
Touched by Scandal
 Nor has SME escaped the vast national bribery scandal. Its managing director, Mario Artali, was jailed for a time, and then freed this month to face questioning about the illicit financing of political parties that forms a main strand of the scandal.
Beyond this pending sale, the privatization program has mostly generated debate. Conservative opponents of the process forced the suspension of a decree that would have created a separate privatization ministry. And opposition is mounting to the next, far more controversial sale of a 67 percent stake in Credito Italiano, the country's sixth-largest bank.
"Possibly, it was done in too much of a hurry," said Enzo Berlanda, the head of Italy's stockbrokers' confederation, "because when we talk about a bank, we are talking about money, assets and the danger of foreigners taking over."
Treasury Minister Piero Barucci said recently that the Government planned to shed its majority stake in energy companies, acknowledging that details needed to be worked out. In the meantime, Italy is facing the prospect of a new Government and a protracted political crisis over electoral reform.
The privatization program was not squarely in the public eye this past week because of a national referendum on the reforms, in which Italians voted overwhelmingly to scrap much of the system that has prevailed since World War II. If changes on that scale come to pass in the electoral system, and thus in the way the country is run, privatization will assume even greater importance as the economic underpinning of what some hope will be a political revolution.
There are further pressures on Italy to privatize. European Community rules on competition make it impossible for the state to continue financing money-losing industrial albatrosses. The giants of state ownership, IRI and the energy conglomerate ENI, need to revitalize subsidiaries and pay off debts. And Italy is committed to reducing its deficit to meet European Community standards.
Rome's ability to continue drawing on a $10 billion community loan, granted in part to offset the costs of trying to defend the lira during the currency crisis last September, depends on meeting tighter fiscal-management targets.

HEADLINE: For Bellamy, Asserting Fiscal and Electoral Credentials for Comptroller

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26

 BODY:
Carol Bellamy, a leading candidate for state comptroller, spent more than an hour at a legislative hearing today telling lawmakers her views on auditing, pension investments and debt reform. She even impressed legislators by knowing that P.U.C., an actuarial method used to calculate pension contributions, stands for projected unit credit.
But the most important part of Ms. Bellamy's presentation today may have been the chart she handed out showing how many votes she won in each of New York's 62 counties in 1990. 
 Ms. Bellamy, a Democrat, narrowly lost that race for state comptroller to Edward V. Regan, the Republican incumbent who plans to retire on Friday. And for all Ms. Bellamy's mastery of the subject matter, it may be her potential to win a statewide election in 1994 that most interests the Democratic legislators charged with choosing Mr. Regan's successor.
In fact, none of the six candidates seeking to succeed Mr. Regan seems to believe that the policy issues discussed in a two-day series of hearings that began today will have much to do with whom the Legislature selects. The most critical issue, they say, will be who wins the endorsement of Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, who presumably will have the political power to swing the election.
 
Political Realities
 Ms. Bellamy seemed to acknowledge those political realities in her testimony today. After briefly discussing the issues, she said: "I am the only candidate who has demonstrated public support for the office of state comptroller. In 1990, running against a three-term incumbent, almost 2 million voters, or 49 percent of the electorate, voted for me. From Niagara Falls to Montauk, those votes were cast by tens of thousands of your constituents in every single Senate and Assembly district across the state."
The Speaker, a Queens Democrat, did not attend today's hearing. But he has said he probably will announce an endorsement after the hearings conclude. Among other things, Mr. Weprin wants to make sure that none of the candidates commits a political or policy faux pas, according to his colleagues. None of the four who appeared today seemed to do so today.
When the state comptroller leaves office in the middle of a term, New York's Constitution gives the Legislature, sitting as a whole, the responsibility to fill the position.
Democrats hold 127 of the Legislature's 211 seats, so if they keep a united front they can insure the election of a fellow Democrat. And because Mr. Weprin is the leader of 101 of the 127 Democrats, he is considered the kingmaker.
 
Significant Fiscal Powers
 The comptroller's job is coveted partly because it carries significant fiscal powers, including investing a $56 billion pension fund, auditing state agencies and local governments and critiquing the state's debt and budget practices. But it also is one of only six statewide elective offices and is considered a potential springboard to higher office.
The Republicans are boycotting this week's hearings in protest over the Democrats' control of the election, notwithstanding that it was a Republican, Mr. Regan, who put them in this fix.
Almost since Mr. Regan announced his plans in February to retire, lawyers for the Republican-controlled Senate have been devising legal and parliamentary maneuvers to block the election of a Democrat. The Senate Republicans plan to pass a bill on Wednesday that would require a nonbinding public referendum before the Legislature could choose a candidate.
Senate aides said they would also favor allowing Mr. Regan's deputy to run the comptroller's office until a successor is elected popularly in 1994. And they said the Senate simply may refuse to convene the joint legislative session needed for a vote, a move likely to inspire a long court fight.
"We're trying to draw attention to the fact that this is not an open and public process and that people are being excluded," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans.
The candidates who appeared at today's hearing with Ms. Bellamy, who is a managing director of Bear, Stearns & Company and a former New York City Council President, were Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol of Brooklyn, Assemblyman Robin Schimminger of Kenmore and Joel A. Giambra, the Buffalo City Comptroller.
The other candidates, H. Carl McCall, the president of the New York City Board of Education, and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, are scheduled to appear on Tuesday. Mr. McCall and Ms. Bellamy are considered by many in Albany to be the leading contenders.
At today's hearing, Mr. Lentol and Mr. Schimminger stressed their legislative service, with Mr. Schimminger telling his colleagues that the Legislature is "likely to find the very best person to serve in that vacated office within its own ranks." Mr. Giambra emphasized that he was "the only one that has been elected to the office of comptroller."
On the issues, Ms. Bellamy said she would use the clout of New York State's pension fund to influence the management of the corporations it invests in but would not seek to micromanage them.
She said she would not invest pension money in banks that "red line" disadvantaged neighborhoods. And on economic as well as social grounds, she said she would seek to divest the state of investments in companies doing business with South Africa, even without legislation mandating that she do so.
 
Some Tough Questioning
 Ms. Bellamy faced some antagonistic questioning from McCall supporters on the panel.
Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve of Buffalo said he found it "a little offensive" that Ms. Bellamy said she plans to run for comptroller in 1994 regardless of whether she wins the interim appointment.
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. of Brooklyn asked how she would handle the potential conflict of using Bear, Stearns to underwrite state bond issues. And Senator Howard C. Nolan Jr. of Albany pointed out that while she almost won her 1990 campaign, she failed to defeat what he termed a vulnerable incumbent.

HEADLINE: Frank Vanderlip, Philanthropist And Investment Banker, at 86

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Frank Arthur Vanderlip Jr., a New York investment banker and philanthropist, died on Friday at the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's disease in Los Alamitos, Calif. He was 86 and lived in Somers, N.Y., and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
The cause was cancer, said Henrik N. Vanderlip, a nephew. 
 Mr. Vanderlip was born in Scarborough, N.Y. His father was a financier, president of National City Bank of New York, now Citibank, and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President William McKinley. He attended the Scarborough School, founded by his parents, and Phillips Exeter Academy, before graduating in economics and architecture from Harvard in 1930.
Mr. Vanderlip became well known as a fund raiser and organizer of charity balls, for causes that included mental health and the fight against cancer.
 
Active in Civic Affairs
 He was a past president of the Cancer Care volunteers for the National Cancer Foundation, and director and treasurer of the American Opera Society. Over the years he also served as a member of the executive council of the International Young Men's Christian Association, chairman of the Committee on Mental Health Needs of New York City, and a council member of the National Municipal League.
He and his second wife, Dr. Neva Eileen McGrath, built the Beechwood Theater for the Scarborough School on the former family estate, Beechwood, in Scarborough.
In World War II, he was commissioned into the Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel while serving in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Europe. His commendations included the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal of the Armed Forces and the French Legion of Honor.
In business he headed family-controlled investment and real-estate concerns, like the Palos Verdes Corporation in southern California. He also held directorships in various corporations.
Mr. Vanderlip's wife died a year ago. He is survived by a brother, John, of Rancho Palos Verdes, and 12 nieces and nephews.

Gold Up $6.30 in New York; Highest Price in 9 Months

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, April 26

 BODY:
Gold surged to its highest price in six months here today and reached a nine-month high in New York on reports that the British financier Sir James Goldsmith had stepped into the market and executed a major purchase.
Sir James reportedly bought the gold after George Soros, a Wall Street investor and fund manager, bought a 10 percent stake in the Newmont Mining Corporation from Sir James for $400 million. 
 The metal climbed more than $5 in London to $349.25 an ounce, its highest since Oct. 9, and then moved higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York to end at $352.80, up $6.30 from Friday's close. That was the highest settlement for spot deliveries since July 31.
The buying also spilled over into silver, lifting the price by 11.1 cents, to $4.065 an ounce in New York trading.
 
Other Markets mixed
In other commodity markets, coffee prices soared and grain and energy prices were mixed.
Gold had been in the doldrums for several years but a surge of buying was reported last week on worries about inflation and the clouded outlook for economic reform in Russia.
One dealer cited the worldwide lowering of interest rates, which threatens to fan the flames of inflation.
"The policy seems to be -- stimulate regrowth at any cost," he said. "Governments appear to be ignoring the inflation risk and that is good for gold."
But analysts had mixed views on how much higher the market could go.
"The market has work to do around $350," one dealer said. "We could see gold trading at $360 an ounce eventually, but I think we'll see the market back at $345 before then."
Coffee prices rallied when a large trading house snapped up deliveries at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
Coffee prices have declined since representatives for growers and consumers were unable to come to any agreement on re-establishing a quota system that would lift the market.
But Dean Witter Reynolds, the large trading house, took delivery of a substantial supply.
"That indicates there's a final destination for the coffee," said one analyst of Dean Witter's move.
Grain prices ended mixed in Chicago, where buying in the soybean complex was balanced against worries over Russia's purchasing plans.
Oil trading was quiet, with June crude oil down 4 cents at $20.30 a barrel.

HEADLINE: U.S. Chides Europe Bank On Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 26

 BODY:
The United States chastised the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development today for lavish spending of taxpayer money, but said it would continue to support the institution's efforts to promote the development of capitalism in Eastern Europe.
The United States is the largest financial backer of the European Bank, which was set up by Western governments two years ago to promote private enterprise in the former Soviet bloc. 
 The bank and its president, Jacques Attali, have come under criticism in recent weeks for spending $83 million on a new headquarters in London and hundreds of thousands of dollars on private jet flights for Mr. Attali. The spending has come under particular criticism because of the slow pace of lending by the bank, which has so far lent or invested only about $240 million in the formerly Communist nations.
 
U.S. Official Speaks
 Speaking at a meeting here of the bank's board, Roger Altman, the Deputy United States Treasury Secretary and the nation's top representative at the meeting, said the Clinton Administration "expects institutions to which we have entrusted public money to use the money wisely."
Mr. Altman said the United States, which has committed $350 million in capital to the bank over five years, had asked Mr. Attali for a review of the management and budget process, with an eye toward tightening controls over internal spending.
"We are sure that Mr. Attali and the bank understand the importance of taking organizational steps to deal with these problems," Mr. Altman said.
Mr. Altman was only one of several officials at the meeting who expressed unhappiness.
Viktor Geraschenko, the chairman of the Russian central bank, said he was disappointed with the level of lending to his nation, saying it had amounted to only $7.5 million so far.
"I believe this is a paltry sum and in no way comparable with the predicted participation of the European Bank or with the promises of the bank's management," he said.
 
Mistakes Admitted
 Mr. Attali, who has admitted making mistakes in overseeing the bank's spending, told the meeting that he expected the pace of lending to increase.
Mr. Altman said that despite the Clinton Administration's unhappiness with Mr. Attali's management, the United States agreed that the bank should be an important part of the West's efforts in the region. He said the United States would like to see the bank re-emphasize lending to private enterprise rather than the financing of public projects like telephone networks.
Mr. Altman said that ultimately the United States wanted to see the bank meet the commitment in its charter to devote 60 percent of its funds to the private sector, up from about 50 percent now, but that he was flexible about how quickly that should happen.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Heads Lower But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined broadly against European currencies yesterday as worries over economic weakness in the United States helped persuade traders to buy British pounds and German marks.
The dollar advanced only against the yen, as world leaders continued to tone down their recent support for a stronger Japanese currency. 
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 110.05 yen, up 0.15 yen from Friday's close. In late New York trading, the dollar was worth 110.60 yen, up from 110.50 late Friday.
Most of the currency buying, though, focused on German marks and British pounds after President Boris N. Yeltsin's apparent victory in the weekend referendum in Russia.
"This is one of the more positive results of this referendum that the market was looking for," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "It's still an uncertain situation, but not as bad as people had feared."
Economic data from Britain drew attention to the pound. In the latest positive statistic, the Government yesterday proclaimed the end of the nation's longest postwar recession, saying that the economy grew modestly in the year's first quarter after more than two years of decline.
In western Germany, several states reported inflation increases of more than 4 percent, which helped underscore sentiment that the German central bank would not deviate from its policy of making only gradual reductions in interest rates.
This encouraged sales of dollars, since investment generally flows to currencies where interest rates are higher.
Also contributing to the dollar's retreat were further worries about the economy in the United States. Friday's news of a disappointing decline in March durable-goods orders was followed yesterday by a real estate trade group's report that sales of previously owned homes dropped 2.9 percent in March, the third straight month of declines..
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5903, from $1.5745 late Friday. By late afternoon in New York, the pound fetched $1.5840, up from $1.5747 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Executive Dip In Confidence

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Manufacturing businesses' confidence slipped in April for the second consecutive month, partly because of uncertainty about the Clinton Administration's plans, Cahners Economics Inc. said today.
"All signs are that the recent retrenchment in business confidence merely reflects a cooling-off period for the industrial sector, rather than a reversal," Cahners said after surveying about 400 business executives. Its findings cover businesses in four areas sensitive to economic cycles, computers, construction, consumer goods and general manufacturing. 
 The Cahners business confidence index, which had risen for four straight months until March, fell to 66.3 in April from 67.8 in March and 68.9 in February.
Only 59 percent of the executives surveyed said business conditions were good or excellent, down from 62 percent in March. The portion of executives who expected improvement slipped to 71 percent in April from 79 percent in March.
The survey found that business executives want deficit reduction to be the top priority for the Administration, with 55 percent saying that should be the case. Twenty-nine percent of the executives said job creation through an economic revitalization program should be Government's top priority.

HEADLINE: Resales Off For Houses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned houses dropped 2.9 percent in March, the third straight month of declines caused by severe weather, a real estate trade group said today. Sales fell in every region except the Midwest.
"Sellers and buyers lost a week in March" because of bad weather, said William S. Chee, president of the National Association of Realtors. But he added that sales appeared to have picked up since then. 
 The group said sales of previously owned houses totaled 3.36 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in March, down from 3.46 million a month earlier.
The revised 8.5 percent drop in sales in February was even steeper than the initial estimate of 6.1 percent. Sales fell 6.4 percent in January after rising 4.7 percent in the final month of 1992.
Mr. Chee said the severe blizzard in March brought housing activity to a virtual standstill for several days in the South and Northeast. But he said anecdotal evidence suggested sales had resumed. "Buyers are continuing to take advantage of low mortgage rates," he said.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported that the national average commitment rate for 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages was 7.5 percent in March, down from 7.68 percent the previous month.
The median price of a house in the United States in March was $106,000, up 2.3 percent from February. The median means that half of the houses cost more and half cost less.

HEADLINE: Reviews/ Television;
Real People With Babies On the Way

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
In the often hazy reality of prime-time entertainment, few events are exploited more adroitly than the birth of a baby. Ratings sagging? Get yourself a pregnancy. From Lucy to Murphy, the ploy seems fail-safe, although, as the subsequent sag in "Murphy Brown" may indicate, not necessarily conducive to long-range survival.
Homing in on the obvious, an hourlong ABC special called "We're Expecting," tonight at 10, follows three couples as each goes through the special experience of having a first child. Reading Louis H. Gorfain's script, Connie Selleca is the warmly reassuring host, promising a journey that will be "wondrous, exhausting, exhilarating." 
 Pushing the consumerism button, the show also looks long and affectionately at "the business of birthing," which, in addition to fees for special classes, involves buying clothes, toys and furniture. Says one expectant mother looking at a very expensive brass-plated crib, "This is gorgeous!" Says the salesman quickly, "An excellent choice," adding ever so smoothly that "you only have your first baby once."
The couples chosen for this exercise are pleasant people, one and all, some coping better than others. The best off economically, a black couple, have the most worrying pregnancy complications. The second husband and wife fret about job and housing problems. The third pair goes into somewhat refreshing reverse: he has morning sickness and is gaining weight, while she is worried because she's feeling so well, relieved only when she finally hears the embryo's heartbeat.
But "We're Expecting" can't resist jerking everybody's leash. As the mother-to-be hears the heartbeat, Ms. Selleca murmurs: "Listen hard. Hear your miracle!" Now, as an exploding world population attests, there is nothing miraculous about having a child. The biological process is normally straightforward. There is nothing supernatural about it. It can be a wonderfully gratifying experience or, as in the instance of AIDS babies, it can be heartbreaking.
But prime time usually insists on nonstop gushing. Children born into television series are obviously going to grow up to become Shirley Temple or Macaulay Culkin, not Amy Fisher or Joey Buttafuoco. Too often, young viewers can get the idea that having a baby is something like getting another doll. Perhaps, no matter what pessimistic evidence to the contrary, cockeyed optimism should prevail. Ms. Selleca certainly remains unruffled. "It's all you could ever expect," she concludes, "and much, much more." Especially if the ratings are good.

HEADLINE: Talking About the Riots That Tore Los Angeles

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Even after so many showings, the pictures of last year's Los Angeles riots, like those of the beating of Rodney G. King, retain their power to shock. Once again tonight, television brings back the fires, the lootings and the assaults, the sight of an American city out of control. It is an urban nightmare that won't go away.
"L.A. Is Burning," a probing 90-minute "Frontline" report, turns the cameras on unintegrated groups of blacks, whites, Hispanic-Americans and Korean-Americans, who talk about what they saw on the screen and witnessed for themselves. They do not represent an official opinion sampling, yet they reveal the breadth and depth of the racial and class divisions in Los Angeles and -- to a lesser degree, one must hope -- throughout much of the rest of the United States. 
 Most of the blacks interviewed agree with John Edgar Wideman, the black novelist who acts as tonight's main guide, that the riot or rebellion or insurrection or uprising was an explosion of the oppressed against their oppressors. The emphasis given to this view suggests that it is also that of the producers.
Ruben Martinez, a journalist whose parents are from Mexico and Salvador, calls the outbreak "multicultural mini-riots," since many Hispanic residents of South-Central Los Angeles took part. But that did not signify any black-Hispanic political alliance, just a case, as one young Hispanic man says, of everybody doing it. The program goes on to report on growing black-Hispanic tensions over construction jobs in their neighborhoods.
Korean merchants, some of whom lost their businesses in the riot, express little patience for economic or sociological interpretations or excuses. One man, who was guarding his brother's store, says of the looters, "Ninety percent of them are all thugs and crooks." He adds, "If they had stepped into my brother's store, without hesitation I would have blasted them away."
Some black shop owners found themselves torn. In one of the evening's strongest scenes, a black businessman shouts his pained outrage at the black locals -- "just ordinary people: stealing, looting," he tells an interviewer -- who had destroyed his store.
Tim Rutten, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times, undoubtedly speaks for many whites who watched the violence from their yet untroubled neighborhoods, when he uses the word "anarchy." He makes the inescapable point that for many blacks the true symbol of the story lay in the beating of Mr. King by white police officers; for many whites, it was the beating of the white truck driver Reginald Denny by young blacks.
The program touches touchy areas. An appearance of intergroup unanimity comes only in criticisms of the police and the press and television. All parties fault the police; but while Korean merchants complain that they were left unprotected, black residents complain that a Korean storekeeper who killed a young black woman she said was a shoplifter was let off more easily than blacks who injure whites.
As for television, Mr. Martinez says the pictures of the lootings taken from a helicopter underscored "the distance between the white media of Los Angeles and what was going on on the streets." That may be an irresistible image, but it is not hard to understand why white reporters might have been uneasy about getting closer to the action. Some shopkeepers protest that television pictured them as vigilantes.
"L.A. Is Burning" goes soft toward the end with a discussion by a multicultural group of liberals that seems made for public television; it is relentlessly well intentioned and, in light of what has gone before, comically irrelevant.
Mr. Wideman points out that little, if anything, has changed since the riots. For the residents of South Central Los Angeles, he says, "normal" means police pressure, no jobs, terrible stores, "that package of second-class life and opportunity that we call the ghetto."
The impression left by this unusually frank report is of groups hunkering together by race or ethnicity. Edward Chang, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California at Riverside, calls the competition for public sympathy and Federal aid "pure ethnic politics at its worst."
Meanwhile, neighborhoods are shown to be walling themselves in and the gun business is booming, as Los Angeles looks nervously forward to the trial of the men charged in the beating of Mr. Denny. The King verdict, a relief to most people, also has a threatening aspect. The black defendants in the Denny case are already being championed on the streets as the L.A. 4 Plus, with an implicit warning to prospective jurors that if they don't do the right thing in this case, Los Angeles may experience the fire one more time.

HEADLINE: Energy Tax? A Better Way.

BYLINE: By J. Robinson West; J. Robinson West, a former Assistant Secretary of the Interior in the first Reagan Administration, is president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton has proposed a tax, soon to be submitted to Congress, that focuses on the energy content -- the British thermal unit -- in each form of energy. There would be a special, higher surcharge on oil. The tax, a major element of the economic program, was initially projected to collect $72 billion over five years.
It is a tax designed by politicians for politics. Its purpose is to get revenues from oil without a gasoline tax. The tax is designed to be so murky the public probably wouldn't blame Washington for pass-along effects. 
 The U.S. energy business -- oil, coal, electricity, natural gas, nuclear -- produces more than $500 billion a year in sales. Although American companies are taxed at levels comparable to the rest of the world, consumers are not, particularly for gasoline, and do not want to be.
The average American is not interested in the subtleties of economic or energy policy but how much it costs to run the car and heat the house. This presented Mr. Clinton with a dilemma: how to get more money from energy without a political backlash from the public. The result is a tax that presents serious problems and abounds in confusion. For example, disputes have arisen between operators of natural-gas pipelines and utilities over who would pay the tax at what point in the energy chain, an issue worth billions. The tax would drive up costs in energy-intensive industries such as aluminum and chemicals, making them uncompetitive.
The confusion has been compounded by exemptions and compromises for, among other things, heating oil and ethanol, that may make political sense but are economic nonsense. The $72 billion revenue target melts with each exemption.
U.S. gasoline prices are the lowest in the industrialized world solely because of Federal tax policy. In Europe and Japan, gasoline may cost as much as $3 more per gallon.
Polls consistently show that a large gasoline tax is the most unpopular one that could be levied. But the public largely does not know what a B.T.U. is and Mr. Clinton is not about to tell them. (It is the amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.) He wants to keep them confused and to ram the tax through. But all energy should not be taxed; it is certainly not taxed this way in any other industrialized country.
The tax would require a new bureaucracy to administer the exemptions, deal with complexities and collect the money. For the average American, it would drive up expenses such as gas-fired home heating and electricity. A simpler, less disruptive, more efficient solution would be a gasoline tax that is phased in at one penny a gallon and rises by another penny monthly for five years. Every penny on a gallon would produce about $1 billion.
Such a tax would not damage manufacturing or raise home heating and electricity costs. If permitted to rise for five years, it would eventually generate about $60 billion a year. Most of the proceeds could be used for deficit reduction, and a percentage could be used for mass transit.
It is too early to tell if a B.T.U. tax is good politics, but it is obvious that it is muddled energy policy. A modestly phased-in gasoline tax would be less burdensome and better for the economy and environment. It would raise more money, and just might help end the deficit crisis.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook: Hereditary Politics in Alabama;
Can Little Jim Harness the Big Mules?

BYLINE: By HOWELL RAINES

 BODY:
In his report on the latest gubernatorial follies in my native Alabama, the Times's Peter Applebome got it right. The conviction of Guy Hunt and his subsequent eviction from the Governor's Mansion was unusual only in that the hapless Mr. Hunt was punished for his crimes against good government. That is not the norm in Alabama.
What is normal is that the sons always rise, no matter what the needs of the state. Hence the new Governor is James Elisha Folsom Jr., the amiable and not very energetic namesake of the legendary Big Jim. The younger Folsom thus beats George C. Wallace Jr. to the state house. If Alabama has to have a hereditary governor, Mr. Folsom probably represents the better outcome. Mr. Wallace Jr. has had a tormented public and private life and seems almost crushed by the weight of his father's grandiose sins against racial harmony. 
 At least Mr. Folsom has a nobler, albeit sad heritage. Alcohol and corrupt underlings did in his father, whose second and final term ended in 1958. But Big Jim at least understood Alabama's problems. He fought as hard as anyone could to forestall the quarter-century sleeper hold put on the state by George C. Wallace Sr., a liberal Folsom protege turned race-baiter.
In the 50's, the elder Folsom stood for a healing moderation on race. He also railed against the "Big Mules," meaning U.S. Steel and the other absentee corporate landlords who treated Alabama as an economic colony. Four decades later, Alabama still suffers from a corporation-dominated public policy that has kept it from membership in the New South.
The out-of-state industrial and timber companies that own 11 percent of Alabama's land pay the Deep South's lowest property taxes. Even tax-shy Mississippi taxes rural land at twice the rate of Alabama. Prosperous Georgia is four times higher.
To make up the shortfall, Alabama socks even its poorest citizens with high sales and income taxes. Scholars, historians and citizens' commissions repeatedly point to property-tax reform as the key to improving the state's impoverished schools and universities.
But corporate and agricultural lobbyists have a lock on the Alabama legislature. For all his populist effusions, Mr. Wallace Sr. never really challenged them. Indeed, no one has since Big Jim.
Alabama progressives wonder if Little Jim will try to fill his daddy's size 16 shoes. They long ago concluded that Mr. Folsom Jr. lacks his namesake's vision and his stomach for taking on the Big Mules. But they also say they have high hopes for Little Jim's wife, Marsha Guthrie Folsom, the daughter of a state legislator from the Folsoms' hometown. Word is she has the gumption in the family, and the state's beleaguered band of political optimists hope some of that gumption will rub off.
Between them, Jim and Marsha Folsom know virtually everybody in the state. They come to the Governor's Mansion as inheritors of a name untainted by racism and linked by history with their state's unfulfilled dreams. Could Alabama be ready for an experiment in husband-wife teamwork like that undertaken a few years back by the first couple of Arkansas? It can't hurt to try.

Guide for Cleansers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
For their work to be effective and lasting, administrators of ethnic cleansing must of course study, understand and follow proven professional guidelines.
The following techniques have shown themselves particularly useful. Therefore it is imperative that they be considered in drawing up an efficient cleansing operation and applied in feasible combination. 
 1. Removal of as much of the indigenous population as possible without destroying the entire native infrastructure until it can be completely replaced.
2. Removal of native civic and religious officials; replacement with cleansing nation's personnel.
3. Destruction of most places of religious worship, arrest of native clerics, banning of mass religious observation and assembly.
4. Banning of teaching of local language to maximum practical extent, introduction of education officials from cleansing nation; shipment to cleansing nation of bright students for long-term indoctrination.
5. Strict regime of political repression, with usual methods of imprisonment and physical persuasion.
6. Most important, long range: introduction from cleansing nation of its own citizens until they can take demographic or economic control.
N.B.: The above steps are recommended specifically for cleansing, where the goal is chiefly full site control. Where extermination is desired, other techniques are available.
One nation exists where all the cleansing techniques have been carried out methodically and continuously for decades. This nation is a long-established reality, with distinct language, religion, custom and people.
Its leader in exile is now in Washington -- the Dalai Lama of Tibet. He comes hoping that two things that have helped sustain his people -- the support of Congress and the empathy of the American people -- will combine with a new Administration to give the Tibetans a touch of political support against their cleansers, the Chinese Communist Government.
They have been pleading for that for so very long -- ever since 1950, when the Chinese Communists enforced their claims of sovereignty over Tibet by sending armies through the Himalayan passes.
And they ask for little -- not arms, not even embargoes against the cleansers. They ask just for the recognition of their nation as at least entitled to political autonomy, for some pressure to persuade their occupiers to negotiate with them, to stop the killings, to end the strangling of their religion and the environmental violation of mountains and rivers.
They are Asians and poor. Also, their sufferings are annoying. They interfere with Western economic pursuit of Communist China. The U.S. has been so busy trying to catch the Chinese fish that it did not even realize it was being towed along, boat and all. For these reasons the Tibetans have received no succor, in all the decades of their sorrows.
But once again Congress will consider a bill similar to the one it passed last year, which was killed by President Bush.
The bill, introduced by two Democrats, Senator George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosi, is restrained and conditional. It attempts to use the economic lever -- Chinese Communist eagerness for that fat $20 billion trade surplus with the U.S.
The bill provides that next year the President remove low tariff privileges from Chinese state enterprises unless China makes human rights progress and reduces trade discrimination. And it ends low tariffs unless Beijing stops selling missiles to Syria, Iran or Pakistan and nuclear material that could be used for explosives.
Now the bill also calls on the Chinese to end the special incentives to Chinese workers that Beijing uses to flood Tibet to the point Tibetans have become a minority in parts of their own country. See 6 above.
Candidate Clinton supported use of the tariff lever. President-elect Clinton said something rather more vague. President Clinton?
Mr. Clinton is expected to meet with the Dalai Lama. Whatever they say to each other, what makes the meeting important far beyond the White House is already clear. See points 1 through 6 above.
As they part, the Dalai Lama will give a gift to the President, a white scarf, signifying peace, blessing and abiding hope.

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform Should Be Inclusive

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The President's health care task force may recommend that automobile and workers' compensation medical insurance be included in a unitary system (front page, April 16). But you warn this might upset "lawyers, doctors, labor unions and insurers" and invite their opposition. Maybe so, but how can a plan that exempts any part of the system end its inflationary cost shifting? 
 And it's not true workers' comp "includes comparatively liberal guarantees to labor." It was designed to pay disability income to, and medical expenses for, workers injured on the job. It protects employers from lawsuits by trading workers' rights to sue in exchange for supposedly quick claims handling. As it has evolved, however, workers' comp cases often drag on for months or years as workers wait for benefits that are anything but rich.

Race Matters
 By Cornel West
 105 pages. Beacon Press. $15.
In the last few years, Cornel West, a professor of religion and the director of Afro-American studies at Princeton University, has been collecting accolades from the worlds of academia, journalism and politics. 
 The scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. called him "the pre-eminent African-American intellectual of our generation." Norman Pearlstine, the former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, has hailed him as "a social critic for our time." And Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, has praised him as "one of the most authentic, brilliant, prophetic and healing voices in America today."
Mr. West's latest book, "Race Matters," should introduce him -- and his anomalous and often compelling blend of philosophy, sociology and political commentary -- to the public at large. Compiled largely from essays published in such disparate publications as Dissent, Tikkun and The New York Times Magazine, "Race Matters" is decidedly more accessible and less scholarly than his earlier books, "The American Evasion of Philosophy: A Genealogy of Pragmatism" and "Prophesy Deliverance!: An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity."
Indeed, "Race Matters" reads as though it had been written by a politician turned preacher and philosopher. It directly takes on some of the most volatile issues facing American society today, and for the most part, it does so without mincing words. Mr. West gives the reader his frank appraisals of such public figures as Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, Dr. Leonard Jeffries and Mayor David N. Dinkins; he also tackles head on such emotionally charged events as the Los Angeles riots, the Clarence A. Thomas-Anita F. Hill hearings and the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Drawing upon both Christian theology and Marxist-inspired economic doctrine, Mr. West assails both traditional conservative and liberal approaches to race relations, while at the same time salvaging and reinventing certain elements of their thinking. He argues that "the liberal notion that more government programs can solve racial problems is simplistic -- precisely because it focuses solely on the economic dimension." Yet at the same time, he argues that "the conservative idea that what is needed is a change in the moral behavior of poor black urban dwellers (especially poor black men, who, they say, should stay married, support their children, and stop committing so much crime) highlights immoral actions while ignoring public responsibility for the immoral circumstances that haunt our fellow citizens."
Both liberals and conservatives, Mr. West contends, "fail to see that the presence and predicaments of black people are neither additions to nor defections from Americans life, but rather constitutive elements of that life." For liberals, he says, "black people are to be 'included' and 'integrated' into 'our' society and culture, while for conservatives they are to be 'well behaved' and 'worthy of acceptance' by 'our' way of life."
The liberal-conservative debate, Mr. West adds, obscures a more basic issue: the sense of nihilism -- a "profound sense of psychological depression, personal worthlessness, and social despair" -- that is taking over black America. As he sees it, there are two reasons for this growing nihilism: the growing influence of a "culture of consumption" on daily life, which has led to the shattering of traditional family, community and religious values; and the current crisis in black leadership.
There are fewer and fewer "race-transcending prophetic leaders" like the Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, Mr. West writes. Instead, present-day black political leaders, in his view, usually fall into two categories: "race-effacing managerial leaders" like Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles and former Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia, who tend "to stunt progressive development and silence the prophetic voices in the black community by casting the practical mainstream as the only game in town"; and "race-identifying protest leaders" like Mr. Farrakhan and former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington, who "function as figures who white Americans must appease so that the plight of the black poor is overlooked and forgotten.".
Although Mr. West hails Malcolm X as "the prophet of black rage," he questions the assumption, made by many followers of Malcolm X, "that black nationalisms have a monopoly on black self-love and black self-determination." He observes that the obsession many black nationalists have with white supremacy actually allows white people to continue to "serve as the principle point of reference," and he rejects the Manichean world view evinced by many black supremacists that wants to see everything in dogmatic terms of black or white, either-or. He similarly contests the framework of "racial reasoning" -- employed by both supporters of Clarence Thomas and "race-identifying" leaders like Mr. Barry -- that reduces the black freedom struggle to "an affair of skin pigmentation and racial phenotype."
When it comes to proposing concrete solutions to the many problems afflicting black America today, Mr. West is less persuasive. Many of his suggestions are vague and sentimentally utopian. Sentences like "our ideals of freedom, democracy and equality must be invoked to invigorate all of us, especially the landless, propertyless and luckless" may sound very nice, but they are the sort of platitudes lip-synched daily by the ineffectual politicians Mr. West says he disdains.
Obviously, it's unrealistic to expect that real solutions to the kind of problems described in "Race Matters" -- problems that have defied the efforts of a generation of thinkers and government officials -- could be articulated in a slim volume like this. One hopes Mr. West will amplify the ideas explored in "Race Matters" at greater length in a more commodious book. In the meantime, one can only applaud the ferocious moral vision and astute intellect on display in these pages.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
As Perot Jabs, White House Appears to Bob and Weave

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
They insist that the timing was coincidental, but officials at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis ordered the removal of two portraits of a young midshipman named Ross Perot from an alumni display earlier this month only days before President Clinton paid a visit.
If only Mr. Clinton could so easily remove the specter of the Ross Perot of today. His grinning presence seems to be hanging over the White House these days like an annoying, uninvited visitor. 
 To the dismay of White House officials, Mr. Perot has become a far greater irritant to Mr. Clinton than he was in last year's campaign, when his central mission seemed to be to beat up President Bush.
Apparently unsure of what to do about Mr. Perot, the White House has switched from stroking him to attacking him to ignoring him altogether.
Though Mr. Clinton tried to sound conciliatory last week ("I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot," he said), he stunned many of his advisers by lashing out at Mr. Perot at the Naval Academy appearance, accusing him of "rumor mongering."
 
A Grace Period Ends
 But no matter what, Mr. Perot always seems to come back with the last laugh (or barb), always reminding the White House that Mr. Clinton needs to win over some of the 19 million people who voted for Mr. Perot if he is to be re-elected in a two-candidate race in 1996.
After a grace period in the early days of the new Administration, Mr. Perot has been anything but hesitant to fling his down-home-style tirades at his onetime Presidential rival. He has challenged everything from Mr. Clinton's economic plan (a "political handout") to the closed-door operations of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care panel. ("This is not a nuclear bomb program," he said in scolding the White House for its secrecy.)
The attacks only escalated in Mr. Perot's latest media campaign, which began Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." He derided Mr. Clinton's ill-fated package to stimulate the economy as riddled with "Mickey Mouse stuff." Then, in the tones of a schoolboy tattling on a classmate, he complained of the President, "He called me a liar!"
That was only a warm-up for the half-hour Mr. Perot bought that evening on NBC, in which he urged Americans to lobby the White House and Congress against new taxes without spending cuts. Depicting Mr. Clinton as a typical untrustworthy politician, he said: "It's just campaign politics. Telling the people what they want to hear at the time." Later this week, he takes his political act to the "Tonight Show."
Perhaps because there has been no phenomenon like Ross Perot's in American political history, White House officials do not know how much of a threat he is. But they know he is a threat.
Mindful of the importance of Mr. Perot's supporters to his own future, Mr. Clinton has signed on to several Perot proposals, from deeper spending cuts than initially planned to wider efforts in tightening campaign finance and ethics laws.
Still, Mr. Clinton and his advisers face a quandary: what to do about Ross Perot himself. Thus far, the White House has seemed to flail, turning from one approach to another.
Knowing that Mr. Perot's deep billionaire's pockets can buy enough television time to sustain his influence and fearful that he could decide to throw his support to Republicans, some White House advisers have counseled the President to seek Mr. Perot's blessing for his policies. (The first approach.)
Thomas F. McLarty Jr. 3d, the White House chief of staff, speaks to Mr. Perot from time to time, and Mr. Clinton has spoken to Mr. Perot by telephone to preview his economic plan and seek support.
Mr. Perot was subdued after the initial stroking, but the effect did not last. Before long, he was back on the air, criticizing the President.
 
Turning Their Backs
 Since Mr. Perot seems to thrive on attention, some Clinton advisers believe that the best thing the White House can do is ignore him. (The second approach.)
That seemed to be what George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, was doing today. Asked if he had any reaction to Mr. Perot's appearance on television Sunday night, he said, "I didn't see it." Asked if anyone else saw the program, he said, "I haven't asked anybody if they watched it."
But Frank Luntz, a former poll taker for Mr. Perot, said: "Ross Perot has become too popular and too credible for Bill Clinton to ignore. He can buy his way on television."
Despite the pleas for restraint, there have been instances where Mr. Clinton lashed out at Mr. Perot. (The third approach.)
One scathing remark came during a speech at the annual dinner of the Gridiron Club, an organization of journalists. Infuriated at what he interpreted as a slight against Mr. McLarty when Mr. Perot said that the President's advisers lacked business experience, Mr. Clinton said, "He just resents it because Mack's a short guy with real power."
 
A Conciliatory Tack
 But the risk with this approach is that it might encourage Mr. Perot to become an outright enemy.
So at his news conference on Friday, Mr. Clinton was back to a more conciliatory tack: while he said he found it "rather amazing" that Mr. Perot had criticized his economic plan, this time there were no outbursts.
Mr. Perot won 19 percent of the vote last year and his popularity has only grown since the election: 42 percent of those polled in a New York Times/CBS News survey conducted March 28 to 31 viewed Mr. Perot favorably, far more than at the end of the campaign. Those figures are close to the ratings Mr. Clinton is getting as Chief Executive.
Mr. Clinton's advisers insist that they are not obsessed with Mr. Perot, but White House aides are somewhat defensive about their boss's tendency to pick up Perot tactics.
"We're not preoccupied with Perot," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker. "We are preoccupied with maintaining our commitment to change." But there seems to be a consensus that the President should try to appeal to Mr. Perot's voters.
It was not all hyperbole recently when Mr. Clinton said his economic program was "85 percent what Ross Perot recommended in the campaign." And words like "gridlock" and "sacrifice" -- staples for Mr. Perot -- peppered his speech.
Perhaps realizing that Mr. Perot is not about to disappear, some White House officials have suggested that maybe the best thing for Mr. Clinton would be for Mr. Perot to run again and split the rural and suburban vote with the Republicans, leaving the big cities to the President.
In the meantime, Mr. Clinton says he only wishes the press would not let Mr. Perot off so easily. "I will ask you," he said at a news conference Friday, "to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me."

HEADLINE: CLINTON RULES OUT DELAY IN UNVEILING HEALTH-CARE PLAN

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Rejecting the urgent pleas of top economic advisers, President Clinton sided with his wife and his health-care team today and insisted that he would not postpone the presentation of his health-reform program next month.
Even though Congress is unlikely to start work on the health-care plan until next year, many of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides, most prominently Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget chief, had argued that the Administration should not even unveil the proposals until fall. 
 That would avoid taking on a new political battle -- and asking Americans to contemplate new taxes -- while Congress is considering Mr. Clinton's $1.5 trillion budget. The budget is the key to all of the President's plans for both deficit reduction and new spending for the next five years.
 
Debate Within Administration
 Since the defeat of the President's $15.5 billion jobs package last week, many of his top economic advisers have been expressing the concern in private that Mr. Clinton, in trying to do too much at one time, was running the risk of tying himself in knots and doing too little. Many historians say that is exactly what happened to the last Democratic President, Jimmy Carter.
But other Administration figures, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, have been urging the President to proceed with the health-care and economic programs simultaneously.
Those people argued that dealing with the health-insurance issue, with a plan intended to limit the growth of Government spending on medical care, was essential to confronting the long-term Federal budget deficit. They said a proper legislative strategy could prevent next month's announcement from paralyzing the Administration's campaign for the budget.
The debate burst into public view today with publication of an interview that Mr. Panetta gave to a group of reporters on Monday in which he said that the President must do "a better job of picking and choosing the battles he wants to go through." The budget director said Mr. Clinton might want to consider delaying his health-care proposals in order to maintain "a clear focus" on the budget bill that is about to move through Congress.
 
Warning of Trouble
 As a practical matter, the relevant Congressional committees will not be able to get to the health-care proposals until they finish the budget. But any discussion of new taxes to pay for health care could poison the political atmosphere when lawmakers vote on the proposed new taxes on energy or Social Security in the economic plan. For instance, some Senators from tobacco-growing states might not be so cooperative with the Administration on its budget proposals if they think that cigarette taxes are going to be raised to pay for more health care.
In a strikingly downbeat assessment, Mr. Panetta also warned that Mr. Clinton's plans for increasing aid to Russia, winning approval of an investment tax credit and signing a free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada were already in trouble in Congress.
White House officials said that many important members of the President's economic team, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, shared Mr. Panetta's views to some degree and wanted to see the health-care plan delayed until fall, after passage of the budget. The officials said Mr. Panetta expressed what was on the minds of many in the Administration.
 
Other Side's Argument
 No sooner had Mr. Panetta's comments been published, though, than a strikingly different argument came from the opposing camp. The manager of Mrs. Clinton's health-care study group, Ira C. Magaziner, gave a speech today in which he played down the idea that new taxes would be a significant obstacle to the group's sweeping plans on health care. "What's really going to matter is what happens when I go to my doctor," Mr. Magaziner said.
Mr. Clinton was said by aides today to have been extremely upset at Mr. Panetta's public remarks but to have accepted his explanation that his comments were overinterpreted by the press and that Mr. Panetta was not trying to send the President a public message.
Asked if the budget chief would be disciplined, Mr. Clinton told reporters: "He had a bad day yesterday, because he got his spirits down. I want to buck him up. I don't want to take him to the woodshed."
At the same time, the White House communications director, George Stephanopoulos, said that despite the unfinished budget business the President was moving along on his schedule to submit a detailed plan to Congress next month to reshape the country's health-care system and extend coverage to 37 million Americans without insurance.
But Mr. Stephanopoulos acknowledged that there were differences within the Administration over legislative strategy. While contending that everyone shared the President's agenda of priorities -- the economy, health care, campaign finance and national service -- he said, "There are a lot of discussions over the exact days when things should go forward. There's no question about that."
As the first, and most politically explosive, step in dealing with concrete aspects of the Clinton economic package, the House Ways and Means Committee plans to begin drafting the tax legislation for the budget next week. The lawmakers will finish their work this summer.
In a speech to the National Association of Realtors, Mr. Clinton explained why he believed it was necessary to proceed simultaneously on the budget and health care.
"There are others who say, 'I wish they'd leave that health-care thing alone,' " the President said. "Let me tell you why I don't agree with that. The biggest spending increases in the first part of the last 12-year period were in defense. But defense peaked out in 1986, and it's been going down since. And, my fellow Americans, without regard to party, respectfully, there is a limit to how much you can take it down how fast.
"So you might say, well, what has happened? If defense has been going down for five years, how come this deficit keeps going up?
"I'll tell you why. Because in the last five years the defense increases have been supplemented by explosive increases in health-care costs and in interest payments on the debt. So we're trying to get the interest payments down by bringing the interest rates down. But we have to address the health-care issue."
The President did not mention Mr. Panetta or refer to problems encountered by his increasingly packed legislative agenda, but he urged his audience to ignore reports that show "somebody's up and somebody's down."
"It's very important that you sort of clear away the political smoke screen and ask yourself, 'What's really at stake here?' " Mr. Clinton said.
At stake, he said, is fundamental change, which is always painful, often messy, but nevertheless essential.
 
'Waiting for the Next Blow'
 While the White House tried to softpeddle Mr. Panetta's downbeat remarks, they reverberated throughout Capitol Hill.
"I'm just astonished and reeling, and waiting for the next blow," said the Senate Finance Committee's chairman, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. Mr. Panetta's talk of defeat can have a "self-confirming effect," he said.
On the other hand, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, hailed Mr. Panetta, saying: "Hallelujah. It's the truth. He's dead right. You can't have 10 or 15 things you're trying to push at the same time, because the American people can't maintain that kind of focus."
The issue is clearly weighing on the President's mind.
As he told The Boston Globe in an interview published Monday: "I do think that I may have overextended myself, and we've got to focus on big things. I'm used to a legislative environment where, as Governor, I worked up all these initiatives, I put them into the pot and then we worked them through the Legislature. It's almost like we are supposed to do one, maybe two things, at a time in Congress. And I think that I have been pushing too hard trying to get everything done."

HEADLINE: Administration Rift Reported Over Course of Trade Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Deep ideological divisions and turf battles within the Clinton Administration have nearly paralyzed its trade policy, with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen fighting attempts by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, to move to a more confrontational approach, Administration officials say.
Because trade policy has assumed such a prominent role in the Administration, much of the Cabinet has been drawn into the fray. The disagreements pit officials like Mr. Bentsen, whose views are closer to traditional American support for free-trade policies, against those like Mr. Kantor who favor tougher demands for specific concessions.
 
Some Crucial Issues
 The policy divisions have delayed or stalled progress most clearly on five key issues: import taxes on mini-vans, world trade talks, trade in auto parts, foreign investment rules and the North American Free Trade Agreement, Administration officials said in interviews over the last two weeks. 
 The divisions have also hamstrung the National Economic Council, which President Clinton created to draft and coordinate Administration economic policy. The council is far behind schedule in its reviews of trade policy toward Japan and other countries.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Robert E. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, have tended to ally themselves with Mr. Bentsen. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, whose writings support a more aggressive trade policy, has tended to support Mr. Kantor, the officials said.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich have allied themselves with Mr. Bentsen in opposing controls on investment into and out of the United States, but have been less visible on other trade issues, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But Mr. Brown has also supported Mr. Kantor's pursuit of specific results in industry-by-industry trade negotiations with the Japanese Government, an approach that Japanese officials have condemned as managed trade.
So far, President Clinton appears to be functioning to an unusual extent as his own trade expert and has not sided definitively with either Mr. Kantor or Mr. Bentsen.
Mr. Kantor appeared to be holding the upper hand when Mr. Clinton criticized the Bush Administration's decision to assess low tariffs on mini-vans. Mr. Clinton called the tariff "a $300-million-a-year freebie to the Japanese for no apparent reason."
Mr. Clinton's language has often been tougher than his actions. For example, he criticized Japan's limited purchases of American auto parts twice during a short news conference with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan on April 16.
But the issue, a pet concern of Mr. Kantor's, was not discussed during several hours of meetings between the two leaders, top American and Japanese officials said at the time. Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Christopher sat in during most of the meetings, while Mr. Kantor was only present at a luncheon at the end.
Mr. Bentsen said today that he had "a good, solid relationship" with Mr. Kantor. "Of course," he said, "there are various points of view within the Administration, and we each feel free to air our views candidly. I think that makes for good policy."
Mr. Kantor contends that the Administration is united. "Some things we have different responsibilities to address, so it might look like we have different positions, but it is because we're looking at different sides of the same issue," he said today.
 
An Annual Duty
 For example, he said later, Federal law will require him to complete by the end of the week an annual review to determine which foreign countries fail to protect American patents, copyrights and trademarks. Negotiations will then begin with countries that fall short, and these countries will be threatened with trade sanctions if they do not reach a settlement.
"That makes it look that I am somehow moving into a harsh stance, but that's a legal obligation," Mr. Kantor said.
Mr. Brown had raised some eyebrows by traveling to Mexico and Japan to discuss trade issues before Mr. Kantor visited either country. But the Commerce Secretary, who insisted in a separate interview today that "we are absolutely united on trade policy," said these trips helped Mr. Kantor because the Commerce Department's delegations were conveying the entire Administration's views on trade.
To be sure, President Clinton and the entire Cabinet do seem committed to Congressional passage this year of the North American trade pact, which would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. But the Treasury Department and the National Economic Council have been pushing for side agreements to the pact that are less ambitious side agreements to the pact than Mr. Kantor's office.

HEADLINE: Christopher Explains Conditions For Use of U.S. Force in Bosnia

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Seeking to reassure lawmakers and others who fear being drawn into a new Vietnam, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told Congress today that President Clinton will not authorize military action in Bosnia unless he is certain the United States can avoid getting more deeply involved than it wants.
Mr. Christopher laid out four strict tests for the use of force: the goal must be stated clearly, there must be a strong likelihood of success, there must be "an exit strategy" and the action must win sustained public support. 
 As he has in meetings at the White House and in conversations with lawmakers, Mr. Christopher offered the diplomatic equivalent of the cautious military doctrine enunciated by Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking a question that has become the Christopher mantra: What is the endgame?
 
Dark Shadows From the Past
 Just as General Powell's ideas are heavily influenced by his experience as an officer in Vietnam, so that war figures in Congressional deliberations on Bosnia.
Although some key senators have drawn parallels to the Holocaust in demanding that the United States and its allies take immediate military action in Bosnia, Vietnam is the dominant image evoked on Capitol Hill, where a growing number of lawmakers are warning against an open-ended military commitment that could overtake the Presidency. [Page A10.]
"I am perfectly -- personally -- quite prepared to see the United States use force, not only there but any place around the world," Mr. Christopher said in testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. "But it has to meet some very severe tests."
During the hearing, Senator Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, reflected the anti-interventionist view most strongly. "I would say nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet," in response to Mr. Christopher's four tests, he said. "No! That's the honest answer to all those questions right now."
And a new opinion poll shows that the public has little enthusiasm for military action despite continuing reports of Serbian "ethnic cleansing" of Muslim-populated areas in Bosnia. A poll last weekend by Cable News Network, USA Today and the Gallup Organization found 62 percent of the respondents opposed to United States air strikes against Serbian targets and 30 percent in favor.
 
Some Political Leeway
 One senior Administration official said Mr. Christopher's testimony was intended to give Mr. Clinton room to maneuver politically.
The President is said by aides to be deeply ambivalent about how to stop Serbian aggression without getting the United States too involved. His indecision runs so deep that, according to an aide to President Francois Mitterrand, White House officials canceled a telephone call on Monday in which Mr. Clinton was to brief Mr. Mitterrand, telling Elysee Palace that Mr. Clinton wants to define his position better before they speak.
Mr. Clinton said on Monday that the United States and its allies needed "a stronger policy" and promised to decide on action in a few days. But the White House spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, said today that he did not expect the President to announce his decision this week.
 
Trip Without a Focus, Yet
 What is likely, a senior Administration official said, is that Mr. Clinton will make his decision within the next two to three days but send Mr. Christopher to consult with the allies before he announces it.
The policy is still so unsettled that the Administration has not decided what Mr. Christopher's mission should be. One senior official said Mr. Christopher would use the trip, to Paris, London, Moscow and perhaps other capitals, to build support for whatever Washington's policy proves to be. But another senior official said Mr. Christopher would go more to hear what the allies have to say.
Mr. Clinton met this afternoon for more than two hours with 20 lawmakers to determine the degree of support on Capitol Hill for military action.
He laid out possible courses of action, including the use of air strikes and the arming of the Bosnian Muslims, but told lawmakers that he had yet to define the goal of American policy, an exercise he must complete before deciding what action is warranted, senior Administration officials said.
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said one of the President's options was to rely on the status quo, which includes newly tightened United Nations sanctions. Mr. Clinton, he said, took no position on any of the options but appeared committed on one point: that something more be done to halt what Senator Pell characterized as a "slaughter" being carried out by the Serbs in Bosnia.
White House officials say the key problem debated in heated meetings in recent weeks is whether the United States and its allies should try to halt Serbian aggression and freeze its military gains by a cease-fire, or whether to take on the more ambitious goal of punishing Serbian aggression.
The first goal could be pursued by controlled air strikes, senior Administration officials said.
 
Money for the Muslims
 But the more ambitious goal would require more aggressive action, perhaps the arming of the Bosnian Muslims. Mr. Christopher has said that arming the Muslims could help "level the playing field" so they could fight more fairly against the Serbs. In Cognressional testimony last week, he reminded lawmakers that they had already appropriated $50 million in this year's budget for such action.
The Clinton Administration has decided that additional United Nations authorization is unnecessary if the United States decides, unilaterally or with its allies, to use military force against Serbs in order to protect the humanitarian effort. Such authorization is included under Resolution 770, which allows Security Council members to use "all necessary measures" to deliver relief supplies and "would provide legal authority to use force against military installations hindering the relief effort."
 
European Worries
 The State Department explained that position last week in a letter to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who has repeatedly called for air strikes and a selective easing of the United Nations arms embargo.
Britain and France have indicated distaste for any military action, though they seem to prefer bombing to other military options, and have spoken out strongly against arming the Bosnian Muslims, arguing that more weapons would intensify the war and endanger thousands of British and French ground troops working with the United Nations.
In a warning from another side, Adm. David Jeremiah, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that air strikes in Bosnia could lead to a difficult, drawn-out commitment that would include civilian deaths and damage to civilian areas.
If the assumption is that bombing raids "will be a painless action, it will not be, because there will clearly be collateral military damage" to civilian areas, he said. "You cannot allow somebody to go forward and assume you're going to get in and out with a 'quickie.' "
 
Balkan Update
 As tighter United Nations sanctions against Serb-dominated YUGOSLAVIA took effect yesterday, Serbs attacked around BIHAC, a strategic pocket of Muslim territory in northwestern BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. In SARAJEVO, an exploding tank shell killed three children.
The Bosnian Serb military chief of staff said that if United Nations officials did not disarm Muslim defenders of SREBRENICA by May 7, Serbs would again block relief and evacuation convoys.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in WASHINGTON that rigorous standards must be met, including a sure way out, before any decision is made to use American military might in the former Yugoslavia.
NATO military chiefs, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, expressed concern in BRUSSELS about the deteriorating Bosnia situation but made no calls for military action.
The European Community's mediator, Lord Owen, said in LONDON that American troops should join the relief operation in Bosnia instead of leaving Europeans to take the risks.
The Security Council's sanctions committee at the UNITED NATIONS rejected an American effort to bar nonessential foodstuffs from Yugoslavia, but decided that large shipments of gourmet items like caviar and champagne should not be allowed in. (pg. A10)

HEADLINE: Many in Congress, Citing Vietnam, Oppose Attacks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
While many advocates of tougher American action against the Bosnian Serbs have drawn parallels to the origins of World War II and the appeasement of Nazi aggression and brutality, the dominant analogy in Congress today was Vietnam.
A growing number of lawmakers are warning the Clinton Administration against bombing Serbian positions, fearing that it would inevitably lead to the kind of runaway deployment of ground troops that characterized American involvement in Southeast Asia. 
 Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine and Bob Dole of Kansas, who respectively lead the Democratic and Republican parties in the Senate, are arguing strenuously for the Administration to push for NATO air strikes to halt the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the few occasions when they agree, they can usually can take the heat out of any issue. But their calls for immediate military action in the former Yugoslavia have failed to win widespread support in Congress.
"We're all scared to death of public reaction to things that have a Vietnam overtone," said Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee who nevertheless supports the use of air strikes against Serbian petroleum depots and manufacturing plants to hinder the Serbian forces fighting in Bosnia.
 
Some Veterans Opposed
 The opposition to military intervention cuts across party and ideological lines, and is especially fierce among some legislators who fought in Vietnam. Many of them have painful memories of another young Democratic President stumbling toward a prolonged conflict without a clear strategy.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, warned that bombing or the use of ground troops could lead to Serbian terrorist attacks in the United States that would be "different from anything we have ever experienced and for which we are largely unprepared."
Furthermore, he added, bombing alone would not deter the Serbs.
"Are we prepared to go to the next move?" he asked. "The next move would have to be ground troops, and I'm not convinced the American people are willing to go to ground troops, especially when the Europeans are so neglectful of their responsibilities that they have not done anything."
Senator John McCain of Arizona, a senior Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, said, "I have yet to talk to a military expert who believes that air strikes alone will beneficially affect that tragic situation." His views in part reflect the advice he and other members close to the Pentagon have received from senior officers who oppose military intervention, but they also reflect the experience of a Navy pilot who was shot down and spent several years in a North Vietnamese prison camp before coming home to an unappreciative country.
 
'No Clear-Cut Objectives'
 As in Vietnam and Lebanon, Mr. McCain said, in Bosnia the Administration faces "a civil war with a great difficulty in differentiating between participants -- and there are no clear-cut military objectives."
Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, a Republican who served as a Navy air navigator in Vietnam, said, "The Vietnam experience is a very pertinent analogy because when Americans suffer casualties in Yugoslavia, support for American involvement is going to fade."
"Bombing is going to involve ground personnel by necessity," Mr. Brown added, "because you have to have spotters, you have to have intelligence and you have to have a way to pick up the pilots if any planes are lost. We are kidding ourselves if we think we can do surgical air strikes and not have American personnel at risk."
Republicans and Democrats said the kind of Congressional consensus that coalesced behind President Bush's call for intervention in the Persian Gulf has not emerged because lawmakers do not believe that American interests are at stake. Nor can they see how Washington can quickly bring an intervention in the Balkans to a conclusion.
 
Difficult Terrain Noted
 Many also noted that while Iraq and Kuwait are desert countries where air power can be decisive against enemy forces without adequate cover, the unpredictable weather and tough mountain terrain in Bosnia limit the effectiveness of air warfare.
Members of both parties are expressing growing alarm about the "ethnic cleansing" campaign by the Serbs and frustration with the failure of the European allies to take tougher action. But few, including Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the influential Democratic chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, seem ready to go much farther than a partial lifting of the United Nations arms embargo on the Bosnian factions so the Muslims can rearm themselves.
"The draconian sanctions just went into effect," Mr. Hamilton said, referring to a tightened United Nations embargo. "It doesn't make sense to put the sanctions in today and bomb tomorrow."
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, who has been a hawk on other foreign policy issues, also urged caution. "It is vital to think through the last step before you take the first step," he said, adding that the Administration could unwisely escalate the war in incremental steps. Instead, he favors lifting the arms embargo on the Muslims and urges that the Administration encourage American civilians with military experience to train the Muslims, perhaps with the help of the Turks and Egyptians.
 
Clinton Promises to Refocus
 The powerful Congressional reservations appear to make it difficult for the Administration to move decisively on Bosnia, especially since much of its legislative program faces an uphill battle. Since the recent defeat of the spending portion of his economic stimulus package, President Clinton has promised to refocus his efforts to enact the rest of the economic program and health care reform.
The debate over whether the crisis in Bosnia is more resonant of the Holocaust or Vietnam is going on in both parties, and crosses the fault lines of the old doves and hawks. On Friday night, at a Senate Democratic retreat at Jamestown, Va., Senator Paul Simon of Illinois got up to ask the opponents of intervention in his party, "What happens next if we do nothing?" Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York responded, "Another museum," a reference to the new Holocaust Museum in Washington.
Mr. Simon, an influential member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the next American step should be air strikes against Serbian artillery positions and supply routes. He has also recommended that Mr. Clinton deploy fighter planes to escort relief aircraft so they can fly at lower altitudes for greater accuracy when they drop supplies to Bosnian civilians.
 
Moral Outrage Expressed
 Expressing the moral outrage that fuels such arguments for more direct intervention, Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester, called for air strikes. "We just can't let the killing go on," Ms. Lowey said. "We have to be a leader in the world community."
Representative David E. Bonior, the Democratic whip from Michigan, agreed, saying, "Nothing else has worked."
But many other Congressional Democrats appear unconvinced that to act cautiously in the former Yugoslavia is to invite comparisons to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler at Munich.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, a senior Democratic member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Congress would follow the President to war only when "there is a clear American interest, an identifiable foe and a sense that victory can be gained at an acceptable price and in an acceptable amount of time."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Market Shows Doubt Over Clinton

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
President Clinton has been enamored of the bond market in ways that no recent President has. Indeed, he and his economic aides have often pointed to the drop in Treasury yields to lows not seen in well over a decade as confirmation that his economic program has been well received.
But in the last several days, the bond market has been losing some of its confidence that Mr. Clinton will be successful in cutting the record Federal budget deficit. Prices of Treasury notes and bonds have dropped and yields have risen. In a sharp decline yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond was off almost a full point as the yield jumped to 6.90 percent, its highest level in three weeks. 
 The shift in the market's mood -- which, indeed, can change on a dime -- seemed to begin late last week, after Senate Republicans finally won their battle to block President Clinton's $19 billion economic stimulus program.
 
Worry on Deficit Reduction
 Investors and traders took the President's defeat negatively, although many had worried earlier this year that the stimulus program might cause inflation by pushing the economy ahead too quickly.
"If he can't get his stimulus plan, how is he ever going to get through his deficit reduction package?" asked Alan Lerner, the head of global markets at Bankers Trust.
John Costas, the managing director for government trading at the First Boston Corporation, said, "This is the unwinding of some of the Clinton euphoria."
The doubts were enhanced by Mr. Clinton's own budget director, Leon E. Panetta, who was quoted in several newspapers yesterday as saying that he had become more pessimistic about the chances for approving a major deficit reduction package this year.
The disappointment is not restricted to the bond market. Stock market investors are also worried. "Every day is a loss of more confidence for Clinton," said Bernard Spilko, managing director for United States stock investments for Julius Baer Securities, a unit of the large Swiss bank.
Mr. Spilko said the declining confidence in the President dominated a lunch yesterday with Bank Julius Baer's outside business advisers, who include bankers, real estate investors and a former Federal Reserve board governor. Many expressed dismay with President Clinton's first 100 days, Mr. Spilko said. "A lot of us were disappointed, but we'd like to give him a little more time before we really give up on him."
 
Negatives Line Up
 The bond market came under additional pressure yesterday because this shift in investors' moods was taking place just as several other negatives were lining up on their own.
The recent rally in the price of gold has revived some concerns about inflation. Consumer confidence rose in April, the first increase this year and another sign that the weather-induced slowdown in March was not likely to continue. Another report showed retail sales up in the third week of April. And traders and investors were faced with a two-year Treasury auction yesterday that did not go well, and face the five-year auction today.
The question now is whether the bond market's rally is over, especially since the price of the 30-year bond has fallen two full points since Friday, while its yield has jumped from 6.75 percent, to 6.90 percent. Some market analysts are ready to say the rally is over, while others still expect yields to fall below 6.72 percent, the 16-year low touched on March 8 and again on April 19.
But for now, the market seems still to be in a tight trading range, which means prices could bounce back from this three-day swoon.
Mr. Costas said yesterday's auction of $15.25 billion of two-year notes went poorly because nobody wanted to bid aggressively, given the current uncertainties about the economy and Mr. Clinton's selling power. But he also said the 3.88 percent yield on the two-year notes meant that their prices might rebound if today's five-year auction went well and there was no more negative news.
One positive sign, he said, was that the yield on the new two-year note did not rise further after the auction, ending the day at 3.88 percent. The yield on the five-year note in the pre-auction market was 5.17 percent, up from 5.10 percent Monday.
 
Lower Rates Expected
 Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, still expects the yield on the 30-year bond to drop to 6 percent by the end of the year. He argued yesterday that a possible stalemate on Mr. Clinton's economic program would not change his outlook because he had never assumed that the President would be successful in cutting the deficit. He thinks low inflation will bring yields lower.
But, he added, "if the bond market has rallied because there are a lot of people who concluded that the Clinton plan had a lot of deficit reduction and they are concluding now that it won't work, then the bond market could sell off."
Following are the results of yesterday's two-year note auction:

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN HAITI DENY DRUG LINKS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 27

 BODY:
Haiti's military leaders deny that they are involved in drug trafficking and say reports of large transshipments of cocaine through the country are part of a "vast campaign to discredit and destabilize the army."
In recent days, there have been repeated reports in the American press of increased drug trafficking in Haiti since a military coup overthrew the elected President in September 1991. An army statement, issued late Monday, specifically denied assertions in an article in The New York Times on Sunday in which international financial experts said the country's Central Bank was laundering drug profits. 
 The statement also denied assertions in the article that the United States Drug Enforcement Administration had been hindered in its work in Haiti by the absence there of a government recognized by Washington. Representatives of the Drug Enforcement Administration "participate regularly in all of the actions carried out by national anti-drug services," the statement said.
International financial experts who are studying Haiti have said in recent days that the country's economy appears to have been kept afloat in defiance of a hemispheric embargo only by large-scale laundering of profits from drugs and other contraband.
American drug officials said today that while it was true that their Haitian counterparts take part in joint operations with them, drug enforcement efforts in Haiti have been spotty since the military coup. Furthermore, they said, suspects arrested in possession of large quantities of cocaine are often released after only brief periods of detention.
"Anytime you have a situation where people have been successful in transiting drugs through a country, and they do so with impunity, it follows that you are going to have an increase in traffic," said an American drug official. In Haiti, he said, "we know of folks who have been caught with the goods, didn't deny it, and were later released without rhyme or reason."
Another American official said: "There has been a real desire on the part of the Colombians to change their routes in the Caribbean because the English-speaking countries are doing a better job at policing. In Haiti, you have a pirate state that sits on all the major trade routes and is desperate for cash."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Forecasts Loss Of Jobs in '93

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In the latest reminder of the enduring grip of the recession, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey predicted yesterday that employment in the New York region would decline further this year, with a loss of 67,000 jobs. It would be the fourth straight year of job losses.
The Port Authority also said it expected the region to fare worse than the rest of the nation, as it has for the last five years. 
 The forecasts were part of the agency's annual economic review of New York City's five boroughs and 12 neighboring counties in New York and New Jersey.
Though parts of the region show clear signs of recovery, the agency anticipated that manufacturers, construction companies and some government agencies would continue to shed workers.
 
Signs of Recovery
 By far the brightest niche is Wall Street, where average pay for workers, from clerks to top executives, leaped to $164,000 last year, a 45 percent increase. Although the data compiled by the agency did not provide a detailed breakdown, it said most of the increase was received by traders, brokers and senior executives.
But the agency saw other signs as well of the beginnings of broader recovery. They include a sharp increase in retail sales in November and December, growing demand for office space midtown Manhattan and an increase last year in tourism.
These scattered signs, after the region's deepest and most protracted downturn since World War II, offer little hope of swift expansion of jobs, the agency said.
"We are in a recovery, but it is uneven and it will not translate into job growth for the region until 1994," said Rosemary Scanlon, the Port Authority's chief economist.
The recession has weighed far more heavily on New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other northeastern states than on the rest of the nation, and is lasting longer. At least 90 percent of the nation's job losses since 1989 have fallen in the Northeast and California.
The agency's forecast of job losses this year would amount to slightly less than 1 percent of the region's total of 6.97 million jobs. After three years of shrinkage, the job base has already declined by more than 660,000, or 8 percent, from a peak of 7.62 million workers in 1989.
In the region, last year's job losses were the worst in New York City, where employment declined by 90,400, or 2.7 percent. The New York suburbs (Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland counties) lost 38,400, or 2.5 percent, of their jobs. And the eight counties of northern New Jersey lost 43,800, or 2 percent of their jobs. They include Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, Passaic, Morris, Middlesex and Monmouth counties.
Evidence of a recovery was weaker than expected, the agency said. In a comparable forecast a year ago, the agency had said that it expected job losses in 1992, but that the losses would have stopped in early 1993.
The region's economy performed worse than expected last year because of deep recession in Europe and Japan, Ms. Scanlon said. That hurt international trade and finance centered in New York City. A weaker than expected recovery elsewhere in the United States was another factor.
The region's real-estate markets, battered by the recession, showed few signs of improvment last year, the report found. One exception was midtown Manhattan, where 17 million square feet of office space was leased in 1992, a 25 percent increase.
 
Good Year for Broadway
 Demand was less robust elsewhere in the region, which had some of the nation's highest office vacancy rates: 17.8 percent in lower Manhattan, 21.8 percent in northern New Jersey, 19.3 percent in Westchester County and 17 percent in Nassau County.
Spurred by the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than 20 years, the region's residential real-estate markets improved slightly last year. Although home sales increased, the median selling price for the region declined by 0.5 percent, to $172,600. That drop followed three years of much steeper declines since 1988, when the median peaked at $194,000.
One bright spot -- particularly in New York City -- was tourism. Hotel occupancy in the city edged up to 68.6 percent from 67.6 percent in 1991, even though 1,500 new hotel rooms were added last year.
Broadway had an exceptional year. Gross receipts at New York City theaters jumped by 22 percent in 1992, to $329 million, the agency said.
Ms. Scanlon said that Wall Street, widely blamed for the long recession that followed the 1987 stock market collapse, now offers the best hope of a broader recovery.
 
Record Christmas Sales
 Employment at securities firms and other enterprises on Wall Street is a tiny part of the region's economy. The report said the city's securities industry employed only 130,000 people last year, an increase of 8,000 over 1991 but far below its work force of 162,000 at the market's peak in 1987.
But while Wall Street employment has increased slowly, wages have soared. Ms. Scanlon said the 45 percent increase in compensation last year largely reflected bonuses paid in the first three months of the year, rewarding work in 1991. The bonuses paid early this year for 1992's results have yet to be tabulated, but she predicted the $164,000 average wage would be equaled or increased.
Wall Street's fortunate, awash in high earnings, fed the surge in consumer spending late last year, the study said. Retailers in the region reported record Christmas sales.
Ms. Scanlon said she expects the "ripple effect" of spending by Wall Street workers to continue to fuel the regional economy this year, and firms in the securities industry to step up their hiring later this year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wants Group of 7 to Focus on Trade Imbalances

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
With an eye on Japan's huge trade surplus, the Clinton Administration sought today to shift the agenda of the Group of Seven industrial nations, pressing them to place more emphasis on reducing trade imbalances.
Two days before the Group of Seven's finance ministers gather in Washington, Administration officials indicated they would use Thursday's meeting not only to seek to speed up global growth but also to pursue one of President Clinton's principal foreign policy goals -- reducing America's trade deficit, especially with Japan. 
 Seeking to turn up the pressure on Tokyo, Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said most of the world was eager for Japan to end its economic slump, especially through stronger consumption at home -- a change that should lead Japan to import more and reduce its trade surplus of more than $100 billion.
Voicing clear exasperation with Japan's surplus and trade practices, Mr. Summers, usually one of the Administration's stronger voices for free trade, said in a news conference that trade imbalances between countries "say something important about the openness of markets and the fairness of competition" in those countries.
Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sought to alleviate Japan's concerns about the yen's sharp rise, saying that "excessive" exchange rate "volatility is counterproductive for growth."
Mr. Bentsen appeared to try to soothe Japanese officials who remain angry about President Clinton's comments 10 days ago that a strong yen would help reduce trade imbalances. Many Japanese hold Mr. Clinton responsible for the yen's recent jump to record levels.
Testifying before a Senate subcommittee, Mr. Bentsen said the Administration believed that "attempts to artificially influence or manipulate exchange rates are inappropriate."
He said the United States stood ready to cooperate with other Group of Seven nations to steady foreign exchange markets. Afterward, currency traders said the Federal Reserve had intervened today to stop the dollar's steep fall against the yen.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Imagining the Electric-Car Future

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Research and development for electric vehicles have mainly concentrated on batteries, power controllers, motors and other vehicle parts. But what about the infrastructure in which the vehicles will function?
One visionary sees battery-recharging stations being combined with other commercial establishments -- Charg-'n'-Shop might do brisk business at a shopping mall, or Charg-'n'-Eat at an Interstate highway exit.
 
Sketching the Future
 Such visions of the future have come tumbling forth in an unusual design competition here that has as much in common with architecture as engineering. Some 130 teams of planners, thinkers and dreamers have submitted their ideas in poster-board form for a contest with the theme "The Electric Vehicle and the American Community." Their sketches offered ideas for new products, new services and whole new industries. 
 The electric-car future is not far off. California has adopted rules demanding mass sales of electric cars, beginning in 1998, and depending on the outcome of courtroom appeals by the auto companies, the same may hold true in New York, Massachusetts and other big Eastern states.
Beyond such basic questions as what the car will look like, there are broader uncertainties. Would electric vehicles be charged at the owner's house, at a service station, or while the car was parked at work? The electric may be the perfect urban vehicle, but how would a city dweller who does not have a garage or driveway charge up a car? If cars could be charged as they ran, through magnetic fields from under-road metal plates, how would drivers be billed?
"There are very real unanswered questions," said Steven G. Cecil, the manager of the competition, which was sponsored primarily by the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade association; the General Motors Corporation and the Energy Department. "The engineering types have their own tradition of predicting what the future will look like. We're trying to place ourselves in that tradition."
 
Panel of Specialists
 So beneath an age-darkened oil portrait of Thomas Edison, a seven-member panel drawn from specialists in energy, the environment, engineering and architecture completed judging the entries today; the dozen or so winners, who will split $100,000 in prizes, will be announced on May 10. The contest sponsors are not planning to execute any of the designs; the intent was simply to stimulate thinking.
The judges assessed each entry without knowing whose work they were viewing. A reporter was invited to observe on condition that the judges not be quoted by name in their frank assessments of specific submissions.
Several entries proposed the popularization of electric vehicles through regulatory means. A plan for Keene, N.H., for example, called for giving zoning benefits to buildings that offer recharging, or other accommodations for electric vehicles, or in which 25 percent of the employees drive electrics. Such buildings would be entitled to a "density bonus" of two extra stories.
 
A New Kind of Shopping
 This same entry, made by the Charg-'n'-Eat folks, also depicted a store called Battery Exchange -- placed next to a Kmart in a flourish of authenticity.
An entry from Sacramento, Calif., foresaw a different adaptation of commerce: Mom & Pop's Fruit & Battery Farm, a roadside stand set against a backdrop of windmills and farm fields.
There were metropolitan images, too. A Philadelphia proposal predicted expensive homes on the median strips of major highways, once the noise of internal combustion engines had faded to memory. It also included a sketch of a vandal-resistant curbside recharging unit for use in neighborhoods without driveways.
Though not bothering with such details as how a resident would insure that someone else did not park in his space, the entry did take care to predict what the cars will look like. One was an electric reproduction of the '57 Chevy, produced by Fonda (the future parent company of Ford and Honda). Another was the Chrysler '09 Elvis. (That's '09 as in 2009, and no, the King wasn't behind the wheel -- he was merely the design on the hood.)
But the car companies have miles to go before worrying about such cosmetics. So far, the auto manufacturers have not settled on a common design for the electrical plug, an essential standard if all electric vehicles will be able to recharge at any station.
"This field is changing so much, that if I were a manufacturer I would be very hard pressed to make a commitment to build," said Paul MacCready, the chairman of Aerovironment Inc., the company that designed the Impact, a zippy two-seater electric prototype, for General Motors.
The true value of the competition, Mr. MacCready said, was "edging people to think about transportation, rather than cars." In recent decades, he said, gasoline-powered cars have "developed our civilization." Now, with some advance planning, he said, perhaps people could regain the initiative, and could plan the civilization and the vehicles to match.
Many designs called for supplanting the gasoline-powered car with the electric through inducements, like preferential parking for electric vehicles. A proposal for Cambridge, Mass., sketched the partial redevelopment of the Alewife stop on the Boston subway system.
The Alewife stop is currently the site of a huge elevated parking garage. The proposal was to drape it with photovoltaic cells, to provide electricity for recharging cars while their owners took the subway into Boston. The design also called for a day-care center and a supermarket to be added to the complex, to reduce the demand for travel.
That design also addressed, if only broadly, the problem of rapid recharging. If a car is to be recharged in five minutes or so, the demand for current is enormous.
To go 100 miles or so between charges, for example, G.M.'s Impact carries about 14 kilowatt-hours of electricity in its 900 pounds of batteries. If those batteries could be charged in five minutes -- itself a challenge, given the state of battery technology today -- they would need to draw well over 100 kilowatts. That is about the same amount of electricity that a small office building draws, pointed out another judge, James J. MacKenzie, senior associate of the World Resources Institute, an environmental group.
 
Spinning a Solution
 The solution in the Cambridge design was to store energy in a flywheel, whose spinning would be converted back to electricity when needed.
Another competitor, though, sketched a filling station with three different charging outlets -- standard, rapid and economy -- a parallel to the differing grades of gasolines sold today.
Another proposed a system of plates buried in the streets that could transmit energy to similar plates mounted on cars.
"How would the owner get billed?" one judge asked another. "Scanners, fiber optics, something," said the other.
Let the engineers iron out the details.

HEADLINE: Consumer Optimism Improves

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
To the surprise of many economists, consumers became slightly less pessimistic in April for the first time this year.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business organization, reported yesterday that its closely followed consumer confidence index bounced up to 67.7 in April, from 63.2 in March, regaining nearly a third of its 15-point drop since December, when post-election euphoria peaked. 
 The upturn cheered stock investors. Retailers track the survey because consumers' spirits -- just like income, inflation or interest rates -- can affect their willingness to spend. The mail survey includes 5,000 families around the country, and yesterday's report covers responses gathered during the first three weeks of April.
 
Two Gloomy Regions
 Confidence brightened a bit this month in six out of nine regions of the country, according to the Conference Board, though not in the mid-Atlantic region, which includes New York. The mid-Atlantic and the West Coast remain the the gloomiest regions. Consumers are most optimistic in parts of the country where the economy has held up pretty well, namely, the mountain states, the upper Midwest and the South.
Americans all over the country are still extraordinarily worried about the weak job market. According to the April survey, 15.5 percent of consumers, only a bit more than 14.9 percent a month earlier, think that jobs will be more abundant by Labor Day. A larger 22.1 percent believe that jobs will actually become scarcer. As recently as January the job optimists outnumbered the pessimists.
Not surprisingly, consumers say they do not have big spending plans. Just 6 percent say they are going to buy a car within the next six months, 3 percent plan to buy a house and 27 percent expect to buy a big-ticket appliance, about the same proportions as a year earlier.
Nonetheless, the Conference Board survey shows that consumers' perceptions of current business conditions are more positive than they have been since last summer. That observation squares with recent weekly readings from a ABC/Money magazine consumer poll that portrays consumers as relatively more sanguine about their current financial situation than about the economy's future prospects.
Spending does not always follow the ups and downs of consumers' spirits, but this month retailers and car dealers are reporting that consumers are also buying more. Car sales have turned more solid in the last few weeks, for example. In the first 20 days of April, auto sales averaged 6.6 million at an annual rate, compared with an annual rate of 6.3 million in March.
And chain-store sales also seem to have bounced back from their mid-March funk, the Johnson Redbook Service, a weekly survey of about 25 national retail chains, reported yesterday. For the first three weeks of the month, sales have been 9.3 percent higher than a year earlier and, seasonally adjusted, are up 2.3 percent from March.
"Sales have been pretty good," Steven Marotta, analyst at the Johnson Redbook Service. "We haven't seen numbers like these since Christmas."
For example, at the Century City Shopping Center and Market Place in Los Angeles, sales have picked up in the last 10 days or so, especially for spring clothes, toys, furniture and consumer electronics. "The weather's been beautiful," Linda Smith Frost, the center's marketing director, said. "And there was a collective sigh of relief after the Rodney King trial verdict."
But the slightly better mood does not mean that consumers will soon be spending as freely as last summer and fall.
For one thing, confidence is still relatively weak. During the boom of the 1980's, readings of 100 or more on the Conference Board's index were typical. "The April reading is encouraging," said Jason Bram, an economist at the Conference Board, "but it's too moderate a gain to signal the start of an enduring upward trend."
 
 
Other Reasons
 Besides, there are other reasons for thinking that consumers will not be the economy's main engine of growth this year.
"The consumer still suffers from the same litany of problems that have kept spending weak for several years," Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said. "Job growth is still sluggish. Wages are rising slowly. And the debt burden is still heavy."

HEADLINE: Company That Shut Factory Has Returned From Mexico

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STONINGTON, Conn., April 27

 BODY:
In 1989, Quality Coils closed its factory here and moved production to Juarez, Mexico, in search of cheaper labor. Now, the company has returned, saying that decision actually cost it money.
"What we learned down in Mexico is that the up-front wages might look a lot less expensive," the company's president, Keith A. Gibson, said. "What we found is that the Connecticut worker is by far more productive." 
 By returning to Stonington, he said, the company hopes to save $150,000 a year despite the higher wages and insurance costs for workers here.
The company's announcement comes less than two weeks after the state's largest employer, Pratt & Whitney, threatened to close two plants in Connecticut, saying its costs here were $6 to $8 an hour more per employee than at its plants in Maine and Georgia.
State officials were quick to seize on the experience of Quality Coils as a reason for manufacturers to stay in Connecticut.
 
'The Bottom Line'
 "The fact is worker productivity goes right to the bottom line," the State Economic Development Commissioner, Joseph J. McGee, said. "Let this be a warning to other small manufacturers to look very closely before moving out of Connecticut."
Quality Coils, which is based in Bristol, Conn., reopened its Stonington plant, near the Rhode Island border, in February.
The company makes electromagnetic coils for refrigeration equipment, motors, relays and signaling devices, and it employs 200 people, with its overall sales reaching $9.6 million in 1992. The plant in Stonington has 18 workers, but that number is expected to reach close to 40 once all its equipment has arrived from Mexico.
Wages in Mexico average $5.38 an hour, including benefits, Mr. Gibson said, compared with $10 an hour here. But he said it takes one Connectciut worker to do the work of three employees in Mexico.
Mr. Gibson said Quality Coils expects to receive $50,000 to $60,000 from the state for the relocation costs.
"We have agreed to help in some undefined way to offset the cost of this move," acknowledged Joseph M. Cohen, a spokesman for the State Economic Development Department. "So far, it's a verbal commitment only."
That assistance, Mr. Cohen added, is not likely to include any tax incentives.
 
Projections Questioned
 Speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony here today, Mr. McGee challenged Pratt & Whitney's estimates of the added costs of manufacturing in Connecticut.
He said Pratt & Whitney was guilty of poor management and that its projections failed to address the issue of worker productivity.
"There is no question we've got to improve on things like workers compensation and energy costs," Mr. McGee said. But he said Connecticut's skilled work force is 20 percent more productive than the national average.
A number of businesses that moved to Southern states seeking cheaper labor, Mr. McGee said, have returned.
"We're trying to make a point here to those who answered the siren call of the South," he said. "We are focusing on wage productivity -- whether unskilled workers can be as productive as skilled workers."

HEADLINE: Hartford Assembly Saves A 5 Deposit on Bottles

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 27

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s plan to replace Connecticut's 5-cent bottle deposit with a 5-cent-a-bottle tax was killed today by the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee, which voted to continue paying for environmental protection through existing taxes.
The committee's 28-to-20 vote on the budget today was the Legislature's first formal response to Mr. Weicker's spending plan for the next two years. Committee leaders said they believed their plan retains Mr. Weicker's priorities, especially for education, and also keeps the budget at his $8.6 billion figure for the year that begins on July 1. 
 But there were changes beyond the bottle-deposit measure. The committee also scrapped the Governor's proposal to evict from welfare people deemed employable. The committee's compromise was to reduce the benefits of such recipients, but not cut them off entirely.
 
Raiding Casino Fund
 The committee also raided the $100 million-a-year fund created earlier this year by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe after Mr. Weicker agreed to permit slot machines at the tribe's casino in Ledyard.
The fund is at the center of the hottest debate in the Legislature, over casino gambling, and some municipalities -- the fund's main beneficiaries -- had feared the money would become a political trading card. But the committee removed only $15 million, leaving $85 million for grants to towns.
Some members questioned just how secure even that money would be as a bill legalizing casinos for Bridgeport and Hartford moves toward a vote later in the session. Under the Governor's agreement with the Pequots, payments to the fund dry up immediately if any other casinos were legalized by the Legislature.
 
An Unbalanced Budget?
 Some legislators wondered whether the budget would suddenly be out of balance if the Pequot money dried up in the aftermath of a casino vote.
"I'm not sure we can tell you today," said the committee's co-chairman, Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr. Mr. Harper said the two theories being analyzed were that the tribe would be obligated to pay until competing casinos were in operation, or that the agreement would become void immediately upon the approval of casinos.
Mr. Harper called the overall plan a "conservative" budget, under which state spending would grow 6.9 percent for the year, compared with Mr. Weicker's budget growth of 7.2 percent. It was the first budget prepared under a new law mandating an annual cap on the growth of state spending, and the first under a two-year budget law also intended to allow greater control over spending. The preliminary budget for the year beginning July 1, 1994 was set at $9 billion.
Mr. Weicker had argued in proposing his budget that recycling is so established in the state that the 13-year-old deposit law is no longer necessary. The extra nickel that residents are used to paying per bottle for beer, soda and other drinks, totaling $65 million a year altogether, could be better applied for state parks and other uses, Mr. Weicker said.
 
Bottle Deposits Popular
 But the plan came under immediate fire from some environmental groups, who said bottle deposits were among the most popular conservation measures. Concerns were also raised about people who survive in part by scavenging bottles and cans to return for their deposits.
"What you want to do is draw the general public into an activity and this does it," said Paula Carrell, state program director for the Sierra Club.
As part of an overhaul of the welfare system, Mr. Weicker had proposed that any person considered employable be taken off general-assistance welfare on July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year. His aides estimated that perhaps 22,000 people now receiving help would be cut off on that date.
The committee's modified plan defines employable more narrowly, to include about 13,500 people. Some categories of drug users, for example, who would have been deemed employable under the Governor's plan, would instead be deemed unemployable and eligible for treatment programs. People considered employable, however, would see their benefits cut from $314 a month to $285.
 
Prescription Subsidies
 The committee also modified, but kept largely intact, the Governor's plan to reduce state subsidies for drug prescriptions for the elderly, a program called Connpace. The committee's budget would institute a 50 percent co-payment program for prescriptions and impose tighter limits on who can qualify for the assistance. But the committee's budget rejected Mr. Weicker's idea of assessing an annual application fee.
More than 20 amendments proposed by Republicans on the Democratic-controlled committee were rejected on largely party-line votes. Most of the amendments proposed deeper spending cuts, or tax cuts for businesses and residents.
The House's ranking minority member, Representative Reginald L. Jones, a Republican from Darien, said he thought that many of the defeated ideas would re-emerge when the budget came up for a vote in the House of Representatives, probably next month.

HEADLINE: Nashville Sets Unusual Deal To Acquire Route of USAir

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
In Nashville, the best defense is a good offense.
That is the message, at least, of an agreement by the city to pay USAir $5 million for an air route between Charlotte, N.C., and London, move the American end to Nashville and let American Airlines operate the route. 
 Confused? So is American Airlines, which says it learned of Nashville's plan over the weekend. "This has never been done before," Tim Smith, a spokesman, said. "We don't know how that works."
 
Will Government Approve?
 Neither, for that matter, does the Department of Transportation, which noted that only airlines could buy the rights to fly a route. Under the Nashville Airport Authority's deal, which is contingent on Government approval, the city would not actually own the route.
Perhaps more interesting than whether the deal is ultimately approved is why it is being attempted.
The deal stems from USAir's recently approved alliance with British Airways, which calls for USAir to dispose of three routes to London, from Philadelphia, Baltimore and Charlotte. Most of the major carriers have clamored for the routes, saying they should get the routes free and be permitted to move them to their hub airports.
Nashville, one of the cities threatened by the contraction of the airline industry, is fighting its own battle. As the major carriers look to reduce some of their costly operations, American Airlines is frowning on unprofitable hub operations at Nashville. It plans to shrink operations in the city, where it operates 127 daily flights and employs roughly 3,000 people.
Pointing to economic ripple effects, Nashville officials contend that moving the London route to Tennessee would inject an additional $250 million annually into the state.
Industry analysts expect similar bidding efforts by other airport groups. In a sense, the airport officials are simply extending a long tradition of competing with other states for businesses.
"They're scrambling to maintain a competitive advantage," said Kenneth P. Quinn, counsel to the aviation practice of Mercer Management Consulting.
Nashville's aggressive stance is not new. City officials have tried for three years to win a London route, and have visited England to drum up support.
"Nashville is rising to the occasion," said Mr. Smith of American Airlines. "In hindsight, we shouldn't be surprised."

New York State's Outlook Improves

 BODY:
The borrowing prospects for New York State, which is expected to sell about $850 million of tax-and-revenue anticipation notes in competitive bidding today, continues to brighten.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation on Monday revised to stable from negative the outlook on the state's $5.1 billion of general obligation debt. 
 As a result, the ratings on debt issued by the New York State Dormitory Authority is also viewed as stable. Yesterday, S.& P. assigned a BBB+ rating to a planned $1.2 billion revenue bond issue for the State University of New York through the dormitory agency. That issue is expected to be priced this week.
While the rating on the state's $5.1 billion of general obligation debt remains A-, the revision by S.& P. indicates a potential upgrading over several years. Rating upgrades allow issuers to borrow at lower rates.
The revision of the state's rating outlook, S.& P. said, was because of positive financial trends over the last two years, including operating surpluses, the timely passage of a budget for two consecutive years and a budget based on realistic economic and revenue estimates. S.& P. said it had assigned its highest short-term rating of SP-1+ to today's $850 million competitive offering.
Last week, Moody's Investors Service Inc. rated the issue MIG-1, its highest rating and the best rating for short-term debt for the state since 1990. Moody's warned that the rating involved a small amount of debt and was not a general endorsement.

HEADLINE: Looking a Gift Painting in the Dollar Sign;
Paterson Examines Its Legacy of Art: How Much It's Worth and How to Restore It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., April 21

 BODY:
During the first half of the century, industrialists and business leaders filled the Danforth Library here with gifts of books and works of art. But as important industries left the city and its economy declined, so did appreciation for its cultural treasures.
Much of the art, including statues, bronzes, rare furniture and more than 60 paintings, is now in storage and, like the building itself, in need of maintenance and repair. But while a makeover is planned for the 88-year-old library, an acrimonious debate is growing over the art -- what it is worth, who should care for it and even where it is. 
 At least twice the city has tried to raise money by selling paintings from the library collection. Public outrage stopped one sale in the 1970's. In 1982 it took a lawsuit filed by a dozen citizens to save a painting titled "In the Park" by William Merritt Chase that has been appraised at $500,000 to $1 million. The painting was one of 26 donated in 1926 by Jennie Tuttle Hobart, the widow of Garret A. Hobart, who served as William McKinley's Vice President from 1897 until Mr. Hobart's death in 1899.
"Part of the reason we sued was that we felt if that painting was sold the whole collection might go," said Howard Sterling, now a member of the library's art committee. Publicity led to display of the painting in a retrospective on Chase's work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And the attention caused the city to take a new look at the art.
"What's happening in Paterson is not unique," Mr. Sterling said. "What is going on is that a lot of people who collected art around the turn of the century began giving it to public institutions in the 1920's, and people are just now beginning to take notice of things they just considered decorations gathering dust. In many cases folks don't know what their collections are worth or how to maintain them."
A couple of years ago a library official went looking for 28 19th-century American and European paintings donated to the library by Ralph P. Ross, a textile manufacturer.
Several paintings were found in a vault, some of them torn and deteriorating from dampness, said Dominic A. DiNardo, a member of the library's board. "Nobody will say who put them there," he said.
A former Paterson resident who wants to establish a museum to house the city's art claims more than two dozen pieces donated by Mr. Ross are missing. Nick Sunday, a magazine writer and graphic artist who lives in nearby Prospect Park, has sent a list of the items that he claims are missing to the State Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, who forwarded Mr. Sunday's complaint to the Passaic County Prosecutor. In the last few days Mayor William J. Pascrell has asked the library for an accounting of each piece of art. He also estimated the cost of restoring the paintings at $50,000 and pledged to find the money.
Norma Harrison, president of the board since January, has said the library can account for all of the objects listed in Mr. Sunday's complaint.
In addition, Ms. Harrison says, the library has asked the city and council, which must approve its budget request, for $12,000 for a part-time curator to examine the paintings, appraise their value and determine which ones are worth restoring and which are too damaged to repair. "We also hope a curator will help us attract grants, interpret the art and develop a curriculum for the schools in Paterson and elsewhere," she said.
Mr. Sunday has also taken on another Paterson institution, the Hamilton Club, a businessmen's group founded in the late 1800's, in defense of another group of paintings.
He has persuaded Sotheby's auction house in New York to delay the sale of 19 paintings that he contends were once owned by Mr. Ross. "He was very firm about what he wanted done with his paintings," Mr. Sunday said of the city's best-known philanthropist. "He wanted them to be available for the young people of the city."
Mr. Sunday says the paintings were part of a collection of 50 works that Mr. Ross gave to the local chamber of commerce in the 1930's, specifying that if the chamber ever wanted to dispose of them they should go to the city's two high schools and the library.
In the early 1950's, he said, the chamber moved out of its quarters in the Fabian Building, and Mr. Ross took 25 of the paintings to the library and 25 to the Hamilton Club, the businessmen's club. Some of these paintings were taken to Sotheby's late last year by Hamilton Club Associates, a limited partnership that had obtained them from the club, Mr. Sunday said.
Walter Hunziker Jr., the president of the Hamilton Club, said discussions are under way to clear up questions about ownership of the paintings, whose history, he said, is "very confused, nothing is clear." But he said the story about their being given to the chamber of commerce and earmarked for the schools "is made up out of whole cloth and supposition."
Mr. Sunday has set up a nonprofit museum named for Jennie Tuttle Hobart to protect the city's art collection from future attempts to sell it off. But the museum exists only on paper so far.
Last year Mr. Sunday and his fledging museum won a $10,000 grant from the New Jersey Committee for the Humanities to make a catalogue of the library's art collection, but the award was rescinded when the library board said it would not cooperate with the project.
"It was a total surprise," said Mr. Sterling, who was on the library committee in 1991 when Mr. Sunday served as a member for a few months.
"He quickly decided we weren't capable and wanted us to turn over the library's collection to him," he said.
He said it was regrettable that Mr. Sunday's relations with the library soured. "He was absolutely right when he said many pieces of art are at a critical stage, need attention and will deteriorate faster if we don't do something," he said. "But we are not at the stage where we will absolutely lose some of the art."
"I have this idea that some think crazy, that somewhere down the road the city will be restored to economic vitality, and that benefactors and resources will be found to restore the collection and appropriately display it."

New Head For A.T.& T. Products Unit

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has gone outside its ranks and named Carl S. Ledbetter Jr., a mathematician, computer executive and self-described gadget junkie, to head its $2 billion consumer products operations.
Mr. Ledbetter, 43, has been a corporate vice president at Sun Microsystems Inc. since 1991. He previously held senior posts at the Control Data Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation. 
 In his new job as president of A.T.& T Consumer Products, he will take over the unit that controls 400 retail phone stores and manufactures and markets household products, including cordless telephones, answering machines and A.T.& T.'s new line of videophones.
During the next few years, the subsidiary is expected to play a central role in marketing hand-held computing devices that read handwriting and transmit data over the air.
"The computer and communications industries are coming together," Mr. Ledbetter said. "We're talking about a time when voice messaging and multimedia are all part of the enterprise of communication."
As both an engineer and a marketing man, Mr. Ledbetter headed a division at Sun Microsystems that makes networking products to link personal computers with more powerful work stations. A man who keeps no fewer than four personal computers at home, he said the emerging family of wireless communication devices should be a huge growth business.
Although A.T.& T. refuses to disclose sales in the consumer product business, it contends that it is the biggest supplier of cordless telephones in the United States. Marion Boucher, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, estimated that the unit generates about $2 billion in sales and said the business has grown comfortably in the last few years.

Euro Disney Needs to Raise Funds in Face of Loss

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 27

 BODY:
Faced by a persistent European recession and a mixed response to its attractions, Euro Disney said today that it would incur a substantial loss for the current fiscal year and would need to raise more money to shore up its finances.
A statement from Euro Disney, which is 49 percent owned by the Walt Disney Company, said the concern had a net loss of 1.08 billion francs ($203 million) for the six months that ended March 31. 
 "Anticipated losses and the expenditures required for the company's ongoing capital investment program will have an adverse effect on its cash and financial positions," the company said. "To address this situation, Euro Disney and the Walt Disney Company are exploring potential sources of financing for Euro Disney."
The company did not indicate the amount it would seek to raise or the means of financing it would use.
 
 
Investment Program
 The new funds would be used to pay down some debt and to finance an ambitious program of investments, including the construction of new park attractions to cut long lines and add variety, company officials said.
Complaints about the lines and the admission fees have marred the park's first year. There have also been difficulties related to cultural differences between the United States and Europe: for example, many Europeans do not like the fact that wine and beer are not available to accompany meals in the theme park.
But analysts said they were troubled by the news that Euro Disney needed more capital when the company's stock had already been battered by lower-than-expected attendance at both the theme park and the six company-owned hotels surrounding it.
"It is odd and disturbing that Euro Disney says it wants to raise new financing but gives no details," said Andrew Hunter, a leisure analyst at Hoare Gavett in London. "The company is probably going to need a substantial amount, perhaps several billion francs, but it may have to put in a better performance before it can raise the money."
Euro Disney, which has faced persistent problems since it opened its theme park amid great hoopla just over a year ago, has debts of 20.3 billion francs ($3.8 billion).
Although attendance in the first year of operation, at 10.3 million, was not much below the company's target of 11 million, spending by visitors has not been as high as had been hoped and occupancy of hotels has fallen far short of expectations. For the most recent fiscal first half, occupancy averaged 37 percent.
 
 
Real Estate Slump
 "Overall results were significantly affected by low hotel occupancy during the period," the company said. A company spokesman, Jean-Jacques Roulmann, said Euro Disney had hoped to sell some of the hotels but had been hampered by the slump in the French real estate market.
Mr. Hunter said he now estimated that Euro Disney would make a small profit during the six summer months, giving a loss for the full fiscal year of about $176 million.
Euro Disney's stock fell 2.8 percent today to 77 francs, or $14.50, on news of its first-half loss. When the park opened, the shares traded at more than double this price. In the United States today, shares of the Walt Disney Company closed at $40.875, down 12.5 cents, after dipping lower earlier in the day.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Mobil's Profit Is Buoyed by Global Sales

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
In contrast to many other oil companies, the Mobil Corporation reported today that its European and Asian refining and marketing operations were profitable despite the sluggish global economy, helping Mobil post first-quarter net income of $490 million, compared with a loss of $319 million a year earlier.
Revenues were virtually unchanged from the period a year earlier at $15 billion. Japan and Australia were especially strong markets for Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, analysts said. 
 Michael Mayer, an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder Inc., said the big surprise in Mobil's report was a plunge in spending on worldwide exploration and production, to $53 million, from $169 million in the first quarter of 1992. Over all, Mobil's capital budget fell to $815 million, from $905 million a year earlier.
 
Remaining Expenditures
 After Mobil officials said spending for worldwide exploration and production had not been reduced, some analysts concluded that spending would be higher than anticipated for the remainder of the year, and earnings lower. That expectation helped push down the price of Mobil's shares in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Still, Mobil's net income of $1.19 a share exceeded the consensus of Wall Street analysts, which had put earnings at $1 a share.
 
Higher Prices
 Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., benefited from higher prices for natural gas and crude oil in the United States as well as lower costs from job cuts, mainly in United States operations.
The company received an average of $2 for each 1,000 cubic feet of domestic natural gas produced in the quarter, compared with $1.48 in the first quarter last year. Mobil's average price for domestic crude sold to refineries rose to $14.70 a barrel from $13.69. The higher prices and lower expenses contributed to operating income of $117 million for the domestic exploration and production unit in the quarter, compared with $19 million in the period a year earlier. The foreign exploration unit earned $316 million, compared with $213 million.

HEADLINE: Income Grew By 3.9% in 1992

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Americans' personal income rebounded across much of the country last year, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said incomes per person last year grew 3.9 percent nationally, to $19,841, a clear advance over the 2.4 percent increase in 1991. The 1991 report, the worst in 30 years, was used by President Clinton in his attacks on the economic record of then-President George Bush. Income growth was so slow that it lagged behind inflation for the first time in nine years. 
 Bu, last year income growth was faster than the 3.2 percent inflation rate. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia shared in the improvement. The six states with a deceleration in growth were Montana, Hawaii, Louisiana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Texas.
Regionally, the far West had the worst income growth last year, only 2.6 percent. It was pulled down by military spending cuts. The best growth came in the Plains states, 5.4 percent, and Great Lakes states, 4.6 percent.
New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, which had been hardest hit by the recession, had better-than-average growth, 4.4 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.
Incomes grew 3.9 percent in both the Rocky Mountain states and the Southeast. They grew 3.7 percent in the Southwest.

HEADLINE: Employment Costs Up 3.5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Wages, salaries and benefits paid to American workers increased a moderate 3.5 percent in the 12 months that ended on March 31, according to a report released today.
The Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed that wages and salaries edged up just 2.7 percent and failed to keep up with a 3.1 percent increase in consumer prices. On the other hand, the value of employee benefits, including health care, rose 5.4 percent. 
 The index is considered a good gauge of wage inflation pressures. Evelina Tainer, head of Prime Economic Consulting in Chicago, called the gauge "a picture of subdued employment costs." Because employment costs are usually passed on to consumers, the stability should translate into a relatively stable price environment, Ms. Tainer said.
In a second report, the Labor Department said collective bargaining agreements for workers in the first quarter of 1993 provide for annual wage gains averaging 3.1 percent.
The pacts replaced contracts, which had generally been negotiated in 1989 and 1990, providing for 3.9 percent average annual gains.
The employment cost report showed that compensation growth slowed slightly from the 4 percent gain for the 12 months ended on March 31, 1992. Compensation had risen 3.5 percent during the 12 months ended Dec. 31 and Sept. 30. The 3.5 percent increases were the smallest since the department began the index in 1982.

HEADLINE: As Haute Cools, Paris Chefs Revitalize The Bistro

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
DINNER under $40, created by three-star French chefs.
Non-smoking sections in restaurants. 
 Smiling faces, welcoming hands.
Can this be Paris?
For Americans who, in the last 15 or 20 years, sort of fell out of love with France and French food, Paris in 1993 is a revelation.
You want to speak in broken French? They'll answer you in French. You want to speak English? They'll speak English.
You look lost? They'll ask if they can guide you.
And if you want to eat high on the hog at moderate prices, no problem. The city's two- and three-star chefs are eager to oblige.
Bistromania has struck the city where it all began. What follows may sound familiar to those who have observed the fate of American restaurants since the late 80's.
Michel Rostang, whose eponymous restaurant has two stars, was the first to start the trend toward lower prices, in 1987. Now, everyone is doing it -- not once, but two, three and even four times.
Early this year, Mr. Rostang opened his fourth Bistrot d'a Cote, so named because the first was actually beside his two-star restaurant. Today, Guy Savoy and Jacques Cagna, whose restaurants bear their names; Gerard Boyer at Les Crayeres in Reims, and Marc Meneau at L'Esperance in Vezelay, about 120 miles southeast of Paris, have opened bistros. In February, Joel Robuchon of the three-star Jamin joined the parade, more or less.
There are a lot of reasons why these chefs, whose starred restaurants charge at least $100 a person for dinner, are either spreading the wealth or diluting their image, depending on your point of view.
Most of them have to do with money. The French, like Americans and most of the rest of the Western world, have been in the grip of a recession.
"The first bistro I opened was not an economic necessity," said Guy Savoy as he sat late one evening at his two-star restaurant in the 17th arrondissement, on the northwestern edge of the city. "Now it is an economic necessity for several reasons. There is a crisis in Paris.
"Absolutely, the regular clients come less often to Guy Savoy. I'm noticing more and more a lot of birthday cakes. This place is for special occasions."
Mr. Savoy's view of what is happening in Paris is shared by his colleagues.
"The crisis makes it unfashionable to spend money," Mr. Cagna said, sipping coffee at his two-star restaurant near the Luxembourg Gardens. "The only ones who are spending are from Taiwan and Hong Kong. And a Russian who bought a $1,500 Chateau d'Yquem."
The popularity of bistros is not just about money. The rhythm of life has changed.
"People don't have time anymore to take a month vacation," Mr. Savoy said. "They take a week. They have less time to relax. Everything is getting shorter. They have less time to eat, and they want to relax more when they eat. People want places to eat that are less formal. Society has changed."
Finally, even in Paris. Patricia Wells, an American who has lived in Paris for years and is the author of "The Food Lover's Guide to France" (1987) and the newly revised "Food Lover's Guide to Paris," both from Workman Publishing, sees the same phenomenon.
"France is much more casual than it was," she said. "France fought it for a long time."
And most of the two- and three-star restaurants have felt the effects. "I got into Guy Savoy by calling one day ahead," Ms. Wells said. "I used to have to reserve 10 days ahead."
Now, even Mr. Robuchon, widely considered the most important chef in France, has succumbed to the bistro concept in terms of price and style of food, but not in the rustic surroundings. His drop-dead-chic Relais du Parc in the new Hotel le Parc Victor Hugo, in the 16th arrondissement, doesn't look much like a bistro, but it serves bistro-style food at bistro prices. It is owned by the hotel, but the chef was trained by Mr. Robuchon and uses his recipes. Later this year, Mr. Robuchon is to move Jamin, which is also in the 16th, along the Bois de Boulogne, to the building next to the hotel, which it also owns.
The two- and three-star restaurants did not feel the economic downturn at first, Mr. Rostang said. "We thought it was the gulf war. In 1992, we did the same business as '91, but '93 is a little bit less, maybe 3 percent."
The bistros have picked up the slack. They are not subsidizing their owners' temples of haute cuisine, but they are making a lot more money. "I absolutely did not know how much money could be made in a bistro," Mr. Savoy said. "A bistro returns 10 times more on the investment than a restaurant like this," he said, referring to his two-star dining room.
"Maybe when I'm 65 I will have six rotisseries and no Jacques Cagna," said Mr. Cagna, whose two rotisserie-bistros are making a lot of money. "If I do, I will become a businessman, but I want to be both a chef and a businessman. I need Jacques Cagna because this is my life."
Of the chefs interviewed, only Gerard Boyer at Les Crayeres, his three-star country-house hotel, said business had not decreased. But, he said, "clients who used to come 10 times a year, now come six."
He and his wife, Elyane, opened their first bistro in 1989. "My original idea was to have other clients at the bistro, but finally it is the same clients," he said.
Sitting in the fin-de-siecle garden room, recently added to the hotel, Mr. Boyer says he thinks the French are now interested in plainer cooking.
"Good chefs want to open bistros because clients want restaurants to go to for simple food," he said. "It is important to have bistros with our quality food."
That's stretching a point. Mr. Rostang has a more clear-eyed view. "It's not the same house," he said. "It's not the same service. The ambiance is very casual. No one would ever say that about his or anyone else's two- or three-star.
Much of the food in the bistros and bistrolike places is very good; some is plebeian. After all, these starred chefs are not doing the cooking themselves. They oversee the operations; they go by often and spend time there; they plan the menus and provide the recipes, and in many instances, whoever buys the food for the top-quality restaurant buys the food for the bistros as well.
Certain standards are never lowered. The products are always fresh. But no truffles, no foie gras, no lobster. And these chefs who strive for perfection cannot always let go. "It is not usual to make the ice cream, the bread and smoked salmon at a place like this," Mr. Cagna said, "but it is the habit of perfectionism. I cannot buy food made elsewhere."
Cooking bistro food requires more skill than cooking in a two-star, Mr. Rostang said. "It is very easy to make a very good dinner with truffles. It is more difficult when you have only potatoes."
But it is possible to find a superb piece of salmon topped with sesame seeds and polenta mixed with vegetables and cheese at Mr. Rostang's bistros; a fine cod with capers on a bed of cabbage and an excellent apple tart at Mr. Savoy's places; a zesty dish not unlike a caponata but made with tiny mushrooms instead of eggplant at Mr. Robuchon's sort-of-bistro; a beautifully dressed salad with buttery goat cheese at Mr. Boyer's bistros and a vacherin with mocha ice cream and caramel sauce at Mr. Cagna's rotisserie-bistros, a dessert for which you will happily breach your caloric boundaries.
And today, Americans can eat these dishes in a relatively smoke-free environment. All of the bistros visited had some sort of non-smoking section in response to a new law. It is here that most of the Americans were eating. Unwittingly, the French have found a way to separate the Americans from the natives.
Not long ago, many restaurants in France would refuse reservations to Americans after their "quota" had been filled. A few still do. "Fou," Mr. Boyer said of the practice. "Americans who travel in France know more about food and wine than French people who do not go to these restaurants. The American clientele is important."
The French are nothing if not practical. "Without foreigners, two out of three two- and three-star restaurants would be closed," Mr. Cagna said.
But still. The French cannot resist the last word. "After so many years of Julia Child, Americans have improved their taste," he said. "Fifteen or 20 years ago, I would say Americans have no taste. Now they know how to eat."

HEADLINE: What the Check Doesn't Tell About the Price of a Meal

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
IF dining out in the 1980's was mostly about big plates with small portions, in the 1990's the focus is on value. And when every dollar counts, it helps to know what you are buying. What costs are hidden under that slab of sirloin or among the strands of fettuccine?
Whether it's steak or pasta, paying for a meal in a restaurant involves much more than merely purchasing ingredients that have been cooked and arranged on a dish. Cooks have to grill the steak or boil the pasta, waiters have to serve it, and they all must be paid. 
 The customer also absorbs the cost of the linens and their laundering and occupies a chair and table in a location for which rent, taxes, insurance and other expenses must be paid. Are there candles on the table? They have to be replaced constantly. Some restaurants spend as much as $100,000 a year on flowers alone. Most fast-food chains may not provide tablecloths and flowers but they do have hefty advertising budgets.
From city to city restaurant prices are affected by variables like taxes, garbage removal and what the competition is charging, to name only a few. Comparing prices is more easily done with a restaurant group like the Palm, which has 12 restaurants in 10 cities, all but one of which have the same menu. Some of the ingredients for all 12 are purchased by the company's headquarters in Washington, and some are even shipped across the country.
A visitor to New York from Chicago who has a steak dinner at the Palm, either in that legendary former speak-easy's original sawdust-strewn location at 837 Second Avenue, near 45th Street, or across the street at Palm Too at 840 Second Avenue, will discover that the shrimp cocktail is $12 instead of the $7.50 it goes for in the Chicago branch. The filet mignon is $27, not $22.
"People are very price-conscious in Chicago, and our manager there knows what we have to charge to stay competitive," said Bruce Bozzi, the co-owner of the Palm Management Corporation. In the restaurant industry, the first consideration in setting prices is what the traffic will bear.
To keep prices in line in Chicago, the Palm puts four jumbo shrimp in the shrimp cocktail instead of the five served in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and East Hampton, L.I. And even though wholesale prices for shrimp and most of the other ingredients are the same in Chicago as they are in New York, the restaurant charges less per shrimp in Chicago because many of the other expenses there are lower than they are in New York.
New York is the most expensive restaurant city in the country, not only for the Palm, but also on an average basis. According to the Zagat Survey, a series of restaurant guides for 19 cities in which restaurants are rated by consumers, the average cost of a dinner in New York is $32.48, compared with $20.97 in Chicago.
Along with the cost of ingredients, which restaurants figure at roughly one-third of expenses, labor is the other big outlay for a restaurant.
"Our labor costs are highest in New York," Mr. Bozzi said. "We figure labor at around $8 per customer. That's nearly double what we pay in some other cities. Utilities are also high. It costs us $7,000 a month for garbage removal for the two restaurants. There are assorted other expenses in New York, like an annual compressor fee to run the refrigerators and air-conditioning, which we do not have in other cities."
For the Palm, each city presents its own set of circumstances that affect the right-hand column on the menu.
Some New Yorkers might not flinch at being charged $16 for broiled chicken. Elsewhere, even $12 might seem outrageous. At the Palm in Dallas the chicken is $10.50.
But New York's lobster price, $55 for four and a half pounds, is the lowest, on a per-pound basis, of any Palm, thanks to volume. The New York Palms each sell about 85 lobsters a day, twice as many as in any other city, mainly because, by tradition, they have no menus, and many customers think all the two restaurants serve is steak and lobster.
"Some of the old-time waiters just say, 'How many steaks, how many lobsters here?' so people don't realize we serve other dishes," Mr. Bozzi said.
The veal chop in Dallas is the cheaper rib cut instead of the loin served elsewhere, because that's what the Palm in Dallas has found that its customers prefer.
In some cities, like Philadelphia, Mr. Bozzi said, portions are smaller to keep the prices competitive.
In Manhattan, he said, the Palms' prices are a trifle lower than for other steak houses nearby.
"A customer has to put up with certain conditions we can't correct, like cramped quarters with no bar where they can wait," he said.
Factored into the price of steak at the Palm in Los Angeles is the cost of shipping the meat by air from New York, where it is dry-aged. In Miami the prices are fairly high because the Palm there does not serve lunch -- the location wouldn't sustain it -- so the total expense of running the restaurant must be absorbed during the evening.
Even though prices are lower at lunch than at dinner, restaurants can often make a better profit at noontime. The actual cost of the food people tend to eat at lunch these days, like salads and pasta, is less, but at the same time, the markup on these items is usually higher than for, say, lamb chops.
The sale of food accounts for about 80 percent of a restaurant's income nationwide. And the more costly the ingredients, as a percentage of the price on the menu, the lower the profit the restaurant makes. At the same time, when prime boneless sirloin is simply grilled instead of being dressed up with elaborate sauces, lower labor costs can offset the price of the raw materials.
Larry Levy, the chairman of Levy Restaurants, which has 22 varied restaurants in Chicago and four other cities, said value was the key element.
"You set prices by what things are worth -- what they cost is secondary," Mr. Levy said. "The atmosphere and the style of service are very important. A person getting something to eat at a ball park or a mid-price restaurant has a different set of expectations than someone going for dinner at Spiaggia."
Spiaggia is Levy's elegant Italian restaurant on Chicago's glittering Miracle Mile. It has higher prices than the company's other restaurants nearby because a larger staff is needed to maintain the quality of the food and the service, and also because the replacement cost of china and glassware is higher, and the linens and flowers are more expensive.
These days most restaurant owners are scrambling to find ways to cover their expenses without raising menu prices. In clinging to his very European, and to many, outmoded, $2.50 cover charge, Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque in Manhattan, said: "I don't want to prevent people from coming in here to have just a salad before the theater or a creme brulee after, but maintaining a table costs a certain amount. The cover charge generates enough to pay for laundering the linens."
With a couple of stiff drinks before lunch or dinner no longer the fashion, the amount of high-profit alcohol that restaurants sell has plummeted. Enter the costly cup of espresso or cappuccino, marked up as much 10 times cost, or the bottle of mineral water that costs $1 and is priced at $6. Whether it's the Palm or the local pizzeria, prices in a successful restaurant have to cover expenses and return a profit.
Last year, restaurant prices rose an average of 2 percent nationwide, the lowest increase recorded by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics since 1964. The wholesale cost of food declined by about 1.5 percent, but other expenses have escalated. Labor costs increased by 4.6 percent and are expected to rise 4.8 percent this year.
"The best way to keep prices as low as possible is to try to lower costs," Mr. Levy said. "In the 1970's and 80's when expenses went up we could pass it along to the customer. Today, like any good entrepreneur, you have to try to be more efficient."
Since the start of the recession, many restaurants have learned to adopt a leaner, more efficient management style.
"The customer has less money to spend," Mr. Levy said. "But we've managed to increase volume so we're not making less profit now."
Wendy Webster, the manager of media relations for the National Restaurant Association in Washington, said that after prices rose by 3.4 percent nationally in 1991, the association had projected they would climb by nearly 4 percent in 1992. "Boy were we wrong," she said. "There is a tremendous amount of consumer resistance to menu price increases."

Patriots Trying to Repair A Broken Northern Ireland

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Northern Ireland may not be at the top of many vacation itineraries these days, but in the minds of Glen Barr and Paddy Doherty, their city of Londonderry, rich in history and beauty, could be a grand tourist attraction. "Sons of Derry" conveys their vision. Unfortunately, few of their compatriots are in so accommodating a mood.
Glen and Paddy, as they are called in tonight's likable documentary, produced by two New York University professors, Terence Moran and Marcia Rock, are builders. Paddy has plans for rebuilding the mostly Roman Catholic inner city, with a view to attracting visitors. Glen is renovating buildings in the largely Protestant, upscale Waterside area, in hopes of keeping young couples from leaving. And both are trying to break down the religious, economic and political walls that keep the people of Northern Ireland divided. 
 "Sons of Derry" offers a quick but cogent account of three centuries of sectarian strife, which is still being nourished by parades, slogans and outbursts of assault and retribution. "Nobody owns the history," says Paddy, who dreams of "all those Americans coming over to find their heritage." Glen calls for a Bill of Rights modeled on the American Constitution, which he credits to Ulster Presbyterians like his forebears.
Adding to the age-old suspicion and animosity is high unemployment, twice as high for Catholics as for Protestants. Whatever their differences of heritage and affiliation, Glen and Paddy would rather concentrate on how much they have in common, notably their affection for Londonderry and their practical approach to problems. Both are teaching trades to young people and incidentally giving them an opportunity to meet one another in the flesh instead of in the demonologies of the paramilitary bands of both sides.
Tonight's program is too honest to raise expectations of peace and prosperity in their time, but what hope there is for Northern Ireland surely lies in people like Glen and Paddy, who are staking their lives on a livable future in the exasperating land they both cherish. There are glimmers of hope in the arrival of new businesses, but the old hates still run strong. As the narrator says, the stones of their much battered city "can be barriers or foundations."
It's Irish night on WNYC-TV. At 8 P.M., "McSorley's New York" offers a froth of social history served up by the owners and patrons of the city's oldest continuing saloon. A bitterer brew is on tap at 8:30 P.M. in "No Irish Need Apply," an account of the welcome Irish immigrants received from New York City in the 1860's.

HEADLINE: Daughters Already at Work, and Succeeding

 BODY:
Sandra Goeken Martis was never encouraged to go into any one of her father's start-up businesses: not MCI Communications, the computer network for the FTD floral service, Airfone or In-Flight Phone. Not that that stopped her.
"In the early days, I would have said he was the most sexist, male chauvinistic pig in the country," said Ms. Martis, 35, who charitably chalks it up to her father's desire to protect her from the unkind business world. 
 Recruited by one of her father's companies, the BTC Corporation, a telecommunications concern, she moved up largely because investors coaxed Mr. Goeken to make better use of his ambitious daughter's talents. "It was only after he saw how when the chips were down, I was always there to pick them up, that he changed his tune," said Ms. Martis, who calls her father Jack to avoid ruffling feathers.
Today, she runs the international half of In-Flight Phone while her father handles the domestic end -- and can barely contain his pride. "Over the years she's proved herself," Mr. Goeken said. "She's does things I wouldn't trust anyone else with."
 
ALEXANDRA LEBANTHAL AND JIM LEBENTHAL
 Alexandra Lebenthal, 29, the heir apparent to the municipal bond house by the same name in downtown Manhattan, has been accompanying her father, Jim, to work since she was 5.
 Her grandmother, Sayra, paid her 25 cents to reinforce the pages in binder notebooks. At age 11, Alexandra and her classmates pitched in at the peak of New York City's financial crisis to help her father figure out how many of the city's bonds were held by individuals.
"If the bonds were not honored, many people's life savings would be wiped out," said Jim Lebenthal, who is 64.
Though she initially considered becoming an actress, Alexandra, who has an older sister and a younger brother, said she was always most interested in the family business. Still is. "I was the only sibling who paid attention at the dinner table when the business was discussed and who worked at Lebenthal during the summers," Alexandra Lebenthal said.
After being graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in history, she joined Kidder, Peabody's municipal bond department.
 She moved to Lebenthal in 1988 -- a development her father considers quite fitting. Not only was the business started by her 94-year-old grandmother, but half of the sales force is women, unusual on Wall Street. Jim Lebenthal envisions a day when his middle child will be the Lebenthal in Lebenthal & Company.

HEADLINE: Cut New York's Un-Welcome Tax

 BODY:
The tax on an average hotel room in New York City is a staggering 21.25 percent. That's double the average for other big cities and, obviously, a crippling disadvantage for the Big Apple. Bills pending in the State Legislature would cut the tax to 16.25 percent. It would still be the nation's highest, but a lot more sensible than it is now.
An overnight stay in New York averages $113 and change -- plus tax. For that average room, the tax would be about $24. For a $200-plus room in one of mid-Manhattan's upscale hotels, the tax for just one night approaches $50! Might that make a tourist or a convention planner think twice about New York versus, say, New Orleans, where the tax is 11 percent? Of course it would, and does. 
 Statistical proof of lost business is hard to nail down, because one high tax isn't all that might discourage trips to New York. While the bright lights and bustle are a constant lure, for example, the crime, grime and high prices are not.
In any case, New York doesn't need another disincentive; the Convention and Visitors Bureau says that since 1990, when the state tax took effect, the city has lost 64 conventions with 228,000 participants who would have spent $133 million. However you add it, common sense says a tax this high is poor strategy for a city with a huge stake in people coming to do business or see the sights.
Politicians are partial to hotel occupancy taxes because the people who pay the tax are from somewhere else. But prohibitive hotel taxes can lengthen unemployment lines for the politicians' constituents whose jobs depend on out-of-towners.
New York City's hotel tax is actually six taxes, starting with the statewide 4 percent sales tax on goods and services, and the city's 4.25 percent on top of that. In 1980 the city imposed its first specific hotel tax -- $2 a night on rooms costing $40 or more. In 1986 it added a 5 percent occupancy tax on all rooms, and in 1990 another 1 percent. Finally, in 1990, the state enacted a 5 percent tax on rooms at $100 or more, for a total of 21.25 percent. Supposedly this last 5 percent was a statewide tax, but Albany knew it targeted New York City. Rolling back the state's last 5 percent grab would give New York a tax only a bit higher than its principal competitors for convention business. Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston charge 13 to 15 percent.
Like other distortive taxes, this one may cost more revenue than it produces by tamping down economic activity. The hotel industry and city officials insist that the state's 5 percent tax is a net loser, since the loss in income tax revenue because of reduced hotel traffic may be greater than what the tax brings in.
Clearly a tax exceeding 20 percent pushes the final cost of a room too high, but the hotels need one word of caution. Given their vigorous campaign to lower the tax, their credibility is on the line. Repeal of the state tax would only boost business if hotels hold their rates steady and let visitors have the benefit of the tax cut. The city's innkeepers have made a sound case for tax relief; their half of the bargain must be price restraint.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment, Key to New York City's Growth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With unemployment and business activity still a serious problem in New York City, questions have been raised as to why Mayor David N. Dinkins has over the past several months chosen to lead missions to Europe and Japan. 
 The answer quite simply is that foreign investment in New York City still ranks as one of the most important growth factors in the city's economy. Rather than being questioned, these overseas trips, which the New York City Partnership/New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry have helped organize, should be applauded.
The reality for New York City is that the 2,500 foreign-based companies in the city, which employ 200,000 people, are critical to our economic future. Foreign companies account for 7 percent of all private-sector jobs in the city. Between 1978 and 1991, foreign companies accounted for $60 billion worth of direct investment in businesses and property here. Add upwards of $3.5 billion a year spent by foreign visitors and one begins to see the importance of paying attention to our overseas neighbors.
The single largest source of foreign investment in New York City -- and also nationwide -- comes from Britain. British investments in New York are widely dispersed across various industries, with the majority of manufacturing interest split between publishing and chemicals. Indeed, Britain has 47 separate investments in publishing firms alone. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy also figure prominently.
Thus it made great sense for New York leaders to re-establish ties with European investors. The city's delegation made 280 business contacts in three European countries, with 26 firms now in serious negotiations toward a New York City presence.
Japanese investors have established the largest number of wholesale trading firms in New York City. Japan ranks second to Britain in the total number of financial-industry investments. Japanese also are active in manufacturing and transport service industries and have been the source of the largest number of real-property investments in the city.
In the case of this year's Japan trip, the Mayor and the business community followed a time-honored rule of commerce: Support a customer encountering a difficult period. Japan, like America, is slowly emerging from a recession, with exports, wages and profits in serious decline and overseas investments being questioned. This made it all the more important for the Mayor and his delegation to reassure Japanese executives of the value of investments in New York City.
I have learned in my travels over the years that there is no substitute for face-to-face meetings between economic partners. Just as the Mayor and New York business leaders have visited their counterparts overseas, so, too, should we welcome similar missions to New York from other countries. The mayors and governors of other cities and states have been conducting outreach and economic missions for decades. Foreign investors wishing to locate in the United States have ample choices. And the battle to attract foreign employers remains a fiercely competitive one.
The bottom line for the city is that foreign investment represents one of a very few areas where the prospects for economic growth are most promising.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment, Key to New York City's Growth;
Unlocking Japan Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his Op-Ed article "It's Clinton's Turn to Bargain With Japan" (April 15), Clyde Prestowitz identifies the composition of trade between the United States and Japan as the area of most concern in U.S.-Japan trade relations. He suggests that the best way to address this concern is for Japan to adhere to prior agreements to purchase more auto parts from U.S. firms. 
 This is the prescription for managed trade, and we think that's wrong. A recent project by the Wednesday Group (a Republican caucus in the House of Representatives, of which we are members) shows that efforts to increase market shares of American firms in Japan will fail until we resolve the basic problem in U.S.-Japan trade: the lack of foreign direct investment in Japan.
The evidence is strong that foreign direct investment increases a nation's level of imports. This is because as multinational corporations expand abroad they continue to purchase supplies from the firms they relied on at home. Since 1957, in fact, 65 percent of all American-manufactured exports have consisted of shipments from American parent firms to their majority-owned subsidiaries abroad. To the extent that American firms have "underinvested" in Japan, they lose a crucial export base, and a crucial entry into the world's second-largest market.
American firms are underinvested in Japan. U.S. firms hold the majority of all foreign direct investment in Japan, but its overall levels are much lower in Japan than in any other advanced nation. All foreign companies combined hold less than $25 billion in direct investment in Japan. By comparison, the U.S. hosts more than $150 billion of Japanese direct investment alone. The U.S., Britain and Germany all invest abroad between 1 and 2.2 times what they host in foreign direct investment. Japan invests abroad more than 20 times what it hosts. This glaring lack of direct investment means foreign firms are deprived of their most important base for selling finished products in the Japanese market.
One reason for this gross investment imbalance between Japan and the rest of the world is the stringent entry process that prevented most foreign direct investment until about 1980. Since the liberalization of the process, the Japanese Government's land and fiscal policies have encouraged a staggering run-up in real-estate prices. It was this "bubble" in land values that allowed Japanese firms to invest so heavily abroad during the 1980's. Furthermore, the high land prices caused by the "bubble" are the most important barrier to the increased investment of American firms in Japan.
The Clinton Administration seems preoccupied with tired old ideas like exchange rates and stimulus packages, or policies that will only hurt us in the long run -- like managed trade. The first issue it should address is the lack of American direct investment in Japan.

HEADLINE: 10 Years After a Scathing Report, Schools Show Uneven Progress

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
If ever the work of a blue-ribbon panel seemed destined to gather dust, it was "A Nation at Risk," the 65-page report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, released at the White House 10 years ago this week.
The panel was appointed by Education Secretary Terrel H. Bell, whose department President Ronald Reagan wanted to abolish. Mr. Reagan's initial endorsement of the report was lukewarm. And with the economy fitfully recovering from recession, there seemed little prospect that the public would want to spend more money on education. 
 But the grim language of the report -- which warned of "a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and as a people" -- caught the imagination of educators, lawmakers and governors. It set off a wave of efforts to improve schools that in one way or another has touched just about every public school system in every state.
In interviews this month, people involved in this loose, nationwide campaign have offered a mixed assessment of its results. While many schools have embraced some of the study's recommendations -- longer school years, tougher curriculums and stronger teacher training programs -- the effort has produced only minimal gains in achievement.
"Schools have been responding diligently over the last 10 years," said Mr. Bell, now an education consultant in Salt Lake City. "But the results have been disappointing. The problems have been deeper and tougher than we thought, and they go beyond the school doors."
 
More Schooling, Mixed Results
 "A Nation at Risk" has driven an effort to improve schools that has lasted much longer than a previous push begun in 1957, when a nationwide alarm was touched off by the Soviet Union's launching of its Sputnik satellite.
Forty-two states since 1983 have toughened high school graduation requirements, a third have strengthened teacher certification programs, and teacher salaries have jumped 22 percent over the rate of inflation, rising from $22,000 to a national average of $36,000.
But student scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test (formerly the Scholastic Aptitude Test) and other benchmarks, while no longer falling as they did in the 1980's, have not shown a significant turnaround in the 1990's.
The woeful results in some areas, however, have masked what educators call significant gains elsewhere. Twenty-seven percent of high schools, according to one study, have toughened their curriculums and are assigning more homework, two recommendations from "A Nation At Risk."
At Pershing High School in Detroit, for instance, math and science requirements have been doubled to 2 years in each subject. Emeral Crosby, the principal, says the report prodded the stiffer requirements.
"The report did have an impact," said Mr. Crosby, one of the 18 members of the commission. "A lot of kids at Pershing who wouldn't have taken advanced math or science courses a decade ago are enrolled in those classes now."
In addition, 40 percent of schools have lengthened their school years, according to a study by the Educational Testing Service, an education research firm. And 70 percent of high schools -- double the number 10 years ago -- have adopted policies that keeps failing students out of extracurricular activities. Forty-seven states have introduced improved testing programs for students, while 39 states have introduced some form of teacher evaluation, according to a study by the Education Commission of the States.
 
Little Attention For City Schools
 Some educators suggest that it is still too early to gauge the movement's success. Others say the effort has been hobbled by the increase of single-parent families, the rising numbers of children living in poverty and the gap between money available to rich schools and to poor ones.
And city schools have been shortchanged by the movement, experts say, even though they enroll 13.5 percent of the nation's 42.5 million public school students and 40 percent of the nation's black, Hispanic and poor children.
"By and large, the reform movement has totally bypassed the cities," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents the 43 largest urban school districts. "Cities have become so isolated racially, culturally and economically. And unfortunately most of the national leadership has either had an enormous sense of indifference or an overt hostility to the cities."
Although the dropout rate of black students has declined steadily over the last decade, the hemorrhaging continues: in 1991, 13.6 percent of blacks aged 16 to 24 were dropouts, nearly double that of whites in the same age group, while the Hispanic rate remained stubbornly high at 35.3 percent.
The negligible progress made by urban schools reflects what many educators concede are intractable problems that do not quickly respond to current solutions. For example, school-based management, in which central school departments give more control to teachers and parents, has had an uneven run in Chicago and in other cities.
As a result, urban schools have been forced to assemble their own programs to meet statewide requirements that were devised without taking into account the special problems of the inner cities. In Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania began a drop-out prevention plan for the city's schools, creating small enclaves of students within large high schools. More counseling and smaller class sizes also have been introduced in high schools that take part in the program.
Administrators like Joseph A. Fernandez, the departing Chancellor of the New York City Public Schools, is widely credited with pioneering some of the changes. When he was superintendent of the Dade County Public Schools, for example, Mr. Fernandez was among the urban administrators who recognized a need for better coordination of the delivery of services to students, not just in education but in health care and other social services.
"By and large, the improvement you have seen in urban schools is a creation of their own effort," said Mr. Casserly.
 
Recession Takes a Toll
 The recent recession forced states to cut budgets so severely that all schools have been dealing with a double burden: lower state aid and voters opposed to higher taxes. The district in Kalkaska, Mich., for instance, closed schools in March, two months early, because it ran out of money after voters rejected a tax increase. Other school systems have laid off teachers and eliminated extracurricular activities to conserve dwindling reserves.
"The competing resources for dollars is so dramatic now that I believe there has been an erosion of education dollars," said Katherine Keough, head of Xavier University's education department. "Health care, welfare, unemployment, jobs, infrastructure all are concrete and more visible. What goes on in the school is more difficult to identify." And thus, school finance experts say, more difficult to sell to voters deciding on tax increases.
Nonetheless, more spending overall has been poured into education, despite the recession. New Jersey, Nebraska and Oklahoma, for instance, have recently pushed through significant education spending bills, sometimes in the face of stiff voter opposition.
And the movement has attracted what many educators say is an unparalleled level of support from corporate America, which has lobbied for education legislation in statehouses, lobbied for strong job-skills programs and donated space for school buildings and equipment to ailing school systems.
 
The Future Of a Movement
 But progress is spotty, said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, the teachers union. "We see a lot of good things, but I still think we haven't found ways to translate these successes to all schools, all teachers, all kids," he said.
That has started to change slowly as the campaign enters its second decade. Early childhood education and health-care and drop-out prevention programs are more and more being fused into so-called one-stop shopping schools, particularly in inner-city schools.
As part of the coordinated effort -- increasingly orchestrated by the Federal Government -- Head Start and Chapter 1, a program intended to help poor students reach grade level in reading and math are scheduled to receive more money in President Clinton's budget for fiscal year 1994.
The Administration's education legislation, unveiled last week, also seeks to tie together the unconnected efforts by offering national standards and assessment guidelines for schools -- the first time any Federal legislation has tried to do that.
"What has happened over time is that the analysis has gotten better," said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. "Right now we are talking about the connection to health care and early childhood education."
But, he added, "Time is running out and, in the coming decade, our reform efforts simply must become more focused and more effective."

HEADLINE: Experts to Review Clinton Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
President Clinton has named 47 doctors, nurses and other medical experts to assess his plan to revamp the nation's health care system before he sends it to Congress this spring.
 The White House did not announce formation of the panel until Monday, but a member of the group said today that members held their first meeting two weeks ago. 
Doctors and other practitioners say Mr. Clinton has relied excessively on economists and academic theorists in developing his health policy. The appointment of outside reviewers may help the Administration overcome such doubts.
 Some doctors, at the American Medical Association and medical specialty groups, suggested today that members of the panel were predisposed to support Mr. Clinton's plan. But White House officials and members of the review group rejected that idea.
 
Osteopath Heads Panel
 Dr. Stephen C. Gleason, an osteopathic physician from Des Moines who was active in Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, is chairman of the new panel, known as the health professionals review group. Osteopathic medicine takes a holistic approach to care of patients, emphasizing the body's ability to heal itself.
 Dr. Arnold S. Relman, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, is a member of the review panel. He has harshly criticized the commercialization of medicine and has advocated strict limits on doctors' ownership of laboratories and other medical businesses.
 Pat Ford-Roegner, a former political director of the American Nurses Association, is vice chairwoman of the review panel. She has also worked at the Service Employees International Union, where she was responsible for health care and nursing issues.
 The vice chairman is Dr. Irwin E. Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, a foundation that supports mobile clinics for children in New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Mississippi, Florida and Texas.
 Dr. Redlener was chairman of the National Health Leadership Council, a group of 300 health professionals who supported Mr. Clinton's campaign last year. He said he worked briefly in March for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform.
 
'Independent Group'
 But Dr. Redlener insisted that the review panel would not "rubber-stamp" Mr. Clinton's proposals. "This is an extremely independent group," he said.
 Dr. Redlener said the panel held its first meeting two weeks ago and was supposed to complete its work this week, but that it might hold another meeting in mid-May.
 The American Medical Association and 26 other groups, representing psychiatrists, surgeons, pathologists and other specialists, outlined their concerns in a letter to Dr. Gleason. They called for changes in medical malpractice laws, and they urged Dr. Gleason to help reduce the burden of Federal regulations on doctors.
 Ira C. Magaziner, the manager of the task force, said today that he did not have a reliable estimate of the cost of the President's health-care plan. In a speech to the American Group Practice Association, he seemed to minimize the political difficulty of getting Congress to raise taxes to finance the President's proposals.
 
Options for Nursing Care
 Mr. Magaziner said Mr. Clinton still intended to make "a serious start" in expanding coverage of long-term care, including nursing homes and residential care.
 Confidential work papers from the task force show that the Administration is considering four options for a "long-term care initiative," ranging from modest changes in Medicaid to a new social insurance program costing more than $100 billion a year. The documents offer no suggestions about how to pay for the new benefits.
 In a memorandum in February, Mr. Magaziner said that guaranteeing universal access to health care "could mean $30 billion or $90 billion of additional annual expenditure by the Government by 1997." But now Administration officials say that some of the options proposed by Mrs. Clinton's task force would put the cost at more than $100 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Clinton's Plan for Economy May Hinge on His Popularity

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Despite some early setbacks and the worries expressed by some of President Clinton's top advisers, his economic plan, on which the ultimate success or failure of his Presidency could ride, has not been derailed by Congress.
But the overall package, with its steep tax increases, deficit reduction and huge shifts in spending away from the military and toward social programs and public works projects, is not -- as the White House maintains day after day -- completely on track either. 
 There are indeed bad signs for the President, many of them emphasized in some accounts of his first 100 days in office. The defeat of his emergency spending bill this month by a Republican filibuster in the Senate was one sign of potential pitfalls ahead. The almost certain rejection of his proposal for an investment tax credit for businesses is another.
 
Some Favorable Signs
 There are favorable signs as well: the nearly unanimous Democratic support in Congress for the general blueprint of the budget, and the fact that the legislation with all the tax measures and some of the toughest spending proposals will not be subject to a Republican filibuster.
In the final analysis, the outcome may depend less on the substance of the proposals than on Mr. Clinton's personal political standing this summer, a matter in which the economy plays only a part. An experienced legislative strategist on the staff of a leading Democratic Senator put it this way: "It's an absolute rule up here: popular Presidents get what they want; unpopular ones don't."
Mr. Clinton's popularity, as measured by opinion polls, has fallen recently. But his political history is one of quick plunges and surges in popularity. Where he stands now may bear little relationship to where he stands in July and August.
 
One Popular Tax
 Some of Mr. Clinton's proposals are viewed more favorably in Congress than others. The idea of higher income tax rates on the wealthy commands broad support. An investment tax credit has almost none. And some proposed tax increases on American companies that do business abroad will probably be dropped because the amount of revenue they would raise is not worth the political grief that goes with tackling the issue.
Other proposals like a new tax on fuel, a tax on more of the Social Security benefits of upper- and middle-income retirees and higher corporate tax rates fall somewhere in between. They are inherently unpopular, but a strong President might be able to muscle them through.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who has fought countless tax wars in the Senate, told reporters today that Congress had always made changes in tax bills and would surely do so this time. But he said he expected the main elements of the President's proposals to be enacted.
The prevailing view among lawmakers of both parties and lobbyists who work the Capitol corridors daily is that the House of Representatives will approve the Clinton economic package without critical changes. The Ways and Means Committee will begin drafting the tax portion, politically the most difficult part, next week, and the full House is expected to vote by Memorial Day.
But the Senate, which will not vote until July or even August, is a different matter. Its rules prevent a Republican filibuster like the one that killed the spending bill this month. Still, the Democratic margin in the Senate is so narrow and the President's support among Democratic Senators tenuous enough that his personal political strength at the time of the vote will be crucial.
That presumably is what Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's budget director, had in mind when he fretted aloud this week about the difficulty the Administration faced in winning Congressional approval of the economic plan at the same time it was asking for a new health-care system, the North American Free Trade Agreement and aid to Russia.
Each of those other matters, Mr. Panetta seemed to be saying, requires political muscle, and they might best be set aside for the time being so Mr. Clinton could devote all his clout to getting his economic package passed.
 
Health-Care Complications
 The health-care issue is seen as particularly vexing by the Clinton advisers focusing on budget questions. They believe the President will have to ask for new, unpopular taxes to pay for coverage for Americans with no health insurance.
These advisers, many with roots in Congress, contend that it is foolhardy to raise the question now, when the President is asking for other unpopular tax increases to shrink the budget deficit.
But the White House insisted again today that the health plan would be announced next month. At a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Clinton said, "I think what we're talking about is not a risk."
His spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, said the President "wants to go forward and thinks he can go forward and get both his economic and his health-care plans without any risk."
Mr. Clinton's prospects are much better in the House than in the Senate because of the big differences in the way the two houses operate.
In the House, Democrats can pass important legislation on their own. In the Senate, some Republican cooperation is essential.
In the House, amendments to tax bills are limited. In the Senate, almost any amendment is allowed.
Most Representatives see themselves as foot soldiers. Most Senators think of themselves as commanders.
In the end, of course, the differences between the House and Senate are resolved by a conference committee.
It is Mr. Clinton's good fortune that tax bills must originate in the House. And he is particularly fortunate that the chief originator nowadays is Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the skillful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and down-the-line Clinton advocate.
Today, Mr. Rostenkowski called all the Democrats on his committee together for a pep talk. On Thursday, he is taking them to the White House to meet with the President. Next week, they will begin writing the legislation, called a reconciliation bill, which will contain about 80 percent of the Federal budget: all the tax measures and spending for big-ticket items like Medicare, Social Security and welfare. The committee is committed to finishing its work by the middle of May.
Rank-and-file committee members said they had no doubt they would approve the basics of what Mr. Clinton wants. "We know we have to pass a bill out of committee, and it will essentially be the President's bill," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat.
 
Limit on Amendments
 The full House will vote under procedures that will allow few if any amendments. With three Democrats in the House for every two Republicans, passage, the Way and Means bill is almost certain to pass.
In the Senate, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, keeps referring to the fact that the Democratic majority on the Finance Committee, the Senate counterpart of the House Ways and Means Committee, is only 11 to 9. If the Republicans stick together, he says, they can probably count on a Democratic defection and get their way.
Democratic defections, in committee and in the Senate as a whole are commonplace. But what the party's leaders are counting on is the Senate's tradition of forming bipartisan coalitions.
The last time a tax measure so consequential was before Congress was seven years ago, when Republicans controlled the Senate. Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon was chairman of the Finance Committee, and he forged a coalition with Democrats like Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. The result was the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Senator Moynihan is now chairman, and he is counting on Senator Packwood and his allies to return the favor. His chances are far from certain. He will benefit from the fact that under Senate rules, debate on reconciliation bills is subject to a time limit, meaning a Republican filibuster is impossible.
And Mr. Moynihan will certainly have to rely on President Clinton to twist arms.

HEADLINE: Belgrade Denounces Sanctions; Calls for Meeting

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, April 28

 BODY:
The President of Yugoslavia today angrily denounced new economic sanctions imposed on his country and called for a multinational summit conference to resolve the "war of annihilation" in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"These are days of profound, epochal crisis," the President, Dobrica Cosic, said at a news conference. "The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is almost totally isolated, in what amounts to a concentration camp whose borders are patrolled by NATO planes and ships and by the world police." 
 The Yugoslav Army originally armed and organized Serbian fighters in Bosnia. Yugoslav leaders, including Mr. Cosic, have failed to persuade the Serbs to accept a peace plan drawn up by international mediators.
Today Mr. Cosic said he still believed that Bosnian Serbs "will find the strength and the ways and means to accept the plan, which is something we will continue to insist on."
As he spoke, sporadic fighting continued on several fronts in Bosnia. United Nations spokesmen reported fighting between Muslim and Croatian forces near Sarajevo, and between Muslims and Serbs near Srebrenica. There were also several clashes near Bihac, a Muslim-controlled city that was attacked by Serbs on Tuesday.
Bosnian Serbs told the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees today that they would not permit the transport of any relief supplies to another Muslim-held town, Gorazde, for at least two weeks because of dangerous conditions in the area. There are an estimated 60,000 people in Gorazde.
Preparations for possible bombing raids against Serbian targets, either in Bosnia or in Serbia itself, intensified in European capitals. Newspapers in Britain and France reported that those countries were preparing planes and pilots. In Spain the Defense Minister, Julian Garcia Vargas, announced that the Western European Union was opening a satellite center near Madrid that could pinpoint targets for air raids.
Asked about the prospect that bombing could soon begin, Mr. Cosic replied, "I still cannot believe that such a senseless act could occur."
In an interview after his news conference, Mr. Cosic said a new international conference was the best way to inject "new ideas and new methods" into the search for peace. He proposed that participants include the United Nations Secretary General, the United Nations and European Community mediators who drafted the peace plan, the leaders of the three factions fighting in Bosnia (including the Government) and the heads of state from 11 countries: Yugoslavia, Croatia, the five permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain) and India, Egypt, Brazil and Zimbabwe.
Mr. Cosic said he would send letters on Thursday to all the parties, asking them to convene a meeting as soon as possible. "If heads of state are willing to declare war, carry out military intervention, bring the NATO fleet into the Adriatic and take other difficult and costly steps, they should be ready to meet to talk peace," he said. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Another Rebuke for Yugoslavia
 UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Security Council recommended to the General Assembly today that Yugoslavia be dropped from the Economic and Social Council, the body that coordinates and directs most of the economic, educational, cultural and health-related activities of the United Nations.
The vote was 13 to 0, with China and Russia abstaining. The 181-member General Assembly is expected to adopt the measure as early as Thursday.
Yugoslavia's deputy representative to the United Nations, Dragomir Djokic, called the action "legally and politically unacceptable." Mr. Djokic said that "Yugoslavia is not a party to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina" and that it is working to end the fighting.
In September, the General Assembly concluded that the present Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was not entitled to the United Nations membership held by the former six-republic Yugoslav federation and would have to reapply.

HEADLINE: Parents in Bronx District Urge Voter Turnout as a Way to Improve Schools

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Every day for the last few weeks, Mildred Bonilla and a gaggle of black and Hispanic parents have hit the streets of the South Bronx in a campaign they call Mothers on the Move.
Armed with fliers and petitions, interrupting afternoon naps and lunches, they are telling parents that the coming school board elections are their best chance to challenge a political system that they say has left the schoolchildren of their hard-pressed neighborhood shortchanged. 
 The group's members are not running themselves running for election. Nor are they formally supporting a specific slate of candidates in the election on May 4. But in a district that has seen little change on the school board -- and little voter interest -- in recent years, they represent an unusual bit of grass-roots activism. Their hope, they say, is that greater turnout in the South Bronx will insure that attention be paid to improving their schools.
"People have already seen our faces 100,000 times," said Ms. Bonilla, as she strode briskly down a corridor the other day with two parents close on her heels. "We feel like we're not getting an equal share. It's time to put in people with a new vision."
 
Condoms a Distraction
 From the mean streets of the South Bronx to the more prosperous neighborhoods in the borough's northeast, Community School District 8 has a collection of schools that seem to illuminate the best and the worst that New York City has to offer. And the central issue of the campaign there -- how to share the school system's scarce resources -- is one being debated in economically diverse districts throughout the city, from Jamaica and Forest Hills in Queens to Canarsie and Flatbush in Brooklyn.
For several candidates and the South Bronx parents as well, the fervent arguments over condoms and the Rainbow Curriculum that have defined so much of the citywide election debate are mere distractions.
A far larger issue, they say, is that many children in the poorer parts of the district are being taught by inexperienced teachers, with chronic shortages of supplies, in crumbling buildings. And they point to a local school board in which five of the nine members are from the Throgs Neck area, where the district's only major school construction project in the last three years -- a $10 million, 300-seat addition to Public School 72 -- is being erected.
"We need more school board members from the southern end of the district who can make sure there is an equitable distribution of resources," said Sandra Love, a board candidate and a health-care administrator from the South Bronx. "It's a critical issue for District 8."
 
Analysis Shows Discrepancies
 The teachers union agrees.
"In all of these districts, there are tensions about the inequitable distribution of resources," said Susan Amlung, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers. "Certainly by all appearances, there is a division in the district between these two ends of Throgs Neck and Hunts Point. It's something that we have been complaining about."
But some incumbent board members and school officials insist that appearances are not entirely what they seem. An analysis of district records shows that the schools in the north, with a significant number of white students, indeed have fewer inexperienced and uncertified teachers, and the school conditions there are somewhat better.
But those schools also have larger class sizes and receive the same or less money for each pupil than do other schools in the district.
Basic spending for each pupil was on average $200 or so lower in the 4 of 27 schools in the northern area, which all have higher white populations, the analysis shows. When Federal funds intended for schools in impoverished neighborhoods are included, the figure is $583 less.
And while the schools in the better-off neighborhoods consistently have scored better on math and reading tests than the rest of the district, mirroring a common trend among middle class students, there are also pockets of high achievement in some of the poorer, southern schools.
According to Rose Foley, an incumbent board member from Throgs Neck, the arguments of inequity is "a terrible rumor." She adds: "It's become, I hate to say it, almost a racial issue when it shouldn't be."
 
'Color Means Nothing'
 "Color and gender make no difference to me," she said at a recent candidates' forum.
Other candidates insist that racial equity is indeed an issue.
"It's a big issue for black and Hispanic candidates," said Virginia Senai Daniels, an incumbent board member who lives in the southeastern Bronx. "When I speak of equity, I'm dealing with the quality of teachers in the schools."
Dennis Coleman, the president of the New York City School Boards Association and a 23-year veteran of the District 8 board, shares the sentiment. Mr. Coleman, who lives in the East Bronx, said voters in the northern part of the district had voted in a bloc to elect candidates representing their interests. He said it was time for voters in the south to do the same.
 
Bringing Encouragement
 Mr. Coleman said the schools needing the most help were neglected and he put much of the blame on the longtime superintendent, Max Messer, who he said caters to the members from the Throgs Neck area. "The whole system stinks," he said.
Mr. Messer's contract expires in June 1994, and Mr. Coleman opposes its renewal. The superintendent did not return telephone calls.
Mr. Coleman, for one, takes heart in the efforts of South Bronx parents to shake up the school district. "Parents have begun to wake up," he said.
The parents' group, which has about 15 members, most of them mothers, was spawned one year ago from adult literacy classes at the Bronx Educational Services, a nonprofit social service organization located in an old school building on bustling Longwood Avenue. The parents were all products of New York City schools and began to ask why they had not learned to read or write.
Their questions led to forming of the Parents Organizing and Education Project: Mothers on the Move.
Since last year, the parents have organized workshops on leadership development and parental involvement. They have sponsored forums attended by school board members. More than 50 parents demonstrated at the district office, urging that more attention to paid to their schools.
 
An Electoral Challenge
 Ms. Bonilla, a coordinator of the group, is currently challenging the right of two board membersfrom Throgs Neck to be on the ballot.
Ms. Bonilla had succeeded in getting the candidates knocked off the ballot when she determined that many of the signatures on their nominating petitions were from non-registered voters. But a few days later, the names were returned to the ballot by the Board of Election commissioners.
When she complained, the executive director of the Board of Elections, Daniel DeFrancesco, said, in a letter on April 14, that while the commissioners appeared to have used incorrect information in restoring the names, the deadline for "judicial intervention has expired."
The Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating Ms. Bonilla's charge. The candidates, Steven Eskow and Ciro Guerra, did not return a reporter's telephone calls.
As the parents canvass the streets every day, they are often met with questions that remind them of the daunting nature of their task.
"Is this the election for the schools chancellor or something?" said one mother, Vivian Jenkins, upon opening her door.
The mother, whose 11-year-old daughter attends Intermediate School 52, said sheepishly that she did not know who was running for office. Ms. Bonilla patiently explained the election, and the value of participating. The mother signed a pledge to vote, one of about 200 to do so.
Down the hall, April O'Toole, toting a thick bundle of leaflets, rapped on another door. When there was no answer, she moved quickly down the hall. Ms. O'Toole, 31, mother of a 9-year-old in Public School 62, said her enthusiasm was fueled by frustration with the schools.
"It's important," she said. "A majority of the school board has been there too long. We need money for resources, books, supplies, all kinds of different things. How can a teacher teach without that?"

The current board is controlled by the Parent Community Coalition, which believes that the social problems of the inner city require new methods of teaching. The other group represented is the educationally traditional Grand Street Slate, supported by the Orthodox Jewish community. This year, though, there is a new group -- United Parents Neighborhood Slate -- that generally agrees with the Community Coalition, but opposes the use of the Rainbow Curriculum.

District 2
19,757 students -- 33.4 percent Asian, 28.2 percent white, 23 percent Hispanic, 15.3 percent black.
Reading: Elementary, 57.1 percent at or above grade level (4th); intermediate, 59.8 percent (7th).
Math: Elementary: 76 percent (4th); intermediate, 70.7 precent (4th).
Other key statistics: One of the wealthiest districts in the city.
District 2, a diverse area that includes most of lower Manhattan, midtown and the Upper East Side, is the scene of one of the bitterest campaigns in the city. The campaign revolves around the district superintendent -- Anthony Alvarado, a former Schools Chancellor who was ousted because of financial irregularities. In District 2, he is considered an innovative leader by his supporters and a poor and overly nontraditional administrator by his detractors, who want to terminate his contract. The race also includes two of the five openly gay candidates running around the city -- Jon Nalley and Robert Ryger.

District 3:
14,868 students -- 47.3 percent black, 39 percent Hispanic, 11.5 percent white, 2 percent Asian.
Reading: 35.8 percent at or above grade level (21st); intermediate, 42.3 percent (21st).
Math: 55.6 percent (21st); intermediate, 49.3 (15th).
Other key statistics: 3d in percentage of not-yet-certified elementary school teachers (11 percent).
Historically, District 3 has struggled to bridge the gap between the largely middle-class Upper West Side and the poorer areas of Manhattan Valley and lower Harlem. All 15 candidates running for the board this year agree about the need to insure equity for all children and fair distribution of resources. However, some candidates support pairing schools in the southern and northern ends of the district, which they say would force schools to share resources as well as the burden for improving student performance.

Reading: Elementary, 35.1 percent at or above grade level (22d); intermediate, 43.1 (19th).
Math: Elementary, 51.9 percent (23d); intermediate, 40.6 percent (24th).
Other key statistics: elementary schools have 2d-smallest class size; intermediae schools, the smallest.
District 4, which covers East Harlem, has what are regarded as some of the most innovative programs in the city, including school choice and special mini-schools -- small schools with an unusual level of parent involvement.
The board race, which includes 16 candidates and one write-in candidate, is relatively quiet, with few divisive issues. Candidates have expressed concern about safety in the areas around the schools, the need for more after-school programs and the effort to involve more parents in school programs.

Reading: Elementary, 27.8 precent at or above grade level (30th); 31.3 percent (28th).
Math: Elementary, 45.4 (29th); intermediate, 35.2 percent (28th).
Other key statistics: Elementary schools ranked last in attendance (85.9 percent); intermediate schools ranked 3d to last.
The election in District 5, which encompasses central Harlem, has attracted a number of community activists who are not usually involved in school board politics. Because of the district's poor results in the standardized reading and math tests, many parents and community leaders have focused their attention on this election as a chance to take control of the board and the schools.
Two slates have formed in the group of 18 candidates. One is made up mostly of incumbents, who say the budget decisions of the central Board of Education are to blame for many of the district's problems. The other slate, called Whose Children? Our Children, is supported both by the liberal SchoolPAC organization and by Quality Candidates for Community Empowerment, a group led by the Rev. Al Sharpton.

Math: Elementary, 50.8 percent (28th); intermediate, 48.3 percent (17th). Other key statistics: Most crowded district in the city.
District 6 -- Inwood and Washington Heights -- has a number of heavily overcrowded and some substandard buildings. It also has one of the fastest growing populations of children in the city, made up mostly of Dominican immigrants, and the Dominican influence in the district has become one of the central issues in the campaign.
A group of Dominican candidates are pushing for more parental participation and for more after-school programs, while others contend that battles over Dominican representation have prevented the board from creating programs to help all the students in the district.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Ask White House for Broad Range of Help

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
The chief executives of the Big Three auto makers asked top Administration officials today for help on a broad range of issues including international trade, regulations, technology and health insurance.
John F. Smith Jr. of General Motors, Harold A. Poling of Ford Motor and Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler urged the joint development of a comprehensive plan to help the auto industry regain its global preeminence. 
 In a joint statement after the meeting, the executives said: "We urged Government leaders to move forward on a full range of issues vital to the success of the domestic auto industry, including health care, international trade and technology projects. Our shared goals are a strong competitive domestic industry and economic recovery which has job creation as its centerpiece."
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who helped set up the meeting, said in an interview: "We've never had any kind of Government strategy. We're now moving toward a comprehensive plan rather than a piecemeal approach."
Mr. Levin said he had proposed legislation to create a commission to study the auto industry's problems, similar to one that will study the problems of the airline industry.
Today's meeting was suggested and led by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and also attended by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Also present were representatives of the Defense, Treasury, Transportation, Energy, State, Health and Human Services Departments and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation and the office of the United States trade representative.
The meeting was the second in a series with industry executives. Aerospace industry executives attended the first session three weeks ago.
On international trade, auto executives have asked for reclassification of mini-vans and sport utility vehicles as light trucks for customs purposes, instead of as cars. This would raise the tariffs on these vehicles to 25 percent from 2.5 percent.
On regulation, General Motors has indignantly resisted a Government proposal to recall 4.7 million pickup trucks with side-mounted gasoline tanks. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, which seeks the recall, said those trucks were especially vulnerable to fatal fires when hit on the side. G.M. contends that the trucks are safe.
John Guiniven, a Chrysler spokesman, said that the meeting was a continuation of a dialogue begun during the Presidential campaign.
"We share a common goal with the Administration: a competitive domestic industry," he said.
The auto executives were especially heartened by the Administration's comprehensive approach to the industry's woes. "It looks like in this Administration, the left hand is going to know what the right hand is doing," Mr. Guiniven said.

HEADLINE: Gold's Modest Ascent

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Gold is rallying. Gold traders are busy. Gold analysts are smiling and predicting higher prices -- yes, higher prices.
That is quite a change for gold, which was banished to the minor leagues in the mid-1980's after enjoying major league status in the 1970's and especially in 1980, when prices hit $850 an ounce. Every rally has been quashed as the price moved relentlessly lower, slumping to $326.90 on March 10, its lowest level in more than eight years. 
 This time, prices appear to be rising because of fundamental changes in supply and demand that have been lacking in past rallies. Inflation fears, however, which have pushed up the price of gold in the past, are not a major driving force in the West but could be stimulating the buying seen in China. Whatever the cause, analysts say, the support is not there to take gold to lofty new price levels.
The price of gold on the Commodity Exchange in New York has jumped more than 8 percent, or $27.50 an ounce, from its year low to its highest level since last August. Almost half that increase has come in the last four trading days and that is what is grabbing the attention. On the Commodity Exchange, gold was up $2.30 to $354.40 yesterday.
Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse, is saying things he has not uttered for years. "I am seeing a very dynamic turnaround," he said. "The bear market has ended."
But this is still, at best, a late-inning rally in a minor league park. Mr. MacDonald's predictions, which are in line with those of several other gold analysts, put the price of gold up an additional 7 percent by the end of the year. "Realistically, there is nothing that says we cannot go to $380, easily," he said.
That means that half the rally is past. And even at that level, the price would still be well below the $427 that gold hit early in 1990. As of now, Mr. MacDonald and others are not talking of returning to those levels soon.
"I can only go by how it looks now and it looks decent," a gold trader said, asking that his opinion remain anonymous. But he added that gold had hurt a lot of people before.
 
Two Big Gold Deals
 The rally still means a lot for traders, who thrive on price movements. And for investors like Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, and George Soros, a renowned fund manager and speculator, it could mean large profits. The two completed a deal last week under which funds managed by Mr. Soros would buy a 10 percent stake in the Newmont Mining Company, which Sir James controls. He used proceeds from the sale to buy options on gold.
The rumor of the buying of options on Friday, the report of the sale on Monday and, possibly, Mr. Soros's appearance on Cable News Network's "Business Day" morning program all contributed to gold's rise. Some traders said they jumped in because they believed Mr. Soros and Mr. Goldsmith might know something they did not.
At the least, by publicly disclosing their investment, Mr. Soros and Mr. Goldsmith have certainly increased their own paper profits, for now. Mr. Soros was unavailable and executives with his fund management firm declined to comment.
The other factors in the rally are the reports of heavy buying of gold in Asia, especially in China, where many Chinese are reaping the benefits of the opening of the economy and are buying gold because they lack options for investing. According to some estimates, the Chinese could buy 1,000 metric tons of gold this year, which is more than South Africa and the United States produce.
 
A Technical Reason
 From a technical view, which is also important in the market, buying was also set off when gold passed $343 dollars an ounce last Thursday, which pushed the price above the line of a 13-year downtrend.
Joseph Rosta, the research director at CPM Group, a precious metals consulting group, said money was flowing into gold because some investors had decided that the bond and stock markets had topped out. He also argued that investors have chosen "to take a fresh look" at gold, in part because prices have fallen so low.
One reason for the slump in the price of gold in the 1980's was an oversupply caused by overproduction and large sales by Russia and others. But there have been recent signs that this supply glut is beginning to turn. Gold Field Mineral Services, which compiles the industry's most detailed report on gold each year, recorded a decline in supply in its 1992 report. The Russians said yesterday that their mine production dropped 8.5 percent last year, to 129.5 million metric tons. In addition, the Government said that production fell by six million metric tons in the first quarter of 1993.
Mr. MacDonald and others have also cited the expectation of a slowdown in gold sales by central banks.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tries to Calm Japan Over Role in Yen Price

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
A day before the Group of Seven's finance ministers gather in Washington, American officials sought today to ease Japanese anger over the value of the yen, repeating that they wanted to avoid exchange-rate volatility.
Japanese officials have complained that remarks by President Clinton and other American officials have pushed the yen to a record level against the dollar, which they fear will make their exports expensive and hurt their ailing economy. 
 American Treasury officials have made clear that they will keep the heat on Japan about its big trade surplus. Still, they had sought to comfort Tokyo on Tuesday, when they asked the Federal Reserve to intervene by buying dollars to stop the yen from soaring further.
The Fed did intervene, and also on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that attempts to "artificially influence" exchange rates were inappropriate. The dollar then rebounded from its record low against the yen.
At a news briefing today, Mr. Bentsen said he thought that "things went well" in reaction to that remark, adding that Japan's Finance Minister, Yoshiro Hayashi, was pleased with the statement. "What we wanted to see," Mr. Bentsen said, "was a further stabilization of the situation. Excessive volatility at the currency exchanges has a tendency to hurt growth."
 
Aid for the Russians
 The Secretary also pressed Japan to provide more aid to Russia, saying that with a strong budget position, it was in a good position to do so. "Hopefully, we are going to see more than we have heard thus far" from Japan, he said.
Mr. Bentsen said aid to Moscow would be one of the main topics at Thursday's session of the leading industrial nations that meet regularly as the Group of Seven. The United States has pledged $1.8 billion in aid in addition to the $1.6 billion that Mr. Clinton promised during his meetings early this month in Vancouver with Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin.
Tokyo has promised $1.8 billion, but American officials have criticized this, saying that only $320 million is direct aid with the rest in the form of loan guarantees.
Mr. Bentsen, asked why he chose to make his currency remarks on Tuesday, said he did so because the Group of Seven meeting was coming up. Finance ministers are often eager to calm currency markets before such meetings because markets can become especially volatile at such times unless existing tensions have been defused.
Economists and currency traders said the Treasury asked the Fed to intervene not just to soothe the Japanese, but also because it was worried that the dollar's plunge was roiling credit markets and pushing up interest rates on Treasury bonds.
"The interest-rate decline is about the only stimulus package the Administration has," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group. "If that reversed on them, they would really be in the soup."
 
Arguments to Clinton
 Administration officials have made the point to Mr. Clinton that a strong yen is an important tool to help reduce Japan's $49 billion trade surplus because it makes Japanese exports more expensive and American goods cheaper in Japan.
A strong yen, though, presumably stirs some ambivalence within the Administration, and not just because it helps feed inflation. "A stronger yen sets up a conflict inside the Treasury," said Scott E. Pardee, a former senior Federal Reserve staff official who is chairman of Yamaichi International America. "The Treasury is responsible for managing the nation's debt, and some people from the debt-management side said this is not a good policy because they saw it pushing up rates."
Japanese officials have also expressed frustration recently toward suggestions from the Clinton Administration that their Government's $116 billion economic-stimulus package is not large enough, and also that its value might be exaggerated.
In his remarks today, Mr. Bentsen praised Tokyo's stimulus package, saying it would help spur growth both at home and around the world. Nonetheless, he said, the Japanese should pursue additional economic-stimulation programs in the future so that "they can get more consumption in Japan and therefore help provide a better market for our products and in turn hopefully cut the deficit in trade that we have with them."
Administration officials have denied that they had any target for the exchange value of the yen. But the sense among many currency traders is that Washington regarded 110 yen to the dollar as a convenient floor, at least for now, and moved to intervene once the dollar fell to that level.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford First-Quarter Profit Is Better than Expected

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 28

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company reported improved first-quarter earnings today, far exceeding analysts' estimates, but still short of what the auto maker said it would deem acceptable.
That was the sort of talk investors loved to hear, and Ford shares rose $1.875, to $54.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. More than three million shares traded hands. 
 Ford reported income of $572 million, or $1.02 a common share, compared with a profit of $223 million, or 36 cents a share, for the comparable period a year ago. Automotive analysts had projected earnings of 59 cents a share for the first quarter of this year. Earnings in the first quarter of 1992 involved a restatement to account for retiree health benefits, which created a loss of $6.7 billion.
Revenue for the period was $26.76 billion, up 9 percent from $24.56 billion in the first quarter of 1992. David N. McCammon, the vice president for finance, said Ford would like to achieve a 5 percent after-tax return on revenue. The current return is about 2 percent.
Last week the Chrysler Corporation reported stronger than expected earnings. The General Motors Corporation is scheduled to report its earnings on Friday.
 
'Intense Competition'
 Harold A. Poling, the chairman of Ford, said the nation's economic recovery was slow and that global economies had remained weak. Worldwide, Ford was also contending with "intense competition and excess industry capacity, all of which make achievement of improved financial results more difficult," he said.
Analysts had underestimated the profit gains of the financial services subsidiaries of the auto maker: the Ford Motor Credit Company; the Associates, and the First Nationwide Bank. Lower loan losses and higher net interest margins helped the financial-services units increase earnings to $396 million in the first quarter, compared with $249 million in the comparable period a year ago, excluding the cumulative effects of the accounting changes. With those changes, net income for the first quarter of last year was $460 million.
Analysts also did not expect as much of an improvement as was reported by the European operations of Ford, which still lost about $100 million in the quarter. "Ford's restructuring in Europe benefited more than I guessed," said Ron Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco.
Worldwide automotive earnings were $176 million, compared with a loss of $26 million for the comparable period a year ago. In the United States, automotive earnings were $113 million, compared with a loss of $59 million in the first quarter of 1992.
Analysts seemed heartened by narrowed losses at Jaguar, the troubled British subsidiary of Ford. The first-quarter operating loss at Jaguar was $55 million, compared with an operating loss of about $100 million in the comparable period a year ago.
Mr. McCammon said deteriorating economic conditions in Europe had led Ford to withdraw its prediction that it would break even in Europe for the year. The auto maker lowered its annual sales projection to 13.1 million vehicles, from 13.7 million. In the United States, Ford is projecting sales of 13.5 million vehicles. It considers sales of 15.5 million vehicles to be a normal year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Despite a well-received Treasury auction, bond investors yesterday continued to demonstrate doubts about the Clinton Adminstration's ability to make significant cuts in the Federal deficit.
Unexpectedly strong demand at the Treasury's sale of five-year notes helped lift secondary market bond prices off their lows. But the key long bond posted a modest loss while short- and intermediate-term securities rose only slightly. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond lost 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.91 percent from late Tuesday's 6.90 percent.
It was the bond's highest yield in about three weeks and reflected bearish sentiment that has confined trading to a narrow price range recently.
The bond market's rally had come largely because of prospects for a lower Federal budget deficit, which would reduce the number of bonds issued by the Government to cover the debt.
But Leon Panetta, Clinton's budget director, was quoted in several newspapers Tuesday as saying he had become increasingly discouraged about the outlook for passage of the deficit-reduction plan.
Andy Brenner, a bond trader at Nomura Securities International Inc., said the market was concerned about the "credibility of the current adminstration in getting their act together. There seems to be a lot of indecision in Clinton's own cabinet."
Despite that bearishness, the Treasury sold more than $11 billion in five-year notes at a lower-than-expected high yield of 5.18 percent. Demonstrating the brisk demand, the bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of Treasury auction demand that compares the number of bids offered to those accepted, was 3.09-to-1, up from an average of 2.4-to-1 in the seven previous auctions.
Participants said the strong demand came partly because the market was coming off Tuesday's poorly received offering of two-year Treasury notes. This helped lift yields higher and made bonds more attractive across the board.
 
Debt Management Study
 John Canavan, an analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said the market remained nervous ahead of the Treasury's debt management study and its refunding announcement due out next week, which should give more definite indications of how the Treasury plans to pare its issuance of longer-term bonds.
Short-term Treasuries were 1/32 point to 1/16 point higher and intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1/32 point higher, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.42, to 1,294.38.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.96 percent as the discount rose .01 percentage point to 2.91 percent. Six-month yields fell to 3.07 percent as the discount fell .02 point, to 2.99 percent. One-year yields held at 3.24 percent with the discount at 3.13 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10025/32 , down 1/16 from late Tuesday. The average yield to maturity edged up to 5.97 percent from 5.96 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:

Dollar Rides on Momentum To Slight Gain Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar eked out another gain against the Japanese yen yesterday, riding on momentum from Tuesday when the Federal Reserve intervened to halt the currency's slide.
But dollar buyers began to lose enthusiasm as they looked toward today's meeting of the Group of Seven nations, where finance officials are expected to discuss exchange rates. 
 The dollar slipped against the German mark and was mixed against other European currencies, although Germany and other European nations cut key short-term interest rates.
The dollar has risen by about three yen since the Fed's intervention Tuesday lifted it from a postwar low of 109.15 yen in New York. But the attempt to slow the dollar's 12 percent plunge this year seemed to falter yesterday.
The dollar rose to a high of 112.50 yen in New York before falling back amid reports of strong selling interest at the 113-yen level. It settled at 112.12 yen from late Tuesday's 111.70 yen.
Earlier yesterday in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 111.88 yen, up 1.40 yen from Tuesday's close. In London, the dollar rose to 112.25 yen.
 
Waiting on Japanese Holidays
 Many traders refrained from major moves ahead of Golden Week in Japan, a seven-day span beginning today that includes four national holidays.
"We're not really seeing much evidence of anyone really positioning for an immediate surge in the dollar," said Ronald Leven, a global currency analyst at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
"The general attitude seems to be that the central banks are trying to slow and control the descent of the dollar, but are not prepared to defend a particular level."
The dollar slipped against the German mark despite a steeper-than-expected cut in the Germany Bundesbank's securities repurchase rate and cuts by Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands in key short-term rates. The move was traced to heavy cross-trading, in which traders sold yen and bought marks.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5720, from $1.5770 late Tuesday. By 4 P.M. in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.5730, more than late Tuesday's $1.5775.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Big Three may get a Clinton goodie, but perhaps not on trade.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"I WAS astonished that the Bush Administration overruled its own Customs Office and gave a $300 million-a-year freebie to the Japanese for no apparent reason," President Clinton told reporters at his first news conference. "And we got nothing, and I emphasize nothing, in return."
The words were Mozart to the ears of Big Three auto executives, who want Uncle Sam to classify imported mini-vans and sporty, four-wheel-drive vehicles as light trucks -- and thus require importers to fork over a 25 percent tariff. But the message sounded more like chalk on a blackboard to the President's economic advisers, who know that Americans did indeed get something -- mini-vans and sport utility vehicles from both America and Japan for thousands of dollars less than they would otherwise have had to pay. 
 Mr. Clinton's economists have thus been happy to duck the issue since candidate Clinton wooed Michigan with a promise to play hardball with the Japanese. At an interagency meeting last Friday, they reiterated their "general agreement" that "there is no trade justification for the reclassification." But the group was pressed by Rahm Emanuel, a White House political operative, to come up with something very quickly. A good guess now is that it will recommend something unrelated that Detroit covets -- perhaps on technology subsidies or a break on fuel economy standards.
The origin of this tale lies in a spat over chickens with the European Common Market in the 1960's. To retaliate for discriminating against American poultry, Washington put a 25 percent tariff on imported light trucks -- then, mostly Volkswagens.
The bird brouhaha is long forgotten (as are Volkswagen's trucks), but the 25 percent tariff on light trucks lingers. And when two new sorts of multipurpose vehicles came into vogue in the 1980's, Detroit saw an opportunity to protect its markets by demanding "harmonization" in the way the vehicles were regulated.
For purposes of safety and exhaust emissions, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles are classified as light trucks -- a decision, incidentally, that serves the Big Three's interests as well as Tokyo's. Thus in the view of Ford, G.M. and Chrysler, all those swank Mazda MPV's, shown in the ads full of tots on their way to Playorama, were really trucks. So were the Toyota 4-Runners, which always seem to be carting skiers off to their condos.
The Bush Administration squirmed, then settled on the Solomonic compromise. Mini-vans would remain cars for tariff purposes, as would four-door sport utility vehicles; two-door sport utility vehicles would be reclassified as trucks.
That satisfied nobody save, perhaps, a few hundred thousand Americans in the market for one of the newfangled people movers. Meanwhile, the whole issue of "harmonizing" regulation is becoming irrelevant, since light trucks will soon be required to meet the same safety standards as cars. But the politics turned decisively in Detroit's favor with the election of a New Democrat, who seems sufficiently old at heart to fear being labeled a wimp on trade.
The Big Three have been banging their protectionist drums on multipurpose vehicles, a priority that might strike some as strange in light of the fact that Chrysler dominates the mini-van market and all three American auto makers are cleaning Japan's clock on sport utility sales. Robert Lutz, the president of Chrysler, did not make the industry's focus any less opaque in a recent interview on CNN. "We've really crowded the Japanese back into a corner," he told the interviewer. "It's just a matter of principle to us."
Detroit may simply crave a symbolic victory to show it still has lobbying clout. The more cynical interpretation is that, in spite of very modest sales, the Japanese still represent a potential marketing threat that makes it problematic for the Big Three to raise prices. Whatever the reason, though, the White House is likely to deliver something.
The President could do what Detroit asks. That option, however, is bitterly opposed by the State Department, which still believes that America has bigger strategic fish to fry with the Japanese than the definition of a light truck -- for example, aid to Russia. The diplomats also worry that the Japanese would appeal the issue to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and win. But even if the Japanese swallowed the bitter medicine, the decision would embarrass Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economist, who has been careful to differentiate her "cautious activism" on trade from garden variety protectionism.
That leaves the possibility of negotiating some modest market-opening initiative with Japan -- the "something" George Bush did not get. More likely, the President will offer Detroit a bonbon from his domestic goodie bag. He may, for example, decide that cleaner cars are in everyone's interest, and throw in some money for joint research. Or, he could take a stand against pushing mileage requirements beyond levels justified by energy security or environmental requirements.
Come to think of it, with a little deft stitching, the President might yet transform this chewed-over sow's ear into a silk purse.

Tax-Exempt Yields Jump While Taxables Are Level

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt money market funds rose smartly in the latest reporting week, while taxable-fund yields were flat.
A survey covering the week ended Tuesday by IBC's Money Fund Report showed the average seven-day compounded yield for a tax-exempt fund up 7 basis points, to 2.04 percent, and the average seven-day simple yield up 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.01 percent. The 30-day average compounded yield was 1.97 percent, and the 30-day simple yield was 1.94 percent. 
 Investors withdrew $1.4 billion from tax-free funds in the week, with total assets falling to $99.4 billion. Analysts at the Money Fund Report noted that the week's withdrawals were considerably less than the previous week's, when investors pulled out about $2.7 billion and yields increased an average of 8 basis points.
In the week, fund managers shortened the average days to maturity of securities held in their portfolios to 48, from 49, as yields moved higher for the second consecutive week. The average is near the year's low.
Not including state and local taxes, the taxable-bond equivalent yield for the average seven-day tax-free yield is 2.83 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 2.96 percent for those in the 31 percent bracket.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, the Money Fund Report said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market Fund was the best performer in the week, with a yield of 2.73 percent, up 12 basis points from the previous week's best.
 
Taxable Funds
 For taxable funds, the average seven-day compounded yield slipped a basis point, to 2.65 percent, and the seven-day simple yield fell 2 basis points, to 2.61 percent, according to IBC/Donoghue's. The compounded average yield over 30 days is 2.68 percent, while the simple yield is 2.65 percent.
For the week ended yesterday, assets of taxable money market funds declined $2.7 billion, to $487.8 billion, with assets of institutional funds down $1.6 billion, to $171.4 billion, and retail assets down $1.1 billion, to $316.4 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios was unchanged at 63, indicating that money managers were still confident that yields would not take a significant turn soon.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for the Money Fund Report, said yields in the week reflected the absence of activity by the Federal Reserve to influence the market, leaving it to bounce around on technicals.
For the second consecutive week, the Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the highest yield among general-purpose taxable money funds with a yield of 3.46 percent, down 2 basis points from last week.
Yields at banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investors' cash, averaged 2.57 percent in the week, down a basis point.

HEADLINE: New York State Issue Is Priced

 BODY:
New York State's spring borrowing, which temporarily bridges the gap between state operating expenditures and anticipated revenues, was priced yesterday through competitive bidding.
Several underwriters were awarded portions of the $850 million offering of tax and revenue anticipation notes due on Dec. 31. 
 The bulk of the issue, or $625 million, was bought with a coupon of 2 3/4 percent and repriced to yield 2.05 percent.
Among the companies reoffering the notes at the 2.05 percent yield were J. P. Morgan, Chemical Securities, Paine Webber, First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
Merrill Lynch bought $125 million of the notes and priced them to yield 2 percent, while Bear, Stearns bought $100 million, reoffering them at a price to yield 2.10 percent.
Underwriters said the notes carried the highest short-term rating of MIG-1 by Moody's Investors Service and the highest short-term rating of SP-1+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: A Shotgun Wedding Startles Milan Design

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, April 26

 BODY:
Like a couple who have been living together for some time without making a serious commitment, modern Italian design and traditional handicrafts have finally decided to tie the knot.
One might call it the shotgun wedding of the decade. 
 And what did the results of the union of high technology and handmade look like? A-six-and-a-half-foot-tall rattan lamp that resembles a giant closed umbrella or a slim towerlike wood cabinet that would not be out of place if Shakers had home offices.
The shakers and movers at the Salone Internazionale del Mobile, the mammoth annual Italian furniture fair that closed here on Sunday, had no choice in the matter.
Italian design is at a significant crossroads. With the recession in the furniture business being felt on an international scale, the closings and cutbacks of the home-furnishings magazines and, most important, the wholesale rejection of cutting-edge design by the buying public, the Italian manufacturers seemed to realize that they had to reinvent themselves or face a slow and painful death.
The Salone, with its 1,806 exhibitors and 147,500 visitors -- buyers, retailers and journalists from 130 countries -- remains the most important marketplace of its kind in the world. The six-day event, held in a country that exported $5.1 billion in furniture last year, also included Eurocucina, a kitchen show, and the Salone del Complemente d'Arredo, an accessories and rugs exhibition.
The Milan fair is also the world's most influential show in terms of style, that volatile yet basic ingredient of modern furniture. Lower prices and collections aimed at a younger clientele were widely adopted strategies. Even so, buyers seemed to be on their guard.
"We come to look -- then we go home to pound it out," said Mitchell Steinberg, one of the owners of the Lee's Art Studio stores in New York. "And we're very conservative these days. There's no room for mistakes."
The new look in Milan is emerging as a strong stylistic statement in its own right, one that is reassuringly recognizable. In an uncertain world people are reaching out for basic, old-fashioned values, with a bit of cute thrown in. A chair with its upholstery tied around its base -- midriff style -- elicited smiles. So did a wing chair covered in cheery checked fabric.
One thing is sure: the hard-edge esthetic has been given the ultimate heave-ho. The furniture of the 90's must be strong but not aggressive, soft but not sentimental, plain but certainly not boring.
"New is quiet," said Paola Navone, one of the owners of Mondo, the company that was one of the leaders in the new design evolution. "Now, everyone is accepting what they were fighting when we started Mondo." Four years ago, Mondo redefined the look of contemporary furniture when it dropped Adirondack chairs onto the Milan design scene.
"Digesting the past instead of being scared of it is now just one of the many components of the new design," Ms. Navone added. "We still accept the industrial look in a car, but absolutely not in the things we like to keep close to home."
Even plastics are trying to change their image. At Kartell, an Italian company known for its avant-garde plastic furniture, Claudio Luti, the chief executive, was standing in a forest of pastel-hued wastepaper baskets made from recycled plastic garbage. "Each one is different," Mr. Luti said proudly.
The international ecological love affair with all things natural was reflected in the widespread use of cane and rattan. They appeared on headboards and lamps, on chair seats and sofas. They were applied to the fronts of chests and transformed into table bases.
But the emphasis on the low-key was disappointing to those still looking for design thrills.
"It looks like no one is putting any effort into their presentations," said Ilan Pivko, an Israeli architect who was touring the show with one of his clients in search of the usual fireworks. "Many things look like last year's festivities. I guess design is out anyway."
Well, not completely. One might just have to accept that furniture is beginning to look, well, normal. "I call it very low tech," said George Beylerian, a senior adviser to the Steelcase Design Partnership in New York. "That's where the Italians are going. To me it's a riot."
But it's not a joke. Companies like Boffi, for example, which have been in the furniture business for generations, are energetically looking for new business and asking style-conscious designers to put together new collections. "We have to offer an alternative market to those who like to go to flea markets," said Aldo Cibic, whose Antologia collection for Boffi is a motley but amusing group of exaggerated versions of classic pieces.
The results include bright blue Regency-style library steps, as well as Geranio, a bulging red chest inspired by a French boule chest. "I call them new antiques," Mr. Cibic said. "A room must be made up of a combination of all the things you love. That's the new culture."
At Xilard, an Italian company that usually manufactures traditional dark walnut furniture, the message was: "Look for these pieces in your attic or your memory." This year, the company introduced a collection of painted chairs, tables and glass-doored cabinets.
"The furniture is poor and sweet, naively painted in natural and pale colors," said Giulio Falcier, the company's export manager, touting Xilard's hand-forged nails and glue made from animal skins.
Ms. Navone was not impressed. "Some manufacturers thought that all you had to do was bring back something from the past and clean it up," she said. "I don't want any of that grandmother stuff anymore."
In her own Mondo collection, Ms. Navone has taken off in more exotic directions, traveling to Morocco. Her idea was to reinterpret the mosaic tile craft she saw there. Ms. Navone designed a series of tables set on iron legs made in Italy. The tops, in colorful carpetlike patterns, are made to Ms. Navone's specifications in Morocco.
"The tables are neither folkloric or old-fashioned, but optimistic," she said. "Is this not really a new way of making furniture?"
It might be. So might Antonio Citterio's multifaceted approach. Mr. Citterio, who seems to have replaced the French designer Philippe Starck as the ubiquitous presence at the fair, put his imprimatur on a plethora of sofas and chairs. His presence was felt most strongly at B & B Italia, one of the most important furniture companies in Italy.
Near the front of the booth stood variation upon variation of his new and seductively youth-oriented seating: plump and round-armed, covered in bright colors or a zany mix of polka dots. Called Indo, Cina, Cubis and Oriente, the chairs and sofas had the essential ingredient so important for mass-produced furniture today: charm.
Mr. Citterio also wrestled with the idea of providing less budget-minded customers with a place to stash their computers. "Everyone is always looking for something like an antique secretary," he said, "but that's not an up-to-date product. I wanted to keep this feeling, of looking for something rich, but design something for our time."
B & B Italia's Maxalto division, which employs 40 artisans, provided the craftsmanship for Mr. Citterio's intricately outfitted four-foot-wide cabinet with a marquetry front. And if that elegant piece was to your liking, then what about a Biedermeier-inspired table to accompany it? And then, of course, you might need dining chairs to complete the decor.
But what should they look like? Mr. Citterio remembers hesitating, but not for long. The light bulb snapped on when he and his wife, Terry Dwan, an architect, were looking up at a bronze statue of a seated man in a leafy Milanese piazza. "I copied the chair nearly exactly from the statue in Largo La Foppa," Mr. Citterio said.
Ms. Dwan added: "The espresso bar on the corner is one of our favorite places to go for coffee. It certainly came in useful."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
In the Know and Willing to Talk

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
All clear, cowed news fans. The assault by television experts has subsided, and for the moment it seems safe to tune in your favorite interview shows. But watch your head; this is likely to be just a Serbian truce.
After the invasion of experts on terrorism set off by the bombing of the World Trade Center, there was only a brief respite before the little war in Waco, Tex., called forth a swarm of experts on cultism. These cadres, swooping straight from producers' Rolodexes onto the nation's screens, were in a thriving television tradition of know-it-alls expatiating at the summons of the evening news on why a catastrophe they never predicted could now easily be foreseen. 
 The most accomplished of the breed are the foreign-policy pontificators. A nation's destruction can be the making of a reputation. You may not recall any of these people announcing before the event that Communism would collapse or that Yugoslavia would become a killing ground, but once they noticed what was happening, they were ready with policy pronouncements adorned with geopolitical phrases and sometimes delivered in a Middle European or Middle Eastern accent. Is it possible that the accent is adapted to the milieu?
Economists may be the most serviceable experts for television purposes, since they can readily be found on all sides of any issue. They resemble those doctors and engineers who rent themselves out in accident cases, some customarily testifying for the prosecution, others for the defense, a nice example of science accommodating itself to the market.
In like manner, economists have been proving to audiences for years that there is a recession and there is no recession, that it is over and it has hardly begun. Nothing that George F. Will or Sam Donaldson does can divert these practitioners from the incessant promotion of their appointed panaceas.
Psychologists have moved in on the downscale talk-show circuit like an occupying army. Some of the terrorism experts and cult experts came from their discipline, but the psychologists' main attraction for the afternoon believe-it-or-nots lies in sexier areas. The Mia Farrow-Woody Allen free-for-all brought out regiments of them, subspecialists in marriage, child care and celebrityitis. So many had been hired by the principals themselves that shaky New Yorkers faced a therapy shortage.
Unfortunately, descriptions of goings-on in the Farrow-Allen households did not enhance practitioners' pretensions to having bolstered their clients' mental health or emotional stability. And recent allegations that specialists in child abuse, a hot new line, have been coaxing young children to accuse parents or day-care workers of sexual hanky-panky have not added to the profession's luster. For the purposes of television, however, fantasy is at least as useful as fact, so you can count on the performing psychologists to continue to do their acts on all channels.
When the expert industry was young, producers ransacked universities and think tanks for presentable people with credentials and an authoritative manner. They found hurricane experts here and earthquake experts there and raided the ranks of retired generals to give blow-by-blows of the war in the Persian Gulf. But when it comes to terrorism and cultism, my suspicion is that the event creates the experts. After all, what university has an Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini Chair in Hostage-Taking or a Jim Jones School of Bartendry from which producers can draw?
No, it must work the other way. Every news program and talk show must have an emergency facility, where all-purpose pros sit around like fire fighters, playing cards until disaster strikes, the alarm sounds and they speed to the cameras with buckets of jargon. A few appearances on "Nightline" or "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" can do wonders for a reputation; a good performance may bring a book contract, a lecture tour, an invitation to be a senior something-or-other at a think tank, a partnership in a consulting operation, an invitation to contribute to op-ed pages. The new line for academic careerists: perform or perish.
What the experts are peddling, along with the usual mix of unexceptional observations and pop formulations, is themselves. When the terrorism expert tells an interviewer that more money must be invested in security, when the cult expert pleads for more attention to religious eccentrics, when the psychologist leads the wailing about domestic disarray, they are cultivating their gardens. The fertilizer is a blend of real troubles and the usual ingredient.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton's Hundred Days

 BODY:
All Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have had their reputations stretched or shortened by a Procrustean journalistic device known as the "first hundred days." The hundred days test is, of course, fundamentally silly. As Arthur Schlesinger pointed out on the Op-Ed page recently, Roosevelt assumed office at a time of such calamity that Congress "dared not say him nay." No President since has faced a comparable crisis.
Yet so durable is the standard that not even the White House, which might prefer to forget some of Bill Clinton's first hundred days, can ignore it. To mark the occasion Mr. Clinton's p.r. apparatus churned out a little pamphlet called "Season of America's Renewal," the title lifted from the President's hopeful address to Congress in February. The Republicans responded with a less flattering exegesis, "On the Wrong Track." 
 The hundred days tag, according to most accounts, was invented by newspapermen, who compared Roosevelt's domination of Washington in the spring of 1933 to another 100-day period embracing Napoleon's escape from exile, his army's triumphant sweep across France and his shattering defeat at Waterloo. Democrats like to recall the triumph; Republicans enjoy the Waterloo bit.
The truth of Mr. Clinton's hundred days is rather more provisional. There have been several large accomplishments. He steered his $1.5 trillion budget outline through Congress in record time, and responded boldly and generously to Boris Yeltsin's cry for help. There have also been less dramatic gestures that nevertheless bespeak a kinder, gentler and less ideological Administration, including the family leave bill and the dismantling of the Reagan-Bush restrictions on abortion.
There have also been many missteps, beginning with his snakebit search for an attorney general and continuing on through the bungled sales job on his stimulus package. One result has been a flurry of articles bemoaning a lack of focus in the White House and a general dulling of the sharp sense of purpose outlined in Mr. Clinton's campaign.
No less a loyalist than Leon Panetta, his Budget Director, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Clinton must do "a better job of picking and choosing the battles he wants to go through." Specifically, Mr. Panetta implored Mr. Clinton to delay health care reform until the fall, and said that piling a revolution in health care on top of everything else, including new taxes on energy and Social Security, could invite general legislative carnage and threaten the deficit-reduction strategy on which Mr. Clinton has staked his Presidency.
Mr. Panetta's advice was rejected out of hand by Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the President's wife and health care expert, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and then by the President himself. Their view is that health care reform is an essential component of any serious deficit reduction strategy, and they may be right. Even so, Mr. Panetta is hardly alone in his belief that Mr. Clinton, a noted trencherman, may have heaped far too much on his plate at this early stage.
Mr. Clinton won the election in part because he focused on one message ("It's the economy, stupid"), despite his policy-wonk tendency to move in a thousand directions at once. It's still early, and a hundred days really don't mean all that much, but one lesson he can learn from his slump in Washington and at the polls is not to confuse motion with progress.
