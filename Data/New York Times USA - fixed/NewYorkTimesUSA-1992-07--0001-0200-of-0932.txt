HEADLINE: Bank Yields Off Slightly

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit moved lower for the week ended today, according to the Bank Rate Monitor. But analysts at the publication said the shallow decline this week could indicate that the banks did not share the expectation of other financial sectors that the Federal Reserve would move to lower rates again.
"The numbers over the last six months show that the Fed has the latitude to change," said Robert K. Heady, the publisher of The Monitor, which focuses on interest rates. 
 At Monday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills, which many analysts regard as a good barometer of what many banks might pay depositors in the weeks ahead, the average discount rates fell smartly this week.
The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.59 percent, down 8 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month bill was down 11 basis points, to 3.66 percent.
New York area banks overall were again off slightly, with a money market account down 2 basis points, to 3.34 percent, and three-month certificates of deposit and six-month certificates unchanged at 3.49 percent and 3.64 percent, repectively.
Commercial banks lowered the average money market account by 5 basis points, to 3.09 percent, and the average yield of a three-month C.D. down a basis point, to 3.33 percent, and a six-month certificate 2 basis points, to 3.41 percent.
The higher-paying savings banks for the most part did not cut their money market accounts, now at 3.59 percent, moving up the yield on three- month C.D.'s by 2 basis points, to 3.66 percent, while leaving their six-month C.D. unchanged at 3.86 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, July 1, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yield are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: The Candidate Who Would Be an Analyst

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
It was almost a throwaway line.
But at a time when the banking industry is showing signs of regaining its financial balance, Ross Perot chose to resurrect old charges that the nation's largest bank -- Citibank -- is insolvent.
Appearing Monday night on a live broadcast on ABC News, he answered a question about Japanese ownership of the Seattle Mariners baseball team by calling it an example of how the United States is "losing in international competition." Then veering into banking as an example, he noted that the largest American bank is only the 21st largest in the world, and contended that "if you ever take the third world loans that'll never be paid out, it's insolvent." While he did not identify the bank by name, only Citibank fits the bill.
 
Rejected by Regulators
 
 It was not a comment normally heard from a public official concerned with the health of the banking system and mindful of the dangers of creating undue worry among depositors. In fact, his charge of insolvency was quickly rejected by regulators. Leonora Cross, a spokeswoman for the Comptroller of the Currency, the Washington-based regulator for most of the nation's largest banks, said yesterday that "Citibank is not insolvent."
But Mr. Perot is not a public official, he is a businessman. And as an investor, he has bet over the last six months that Citicorp, the bank's parent, problems would cause its stock to fall. According to his filings with the Federal Election Commission in mid-May, Mr. Perot did not own any Citicorp stock, but did borrow more than $1 million of the banking company's stock late last year, and again on March 25, so he could sell it.
That practice, known as short selling, would produce a profit for Mr. Perot if the price of Citicorp stock declined and he was able to buy shares at a lower price than the shares he sold, but did not own. Loans of Citicorp stock to Mr. Perot were reported to the Federal Election Commission on May 18, and reported in Grant's Interest Rate Observer on June 5.
James D. Squires, a spokesman for Mr. Perot, said in a telephone interview yesterday that "as a matter of principle we are not answering any questions about the financial disclosures." He added that later in the campaign "I am sure you will hear Mr. Perot talking about the declining competitive position of American banks."
While Mr. Perot's thinking about the problems of the banking system and the measures that might improve its health remain unclear, the available information strongly suggests that as an investor, he badly misjudged the prospects of Citicorp. Since the times Mr. Perot in effect placed bets that Citicorp stock would fall, its price has risen steadily.
Citicorp closed at $21.25 yesterday, up from $10.375 on Dec. 30, 1991, when he borrowed more than $1 million worth of stock from Goldman, Sachs & Company, and $17 on March 25, when he borrowed more than $1 million of stock from Jefferies & Company.
In recent months, Wall Street has judged Citicorp far healthier than Mr. Perot did. Several banking analysts have issued positive reports about the company and the stock has risen sharply this year. The sharp rebound in its stock price has come as the company's profit outlook has improved amid cost cutting and a slowdown in the souring of loans.
Mr. Perot's comments appeared to have no impact on Citicorp or other banking company stocks yesterday.
The problem for Citicorp the last few years has not been, as Mr. Perot said, its losses on loans to less-developed countries. Those losses were recognized, and subtracted from profits in 1987 when the company added $3 billion to its reserve for losses and in 1989, when it added an additional $1 billion.
Instead, the problem has recently been losses on commercial real estate, where 25 percent of Citicorp's $12.3 billion of loans were delinquent or not expected to be repaid in full and it held an additional $2.3 billion of real estate from foreclosed loans.
Assertions that Citibank and other large banks were insolvent were made occasionally in 1990 and 1991 as the industry's losses on commercial real estate loans led to comparisons with the savings and loan industry. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, echoed those contentions last July.
While the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has suffered heavy losses from bank failures in recent years, the banking system as a whole has fared far better than savings and loans because it had far more capital to absorb losses. Regulators forced banks beginning in 1989 to tighten lending standards that were too lax earlier in the decade.
The insolvency assertions are based primarily on contentions that bank accounting rules conceal the true deterioration of a bank's financial condition. While it is true that loans to businesses and consumers are not carried on a bank's books at the price they might be sold in the open market, regulators and many accountants say that fire-sale prices are not a fair way to evaluate loans that are delinquent or in trouble. Instead, they say that the losses a bank will incur on bad loans are reflected in the sums that banks subtract from their profits and add to their reserve for loan losses, or in the amounts by which banks write off as a loss all or part of a bad loan.
Even assuming that Citicorp has underestimated its losses on loans, analysts say, the company is far from insolvent. James Rosenberg, a banking analyst at Shearson, Lehman Brothers, said in a recent study that even if Citicorp suffered losses on risky loans much greater than the company has already admitted, it would still be solvent, with shareholders capital of $4.2 billion plus $2.3 billion more of preferred stock. That is not a thick cushion for a $216.9 billion company, but it is a cushion analysts expect will increase as Citicorp sells more nonessential businesses, cuts expenses and earns profits. After losing $457 million last year, Citicorp earned a profit of $183 million in the first quarter.
Banking specialists said that ranking banks by size understates the role American banks play in global financial markets. In the United States, 12,000 banks share the market while in other countries, like Japan, the market is far more concentrated and is dominated by just a few dozen banks.

Chairman Retires at France's Aerospatiale

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 30

 BODY:
The chairman of Aerospatiale of France, one of the two main participants in the European aerospace consortium Airbus Industrie, stepped down today, the company announced.
Henri Martre led state-owned Aerospatiale to a prominent position in the world aerospace industry and fiercely defended Airbus against American criticism. He will be 65 years old next year, the retirement age for executives in state companies. 
 A spokeswoman for Aerospatiale said Mr. Martre would be replaced by Louis Gallois, the 48-year-old chairman of Snecma, a state-owned jet-engine maker.
Analysts said there was no reason to believe that factors other than age had played a part in Mr. Martre's replacement. They said his direction of the company had been highly successful.
The change comes as the protracted dispute between the United States and Airbus appears to have reached a tentative resolution. Aerospatiale and Deutsche Airbus of Germany, a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., each own about 38 percent of Airbus; the remainder is owned by British Aerospace P.L.C., which holds about 20 percent, and CASA of Spain, which owns 4 percent.
In April, officials said the dispute, centering on American accusations that Airbus had an unfair competitive advantage because it receives government subsidies, was settled. The agreement, however, has not been ratified, but an American economic official in Paris said: "Things are still going in the right direction."
Throughout the dispute, Mr. Martre, who has headed Aerospatiale for a decade, argued vigorously that American aerospace companies like Boeing were indirectly subsidized by orders from the Pentagon and the space program and were engaged in a thinly veiled attempt to thwart a European upstart in an industry they had long dominated.
Analysts said Mr. Gallois, who held senior posts in the Defense and Industry ministries before joining Snecma, was unlikely to change substantially the policy or direction of Aerospatiale.
He will, however, face a consolidation in the European aerospace industry and crucial decisions on Aerospatiale's future alliances. The Dutch aerospace manufacturer Fokker N.V. is among the companies in which Aerospatiale has recently shown an interest.

HEADLINE: Hughes to Cut 9,000 Workers And Write Off $789.4 Million

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 30

 BODY:
The Hughes Aircraft Company said today that it would lay off 9,000 employees, or about 15 percent of its work force, largely because of the rapid decline in Pentagon spending.
The layoffs will come primarily in Southern California, where Hughes is the largest industrial employer, and will be spread over the next 18 months, company officials said. 
 Many of the job cuts will come at the managerial and supervisory levels, company executives said, including half the staff of 1,050 at corporate headquarters here.
The cuts are another jolt to California's economy, which is suffering its worst recession since the 1930's, in part because of widespread job losses in the military-contracting industry. In the Los Angeles area alone, employment in the aerospace industry has declined by nearly a third in the last six years, to about 200,000.
Hughes is the Pentagon's leading supplier of military electronics, and the job cutbacks stand in sharp contrast to the common wisdom that electronics companies would weather the cutbacks in weapons programs far better than manufacturers of airplanes, tanks and ships.
Hughes said it would also close buildings or entire plants at 92 sites in California and other states.
"This is the result of an industry that went into precipitous decline because of the breakup of the Soviet Union," said C. Michael Armstrong, the former I.B.M. executive who became chairman and chief executive of Hughes three months ago.
"Today the budget has been dramatically slashed," he said. "Programs have been canceled and others significantly delayed. The effect on this industry has been to force it to adjust."
Hughes has been reducing employment for five years, largely through an early-retirement program and attrition, but has never before undertaken such large-scale layoffs. It expects its work force to be about 50,000 people at the end of next year, from a current level of 60,000. The company's employment peaked six years ago at 82,100.
 
Taking $789.4 Million in Charges
 To pay for the layoffs and the plant consolidations, Hughes said it would take an after-tax charge against earnings of $749.4 million for the second quarter, which ended today. Hughes said it would also take a separate after-tax charge of $40 million in the quarter to reflect a change in the way it accounts for sales in some of its commercial businesses.
Hughes is a unit of the G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation, which is controlled by General Motors. In last year's second quarter, G.M. Hughes earned $83.4 million, or 29 cents a share.
Most major military contractors have been slashing employment for years. But Hughes's action today, which it said was based on the assumption that Pentagon procurement budgets would decline 5 percent a year through much of the decade, suggested that the industrywide contraction would continue.
 
Further Review of Operations
 Mr. Armstrong said Hughes would continue to review its operations and possibly sell or close those that it no longer considered good investments. He said, for example, that the company has put its electrical connectors business up for sale and that several companies have expressed interest in buying it.
The layoffs, the consolidation of the plants and the sale or closure of noncore businesses, Mr. Armstrong said, would allow Hughes to invest in those areas where it believes its business can grow.
The plan should ultimately save Hughes $700 million a year in operating costs, executives said.
"We believe we will have established, among those markets we have selected to serve, a much more competitive Hughes," Mr. Armstrong said at a news conference.
Shares in G.M. Hughes, which trades as G.M. Class H stock, have risen sharply in recent weeks, apparently in anticipation of the cost-cutting moves. The stock closed today on the New York Stock Exchange at $25.875, up 50 cents.
To cope with the decline in its military business, Hughes has been pushing into commercial technologies, including telecommunications networks and satellites and a host of smaller ventures. About 65 percent of the company's sales now come from the Government, down from 85 percent several years ago.
The hiring of Mr. Armstrong from the International Business Machines Corporation earlier this year clearly reflected the company's strategy of trying to become a more broadly based technology company.
But Mr. Armstrong reiterated today that Hughes had no intention of abandoning the military business, saying he believed the company could increase its market share and profits in selected types of programs.
Hughes, in fact, is in the process of acquiring the General Dynamics Corporation's missile business and its 9,000 employees.

HEADLINE: For Japanese, 'Shared Values' in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 30

 BODY:
In the six months since President Bush's ill-fated trade mission to Japan, Washington and Tokyo have made little progress on the major economic issues that turned the visit into one of the bitterest encounters between the two countries in years.
Yet when Kiichi Miyazawa arrives on Wednesday afternoon for his first official White House visit as Prime Minister, no one expects the discussion to dwell on Japan's swelling trade surpluses, its automotive imports or the depth of either country's commitment to fundamental economic reform. 
 With both leaders facing difficult election campaigns, American and Japanese officials say they hope to move the focus to "shared values" and "mutual dependence," much as they originally planned for the President's trip in January before everything -- including Mr. Bush's stomach -- went awry.
"We don't want to repeat what happened in January," one of Mr. Miyazawa's closest foreign policy advisers said on Monday. "I can't imagine the White House does either."
Mr. Miyazawa will be arriving with a plan for the Japanese Government to spend $47 billion to $55 billion on a package to stimulate the country's lagging economy and, in theory at least, to increase its imports.
 
Aid to Russia Indicated
 Japanese officials also hint that Mr. Miyazawa will arrive in Washington, and next Monday in Munich at the summit meeting of seven large industrial nations, with a significantly greater willingness to aid Russia than Japan has shown anytime in the past.
Last month Helmut Kohl, Germany's Chancellor, charged that Japan's refusal to provide large-scale aid to Russia was threatening President Boris N. Yeltsin's efforts to transform the country into a market economy.
Japanese officials still insist, as they have at past summit meetings, that any major, direct economic support must be linked to the return of four northern islands seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II.
But they have also begun to say that support for Mr. Yeltsin's initiatives are a major Japanese goal, signaling a willingness to funnel new money through international lending agencies.
"We feel that the Russians are now serious about negotiating a conclusion to a peace treaty" which hinges on resolving the territorial dispute, Koichiro Matsuura, the Deputy Foreign Minister, said on Monday. "We hope that there will be some breakthrough when Yeltsin comes in September," on his first official trip to Tokyo.
For Mr. Miyazawa, the most politically problematic issue in Washington and Munich is one he is least likely to be able to control: the ballooning of Japan's trade surplus.
By some estimates, the surplus with all of Japan's trading partners will climb to roughly $125 billion this year, nearly a 25 percent increase from 1991. In recent months, its surplus with the United States has also begun to rise rapidly.
"The figures are worrisome because they showed a 50 percent increase year over year in the bilateral deficit," Michael H. Armacost, the American Ambassador to Japan, said last week. "That risks injecting this issue into election-year politics, and that would not be desirable."
But no amount of Government prompting seems likely to induce Japanese consumers to purchase more imported goods in the middle of a continuing economic downturn.
In a series of appearances in Washington over the next two days, Mr. Miyazawa is expected to argue that over the last six months Japan has made great strides in taking a larger political role in world affairs.
During the visit both sides are expected to refer again to the "Tokyo Declaration," a reaffirmation of the political and security ties between the two countries that was overshadowed by the conflicts over American automobile imports and market access during the last trip.
"We're going to try it again," one of Mr. Miyazawa's advisers said recently, hoping to demonstrate to the Japanese public that the passage of the peacekeeping bill was contributing to improved relations with the United States -- only three weeks before an election for the upper house of Parliament that many expect will be a referendum on the peacekeeping question.
Mr. Bush may also not be eager to bring up the economic problems he raised in January because progress has been slim.
During the January visit, Japanese auto makers agreed to a target of selling 20,000 more American cars in Japan annually, a figure the Detroit executives who accompanied Mr. Bush described as inadequate. It has not been raised.
In the meantime, the United States appears to have switched emphasis: The latest American trade delegation to come through Tokyo said that the major trade issue of the year is no longer cars, but computer chips.
Equally uncomfortable to discuss is the progress of the "Structural Impediments Initiative," which Mr. Bush has hailed as a landmark effort to change the fundamental problems in the American and Japanese economic systems, the ones that hurt trade and competitiveness.
One big difficulty, as many American officials concede, is that Japan has enacted several of its commitments -- such as reforming its laws to make it easier to open large stores here and to cut working hours -- much faster than the United States has come through on its commitments.
Those included cutting the budget deficit and inducing Americans to increase their rates of savings. Both are far more difficult to achieve than the Japanese actions. But America's slowness to respond, some complain, will undercut future efforts to get Japan to make hard changes of its own.

HEADLINE: PLAN TO TIGHTEN EMBARGO ON IRAQ SUGGESTED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Seeking to slow an increase in illicit trade with Iraq, the Bush Administration failed to win greater cooperation from King Hussein of Jordan last week to enforce the United Nations trade embargo.
Washington is now considering a broader plan to stop illegal shipments after they arrive in Iraq, Administration officials said today. 
 The intensified planning represents at attempt by the White House to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein, during an election season in which the Iraqi's survival since the Persian Gulf war continues to be politically embarrassing to Mr. Bush. Democratic criticism of Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait has already tarnished the allies' victory in the war as a campaign asset for the President.
 
The Leaky Embargo
 In recent weeks, United States intelligence estimates have concluded that Mr. Hussein is strengthening his position in Baghdad with the help of an ever higher volume of critical supplies and other goods entering Iraq from Jordan, in violation of the 22-month-old trade embargo.
A recent National Intelligence Estimate said that up to 30 percent of the cargo crossing into Iraq from Jordan violates the trade embargo.
As a result, the White House last week dispatched the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, to Jordan to press for King Hussein's cooperation in placing United Nations inspectors at the Red Sea port of Aqaba to turn back Iraq-bound cargo, Administration officials said.
 
Jordan Changes Direction
 A senior Administration official said Jordanian officials were presented with "evidence about sanctions violations that originated in Jordan and their significance for Iraq's economy."
"We essentially made the case for a strengthened United Nations regime," the official continued. "At the end of the day it was no sale -- the Jordanians felt they couldn't go along."
Jordan's position contrasted with its cooperation in the fall of 1990, when United States embassy personnel in Jordan were allowed to take up positions on the border crossing with Iraq, where they lifted the tarpaulins covering Iraq-bound trucks to affirm Jordan's compliance with the embargo.
Mr. Gates' trip was not announced in advance, but news of his presence in Amman leaked out. C.I.A. officials would not discuss the trip today.
The senior Administration official, acknowledging the failure of the diplomatic mission, said: "In the wake of that, we are in the process of thinking what our options are in this particular hole in the sanctions net. No decisions have been made."
 
Would Search Trucks
 But other Administration officials said the White House was preparing a plan under which United Nations policemen inside Iraq would search the hundreds of trucks that enter from Jordan every week. Food and medicine would be passed; items banned by the embargo -- virtually all other goods -- would be turned back.
Administration officials said the plan would draw on the authority of existing United Nations resolutions and would not require Jordan's cooperation. The inspectors could be drawn from the United Nations personnel in Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction and monitor Iraq's compliance with other aspects of the cease-fire resolution that ended the gulf war 16 months ago.
The plan is to be reviewed Wednesday at the White House by senior deputies from major Government agencies. Officials also said three key allies, Britain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, were briefed today on a proposed notification to Baghdad stating that United Nations personnel in Iraq could begin enforcing the embargo.
Administration officials acknowledged that there was an element of brinkmanship, since the plan would involve interference with vehicles on Iraqi soil and could prove both embarrassing and provocative to Iraq.
 
U.N. Tenacity
 As an added element of urgency, the United Nations today press Baghdad to renew a "memorandum of understanding" covering the presence of 1,100 United Nations personnel in Iraq, including 500 armed guards in northern Iraq. The current agreement on protection of the United Nations personnel and their access to all parts of Iraq expires midnight tonight.
United States officials indicated that there was support among members of the Security Council to maintain the United Nations presence in Iraq, regardless whether Baghdad renewed the agreement.
Up to now, a multinational naval force in the Red Sea has been intercepting ships bound for Aqaba, Jordan, to stop illicit shipments to Iraq. But these forces have been powerless to stop cargo labeled as bound for Jordan, but which is later trucked to Iraq.
In his meetings with Mr. Gates, King Hussein was said to have objected to any public cooperation with the effort to choke off supplies to Baghdad, but he pledged a willingness to cooperate in other unspecified covert actions aimed at destabilizing the Iraqi leader.
 
Two-Track Attack
 Testifying today before the Europe and Middle East Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Edward P. Djerejian, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs, referred to the talks in Jordan.
"They said they could not implement certain arrangements which would involve outside observers," he said.
Asked what steps the Administration was considering to "ratchet up the pressure" on Iraq, Mr. Djerejian replied, "I can't discuss that in open session."
The United States has been engaged in a two-track policy against Iraq.
One emphasizes the trade embargo and inspections to force Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction and war-making industries.
The second track, authorized by a series of secret Presidential findings by Mr. Bush, emphasizes covert steps by the C.I.A. and Pentagon to build an Iraqi opposition capable of fomenting a coup that could topple Mr. Hussein and perhaps receive the backing of allied military forces.
 
The Oil Issue
 King Hussein's stance appears to be driven by domestic politics, as well as by economic fears that Iraq would cut off oil supplies. Iraq sends more than 60,000 barrels of crude oil a day to Jordan in truck tankers that traverse the same desert highway that supplies Baghdad. This oil meets most of the needs of Jordan's severely stressed economy, and has been overlooked by the United Nations commission enforcing the embargo.

HEADLINE: Amendments Stall Gun-Control Measure in Hartford Senate

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 30

 BODY:
A special session of the General Assembly that was expected to act swiftly on a package of gun-control laws has instead turned into a complicated political minuet.
On Monday, after almost 10 hours of debate, the House of Representatives passed a pair of bills that had been vastly transformed from the original proposals. 
 The package moved to the Senate late today, where the bills passed, but the fate of one of them became uncertain after a key amendment, banning the sale of cheap hanguns known as Saturday night specials, was defeated.
At the same time, the Senate approved an amendment that would make it easier to apply the death penalty, a combination that one of the bill's sponsors, Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford, said would prove deadly because Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. opposed the death penalty and was likely to veto the measure.
"If the death penalty stays on it, without the handgun ban, it's in big trouble," Mr. Jepsen said before the vote. That bill, which makes it a felony to sell or otherwise provide firearms to juveniles, now goes back to the House, which returns to Hartford on Monday.
"It's very disappointing," Mr. Jepsen said. "One problem when you're dealing with a special session is that time is very limited." He said he would try to bring back the measure in the regular session.
Governor Weicker, who called the special session to consider gun control only, had proposed two modest measures intended to inhibit the flow of guns into the hands of juveniles. Those bills would have made it a felony to sell a gun to anyone under 18, and would have penalized people who carried guns within 1,500 feet of a school, with exceptions made for permit-holders, police officers and a few others.
 
Sense of Frustration
 Enthusiasts of stricter curbs added amendments to outlaw Saturday night specials and assault weapons. The former squeaked through the House by a handful of votes Monday night; the latter was defeated. But opponents of gun control won an amendment in the House that would make it easier to impose the death penalty, setting the stage for a likely veto.
In response to reporters' questions this morning, Mr. Weicker said he was still hopeful that gun-control measures of some kind would become law.
"I'll have to see what develops in terms of the final package," he said. "But I've got great optimism that everybody is doing the Lord's work here in terms of trying to get something that will be meaningful in stopping the violence."
The mood in both houses of the General Assembly seemed to be one of frustration as the battle's focus shifted from public safety to political gamesmanship.
 
Debate Reflects Division
 With Connecticut reeling from the recession, some legislators said they were concerned that certain measures, like the ban on Saturday night specials, might harm the state's gun manufacturers. "This is a terrible amendment," said Representative Angelo M. Fusco, a Republican from Plantsville, during debate on the issue. "It doesn't really doesn't do anything except harass Connecticut businesses that make some of the higher-priced weapons that fall into the Saturday night special category."
Others disagreed, saying that the amendment was aimed at cheap versions of those weapons that are churned out by factories owned by companies in other states.
The debate over gun control reflected the divisions in the Legislature between representatives from the state's beleaguered cities, like Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford, and those from quiet suburbs like Farmington and Bethlehem.
"This is like banning Model T's," said Representative William R. Dyson, a veteran Democrat from New Haven. "You're hearing from people who may not care, because they're not being shot at in their towns."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Tongues Wag Over Shift at New Yorker

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE Talk of the Town, and all the other features of The New Yorker, were the talk of the avenue -- Madison Avenue, that is -- in the wake of the unexpected changes in editors that S. I. Newhouse Jr. made yesterday at that venerable weekly magazine and at his glitzy monthly, Vanity Fair.
Mr. Newhouse, chairman of the magazines' parent companies, named Tina Brown, the Vanity Fair editor in chief since 1984, to replace Robert Gottlieb as editor in chief of The New Yorker, a post he had held for five years. Graydon Carter, editor of The New York Observer, will succeed Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair. 
 Rarely has such a significant shift taken advertising and publishing executives so much by surprise. And rarely has opinion been so divided on what the moves might mean for the economic health of the magazines involved.
Some are thrilled; some are aghast; some are skeptical, concerned that The New Yorker could lose its distinctive cachet in seeking to woo reluctant advertisers.
"She is going to revitalize the magazine," Claude Fromm, executive vice president and media director at TBWA Advertising in New York, said of Ms. Brown.
Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and director of print media at McCann-Erickson New York, said: "From the advertiser point of view, the thinking has been that The New Yorker represents 'stodgy.' If her mission is to spruce it up, to bring it into the 90's without radically changing it, I can't wait." But, she added, she would be disappointed if Ms. Brown made "a more drastic change."
Steve Klein, media director at Kirshenbaum & Bond in New York, called The New Yorker under Mr. Gottlieb "a tremendous editorial product," and worried that the weekly might not "continue to be what it is."
"As a reader, I'm upset," he added of Ms. Brown's arrival, due in the fall. "As an advertiser, I don't know what to think."
Even blunter was John R. (Rick) MacArthur, president and publisher of Harper's Magazine in New York.
"It's the triumph of sleaze and salesmanship over quality," he said. "The idea of the editor of Vanity Fair being made editor of The New Yorker is like moving Trump Tower to the middle of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden."
He added that Ms. Brown's status as "the hottest editor on Madison Avenue," referring to Vanity Fair's strong gains in advertising pages since her arrival, was the sole reason Mr. Newhouse tapped her for The New Yorker.
"Now he's got an editor who can sell," Mr. MacArthur continued. "This is evidence of the ultimate sort of pandering. It's very depressing."
Ms. Brown, like her namesake Helen Gurley Brown, editor in chief of Hearst Magazines' Cosmopolitan, is known for her involvement in publishing-side matters. For example, the designer Calvin Klein was about to run his 116-page jeans ad supplement in Rolling Stone last fall, publishing executives say, when Ms. Brown persuaded him to switch to Vanity Fair.
She is also outspoken. She said she would have rejected a controversial Benetton ad that Vanity Fair ran this year, showing an AIDS patient at the moment he died.
Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive of The New Yorker, said that Ms. Brown, whom he praised as "the right person for the job," would be involved in functions like luncheons for advertisers.
But, he added, an incident like the courting of Calvin Klein "won't happen here, because this is a different place with different customs."
"I hate to sound precious," he added, "but this is a class act. She will never compromise the product. She will only enrich it."
Mr. Florio, who has seen The New Yorker through tough and flush times in the seven years since Mr. Newhouse purchased it for $168 million, is eager for Ms. Brown to arrive.
"She doesn't know this," he said, "but a salesperson came in to me and said, 'I've been working on the Banana Republic for three years and they called to say they heard, it's great news, and "We're in." ' "
The New Yorker's ad pages, which topped 4,300 as recently as 1981, according to the Publishers Information Bureau in New York, fell fairly steadily through the rest of the decade, then rose in 1989 and 1990 only to plunge 18.5 percent last year, to 2,001.
Contributing to the declines were intense competition for its affluent, well-educated readers from publications as diverse as Interview, Connoisseur and Vanity Fair, as well as the recession and, most recently, the Persian Gulf war, which crippled its mainstay category, travel advertising.
So far this year, though, results have improved; ad pages through May totaled 673.4, up 5.1 percent from a year earlier. Mr. Klein of Kirschenbaum noted that The New Yorker continues to enjoy one of the highest subcriber renewal rates in the industry. The median age of The New Yorker's readers, according to the 1991 Simmons Market Research Bureau study, is 43.6, compared with 33.6 for Vanity Fair, while the median household income stood at $56,061, compared with $44,560.
At Vanity Fair, ad pages soared as Ms. Brown transformed a moribund literary magazine that Mr. Newhouse had come close to closing into a sprightly potpourri of celebrity covers, star- and society-focused articles and occasional investigative journalism.
Since 1989, ad pages have remained steady in the high 1,400's, a performance that Ron Galotti, the publisher, said "has been unbelievable in this economy" and compared favorably with steep declines at rival monthlies. Through May, ad pages resumed their climb, rising 10.3 percent from the first five months of 1991.
Mr. Galotti added that Mr. Carter faced a "fantastic" challenge at Vanity Fair, but that he would benefit from the monthly's "position of strength" in the market.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Rise But Recovery Still Sputters

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
The Commerce Department index designed to forecast the economy climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in May, its fifth straight advance and the largest since February.
But the moderate rise in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was seen by most analysts as exaggerating the economy's prospects and doing nothing to dispel the growing sense that an already weak recovery is losing momentum. Recent reports have shown declines for home sales and orders for durable manufactured goods amid higher first-time claims for jobless benefits. 
 "I'm not too optimistic about where this economy is going," commented Richard D. C. Trainer, chief economist for the Bank of Tokyo in New York. "The recovery now is extremely fragile."
Analysts also noted that the index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current activity, was unchanged in May. It has now failed to rise for three straight months and is at the same level as December.
 
Other Reports Also Weak
 Meanwhile, the Conference Board reported today that its consumer confidence index stopped improving in June following three sharp increases. And purchasing managers in Chicago showed a slight improvement but ordering fell in Milwaukee.
This batch of figures came as the policy makers at the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting to plot a course for the next seven weeks. Most analysts seem to believe the Fed, its credibility on the line because of Adminstration pleas to cut rates again, will decide against doing so unless Thursday's Labor Department report on the June job market is particularly weak.
One reason for negative interpretation of the widely anticipated six-tenths of 1 percent rise in the leading index was that six components fell while only five rose, observed Raymond A. Worseck, chief economist for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
And some that rose were disparaged because they were seen as reflecting weakness -- a longer workweek, for example, being preferred to hiring new employees -- or have been subsequently reversed, as in the case of the stock market.
 
Breakdown of Components
 The biggest contributor to the rise was higher prices for materials that are especially sensitive to the business cycle, a volatile series that some analysts thought might be mere random fluctuation. The others were a rising proportion of companies experiencing slower deliveries from suppliers, higher stock prices and higher consumer expectations.
The components that fell, all of them just marginally, reflected lower new factory orders for consumer goods and materials, declining M-2 money supply, fewer contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a decline in unfilled orders for durable goods, lower building permits and rising first-time unemployment claims.
"Ouch!" exclaimed William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. He added that his group's own predictive indicator moved sideways in May after four monthly gains but he nevertheless contended that the economy shows more substance now than a year ago, when a spring surge turned into a second-half swoon.
The department's index of lagging indicators, those that tend to turn only after the economy at large, dropped in May for the 16th month in a row. The 1.2 percent fall was the biggest since January.
Among private-sector forecasting indexes, the one compiled by Safian Investment Research of White Plains gained two-tenths of 1 percent in May, with 14 of 24 components moving up.
But Herzog, Heine, Geduld reported that its index slipped to a reading of plus 142 from plus 145, the first decline in seven months.
David B. Bostian Jr. called this result a possible cautionary sign that may reflect deferral of business decisions because of uncertainty about this fall's elections.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steelmakers Seek Steep Fees on Imports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
American steel producers filed 84 trade complaints today against Japan, Canada, Mexico, Germany and 17 other countries, seeking steep customs fees on imports.
The filing of the complaints, which coincided with the arrival in Washington of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, is new poison for the nation's already-difficult trade relations with important allies abroad. European, Canadian and Japanese officials warned that the cases would heighten tensions already raised by disputes over trade in soybeans, lumber and mini-vans. 
 "It's going to put further strain on an already strained relationship," a senior Canadian official told reporters on Monday.
Ella Krucoff, a spokeswoman for the European Community's Washington office, criticized the trade cases as "uncalled-for economic harassment and deeply disturbing to the steel trade."
The rising number of trade conflicts, coupled with European Community disarray over whether to create a single currency and central bank, has paralyzed 108-nation negotiations in Geneva to reduce international trade barriers. The disputes have also eroded support, especially in Canada, for a free-trade agreement in North America.
Japanese companies, which have spent $3.5 billion on large shareholdings and joint ventures with all six big steel companies in the United States, campaigned for their shipments to be excluded from today's cases. Senior Japanese steel executives held a series of secret meetings with their American counterparts in the unsuccessful effort, people involved in the steel cases said.
The Japanese steel industry responded indignantly to their inclusion in today's cases. "Having shown cooperation and support in both trade and investment, we are astonished that these efforts are being totally ignored by U.S. industry," said Yoshitaka Fujitani, the president of NKK America Inc., a subsidiary of the Tokyo-based NKK Corporation.
Yet in an extraordinary sign of both the extent and the limits of foreign investors' influence in the United States, four of the nation's six leading steel companies did not join the complaints against Japan, but filed against other countries. They are LTV, Inland Steel, Armco and National Steel.
But these companies did agree not to oppose the complaint outright, which would have considerably weakened the American steelmakers' case. Bethlehem Steel, USX and six small steel companies did file the petitions against Japan. The small steel companies joined the case in the last week, a person involved in the case said.
The complaints ask the Commerce Department to impose up to $1 billion in duties on flat-rolled steel imports that totaled $2.5 billion last year.
To win their cases, the big American steelmakers must convince the Commerce Department that foreign producers are either exporting steel below cost or are receiving government subsidies. They must also prove to the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, that they are in commercial trouble and that unfair imports are at least partly responsible.
Robert W. Crandall, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the International Trade Commission could be hard to convince. He added that domestic competition from companies that recycle scrap metal into steel might prevent the big steel companies from raising prices even with import duties.
Some foreign steelmakers vowed today to retaliate. Donald K. Belch, the director of government relations at Stelco Inc., in Hamilton, Ontario, said that Canadian steel producers would file similar trade complaints against imports from the United States "almost immediately -- they are already prepared."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slips, Reversing 3-Month Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy stopped growing in June after a three-month surge, the Conference Board reported yesterday, in a widely followed survey that reflected the fragility of the recovery.
Economists expressed concern about the finding by the business research group because it suggested that consumers are turning more cautious about spending and borrowing money. Consumers account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and are the driving force behind recovery and expansion. 
 "The growth rate of the economy in this recovery is still quite feeble as compared to most other recession-recovery episodes," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
The group's consumer confidence index, which chronicles consumer levels of financial security on a monthly basis, registered 71.7 in June, barely changed from the revised 71.9 reading in May.
The index, calculated on a 1985 base of 100, is derived from answers to questionnaires sent to 5,000 households nationwide, covering topics like personal spending plans, the job outlook and business conditions for the next six months.
The June reading followed a rise of more than 24 points in the index from February to May, which had been considered an important sign that consumers were growing more confident about their finances.
The news came as the Commerce Department reported its main economic barometer rose for the fifth straight month in May. But the advance was modest and economists saw no inconsistency in the numbers.
Release of the consumer confidence survey also coincided with a meeting of the Federal Reserve Board committee that charts monetary policy.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Fiat Reports 39% Decline In Earnings

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy, June 30

 BODY:
Fiat S.p.A., the Italian automobile and industrial giant, said today that 1991 profits fell 39 percent, to the lowest level in four years.
The 90-year-old company forecast a continued squeeze as it pursues a $40 billion program to modernize production and update aging car designs. 
 Profits last year of 871 billion lire, about $720 million, were down from a 1990 profit of 1.417 trillion lire. Sales were 56.488 trillion lire, or about $48 billion, compared with sales of 57.209 trillion lire in 1990.
Company executives attributed the drop in part to high production costs in Italy and to the global economic slowdown. They also cited losses from Fiat's 1990 takeover of Ford New Holland, a Ford Motor Company unit that made agricultural machinery and tractors, which is now merged with Fiat's Geotech.
Fiat executives said the new company, called N. H. Geotech, lost $300 million last year and $120 million in the first six months of this year. Moreover, Fiat plans to spend up to $500 million more to recapitalize the new company this year.
But Fiat's chief executive, Cesare Romiti, said at a news conference today that Fiat also planned to close plants and cut jobs at the new company. It was not clear whether this would affect operations in the United States.
Fiat's acquisition of the tractor concern reflected a policy to consolidate strategic divisions to seek market dominance while shedding nonstrategic units to help finance the company's plans through 1996.
Under that policy, Fiat last year acquired both Ford New Holland and Spain's biggest truck producer, Enasa Pegaso. It has also shed its controlling interest in the past two years in the Telettra Telecommunications Company, which it sold to Alcatel Alsthom of France.
Umberto Quadrino, Fiat's planning director, said the sale this year of Fiat's remaining 25 percent stake in Telettra had yielded the equivalent of $700 million with a further $200 million to be paid in installments over four years.
That money, he told reporters, with expected income from the group's many divisions, would produce a profit for 1992, although on a smaller scale than last year.
The company's 1991 results also showed that Fiat took on debt last year for the first time in almost a decade -- the equivalent of roughly $225 million. Executives said borrowing was needed because of the capital investment plan at a time of depressed markets.
Fiat's concern about its future in the European car market reflects worries that other European producers, notably Ford and Volkswagen, are encroaching on its Italian stronghold. Fiat's share of the Italian market still stands at 46 percent, but in the late 1980's it commanded 60 percent.

HEADLINE: Consumers Hesitant in the Heartland

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CENTRALIA, Ill., June 25

 BODY:
After several years of profound economic malaise, businesses and consumers in much of the country appear to be emerging, at last, from the recession. But while they say they are more hopeful than they were a few months ago, most people are by no means convinced that their woes are past.
The recovery has yet to take hold in the Northeast or in California. But in interviews in and around Salt Lake City, Omaha and here in Centralia in the last week, dozens of people provided evidence that the economic recovery remained spotty and that even in areas of relative strength, faith in the recovery was thin. Consumers and businesses hold dampened expectations and neither group is likely to shed the caution adopted over the last several years.
 
'Depends on Who You Are'
 
 "Is the recession over?" said Neenah Sabir, a social worker, as she sat having a snack at the Crossroads Mall in Omaha. "Depends on who you are. I make a fairly decent salary, but even with that there are a lot of things you have to tighten your belt for."
Yet along with such wariness are clear signs that the economy is coming fitfully back to life.
In Omaha, Wayne Atchley, a Ford dealer, said he had 15 percent more visitors to his showroom so far this year than by this point last year, and sales have returned nearly to the levels of the late 1980's.
In Salt Lake City, Todd B. Kjar, a lawyer, and his wife, Jennifer, felt confident enough about their prospects to sell their house -- they found a buyer in a single day this month -- and trade up to a more expensive home. Before they move they will buy a refrigerator, just the kind of big-ticket purchase that economists look for as signs of consumer optimism.
Here in Centralia, a rural town of 14,000 that is 60 miles east of St. Louis, a Rockwell International Corporation auto-parts plant has hired 90 employees this year. Orders from car and truck makers are picking up, several new products are selling well and the plant expects to hire 50 people in the next few months for manufacturing jobs paying $10 an hour, adding them to the factory's work force of 900.
"There are some pretty strong indicators, and we're forecasting that things will continue on that path next year," said Larry W. Garretson, the factory's director of manufacturing.
The sporadic nature of the recovery has been reflected in recent economic statistics. The Commerce Department has reported, for example, that orders for durable goods fell 2.4 percent in May after gains in the previous two months.
After the economy showed a relatively healthy gain of 2.7 percent in the first three months of the year, more recent indicators illustrate "the now familiar pattern of ragged recovery," said David Hensley, an economist with the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles. "We expect this patchwork pattern of growth to continue through the remainder of this year."
Still, many business owners and managers, and many consumers, seem to have turned a psychological corner.
 
The Garage Door Indicator
 When the economy perks up, so does Kenneth D. Martin's garage-door manufacturing business, and in the last several months Mr. Martin has seen positive signs.
With interest rates low and home sales in some parts of the country rebounding, orders for Martin Door Manufacturing's garage doors should be up 10 percent this year, compared with 5 percent last year, Mr. Martin said in an interview at the company's factory in Salt Lake City.
The recovery looks uneven, because Mr. Martin's biggest market, California, remains mired in its worst slump since the 1930's. And after several years of slashing costs, he said he did not plan to add much to the family-owned company's work force of 80 people. But Mr. Martin says he is confident that after a false start last year, the economy is moving ahead again, albeit slowly.
 
Orders Up at Rockwell Plant
 At the Rockwell plant in Centralia, sales in the second half of the company's fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, are running 10 to 15 percent ahead of the first half. Mr. Garretson said sales next year should be up another 15 to 17 percent, to about $100 million.
A little more than half the increase is being generated by new plastic auto-body parts manufactured by the plant, and the rest reflects the improved economy and stronger orders from auto makers, Mr. Garretson said.
"We went for the last year or two with our customers shutting down their production lines for a week or a week and a half every month," Mr. Garretson said. "In the last few months there haven't been any shutdown weeks."
 
'We're Real Optimistic'
 A survey done last month for the credit card company Mastercard found that small-business owners believed, by a margin of 3 to 1, that the economy was improving. And most owners said they planned to hire some additional workers this year.
At a new shopping center in the Sugar House section of Salt Lake City, the parking lot was filling with shoppers' cars the other day and employees at a bookstore were unpacking crates of books and stocking the shelves.
"We're real optimistic," said Kathleen Pelzer, one of the 30 employees recently hired by the store, Bookstar, which is owned by Barnes & Noble Bookstores. "I think this is going to be a great success."
If the store does do well, it may be because of its steeply discounted prices. Most traffic at the shopping center seemed to head for discount stores -- a Toys "R" Us; a Nordstrom Rack, a low-price closeout store run by the department store chain, and specialty stores like Payless Shoes.
"Customer purchases are very value oriented," said Jack Baker, the president of Baker's Supermarkets, a chain of 10 stores around Omaha. Nadean Hall and her husband, Jay, own Botanic Design, a florist in Salt Lake City. To keep the business afloat for the last few years, they have each put in six days a week, often bringing their three young children to the store.
"Shopping at Nordstrom," Mrs. Hall said wistfully. "I haven't done that in years. We try to use our credit cards only in emergencies. And when we shop, it's on an as-needed basis." But Mrs. Hall said she was more optimistic now than a year ago.
So is Chris Bruce, a systems analyst in Omaha. She said her husband had just received a higher-paying job that would require them to move to Kansas. She expects them to be able to sell their house, which they just put on the market, for $125,500, a small profit over what they paid for it at the beginning of the year.
Still, Ms. Bruce said, they have hesitated about buying the Chevrolet Blazer they want.
"We're still a little cautious," she said. "We're very careful about what we get ourselves into."
The Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York, has seen sharp increases in its consumer confidence index in each of the last three months. After plummeting throughout the second half of last year, the index has rebounded nearly to its level of a year ago.
Perhaps more important, the survey showed increased confidence among consumers that the economy would continue to improve in the next six months.
 
'Nothing's Stable Enough'HE>
Yet for many people, the recovery seems to be something enjoyed by other regions, or by their neighbors.
Economists say Utah's economy is one of the fastest growing in the region, but Alex Hansen, a 22-year-old resident of Salt Lake City, said, "Utah's economy is horrible." In February, she lost her job as an administrator for a chain of video stores and was unemployed for two months. She is now working part time at a supermarket.
To make ends meet, Ms. Hansen and her boyfriend, Dan Ponder, have sublet a spare bedroom in the home they rent. Mr. Ponder, who works with developmentally disabled students in a program financed by the local government, said neither he nor Ms. Hansen was banking on things getting better.
"Nothing's stable enough to get a good feeling," Mr. Ponder said.
Even some people who are feeling the benefits of the recovery, however, say they remain worried that the economy could turn down again.
In Centralia, Joel Spenner, a production worker at the Rockwell plant, said: "Do I feel secure in my job now? Yes and no. I remember what it was like a year ago."
Mr. Spenner said he and his wife together make $60,000 a year, but that with four children, it had been impossible to save money.
"I don't have much confidence, even with what's going on here," he said, pointing to the bustle of activity around the plant. "I know people who've worked their whole lives, but now they're just sitting around getting drunk. This plant can't hire everybody."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "The impact of the overspending of the 80's has caused consumers to regroup and be more conservative about how they're spending, and I'd expect that to continue for some time to come," said Jack Baker, president of Baker's Supermarkets in Omaha. With him was Mark Neumayer, fish market manager.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Results Are Posted For Dollar and Gold Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed on world currency markets yesterday, rising overseas but mostly declining in domestic trading after the release of a lukewarm report on consumer confidence.
Gold prices also fell in domestic trading after rising in foreign markets. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $343.10 an ounce, off 60 cents from Monday. Republic National Bank said gold lost 45 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $343. 
 The dollar rose in foreign markets and began domestic trading with a rally. "Traders were thinking that maybe today's numbers would be a little more favorable to the dollar," said Mike Faust, an analyst with MMS International.
But Mr. Faust said selling hit the market around midmorning after the release of a Conference Board report that showed consumers' confidence stagnated during June.
The report underscored the modest pace of the economic recovery and put the market on alert for an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Faust said. Such a move would be bearish for the dollar because it diminishes the value of dollar-denominated securities. The central bank is unlikely to take any action before tomorrow's release of June unemployment data, however.
Traders were unimpressed by another report showing the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose six-tenths of 1 percent in May for the fifth straight increase.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.55 yen, up 0.05 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 125.85 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 125.60 yen, down from 125.80 yen on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates included: 1.5215 German marks, unchanged; 1.3710 Swiss francs, down from 1.3730; 5.1180 French francs, up from 5.1170; 1,150.50 Italian lire, down from 1,151.00, and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $343.45 an ounce from $342.35 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $343.25 from $342.50. In Hong Kong, gold was up 86 cents to close at $343.68.

HEADLINE: Congress and White House Are Nearing Agreement on Urban Aid

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
After more than five weeks of intense bargaining, Congressional and White House negotiators said tonight that they were nearing an agreement on a $5 billion urban aid package.
The emerging agreement would provide $500 million a year for five years for the nation's cities, including money for new social programs, as well as $2.5 billion for businesses in waivers on capital gains taxes to spur investment in impoverished neighborhoods. 
A senior White House official said the Administration was pleased with the arrangement, while Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, consulted with other senior Democrats to work out a few remaining details.
 
Joint Effort
 "We both gave in order to reach an agreement," said the White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Negotiators hoped the tentative compromise would reach the House floor on Wednesday, although there was still the possibility of a hitch. Congressional and White House aides said that Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, wanted to have a hand in setting up the urban enterprise zones.
The compromise represents a victory for moderates in the Administration as well as the Congressional leadership, who said that it was important to show that the two parties could respond quickly and ably to the rioting in Los Angeles.
At times during the negotiations, Democrats and Republicans told one another that if they did not compromise, Ross Perot, who has all but declared that he is an independent candidate for the Presidency, would benefit from the perception that they were indulging in political posturing.
 
More Money This Time
 The proposed package falls far short of the $35 billion program requested by the nation's mayors, but it went far beyond the $1.3 billion aid bill the White House and Congressional negotiators worked out two weeks ago. That assistance came mostly in the form of loans and grants to businesses and homes damaged in the Los Angeles disturbances.
A successful negotiation would allow Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats the chance to declare a political victory. After three years, Mr. Bush was able to persuade Democrats to enact his plan for urban enterprise zones, with a major capital gains tax break.
In 50 such zones, half of which are in inner cities and the rest in distressed rural areas, businesses will be granted a five-year moratorium on capital gains, with a 50 percent reduction on capital gains taxes paid after the five years. Democrats had already agreed to a bill that would create enterprise zones with various tax breaks for investors, but they only now agreed to a significant break on capital gains taxes, which are at the heart of the Administration concept.
In exchange for compromising on the capital gains tax, the Democrats received the President's acquiescence for the $2.5 billion in spending for job training, education and health care programs to be coordinated with law enforcement activities. Known as Weed and Seed, specially trained detectives and SWAT teams would be assigned to clear neighborhoods of gangs and drug dealers before the social programs would be instituted.
Aides close to the negotiators said Richard G. Darman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and staff members of the House Ways and Means Committee still needed to work out the accounting methods to be used to figure out the financing of the measure. A senior Gephardt aide said Mr. Rostenkowski was not in full agreement with the capital gains provision, adding, "This could still blow up in our faces."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Buoyed Clinton Goes on the Offensive

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Buoyed by new polls indicating that his Presidential campaign seems to be picking up some speed, Gov. Bill Clinton tried today to take advantage of the renewed concern about the abortion restrictions narrowly approved Monday by the Supreme Court.
In a long day of television appearances, speeches, meetings and news conferences, here and in New York, Mr. Clinton repeated that he favored the right to choose an abortion and said that he would select a running mate who held that view. He also said that if elected President he would appoint only Supreme Court Justices who support the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. 
 Before his 16-hour day was finished, Mr. Clinton, the presumed Democratic Presidential nominee, touched bases with almost all the major elements of the Democratic Party in an effort to widen his base and justify speculation that, suddenly, there is a genuine new leader of the Presidential pack.
"This has been a good day," he said enthusiastically at one point, his spirits obviously lifted by the new polls that show him in a dead heat with the other Presidential contenders.
Mr. Clinton promised the Congressional Black Caucus that he would work to heal racial divisions in the nation. "My whole career, my whole campaign, is about unity, not division," he told the lawmakers in a visit to Capitol Hill.
The caucus leader, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of Brooklyn, replied: "We smell victory in the air. There is no doubt about it."
 
Laying Out Middle East Policy
 In another speech, Mr. Clinton told leaders of the Service Employees International Union that his recently announced national economic plan would put people back to work and get the American economy moving. The labor leaders cheered in return.
Addressing a group of Jewish supporters, Mr. Clinton delivered one of his sharpest attacks yet on the foreign policies of the Bush Administration, accusing the President of forging appeasing relationships with "dangerous, despotic" Middle Eastern governments like that in Iraq.
Mr. Clinton said he opposed creation of an independent Palestinian state, said Jerusalem should be considered Israel's capital and promised help to Israel in its effort to assimilate Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
"The Bush Administration has pushed Israel relentlessly to make one-sided concessions," Mr. Clinton said. "You should not forget the Bush Administration's cold shoulder and the back of the hand."
The crowds that greeted Mr. Clinton at each appearance were noticeably larger than in the recent past, and his repeated precipitous plunges into sidewalk crowds had the confident earmark of a candidate who figured that he suddenly was the anointed leader of the pack.
 
'Pro-choice! Pro-Clinton!'
 Perhaps the Governor's most successful campaign stop of the day was before a cheering crowd of women gathered here on Pennsylvania Avenue to open an office to push an abortion-rights law through Congress.
"As President, I won't make you worry," Mr. Clinton told the women as they chanted, "Pro-choice! Pro-Clinton! Pro-choice! Pro-Clinton!"
The Governor called for a "political uprising" by American women, saying they were not being heard in discussions about major issues, especially the right to choose to have an abortion.
The Governor warned that the High Court's 5-to-4 vote on Monday served notice that the next President, if a Republican, would probably be in position to appoint more conservative Justices. Only one more such Justice, he said, would almost certainly tip the balance against the 1973 Roe decision.
"We don't need to go back to those days," Mr. Clinton said. "It's not good for America. It's not good for the women of America -- the uneven treatment, the disasters in dark alleys, the uncertainty, the fear, the hiding, the uneven application of the law."

HEADLINE: Twisted Tale of a Kidnapping And of Dreams Gone Wrong

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
It was, in its way, a distinctly American tragedy, one built, perhaps, on greed and carried out with a casualness and ineptitude that shocked even the most seasoned of law-enforcement officials. It was, said Gary L. Penrith, the special agent in charge of the Newark Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an "unbelievably despicable" crime.
The largest kidnapping investigation in recent history began on April 29 with a car standing empty at the end of a secluded suburban driveway, its motor idling, its driver gone. 
 It ended yesterday with a guilty plea by Irene J. Seale, a 45-year-old mother of two described by friends as well-dressed and talkative, and who, for all appearances, seemed to come from "the average family." Yet last Saturday she led investigators through a tangle of underbrush to a grave in the desolate sand-swept New Jersey Pine Barrens and the decomposing corpse of Sidney J. Reso, the missing president of the Exxon Company International.
It also ended with an obvious betrayal, as the woman's husband, Arthur D. Seale, pleaded not guilty to charges that included kidnapping, extortion, conspiracy and improper use of the United States mails for the delivery of ransom letters. Mrs. Seale has agreed to testify against her husband. [Page B4.]
Over the past four days, interviews with family members, neighbors, former employers, law enforcement officials and others close to the case have yielded these findings about the abduction, the investigation and the people involved:
*Irene and Arthur Seale, despite their public expressions of love shortly after their arrest, had a troubled family history that several times called for police intervention in family arguments and in the recovery of a runaway child.
*Mr. Seale, a former police officer who as an Exxon employee was in charge of supervising guards supplied to the company by a contractor, is likely to have known Mr. Reso by sight while he worked at the Exxon offices at 200 Park Avenue in Florham Park, N.J., but he is not believed to have harbored any personal animosity toward the executive.
*Federal agents, in a ruse designed to lull the kidnappers into a false sense of security, purposefully misled reporters, describing the kidnapping in a rather lackluster way as a "missing persons" matter rather than a major kidnapping case. In fact, as the 59-day investigation wore on, it would become the largest nationwide manhunt since the high-profile kidnapping of Patricia Hearst in California 1974, said Federal investigators.
*Exxon officials, on the instructions of Federal agents, prepared $18.5 million in cash as a payoff to the kidnappers, though that money never left company coffers.
*Irene Seale was deeply disturbed by Mr. Reso's death and turned against her husband shortly after the couple's apprehension by Federal agents to "provide Mr. Reso with a decent burial," in the words of her lawyer.
While particulars of the investigation remain unclear, a picture has begun to emerge of the kidnappers as part of a deeply troubled family battling a private history of physical and emotional abuse and yet drawn, publicly, to a world of wealth and status typified by the star-studded resort towns of Vail, Colo., and Hilton Head, S.C., where they lived for a time.
It was, perhaps, their inability to sustain that expensive life style that led them to turn to a rash scheme launched late this spring at a time both were unemployed and living at the home of Mr. Seale's parents in Hackettstown, N.J.
 
The Abduction
Morning Commute Ends in Driveway
 April 29 was a Wednesday and Sidney J. Reso, the 57-year-old head of a subsidiary of one of the largest corporations in America, started his day by eating breakfast with his wife of 37 years at their home off Jonathan Smith Road, a cul-de-sac studded with elegant houses strung over four-acre plots in Morris Township. As Mr. Reso prepared for the day, Mrs. Seale, a trim, attractive blonde, jogged past the family's driveway and then returned to the van, where her husband was waiting nearby.
Sometime before 7:30 A.M., Mr. Reso stepped into his car and started on his daily 10 minute commute to his office in Florham Park.
He never made it past the end of his long driveway. There, according to law enforcement officials, a van rented by Irene Seale blocked his way after he stepped from his car to pick up the morning paper. Mr. Seale grappled with the Exxon executive in the driveway, law enforcement officials said, and then pushed him into the van, which was driven by his wife.
 
Shot in the Arm
 Inside the van, Mr. Reso and Mr. Seale scuffled, Mrs. Seale told the United States District Court at her hearing yesterday. As the two men struggled, Mrs. Seale confirmed, Mr. Reso was shot in the arm. Still bleeding from that wound, Mr. Reso was next taken to a rental storage locker the size of a small room not far from where the Seales were living. There, the Exxon executive was handcuffed, gagged with a strip of duct tape and bound hand and foot.
While Mr. Reso remained locked within the sometimes sweltering locker, the Seales began their attempts to extract millions in ransom from the oil company, the authorities said. The day after Mr. Reso's disappearance, Exxon officials received a call directing them to the Livingston Mall. At the mall, which is near Exxon's Florham Park offices, law enforcement officials said there was a note that instructed company officials to await further instructions.
At that moment, it was unclear whether Mr. Reso was alive, or even if the purported kidnappers were holding him.
A second note, found in a park in Morristown about five miles from the Reso's home on May 1, did little to clarify Mr. Reso's condition or whereabouts. Yet together, the notes raised a disturbing possibility. Signed "Rainbow Warriors," the notes raised the possibility that the abductors were extremists somehow linked to the environmental group "Greenpeace," since the group sometimes uses a ship known as "the Rainbow Warrior" to press for tougher environmental standards in the oil and nuclear industries.
Greenpeace officials denied any involvement, and Mrs. Reso told reporters that her husband's concerns about the environment would have made him an unlikely target for extremists from that group.
Before the news of the "Rainbow Warrior" letters leaked to the media, Mr. Reso was already dead. Mrs. Seale told the court yesterday that the couple tried to treat his arm wound, but she confirmed that the Exxon executive was found dead in the concrete-floored locker on May 3, just four days after his abduction.
No autopsy report has been released yet, and the precise cause of Mr. Reso's death remains unclear, though early statements by Mrs. Seale that Mr. Reso died of "natural causes" have been rejected by officials linked to the case. Officials have tried to determine whether Mr. Reso was even given food or water in captivity or if he was simply dumped in the locker and left alone without any significant care beyond superficial treatment of his arm wound.
Even if he was given something to eat and drink, the 57-year-old executive's chances were never very good. Law enforcement officials believe that the temperature in the metal locker would have become nearly unbearable during daytime, and that even a younger, heartier man might not have survived. Mr. Reso's health, in fact, was far from perfect. He suffered a heart attack three years ago and was still on medication at the time of his abduction.
By May 7, Federal officials may have already suspected that Mr. Reso had not survived the abduction. In response to an article in the New York Post suggesting the involvement of Greenpeace, W. Michael Murphy, the Morris County prosecutor, subsequently made an appeal for a photograph or voice recording of the missing executive.
None was forthcoming.
 
The Investigation
Staking Out Pay Phones
 As day after day passed with no proof from the kidnappers that Mr. Reso was alive, the investigation quickly grew. By May 12, a ransom letter was received at Exxon's corporate headquarters in Irving, Tex., calling for a payment and signed "members of the conspiracy," according to a Federal indictment filed on June 25 against the Seales.
On May 15, Jeremiah Doyle, the F.B.I.'s second in command in New Jersey, reiterated the bureau's demand for proof that the kidnappers were holding Mr. Reso and that the executive was alive and well.
That same day, a one-page note was found taped to a light pole in the Rockaway Townsquare Mall, about 12 miles from Hackettstown, after a security guard was alerted by an anonymous call. The note instructed Mr. Reso's wife, Patricia, to make a statement to the media. She appeared on television that evening, saying that she believed her husband was still alive and pleading for him to come home.
Weeks passed, and still there was no proof from the kidnappers. Finally, on June 1, the "members of the conspiracy" mailed a letter from Florham Park to Exxon's international division in Florham Park, calling for the payment of the ransom money.
Two days later, Arthur Seale applied for a passport, telling immigration officials that he had to make an "emergency" trip to the Bahamas. He received the passport the same day.
 
'No Response'
 The next call came June 8, from a pay telephone in Poole, Ga., to a cellular telephone number set up by the F.B.I. exclusively to monitor ransom communications from the kidnappers. In that call, a man's voice asked "why there had been no response to a previous message," according to the United States criminal complaint filed against the Seales on June 19.
Earlier in the week, the Seales had arrived in Hilton Head to visit their son, Justin. There, they dined with friends, appeared relaxed and seemed to be preparing to purchase a marina, said several people who met with the family during the week. One woman who met the Seales for dinner at a Japanese restaurant remembered Mr. Seale as "very relaxed and very open."
Several of Mr. Seale's acquaintances said he arrived in Hilton Head from Florida, where he had often traveled by sailboat in better times.
By this time, the investigative team had swelled to more than 300 people, law enforcement officials said. Mrs. Reso appeared before the media on June 16 and made a plea for her husband's safe return by Father's Day, June 21. "In my heart, I believe Sid is alive," she said. "He's very strong and he's got great faith."
That same day, F.B.I. agents found a peculiar note. Stuffed in a mailbox on Route 24 in Morris Township, it instructed Exxon officials to bundle the $18.5 million ransom in packets of $100 bills inside old Eddie Bauer laundry bags. The authorities were tipped to the letter's location by a prerecorded message left on the cellular phone.
The case was drawing to a close. On Thursday, June 18, Mrs. Seale rented an Oldsmobile from Bette's Rental Agency of Hackettstown. Two final calls were made to confirm arrangements for the ransom payment and teams of F.B.I. agents were dispatched across the county to watch pay phones.
 
A Flurry of Calls
 That surveillance net would soon prove effective. After a flurry of calls and a series of complicated directions throughout June 18, a surveillance team at the Chester Mall in Chester watched from a distance as a blond man placed a call wearing gloves. He then returned to the Oldsmobile rented by Mrs. Seale. A second person was observed in the passenger seat of that car, but could not be identified. The couple left the mall just after 10:40 P.M.
By 11:16 P.M. a woman fitting the description of Irene Seale was spotted at a pay telephone at the Somerset Hills Elks Club in Gladstone, walking toward a white Mercedes Benz. Three calls had been made to the special F.B.I. cellular phone earlier from that number.
At 12:40 A.M., the Oldsmobile pulled up at the rental facility in Hackettstown. No ransom money was ever dropped, and no further instructions had been received.
At the rental lot, Mr. Seale told waiting law enforcement officials that he was simply returning a rented car and waiting for his wife. Shortly afterward, Mrs. Seale arrived in the white Mercedes, and both were arrested. Inside Mrs. Seale's car, agents found two pairs of rubber kitchen gloves, four Eddie Bauer laundry bags, a briefcase with a 1985 Exxon directory marking the home addresses of the company's top executives and three .38-caliber slugs.
 
The Suspects
Domestic Troubles Hidden From View
 Over the next few days, the arrest of the Seles would be followed by a series of revelations about their probable intentions. Law enforcement authorities disclosed his emergency passport application. They also followed a trail of clues that, pieced together, seemed to paint a picture of Mr. Seale's plans for his life as a millionaire.
Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, said a search of the couple's home in rural Lebanon Township had turned up, among other things, lists of banks in Switzerland, Pakistan and India, Mr. Seale's newly approved passport, a book about money laundering and a dozen handguns and other weapons.
But a backward glance at the Seale's life is equally revealing. Mrs. Seale's court-appointed attorney, Sallyanne Floria, yesterday told reporters that her client was abused and manipulated by her husband over the course of their 25 year marriage. "By the time of sentencing," said Ms. Floria, the jury would understand that Mrs. Seale would never have been involved in the crime had it not been for Mr. Seale's control.
It was by far the most dramatic time that the family's problems had become public. But it was not the first. Joe Venneman, a former police investigator in Eagle County, Colo., said the Seale's domestic troubles brought them to the attention of the police when their daughter, Courtney, 13 at the time, ran away from the family's home in Vail.
"I got the feeling that I wasn't getting the whole story from them," Mr. Venneman said, referring to his visit to the family's house. "They were a couple with a secret, and I was the third man out." Mr. Venneman dismissed the couple as "social wannabes" who were trying "to pull off a life style they couldn't afford."
Sgt. Rick Anardado of the Vail Police also came to know the family. "We received three runaway reports regarding their daughter," he said. On another occasion, the police were called in for a domestic disturbance involving the family's son.
Susan Brody, owner of Convention Designs in Vail, remembers Mrs. Seale without rancor. She said Mrs. Seale worked for her company as a secretary for less than a year, a time during which Mr. Seale was working as a stock broker at Paine Webber in Denver.
Acquaintances of the family in South Carolina were equally split on the subject of the family's background. Several friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were shocked at reports of the couple's involvement in the kidnapping and described the family as pleasant and ambitious.
"He doesn't even look like the guy I knew," said Porter Thompson, an advertising agent who worked with the Seales while they owned an interior design and furniture business on Hilton Head. Though Mr. Thompson was left with $30,000 in unpaid bills by the couple, he remembered them without bitterness. "Art was always fun," he said. "A happy guy. Cheerful. He was always pleasant. I am just praying they weren't involved in this."

HEADLINE: Tina Brown to Take Over at The New Yorker

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
In an announcement that stunned the publishing industry, The New Yorker yesterday named Tina Brown, the 38-year-old British editor in chief of Vanity Fair, to be its editor in chief. She will replace Robert A. Gottlieb, whose resignation was also announced yesterday.
Graydon Carter, a co-founder and editor of Spy magazine who last year became editor of The New York Observer, is to replace Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair. 
 The news, which spread like wildfire throughout the publishing industry, was as juicy as it was unexpected. It involves two of New York City's landmark publications. The New Yorker established a brilliant genre of witty and sophisticated journalism when it was founded in 1925. Vanity Fair, the sassy parvenu, became the hot magazine of the 1980's and 90's under Ms. Brown.
S. I. Newhouse Jr. chairman of both Advance Publications and The Conde Nast Publications, the parents of The New Yorker and of Vanity Fair, respectively, said in an interview that he and Mr. Gottlieb, who was president of Alfred A. Knopf before his appointment to The New Yorker five years ago, had held talks about the magazine's direction and "continuous evolution" for six to eight months.
"At a certain point, Bob, who is quite conservative and quite classical, was unable or willing to see the need for further evolvement," Mr. Newhouse said. "In a quiet way, he decided that this wasn't a good situation, and he resigned."
News of Mr. Gottlieb's resignation and Ms. Brown's accession met with none of the overt hostility that greeted Mr. Gottlieb when he took over. Many of the writers and editors had almost devotional regard for William Shawn, Mr. Gottlieb's predecessor, who had edited the magazine since 1951. The thought of an outsider's coming in to edit their beloved magazine was almost more than many of them could consider. But yesterday the news about Ms. Brown, who is not just an outsider but a Briton, was received more calmly.
"Everyone I have spoken to so far has been very open-minded and very charitable in an understandably circumspect and professional way," said Daniel Menaker, a New Yorker senior editor, who was on vacation in Massachusetts and fielding calls from colleagues in New York. "I have heard none of the weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Other editors reacted far more negatively when Mr. Newhouse broke the news to the staff at a morning meeting. One said the general feeling was that Mr. Gottlieb, whom many had come to respect, felt an obligation to save something of the magazine, whereas they said they feared Ms. Brown would not.
The news of the changes had been scheduled for release after Mr. Gottlieb's return in mid-July from a trip to Japan. But fears at Conde Nast that the news was leaking out prompted its release yesterday.
 
An Amicable Parting
 Mr. Gottlieb said in a middle-of-the-night interview from his hotel in Tokyo that he had made it clear when he was hired that he was not the person to carry out a real overhaul of The New Yorker because "I would not do it very well."
Conversations over the last several months between Mr. Newhouse and Mr. Gottlieb began to focus again on the need for change, both men said. And, increasingly, it became evident that Mr. Gottlieb was not the one to make these changes.
"The changes I did make -- the changes in Goings On About Town -- those seemed absolutely natural," Mr. Gottlieb said. "I did not see further larger changes that seemed to me appropriate to the magazine or that I was the one to carry out."
Mr. Newhouse, who is known for not prescribing to editors but rather giving them their heads, declined to specify what kind of changes he had in mind or the directions in which he wants to take the magazine.
Both he and Mr. Gottlieb described the conversations as pleasant and the parting as amicable.
"I don't want anyone to think that I have been treated badly," Mr. Gottlieb said. "Si has been extraordinarily generous to me."
While Mr. Newhouse said that the changes "in no way arose because of business or in an attempt to solve a business problem," people in the industry questioned whether financial considerations had not been part of the change.
Conde Nast is a privately held company, so figures on its profits and losses are not available, and its officials always decline to comment on them. But reports have been circulating through the industry that The New Yorker lost $10 million last year.
When asked if this was true, Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive of The New Yorker, replied: "Oh, God, no! If that were true, it would not be a new editor we'd be looking for. It would be a new publisher."
For many years, The New Yorker's advertising pages have declined, first in the face of competition for its affluent, well-educated readers, and more recently because of the recession. So far this year, however, results have improved. Ad pages through May totaled 673.4, up 5.1 percent from the same period a year ago.
The New Yorker's circulation for the last six months of 1991 was 627,263, down 2.2 percent from the last six months of 1990. Single-copy sales, a good test of a magazine's health, were down 8.3 percent.
 
No Imitation of Vanity Fair
 Both Mr. Newhouse and Ms. Brown said emphatically that she would not bring to The New Yorker the kind of glitz she used so successfully in Vanity Fair. Her most famous cover was a nude picture of the actress Demi Moore, who was seven months pregnant at the time.
"I do not know what she is going to do, but I know what she is not going to do," Mr. Newhouse said. "She is not going to go monthly. She is not going to drop the cartoons. She is not going to have some version of Vanity Fair at The New Yorker."
Reports have been circulating that Ms. Brown was becoming restless at Vanity Fair and considering job offers from Hollywood. She has told friends about offers from at least two major film studios and has been approached about jobs in television.
In an interview yesterday, she said she had thought hard about her preferences and decided that her real passion was print.
"Sitting with a writer, talking about how the story is going to be, that's when I come home happy; that's when my husband says I come home with a light in my eye," said Ms. Brown, who is married to Harold Evans, president and publisher of Random House, owned by Advance Publications.
An immediate question is whether Ms. Brown will bring to The New Yorker the group of writers she has developed at Vanity Fair. In answer, Ms. Brown praised the staff writers of The New Yorker and said that while she would search for new writing talent, "I have no idea of decimating the Vanity Fair stable."
She was effusive in her praise of her eight years at Vanity Fair, calling them "the most wonderful roller coaster" and "a journalistic Camelot" and describing Mr. Newhouse as "the white knight."
At 11 A.M. yesterday, Ronald A. Galotti, the publisher of Vanity Fair, escorted Ms. Brown into the magazine's conference room to announce her departure to the staff. The room was overflowing with apprehensive writers and editors who had heard the rumors.
Ms. Brown took one look and started to cry. She turned around, regained her composure and started to say she had news that was going to be very sad, but then she choked up again. At the end of the meeting, everyone stood up and cheered her.
Ms. Brown said Vanity Fair's circulation had just reached one million. The magazine, which is to celebrate its 10th anniversary in March, has enjoyed robust ad-page growth recently, although the recession has taken its toll. Ad pages last year totaled 1,440, down 2.2 percent from 1991. So far this year, growth has resumed. Ad pages through May totaled 544.6, up 10.3 percent.
Yesterday was a day of meetings. Ms. Brown met with some editors at The New Yorker and assured them that "she would not be adding photos or changing the magazine in the ways we had feared," said one person who attended the meeting. Mr. Carter also met with Vanity Fair staff members yesterday and assured them he had no intention of making drastic changes.
Mr. Carter, who is 42 years old and was born in Canada, said he would not turn Vanity Fair into another Spy. He was one of that magazine's three founders in 1986 and went on to be a co-editor. Under his stewardship, Spy published profiles of celebrities that many considered to be unnecessarily mean and often inaccurate. What might have been intended as humor struck many readers as nastiness. Asked if this kind of journalism would characterize his tenure at Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter said "No, absolutely not."
"Spy required certain things and a different set of talents," he said. "I hope that my nine months at The New York Observer shows that I have another set of talents. The Observer was very objective and very fair."
Mr. Carter assumes his new position immediately; The Observer has not named his successor. Ms. Brown is to start at The New Yorker in September, working with Mr. Gottlieb to learn the ropes.
There is one tradition Ms. Brown will not have to learn. In 1925, when Harold Ross founded the magazine, he made it clear that it would not be edited for "the old lady from Dubuque." There seems little fear that Ms. Brown will fail to honor that directive.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Taking Heat at Every Turn, Bush Shows a Boiling Point

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
President Bush's temper seemed to get the better of him in Detroit on Monday night.
Speaking to a group of Republican contributors, he said he was tired of hearing that the economy is not getting better when he is sure that it is, and he thinks Americans have just not gotten the word. Waving his arms in the air and nearly shouting, he said he is sick of not getting credit for the Persian Gulf war, the fall of communism and arms-control breakthroughs. 
 "I have worked my heart out as President of the United States," Mr. Bush said. "I'm getting a little sick of being on the receiving line -- receiving end -- of criticism day in and day out."
Mr. Bush summoned up a similar bout of anger in the 1988 New Hampshire primary to show that he was not down for the count. And he may have been putting on a calculated show of annoyance on Monday to send that same message to party faithful who have been agitating for him to get into the fight.
But frustration on his part would be understandable.
Last week, the Presidential campaign went through one of those periods in which the alignment of the battle clearly shifts. And the President got little out of it. A new round of polls, combined with the behavior of the candidates themselves, indicate three major developments.
 
Perot on Defensive
 One, the all-out attack by the President's surrogates succeeded in flattening the soaring trajectory of Ross Perot by assaulting his integrity, his mental balance and his respect for the Constitution.
But the second major point is that Mr. Bush did not get any boost at all from that effort, or from the sweeping arms-control agreement he signed less than two weeks ago with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The White House campaign still looks to be dead in the water.
Third, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic nominee, gained strength with a calm, dogged campaign on issues. Mr. Clinton finds himself in the happy position of handing over his defensive position to Mr. Perot. Now it is Mr. Perot's psyche, rather than Mr. Clinton's personal history, that is the hot subject.
A new poll published today by The Washington Post and ABC News showed Mr. Clinton with a slight lead of 33 percent to 31 percent for Mr. Perot. Mr. Bush was preferred by 28 percent of those who were asked whom they would vote for if the election were held that day. .
 
'Net Neutral' on Bush
 The poll, conducted on June 24-28 among 785 registered voters, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning that it recorded a practical dead heat. But there was no denying that its rankings also seemed to provide an accurate snapshot of the moment.
Roger Ailes, an occasional political adviser to Mr. Bush, tried to play down the polling results in an appearance on the NBC News program "Today" this morning. But the best he could say was that the events of the last week or so were "a net neutral on the President."
Mr. Clinton and his aides could hardly contain their delight at the polling results, which were published two weeks before the start of the Democratic National Convention. "It's a natural roll into the convention," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director.
 
'Full-Scale Assault'
 Edward J. Rollins, Mr. Perot's campaign co-chairman, appeared with Mr. Ailes on the "Today" show and declared that Mr. Perot's campaign was moving along just fine. He discounted the polling results but acknowledged that the Republicans had damaged Mr. Perot with what Mr. Rollins called "a full-scale assault."
The figures published by The Post and ABC did not represent a statistically significant shift from previous polls that had Mr. Perot leading, Mr. Bush in the middle and Mr. Clinton trailing.
But polls have a psychological impact on a campaign that is so close, and this one served to underscore what was evident: that Mr. Clinton was recovering from his own slide, while Mr. Bush's position may actually have worsened.
"The Bush slide doesn't look like it's stopped," said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee. "It looks like it's continued to bleed out even more."
Mr. Tully was quick to point out what Democratic and Republican strategists noted in the new poll: that the shift was caused in large measure by Democrats switching their allegiance away from Mr. Perot, possibly because the White House surrogates had succeeded in their mission of making Mr. Perot look scary. "They freed up some voters, but they freed up some Democrats and some Democratic leaners as well," Mr. Tully said of the Republican attacks.
The new poll made Mr. Bush's problem clear: He must shift from defense to offense. The Supreme Court decision on the Pennsylvania abortion case, for example, was at most a reprieve for Mr. Bush from a political problem, a defensive success that did not provide his campaign with the offensive momentum for which the President's advisers have been hunting for months.
After watching his opponents score public relations points on what he described on Monday as "weird talk shows," Mr. Bush has embarked on his own campaign of television appearances, including a scheduled hour-long stint on Wednesday on the CBS program "This Morning."
 
Bush and Reality Gap
 But Mr. Bush has mostly stuck to the counsel of political aides who told him to avoid any direct attack on his opponents until after the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Houston in August, and to focus on giving the impression of a chief executive hard at work on the nation's problems.
To Mr. Bush's obvious annoyance, it has not worked. "We had Yeltsin standing here in the Rose Garden, and we entered into a deal to eliminate the biggest and the most threatening intercontinental ballistic missiles -- the SS-18's of the Soviet Union -- and it was almost, 'Ho-hum, what have you done for me recently?' " Mr. Bush told a gathering of agricultural journalists here today.
Declaring that the economy was doing better than is generally recognized, Mr. Bush said, "There is a gap between reality and perception, and part of my job when I do get into a campaign mode is to try to close that gap and be sure that we are judged on reality, not on these erroneous perceptions that are being portrayed by the, in the, political process. Get it?"
In fact, Mr. Bush has long been in what he calls a "campaign mode," but only half-heartedly. He defends himself and promotes his programs at every opportunity and has refused only to engage directly with his opposition -- a decision that Republican strategists are starting to question.
 
'Nonpolitical Mode'
 Not only is Mr. Bush sounding increasingly defensive, but he has been forced of late to explain himself to his own party. "When I am unleashed and when we get out of this mode, this nonpolitical mode we're in, I'll tell you, I'll be ready for the fray," he said on Monday night.
But some Republicans say he is waiting too long. "In Bush's mind, he has a clock that starts in Houston and he sees all of this as rehearsal," Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican Whip, said in a recent interview.
"Bush simply has to be able to create no later than the convention a clear and compelling explanation of what changes he favors, why they fit the values of the American people and how they will improve the lives of the American people," Mr. Gingrich said. "If he doesn't do that, frankly, the Presidency is up to pure luck."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Midwest: Fertile Region For Politics of Disgust

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, June 26

 BODY:
At truck stops and picnics, in downtown high rises and farm-town cafes, the American heartland is talking politics.
"I've voted Republican all my life, but I'm disgusted," 40-year-old Jim Allmon said in ball park bleachers as he watched his son play Little League in Springfield, Ill. "I'm leaning toward Perot and hope he doesn't come up with something off the wall." 
 But in the middle of Iowa, in Kellogg, another 40-year-old, Bonnie Crook, who voted last time for Michael S. Dukakis, said she was uncomfortable with Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire. "I don't want Bush. I don't like Clinton. But I'm afraid of Perot," she said, gazing from the window of her grocery at the one-block main street. "He's a Trojan horse. We don't know what's really inside him. Four years down the line, will he hurt us? Will we be sorry? I'm afraid so."
In a weeklong thousand-mile drive and in chats with some 200 people around the Midwest -- from Kansas City, Mo., north to Iowa, then across Illinois and Indiana -- Mr. Perot was very much the topic of conversation. But it was not always favorable: none of the wide-eyed fervor here that came out in similar conversations in California just four weeks ago, no blizzard of bumper stickers. For every Perot supporter, there was a Perot opponent.
 
Where Else to Go?
 The same was true of President Bush. He still has a base of support, especially in farm country. But even many people sticking with him said they were doing so not because he is so strong, but because Mr. Perot and Gov. Bill Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, are so inexperienced, so phony.
"I don't know what else to do," said Arthur Kane, a 45-year-old lawyer in St. Joseph, Mo. "Don't make me out to be leading the Bush bandwagon. I'm not. But I don't see where else to go. Clinton and Perot are just playing at it. They're not experienced leaders."
Polls show Mr. Clinton gaining support nationwide. But there was little evidence of that during this journey. People seemed accustomed to thinking in terms of a two-candidate race. And in this part of the country, where the sentiment is often Republican, it was Mr. Clinton, not Mr. Perot, who was perceived as the third-party candidate, eclipsed by an incumbent President and a "give 'em hell" billionaire even in some urban areas and among some people who voted Democratic four years ago.
"It's time for a change, but I don't think Mr. Clinton has the experience to go in there," said Tim Bredberg, a 38-year-old race horse trainer in central Illinois who voted last time for Mr. Dukakis. "I'm leaning toward Perot. He'll shake it up. If he doesn't come up with some concrete specifics, I'll go to Bush."
 
Lemonade, Not Vitriol
 From town to town and state to state, the country flashed by in a series of nonstop portraits -- white farmhouses engulfed in a sea of green corn, contented town squares with the flag flying high, farmers rushing out the door to greet a visitor not out of fear but to offer a glass of lemonade.
For the most part, people were well informed about the campaign, quoting newspaper articles and radio and television interviews. But being well informed does not necessarily mean they will vote. Mr. Perot is not so much a phenomenon here as just another candidate, and therefore not a reason for many nonvoters to change their ways.
"I haven't registered to vote, and I don't intend to," said Kevin Madlem, a 26-year-old farmer in Charleston, Ill., who was more concerned about the lack of rain than the Presidential campaign. "Bush, Clinton, they're all the same, all talk."
Asked about Mr. Perot, he said: "Everybody can talk. Everybody can say, 'Heck. I'll go out and do all them things.' He's no different than the rest of them. Talk. I don't care for any of them."
In some cases, not only is the race failing to rally nonvoters to vote, it is chasing away a few longtime voters.
"I'm about as disenchanted as I can get," John Chibnall, 30, said as held 8-month-old John Jr. outside Abraham Lincoln's tomb in Springfield. "You couldn't get three bigger dunderheads. I voted for Dukakis. This time, I'm not going to vote. A Republican's out of the question. Clinton's just mediocre. There's no reason to vote for him. He's the consumate politician. Perot? He's a skillful liar, very shrewd."
In Iowa, in the Winga Cafe in Washington, politics is as much a part of life as the corn, and not voting is unthinkable. Visitors are welcomed to town by being elected president of the coffee club, which meets promptly at 10 A.M., just as it has for 60 years, a mix of business leaders, farmers and retired people, all white men.
On a recent morning, the conversation was the Bushites vs. the Perotists, with most of the older men supporting Mr. Bush and the younger ones Mr. Perot.
"I don't think Perot is the paragon of virtue some people think he is," said Rolly Crandall. "I voted for Dukakis, and I might vote for Clinton."
Then a shout rang out: "You voted for Dukakis!"
Mr. Crandall hunched down in the booth. "I'm not sure who I'll support. I don't put much stock in the marital infidelity stuff with Clinton," he said. "But I'm just not sure he's up to the job."
 
'All Right' or Not?
 The 36 members of the breakfast club then interrupted politics to honor one of the members: "Happy Birthday, Dear Louis, Happy Birthday, to you."
"No Perot," Rick Hofer, 44, said the second the singing stopped. "He'll be a dictator. There's a big difference between government and business. It wouldn't work."
John Winga Jr., the owner of Winga's, called Mr. Perot "probably all right," then added: "I think experience is what's most important. I'd prefer to go with Bush."
The breakfast club then broke the bad news to its visitor. The club's president gets stuck with he tab for coffee: $8.32. But who's counting?
Eight younger members, all of whom voted for Mr. Bush in the last election, stopped on the way out to press the Perot case. "Let's face it," said Mike Moore, 45, who administers a health-care center, Mr. Bush is "not ahead on the issues. Health care is a disaster, the environment. Let's give Perot a shot."
Jim Logan, a 44-year-old jeweler, took the breakfast club's president aside -- the visitor from New York who had just paid the check ($8.32, but who's counting?) -- to inquire about Mario M. Cuomo. "Why didn't he run?" he asked. "He would have won it."
The New York Governor was brought up from to time by others in the Midwest, with sentiments decidedly mixed. At a Rotary Club dinner in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, William Layne said: "Once Clinton said Cuomo was a potential Supreme Court nominee, that wrote Clinton off for me. Cuomo doesn't think in a straight line."
 
On to Indianapolis
 From downtown Indianapolis, with its skyscrapers and black faces, rural Iowa seemed part of another world. But it was just as easy to get a political debate going among office workers and bus riders. Mr. Bush was detested here. But there was some support for Mr. Perot and some for Mr. Clinton, though it was not enthusiastic.
"I'd like to see Clinton campaign a little more in black neighborhoods; I'd like to see him sweat," said Jackie Bryant, 32, a service representative for Indiana Bell, who is black. "I think he overreacted on Sister Souljah. He doesn't understand from the heart. He didn't come from a family with eight kids like I did. It's all too easy for him. He's never had to put forth any effort. I want him to sweat."
Sadie Ellis, 62, standing nearby, agreed that she'd like to see Mr. Clinton kept dangling for a while. But she hinted that she would probably have to come around to him. "Perot is too smooth a talker," she said. "Clinton? There isn't much there. I'm not too sure. I can't say I won't vote for him, but----"
While many blacks said they had no real sympathy for the rap performer Sister Souljah, whom the Arkansas Governor criticized for making what he called racially-divisive remarks, they also said that they thought Mr. Clinton had overreacted, that he should not take their votes for granted, which they seemed to think he was doing.
"Clinton is better than Bush, but Perot is better than Clinton," said Keith Thomas, 20, who is unemployed. "Perot's a businessman. Maybe he can help us get the economy going. I'm a little bit frustrated about Sister Souljah. She's been around for a long time and she's frustrated. She's angry at what she's seen. Clinton should understand that. I'm not saying anybody should kill whites. But Clinton needs to understand the frustration. I follow his line, but only to a point."
 
Playing at Twilight
 In Fairview Park in Springfield, Ill., as the Little League teams played on into the summer twilight, parents sat on lawn chairs and bleachers, talking politics and watching their sons, their uniforms two sizes too big, hit and run. About a third of the parents, who were mostly white, supported Mr. Clinton. The rest were split between Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot.
"We voted for Bush last time, but I'm afraid with Bush we're not going to see any real change," said Brian Piersma, 44. "There's nothing coming out of the Democratic Party. The country's foundering economically, and Perot seems to have some fresh ideas."
At that point, Mary Ann Mulvey, 41, who voted last time for Mr. Dukakis, interrupted. "Perot? No way!" she said. "I haven't heard him say specifically what he'll do. He has no plan. Bush is out of the question. Just look at the state of the country. I favor Clinton. He's got some ideas, he just doesn't seam to be getting a hearing for them."
Said Matthew Clarke, 32: "Did she say Clinton? Clinton! How can anybody say that. There's nothing there. He wants to be President merely for the sake of being President. He has no purpose, no vision. If you don't like Bush, then go for Perot."
 
Would Lincoln Be Sad?
 Elsewhere in town, at Lincoln's tomb, the weekly summer flag-lowering ceremony had just ended. People, clearly moved by the ceremony and by a moment or two inside the burial chamber, seemed saddened by the state of American politics.
"You think about Lincoln and what a great man he was," Clyde Aymes, 43, a stockbroker, said in the twilight. "It's sad, really, where we are. None of them comes close. I think Perot is a fraud. It'll be Bush or Clinton. It's too bad. I'm not sure I'll vote."
He walked away, only to run back a few seconds later. "I'll vote, I'll vote," he said, as if his conscience had got to him. "You have to vote. Why are our choices always so limited? I can't believe there isn't someone better out there. Someone who's real."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Perot Turns to Professionals As Campaign Turns Rough

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 30

 BODY:
Amid tentative signs that the heady momentum of the last two months is beginning to flag, the undeclared candidacy of Ross Perot is moving into a new, more sophisticated phase, a top campaign official said today.
The official, James Squires, press secretary for the Perot Petition Committee, said in an interview that in the coming month the Texas billionaire would make greater use of professional political advisers to help his campaign, possibly put some campaign commercials on television and become more specific about his views. Such a shift would be a marked but expected departure from the campaign's almost exclusive reliance on enthusiastic but untutored volunteers, whose primary focus has been to gather enough signatures to try to qualify Mr. Perot for the ballot in the 50 states. 
 "We have to start doing something other than petition drives" Mr. Squires said.
 
Morning for Perot?
 In recent weeks, Edward J. Rollins, the co-manager of the Perot committee who is in charge of its day-to-day operations, has employed a number of professional political consultants to tackle chores like building crowds for rallies, conducting voter-registration drives and handling the hordes of reporters and camera crews covering Mr. Perot's public appearances. In addition, the Perot Committee has hired Hal Riney, a San Francisco advertising specialist who created the "Morning in America" theme for Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign.
Mr. Rollins has said that Mr. Perot would declare his candidacy in July, but Mr. Squires and Thomas W. Luce 3d, the committee's chairman, said today that no date had been set for such an announcement.
The change in complexion of Mr. Perot's effort comes at a time when a spate of public-opinion polls show a slowing of his meteoric rise and some embryonic doubts about the plausibility of a Perot Presidency. A Washington Post-ABC News nationwide poll conducted June 24 through June 28 placed Mr. Perot in a virtual dead heat with President Bush and Bill Clinton. In a similar poll conducted by the Post and ABC from May 31 to June, Mr. Perot led Mr. Bush by 6 points and Mr. Clinton by 10.
Other polls have shown a similar erosion of Mr. Perot's standing. In a telephone survey of 810 adults in 12 Southern states conducted June 21 through June 24 by The Atlanta Constitution, Mr. Perot tied for second place with Mr. Clinton, 10 points behind the President. In Massachusetts, a statewide poll of 400 registered voters conducted June 24 through June 26 indicated that the Dallas independent also trailed Mr. Clinton by a margin of 28 percent to 26 percent, with Mr. Bush third with 23 percent. Earlier this month, the same poll had Mr. Perot leading both his possible rivals by 13 points.
"It's like the bloom is off the rose," said Gerry Cherzinsky, president of KRC Communications Research, which conducted the Massachusetts poll for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV.
These polls suggest that Mr. Perot has been scarred in recent days by the bitter charges being flung back and forth between himself and surrogates for President Bush, and by a reluctance to provide clear answers to some pressing voter concerns.
"I think Bush's attacks have had an impact," Mr. Cherzinsky said. "My belief has always been that the more people know about Perot, the less people will like him. That's only normal for any politician."
Aides to Mr. Perot say they are not concerned about these polls, noting that the electorate has been extremely volatile all year and there are months to go before the election. "What we are seeing is not unexpected," Mr. Squires said. "When you go up in the polls as fast as he did, you're going to bump off the ceiling sometime."
Some political analysts say that Mr. Perot has perhaps also been hurt by his unwillingness to be specific on issues. That reluctance was on display Monday night. During an appearance on a 90-minute program on ABC-TV, Mr. Perot did not directly answer the question of whether he would allow homosexuals in the armed forces. And when asked whether he would sign the Freedom of Choice Act, which would provide a Federal statutory guarantee of abortion rights, he would say only that abortion was a woman's decision.
Mr. Perot also declined to specify how he would make good on his oft-stated view that the way to stop violence in the United States was to "get guns out of the hands of violent people".
Still, toward the end of the show, which featured questions from studio audiences in 10 cities, Mr. Perot virtually endorsed the economic proposals that had been put forward by Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination this year.
"What is the most impressive platform I've seen so far? Senator Tsongas's platform, 'An Economic Call to Arms,' " Mr. Perot said, brandishing the small booklet that Mr. Tsongas and his aides passed out at virtually every campaign stop. Mr. Perot added, "There's a lot of good ideas here."
Mr. Perot has been in accord with Mr. Tsongas on a number of economic issues, including a cut in the capital gains tax to spur investment and opposition to a middle-class tax cut. But as he left the ABC studios, Mr. Perot declined to answer a reporter's question of whether he favored a five-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, another of Mr. Tsongas' economic tenets.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Journal;
Quake Spares Buildings but Undermines Denials

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 30

 BODY:
When Joan Welles, an actress, tells people she is moving to Boston, she finds it necessary to add, "We're not leaving because of the earthquakes or the riots." And with that explanation she defines the difficult new reality of this balmy city by the sea.
"It's tough here, it's really tough," she said today, realizing the implications of her words. "When you have a child, you find yourself thinking twice: Do I really want to continue here with the smog and with the earthquakes and with the crime?" 
She said the strong earthquake last weekend and its aftershocks have shaken her calm, and that she now tells herself, "I guess we're getting out at the right time."
It may be because she is about to leave that Ms. Welles has been able to set aside the denial that is a way of life here in Los Angeles. But a number of other people said they had found the current round of earthquakes unusually disturbing.
"I tell you, practically every conversation I've had in the last two days started out with, 'How did you feel about these earthquakes?' " said Linda Wong, director of the Achievement Council, a nonprofit social agency.
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, who is a political analyst by profession, found broad implications in the latest earthquake and the fears it has aroused in a city still shaken by civil unrest.
"The earthquake is a metaphor for the shifting political, cultural, societal and economic ground," she said, referring to the recent rioting and the three-way Presidential race.
"There are not predictable patterns left, and I think this plays into things," she said.
Examining her own reactions as if she were analyzing an exit poll, she said: "It surprises me how on edge I am. My awareness has never been so heightened as it is now. I have mentally gone through my quake kit. I went out last night and filled up my gas tank. I now have a pair of shoes under my bed.
"I just came home from an appointment in Hollywood, and as I was driving in my own neighborhood, I unconsciously looked up to see whether there were any live wires around, just in case," said Ms. Jeffe, a political scientist. "Yesterday out driving, I was careful to urge my husband not to slow down as we went under underpasses. Sunday, I canceled a dinner in Malibu; I had nightmares of tootling along Pacific Coast Highway and being caught in a rock slide."
She paused to oberve herself with wonder. "You are talking to a Ph.D here, having her schedule and her life to some degree influenced, as it never has been, by apprehension."
But if the earth stops shaking over the next few days, Ms. Jeffe said, she will "shift again into blissful denial.
Donald C. Claussen, for example, a 38-year-old construction worker, said he views the world like this: "I know it's coming, but I haven't done much about it. I figure, if it kills me, it kills me. I mean, if a building falls on you, what can you do?"
Cindy L. Galvan, 18, put it this way: "I don't think they really know if the Big One is coming or not. You can't just be afraid all the time."
The alternative is to live in fear of electrical wires and highway overpasses, as Ms. Jeffe has been doing for the past few days, or like the man Ms. Welles said she knew who couldn't get earthquakes out of his mind.
"He was an older man," she said. "He got to the point where he was walking down one side of the street rather than the other to avoid falling telephone poles. It was very hard for him to stay here. He finally moved."
Though she said she had never been one to worry much about impending disaster, Ms. Welles said she now realized that she had been living with a symbol of terror that is particular to cities like Los Angeles: her child's earthquake kit.
Like thousands of other parents here, she had prepared for her daughter's preschool a packet with food, clothing, the names and addresses of relatives and photographs of herself and her husband to comfort her if the Big One hits.
"I'm going to pick up that kit when we leave," she said, "and that will be a great sense of relief."

HEADLINE: A State-Financed Boarding School Made Just for the Science-Deprived

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DURHAM, N. C.

 BODY:
Todd Rose was something of a misfit. A sturdily built teen-ager from a family swarming with farmers, he did not want to farm. He wanted to study science.
In his small town of Nashville, in tobacco and soybean country in eastern North Carolina, the local high school could offer him shop classes in plowing and welding but nothing in advanced science. 
 But Todd was a good-enough student to be accepted into the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics here, a public boarding school for bright students from around the state. He could pick from a banquet of academic delights -- genetics, anatomy, organic chemistry and fractal mathematics -- and even spend six hours a week at local hospitals, trailing cardiologists into operating rooms.
"That just blew my mind, that I was sitting here, at 17, looking at a person on a table while a doctor is explaining to me everything that's going on," Todd said. "It made me think this is something I want to do."
 
Example for Other States
 As it has done with Todd, the North Carolina School has cultivated hundreds of aspiring scientists after discovering them in the state's backwaters as well as its cities. Its success with those students since it opened in 1980 has inspired imitators in Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.
Together, say leading scientists and educators like Dr. Leon Lederman, these state-financed dormitory schools are one of the most potent antidotes to the country's deteriorating performance in science.
Dr. Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who founded the Illinois school, said that youngsters ardent about science often felt isolated at conventional schools and would withdraw into themselves, grow bored or even become discipline problems. By contrast, he said, those who go to specialized schools find that suddenly "everyone is like them, they don't have to hide, and they start to flower."
 
In the State's Self-Interest
 But the motivation for these pioneering states is far from altruism. They want to leapfrog their agrarian and blue-collar economies into the more scientific and technological world of the future.
Many of these largely rural states faced a policy maker's Catch 22. Without a scientifically literate population, they could not lure advanced industries like those dealing with computers and pharmaceuticals. Yet with their old-fashioned industries, they lacked the tax base to give every school the laboratories and trained teachers could produce a scientifically literate population.
"You can get a ninth-grade education and work in a cigarette factory for the rest of your life," said Dr. William W. Youngblood, an administrator at the North Carolina School. "You can't get a ninth-grade education and work in a pharmaceutical company. You're frozen out of the 21st century."
North Carolina, which had long ranked near the bottom on almost every educational measure, decided to concentrate its resources on a single state school. Wealthy people had long sent their children to private boarding schools, but would the population of a largely rural state be willing to finance a public one?
In 1980 North Carolina opened the nation's first government-financed residential high school, but it had been a hard sell. The state's expense for the first four years was $19 million.
Because of smaller class sizes, sophisticated science equipment and, most of all, room and board, a single student's education at the school costs $12,000 a year, four times the amount spent on a conventional student. And there there were complaints from school boards that the school would skim off their best students for its enrollment of 550.
The school's proponents had to promise to train teachers from around the state and generate curriculums and textbooks that other schools could use. Also, arguing that the school's graduates would provide skilled employees for the many research-driven companies in the college-saturated area around Durham, they attracted $7 million from those companies in the school's first four years, for building renovation and new laboratories.
The payoff came in 1989, when a student, Celeste Posey of Cary, submitted her DNA research project to the prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search and finished fifth in the nation. Two years later, another student, Ashley Reiter of Charlotte, took first place for her project in fractals, winning $40,000.
Less glorious but perhaps more prized by the school is the roster of graduates who go on to become scientists and engineers. A survey showed that of the 1,349 students who graduated from 1982 to 1989, 80 percent went on to major in science and engineering.
Despite this record, however, funding the school remains an issue of perennial debate in the Legislature.
Situated in a Spanish-style 16-building campus that had been a decaying county hospital, the school has its own observatory and greenhouse and a laboratory outfitted with gel boxes and transilluminators for cutting-edge research on DNA.
The staff of 58 is as exceptional as the school's courses and equipment. Half the teachers come from colleges or private industry, and 37 percent hold doctorates.
To attract such people, the school's founders had to persuade the state to exempt it from normal teacher certification requirements; this was accomplished through a gimmick: the school was designated a branch of the state university system.
The teachers earn $23,000 to $43,000 a year, about the same as colleagues with similar education levels in the rest of the state. Many said they were drawn by the chance of working with exceptionally bright youngsters in the high school's intimate ambience.
Though many of the teachers have never before taught in high school, they often bring a firsthand grasp of their fields. Stephen J. Warshaw, for example, came after a career as a government water-quality expert.
On a muggy late-spring day, he took his ecology class to the Eno River, a shimmering stream in the piney woods nearby. Slogging into the shallow water, they used rigidly framed nets to jog aquatic insects from under rocks, and then identified the creatures using microscopes and charts arranged by body traits.
Trekking back to school, 17-year-old Julie Bass confided why she could not have had such a satisfying scientific experience back home in Asheville.
"First of all, we wouldn't have ecology," she said. "Second of all, we wouldn't have a field trip. In that school, everything is from a textbook."
 
Days of Cerebral Fun
 In Kevin G. Bartkovich's class, where the air is thick with terms like bifurcation trees and iterations, students are not just learning mathematics, they are also practically inventing it. Dr. Bartkovich teaches a class in fractals, one of only a handful in the country. Fractals, a word that did not exist 20 years ago, is a mathematical tool for imposing order on the seemingly chaotic geometry of mountain ranges, clouds, even lung tissue -- and is also a fertile field for just plain cerebral fun.
"It's not as though there's this well-defined theory we can learn," Mr. Bartkovich said outside his class. "People are still figuring out what this is all about."
The North Carolina School admits only juniors and seniors, because the founders believed that sophomores were too young to flourish on their own, away from home. It tries to balance race, sex and state geography, using a 24-member admissions committee that is itself diverse, and judging students on interviews as well as grades.
In 1992, 47 percent of the students were female. In proportions that roughly mirror the state's ethnic breakdown, 23 percent of the study body was black, 10 percent Asian, 2 percent Indian and 1 percent Hispanic. Ninety-four of the state's 100 counties were represented.
 
Changes From a Tiny Town
 The school has provided a haven for young people who might have felt out-of-place in their hometown schools. Julie Woosley, an effervescent 1986 alumna who is now a chemist at the Research Triangle Institute here, recalled that back home in Cullowhee, population 1,200, the physics teacher was about one month ahead of the class.
"We did not have chalk or paper, but the football team had a VCR and a wide-screen TV so they could see tapes of how they played," she said. "When I got to Science and Math, the thing that impressed me the most was that there were people who were curious about current events, religion, you name it."
For those singleminded about science, the most compelling classes are in research. After a crash course in deciphering scientific treatises, using the Duke University library, the biology research students learn how to distinguish varieties of bacteria, inject pathogens into plants and separate strands of DNA.
Once they are ready to tackle a professional-scale project, the school offers them two commodities they could not get in most public high schools -- space and time. It has laboratories restricted to research students, where they can be sure their agar plates and fish tanks will not be disturbed by the general stream of students.
Elizabeth Smith, 17, of Ayden, has been investigating the impact of nitrogen deficiency on plants she grows in the greenhouse. "At home we don't have the chemicals I need, we don't have a greenhouse, we don't have the money for vermiculite or pebbles," she said. "Before I came here, I was thinking about being an architect. Now I'm thinking about botany."
North Carolina Science and Math also has a less demanding program than research to give students a feel for careers in science. Like Todd Rose, who now wants to be a neurosurgeon, students are paired with researchers and doctors at nearby universities or at technological companies in Research Triangle Park.
Most students seem to thrive in the residential atmosphere. The dorm rooms are as unkempt as their college prototypes, except that the objects scattered about are closer to childhood -- a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh or a Happy Birthday balloon. In one boy's room, a picture of Einstein is next to one of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.
Students wander into each other's rooms to work through baffling math questions or to gossip or just get relief from the homesickness that many feel from being away about nine months a year. Each year, about 10 percent of the starting juniors return home to their local schools.
"Many of these kids have made nothing but 98 and 99," said Mr. Warshaw, who becomes principal next year. "Then they come here and get a C on their first test, they realize they're not at the top of the heap anymore and that's a big adjustment."
Yet most students eventually get A's and B's and go to respected colleges. Two-thirds attend college within the state, a fact that has vindicated the chauvinistic founders.
"We tell students they are here as the seedcorn of North Carolina's future," said Dr. John J. Friedrick, the school's executive director.

Scott Sanderson throws pitches that should be hit. They float to the plate with incredible ease and look delicious to batters. Until they tap the ball 90 feet, miss it totally or pop it up harmlessly. Just like the Royals did last night.
Sanderson was dominant without looking menacing, and his assortment of change-ups, sliders, forkballs, fastballs and curveballs mesmerized a Kansas City club that had accumulated 33 hits and 16 runs in its preceding two games. 
 With Sanderson limiting the Royals to four hits, Don Mattingly smacking two singles, a double and a homer, and Mel Hall, Pat Kelly and Matt Nokes also smashing homers, the Yankees whisked to a 6-0 victory at Yankee Stadium.
That Sanderson painted corners and never exceeded 89 miles an hour on the radar pitching gun is nothing new. But his stellar performance was opportune because it prevented the Yankees from sliding four games below .500 for the first time this year.
 
Putting Things Together
 By tossing his first shutout of the season, Sanderson lowered his e.r.a. to 4.49, after it had been above 4.90 since mid-April. He threw an economical 86 pitches, 60 of which were strikes, did not walk a batter and retired 27 of 31 hitters.
"Scott put it all together tonight," said the pitching coach, Mark Connor. "That's as pretty as you can do it."
While Sanderson was completing his first shutout in nearly a year, Mattingly gave a glimpse of his old self with his first four-hit game since Sept. 12, 1989, a span of 431 games. Mattingly extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the first, then he doubled in the fourth, hit his ninth homer of the season in the sixth and added an r.b.i. single in the seventh.
Since he was switched to fourth in the batting order June 12, Mattingly is hitting .372 to raise his average to .272.
But Mattingly still declines to talk much about his hitting, even now that it has become more robust. He has said since the spring that he wants to let his hitting do the talking for him. Last night, it was a gorgeous speech as Mattingly sprayed hits to all parts of the field.
 
Silence, Everyone
 "I want to go out there, put up the numbers and just play ball," said Mattingly. "All I want to do is let the game come to me. Hopefully, I can silence some people and show them I can still play."
One magazine has called the 31-year-old Mattingly over the hill. It upset him, and he has not forgotten it.
"That was an insult," Mattingly said. "I don't feel that in my heart, but if someone feels that way, it's an insult."
No one was insulting Sanderson after he allowed no runner to reach third base and only two to make it to second.
"There is satisfaction," said Sanderson, after notching the club's first complete-game victory. "I don't know if it is any more special."
Pat Kelly made only his third start in 17 games and gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the third by belting his third homer, off Mark Gubicza. Hall rocked his team-high 11th homer in the seventh to boost the lead to 4-0. Each homer was slammed on the first pitch. Nokes continued the trend and tied Hall for the team lead by hitting a first-pitch homer off Neal Heaton to start the eighth.
 
Some Joy Returns
 With another game less than 15 hours away, players rushed home after the victory. Sanderson had to pick up his nephew at the airport in Newark, and Mattingly dressed quickly after speaking to reporters. But first he conceded that the joy had gone out of baseball at times last season. It was back last night in a big way.
"The one thing I've always enjoyed is the baseball," Mattingly said. "I want to play the game the way it was supposed to be played and then go home."
Then he left.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees are expected to try remedying their starting pitching woes by recalling BOB WICKMAN from Class AAA Columbus soon, club officials said. The right-hander is 9-2 with a 2.09 e.r.a. and has held hitters to a .194 batting average. Wickman might start Monday, and JEFF JOHNSON (2-3, 6.25 e.r.a.) will probably be dropped from the rotation. "It's not good enough right now," said General Manager GENE MICHAEL. "We just haven't finalized plans. We'll be discussing things to get it better." . . . Outfielder JESSE BARFIELD underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged tissue in his left wrist Tuesday and will miss four to eight weeks. . . . BRIAN McRAE robbed MATT NOKES of a three-run homer by leaping above the center-field fence in the fourth.

KYOEI STEEL OF JAPAN AGREES TO BUY FLORIDA STEEL CORP.

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Kyoei Steel Ltd. has agreed to buy the Florida Steel Corporation, the nation's largest maker of concrete-reinforcing steel bars. Kyoei, one of Japan's largest makers of steel bars, said it would pay an estimated $350 million for FLS Holdings Inc., the parent of the Tampa-based company. Kyoei agreed to buy many of the company's outstanding bonds and pay some of its bank debt. 
 The purchase ends about two years of financial struggles for Florida Steel, which has been hurting from the recession and the debt it took on in a 1988 leveraged buyout. Kyoei Steel, based in Hirakata, Japan, said it did not plan to alter the company's name, staff or managers. Florida Steel, which has annual sales of more than $463 million, was negotiating with lenders to ease the debt from its $306 million buyout. As of April, it defaulted on more than $5 million in payments to banks.

Banking: Bright Spot Stands Out In Quarter

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
You can bank on it.
In fact, if that was your investment strategy in 1992, you have probably done quite well. Otherwise, it hasn't been much of a year so far.
In the second quarter of 1992, an unlamented period that saw more stocks go down than up in price, while Wall Street kept looking for signs of economic recovery, the bank stocks starred. 
 The Nasdaq bank index, a collection of mostly regional banks, zipped up 11.8 percent in the quarter, and has risen 26.3 percent this year. Of the 18 best-performing stocks on Nasdaq in the second quarter, 16 of them, including all of the top 7, are banks. And big banks also moved up. Bank of Boston gained 36 percent in the quarter, while Citicorp added 29 percent.
The reasons for that good performance include takeovers and, in some cases, relief that a bank whose survival had seemed shaky now looks as if it will make it. But the Federal Reserve has played the largest role. The Fed's efforts may or may not prove sufficient to produce a decent recovery, but the strategy of pushing down short-term interest rates has raised profit margins and saved a lot of money for banks.
 
Wall Street's Beliefs
 In addition, there is a belief on Wall Street that bank mergers will drive down costs and push up profits for years to come. Chemical Banking, which is digesting its acquisition of Manufacturers Hanover, rose 13.4 percent and by the end of the quarter was being hailed by Thomas Hanley, First Boston's bank analyst, as a growth stock.
Unfortunately, there is more to the stock market than bank shares, and the rest of the list was something less than scintillating. Areas like health care and pharmaceuticals did poorly, and there were disturbing signs that consumers are not especially eager to spend their money.
The Standard & Poor's 500 edged up 1.1 percent in the quarter, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.6 percent, but the Nasdaq composite fell 6.7 percent, despite the big gains by banks and smaller ones by other types of financial stocks.
 
Sensitive to Economy
 Among the Dow stocks, economically sensitive stocks continued to do well, as investors showed they were willing to bet that the recovery will endure, come what may. General Motors was the best performer of the Dow 30 for the second consecutive quarter, rising 20.1 percent after adding 26.8 percent in the first three months of 1992. Double-digit gains were also shown by I.B.M., at 17.2 percent; McDonald's, at 15.4 percent, and Exxon, at 13 percent.
The worst performers of the Dow 30 had one thing in common: a dependence on consumers. Woolworth sagged 12.1 percent, Sears, Roebuck slipped 11.4 percent and Procter & Gamble dropped 10 percent.
Carriage Inc., the Big Board's best performer (among common stocks that began the quarter at $5 or more), reported rising profits from its carpet operations, but a part of its 93 percent rise came on the news that Carriage's chief executive and principal shareholder, Clarence E. Harris, was suffering from prostate cancer. The company has a large insurance policy on his life, most of whose proceeds will be used to repurchase his stock.
The three worst performers on the Big Board for the quarter were all dependent on the clothing business, and found it tough. Financially troubled Gitano, the maker of women's clothing, fell 61 percent, while Aileen, a maker and retailer of clothes, dropped 59 percent and Fabri-Centers, a retailer of fabrics and patterns, fell 55 percent.
In 1991, some of the best stocks to own were small growth stocks. There were exceptions, but in many cases they were among the worst this year. The Nasdaq industrial average, which is dominated by technology companies, fell 11 percent.
Lately, it appears that many on Wall Street are giving up on such companies. Mutual fund investors, who poured money in earlier in the year, started to take cash out of some funds specializing in such stocks last month, but the funds still have large amounts of cash available for investment, largely because the fund managers have hesitated to buy stocks. And the short-sellers who bet against stocks have piled up big positions.

HEADLINE: Purchasers See Signs of Slow Growth

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Economic growth among manufacturers slowed somewhat in June, according to a survey of the nation's purchasing managers. Economists contend that the survey indicates that the rebound from recession will be gradual and drawn out.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its index of economic activity had fallen to 52.8 percent in June, from 56.3 percent in May. The decline was largely a result of slower growth in production and new orders. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting, the group says, while a reading above 50 is a sign of expansion. 
 "Since the index and its major components were at or above 50 percent, it seems that the economy is still expanding, although slowly," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Federal Reserve governor and president of the Washington economic consulting firm Brimmer & Company. "It appears that the slowdown in economic growth has been broadly based. Since the trend has been upward over the last few months, I expect that the expansion will continue, although at a moderate rate."
 
Wide Range of Companies
 The monthly index is compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers at a wide range of industrial companies. It is considered important because it is the first significant indicator of economic activity in the previous month.
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the puchasing managers survey committee and director of corporate purchasing for Pitney Bowes Inc., said the data continued to indicate economic growth. "However, the torrid pace of growth in May has clearly cooled in June," Mr. Bretz said. "Nevertheless, the sustained high level of growth in new orders strongly suggests that the economy will continue to grow in the third quarter."
The association's index of new orders slipped to 58.3 percent, from 61 percent in May. The new-orders index is considered the most important of the indexes because it directly affects the level of production in the months that follow.
New orders for exports followed a similar path. The index of orders for exports slid to 51.9 percent, from 56.9 percent in May. Imports fell in June after growing in the previous three months. The index of imports fell to 49.5 percent, from 53 percent in May.
The association's production index dropped to 56.4 percent, from 62.9 percent in May. Economists said the drop in the index reflected a decline in new orders in April.

HEADLINE: Hughes Fails to Fulfill Hopes Of G.M. for Counterbalance

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1

 BODY:
It was for times like these, when auto sales are slow, that the General Motors Corporation bought the Hughes Aircraft Company six years ago. Pentagon orders for military goods, it was reasoned, could be counted on regardless of lean economic times.
What was not foreseen, however, was the full impact of the end of the cold war. 
 Now, after Tuesday's announcement that G.M. would take a $749.4 million write-off and cut 9,000 workers from Hughes, analysts say Hughes will cause a second-quarter loss for the troubled auto maker. What is more, many analysts, though declining to speak for the record, rate the Hughes acquisition a waste of capital, noting that G.M. would be in far better financial shape today if it could spend the $5.2 billion it spent on Hughes on retrenching of North American automotive operations, which lost nearly $8 billion last year.
"We had been predicting a G.M. net profit in the second quarter of about $500 million, but now we're looking toward a net loss of about $250 million," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
G.M. earned a slim $179 million in the first quarter, after posting a $4.55 billion loss for last year. G.M. will announce its earnings for its second quarter, which ended Tuesday, later this month.
G.M. bought Hughes six years ago for $5.2 billion in cash and stock, winning an auction against the Ford Motor Company, the Boeing Company and others.
William Winters, a G.M. spokesman, reiterated the auto maker's stance that it has no intention of selling Hughes, although it is divesting other nonautomotive businesses to concentrate effort and capital on cars and trucks.
Hughes said the cutbacks will save about $700 million a year in cost and position the company for stronger financial results in the future. C. Michael Armstrong, Hughes's chairman, said he hoped to broaden commercial applications of the company's high-technology abilities.
Bruce McCristal, a spokesman for G.M. Hughes Electronics, said the subsidiary had earned a cumulative $4.31 billion since the acquisition. But with meager overall profits last year, G.M. has pursued alternative financing, selling $2 billion worth of common stock two months ago to raise cash.
G.M.'s common stock lost $1 a share today, closing at $43 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in G.M. Hughes, known as G.M. class H stock, lost $3.25 each, closing at $22.625 on the Big Board.
G.M. bought Hughes to take advantage of its expertise in high-technology systems integration, optics and other fields that might be useful in automotive research and development.
But the acquisition, a pet project of Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s chairman at the time, was born in controversy. Ross Perot, then a G.M. director, opposed the acquisition because he said the price was too high, particularly in light of Soviet overtures for mutual arms reduction. Mr. Perot, who left G.M. in 1986, was the lone G.M. director to vote against it.
Since then, Hughes engineers have helped G.M. automotive engineers on a number of projects, including development of the Impact battery-powered car prototype. Mr. McCristal said Hughes engineers had completed installing half of a satellite network to 9,700 G.M. dealers. It will be complete in two years.
Still, Hughes Aircraft has failed to produce solid earnings for as long as G.M. has owned it. Analysts cannot calculate precisely how much Hughes has earned on its own because its results are lumped together with those of several Delco Electronics subsidiaries, which G.M. already owned.
Delco and Hughes were joined as part of the acquisition financing package, which paid the Howard Hughes Medical Institute $2.7 billion in cash and $2.5 billion worth of a new class of G.M. stock, G.M. class H.
Soon thereafter, the acquisition dissolved into a squabble between G.M. and the medical institute, which contended that class H stock did not pay adequate dividends -- dividends depended on earnings -- and there was an inadequate public market in which to sell the stock. The squabble was settled in early 1989 when G.M. paid the institute almost $1 billion and agreed to buy back much, if not most, of the class H stock.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Too High? Export a Few Lawyers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
In a perverse confirmation of American competitiveness in at least one sector of the economy, the nation's capital in one day created an export that could reduce the trade deficit by $100 million or more during the next 12 months.
It consists of legal and lobbying services to be contracted by the 21 foreign countries and 47 foreign steel companies who must defend themselves against the trade complaints filed here on Tuesday by struggling United States steel producers. To avoid punitive customs duties of up to 165 percent on shipments to the United States, each company and each country has hired or plans to hire at least one Washington law firm. 
 The firms charge $500,000 to $3 million for such jobs, with the average bill paid by a company or a government likely to run around $1 million, lawyers involved on both sides of the cases said.
Add this to the $20 million war chest that the nation's six major steel companies have assembled to file and fight the cases, and the new trade war over steel imports, at roughly $120 million, is almost certain to be the most expensive ever fought.
These cases "dwarf anything that has come before," said Alan W. Wolff, the partner at Dewey Ballantine who filed the American steel cases together with Robert E. Lighthizer, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Even $120 million may be a low estimate.
"I'd be surprised if it weren't over $100 million on the other side," Mr. Wolff said.
Dewey Ballantine and Skadden, Arps together buried the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission's dockets with two million pages of documents in 650 boxes on Tuesday.
The work available for trade lawyers and lobbyists in fighting and filing trade complaints surged last year and again this year, after a low of just 44 complaints were filed in 1990. American trade law makes it easier during a recession to convince the International Trade Commission that an industry is in trouble and needs protection from imports.
The bonanza has spawned a feeding frenzy among Washington law firms, as lawyers idled by the slump in corporate mergers and acquisitions now gallop after foreign steel clients. "This is a fat pig, and they all want a slice of it," Mr. Lighthizer said. "Every single person in town will be working on this, every single one."
When a dozen senators and representatives joined the nation's top steel executives for a news conference in the Capitol building on Tuesday to announce the 84 trade complaints against imported steel, they found themselves addressing a room filled with uninvited trade lawyers.
Eager for a list of the foreign steel companies being sued, the lawyers, who bill at rates of $100 or more an hour, had already grabbed many of the 150 press kits prepared by the steel companies' public relations firm, the Sawyer Miller Group. Well trained from long years of waiting outside Congressional hearing rooms for seats, other lawyers and their aides stood two or three abreast in a line down the marble corridor and around the corner.
Defending against a trade complaint is lucrative because it requires thousands of hours of legal and economic analysis, as each company tries to prove that it does not receive illegal government subsidies and is not exporting steel at unfairly low prices. Many foreign companies do not follow American accounting practices, and even American trade law does not always follow generally accepted accounting practices, so, much of the work involves translating companies' costs and prices into the unusual language of American trade complaints.
 
Strategies to Get Work
 Washington lawyers still without steel clients are busily devising strategies to woo them. Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, which is already representing steel pipe producers in Argentina in a trade case filed earlier this year, retained a public relations firm in an effort to have its lawyers quoted as experts.
David P. Houlihan, a partner at the firm, said that was easier than calling complete strangers and asking them for work. "I just couldn't do that, the cold call," he said.
Other law firms are more brash. Sandra Wright, an international trade analyst at Donovan Leisure, Rogovin, Huge & Schiller, called a reporter two hours before the news conference on Tuesday in search of an early list of foreign steel companies to call.
While Donovan Leisure has traditionally concentrated on corporate law, it hopes to expand into trade, she explained.
Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy is likely to represent the biggest Dutch and German steel producers, while Willkie Farr & Gallagher will probably represent Brazilian steel producers and at least one Japanese company.
 
The Two Favorites
 But among the biggest beneficiaries from the steel cases are likely to be Dewey Ballantine and Skadden, Arps. Dewey Ballantine was successful when it represented American lumber producers seeking to impose punitive duties on lumber shipments from Canada, and the firm will be pulling lawyers away from general litigation to fight the steel case, Mr. Wolff said.
Skadden, Arps is drafting lawyers from its tax and environmental sections for the case, Mr. Lighthizer said. Neither firm would say how many lawyers they are putting on the case and for how long.
The risks of not paying generously to contest a trade suit were recently illustrated by Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and three other former Soviet republics. When accused of selling uranium in the United States below production costs, officials in the six republics tried to fill out the thousands of pages of necessary paperwork with little outside help.
In a tentative ruling on May 29, the Commerce Department said the republics had failed to return some forms and had botched others. So the department assumed that production costs in the republics were roughly comparable to costs in Canada, Britain and Namibia, and assessed a customs duty of 116 percent.
 
Diplomats Unhappy
 The decision appalled the State Department because it could wipe out shipments of a product that accounted for an eighth of the entire Soviet Union's exports to the United States last year. The Commerce Department issued its verdict days after Kazakhstan had agreed to renounce strategic nuclear weapons, and at a time of rising concern that the republics' nearly bankrupt nuclear industry might be driven by financial desperation into doing business with Iran and other potentially dangerous third world nations.
But the ruling was quietly welcomed by Washington trade lawyers as yet another reminder to the rest of the world that their skills are very much needed.

HEADLINE: Council Held Likely to Bar Waste Project

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration's plan to build a $550 million incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- one of the most bitterly contested public works projects in New York's history -- will almost certainly be rejected by the City Council before it adjourns next week.
The Council action would send the city's carefully crafted solid-waste management plan into chaos and probably force Mayor David N. Dinkins to negotiate a new agreement by the end of the month, when it must be presented to state officials. 
 The plan is the city's blueprint for disposing of garbage over the next 20 years through a complicated mix of recycling, efforts to reduce waste and the addition of at least one major incinerator, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
The plan's many vocal opponents object mostly to the new incinerator. But the administration and its supporters say that solutions that do not include incinerators are unrealistic. In the next two weeks, the Dinkins administration, if it cannot find the votes to defeat a veto, will have to find a compromise, possibly by delaying construction at the Navy Yard or by adding funds to hasten the recycling program.
 
Assessing the Votes
 Council members who oppose the plan said at a City Hall news conference yesterday that they were certain of at least 30 votes, enough to defeat the incinerator project and only 5 fewer than are necessary to override any mayoral attempt to reinstate it.
"There is no support for this program, which is really just an expensive incineration plan," said a Council member from Brooklyn, Steven DiBrienza. "What the city needs is much more recycling. We cannot have a plan that puts the emphasis on burning trash."
The final bill will depend largely on whether Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, takes an active position. So far, he has not spoken forcefully on the issue.
Mr. Dinkins, who supports the incinerator plan but has never forcefully campaigned for it, said it was still too soon to gauge the eventual outcome. But if the plan is spurned by the Council, which has sought to greatly expand the city's faltering recycling program, it will be a critical defeat for Mr. Dinkins and his newly appointed Sanitation Commissioner, Emily Lloyd. It will also present the most vivid example yet of how politically treacherous it has become to attempt to construct incinerators in New York, or most other American cities.
Some environmentalists say the plan, the city's first comprehensive solid-waste program in 20 years, places far too much emphasis on burning New York's enormous daily load of garbage and not enough on recycling it.
 
Remarkable Amounts
 There have been two types of opponents to the incinerator in the past: those advocates who believe that incinerators should be banned always no matter what the alternatives are, and those environmentalists who say that if the city cannot afford to invest heavily in both recycling and incineration, it should rely on the first. Increasingly over the last year, the two groups have merged to oppose the Navy Yard.
But others, including Ms. Lloyd and the State Environmental Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, warn that the city generates such remarkable amounts of waste -- nearly 28,000 tons a day -- that nearly every way of disposing it -- recycling, incineration and burying it in landfills -- will be necessary.
"The Council wants us to be able to tell them we are on the verge of a real crisis," Ms. Lloyd said. "And the crisis is not going to be here tomorrow. But it's as if they need rats frolicking on garbage bags before they can appreciate the critical issues we must face."
The city will close two major sections of its Fresh Kills landfill by the end of next year. Congress is considering legislation that would sharply curtail the amount of garbage New York can ship to landfills in other states. And tipping fees -- the charges for sending garbage to the landfills -- have risen rapidly and are expected to continue to climb.
All that, and the certainty that within 5 to 20 years the Fresh Kills lanfill will close completely, has forced New York to plan for the future. If the city fails to produce an acceptable program, the State Environmental Conservation Department can suspend permits for current landfills and decline to issue new permits, including those for any future recycling centers. While such action is unlikely, its practical effect would be to prevent all development in the city.
 
Quality of Life
 "If the leaders of New York City continue to believe that there is some magic solution to its waste problems, they risk causing a very substantial decline in the quality of life there," Mr. Jorling said.
Mr. Jorling has not taken a position on the specific Navy Yard incinerator because, he said, it would be improper since he must rule on permits. But he has made clear that he believes the city will need to explore all options for disposing of waste. And he added that if the incinerator was rejected this month, it might be necessary to begin the lengthy approval process all over should the city wish to try again to build it.
But opponents of the incinerator say the city has never made a real commitment to recycling and they contend that unless it is stripped of other alternatives, it never will.
The recycling advocates insist that if after aggressive recycling the city still need to find other solutions, they will reconsider their opposition to incinerators.
"The city wants to do everything at the same time," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "We are convinced for poltical and economic reasons that the city has failed and will continue to fail at trying to do both. It's time to recycle first."

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 35.58 On Hopes of Fed Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Speculation that the Federal Reserve might ease its monetary policy helped propel stock prices broadly higher yesterday, reviving a rally that began at the start of the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 35.58 points, to 3,354.10, bringing its net gain since the end of last week to 71.69 points. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,217 to 548 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.74 points, to 412.88.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 214.3 million shares, against 201 million on Tuesday.
The rally extended to secondary stocks as well. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues gained 5.39 points, to 568.99, while the American Stock Exchange's market- value index rose 3.73, to 383.01.
 
Waiting for Employment Data
 The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee met this week, and analysts have been debating the chances for new moves to ease credit conditions.
Many analysts believe the Fed's decision will be influenced by the latest data on unemployment, scheduled to be released this morning.
If the figures point to continued sluggishness in the economic recovery, the central bank would presumably have a new incentive to nudge short-term interest rates lower.
"Nonfarm payroll employment should show its fifth consecutive monthly gain in June," said Peter Greenbaum at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "However, this increase, like the May preliminary data, should be quite modest."
Those expectations were reinforced yesterday with a monthly report from corporate purchasing executives showing a drop in the pace of the manufacturing sector's growth last month.
On the Big Board, gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2 1/2, at 76; Merck, up 7/8, at 49 5/8; I.B.M., up 3/8, at 98 1/4; Boeing, up 1 1/4, at 41 1/8, and A.T.& T., up 3/4, at 43 3/4.
I.B.M. was one of the stocks chosen by Shearson Lehman Brothers for its midyear list of "10 uncommon values in common stocks."
Among other issues, BankAmerica rose 3/8, to 44 3/4; Chemical Banking 3/4, to 37 7/8; Autozone 1 3/8, to 29 3/8; Forest Laboratories 1, to 33, and Royal Dutch Petroleum 1, to 88 5/8.
Bradlees ranked among the volume leaders, trading at 12 1/2 after an initial public offering of 11 million shares of the stock by the Stop and Shop Companies.
Quarterdeck Office Systems lost more than half its value, plunging 6 3/4, to 5 5/8, as the most-active issue in Nasdaq over-the-counter trading. The computer software company estimated its earnings dropped sharply in the quarter that ended Tuesday.
Among other over-the-counter technology stocks, Novell gained 2, to 55 1/4; Intel 1, to 58; Microsoft 2 1/8, to 72 1/8, and Oracle Systems 2 1/8, to 17 3/8. Late Tuesday, Oracle reported sharply higher profits.
Securities-industry issues advanced as the bull market for both stocks and bonds showed signs of reviving. Morgan Stanley rose 1 1/8, to 51 1/4; Merrill Lynch 7/8, to 51 3/8; Paine Webber 1/2 to 22 1/8; Bear Stearns 1/2, to 17, and Charles Schwab 7/8, to 24 3/8.
Louisiana-Pacific, up 1/4 at 46 1/2, touched a new high. The company said it expected its 1992 earnings to live up to analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: Millionaire Adding Unpredictability to a Campaign

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., July 1

 BODY:
Here in this state of shuttered factories, collapsed banks and wilted real-estate investments, the campaign for the United States Senate seat held by Christopher J. Dodd has taken an unexpected turn with the entry of a Republican candidate some consider a Connecticut strain of Ross Perot.
His name is Charles Senter Johnson Jr., but he prefers to be known as Brook, a childhood nickname. A millionaire several times over, he runs a towel and bedding company called C. S. Brooks, lives in an exclusive enclave of this well-to-do Fairfield County suburb, where his neighbors are people like Ivan Lendl, and swings a polo mallet for recreation.
 
'A Dose of Success'
 And to counter the fact that a month ago the mention of his name drew blank stares from nearly everyone considered important in state politics, he has already spent $160,000 on television ads that depict him as an earnest, smiling executive in shirt-sleeves and describe him as "a dose of success Washington needs." 
 Mr. Johnson, 45 years old, has no political experience, local or national, and readily admits it. But he insists that his career in the textile business, which he says began at age 16 on the factory floor at the American Thread Company in Willimantic, has given him the skills he needs for the Senate.
"What is politics but business?" he said in a recent interview at his company headquarters-turned-command center here. "It's just the business of government."
Many here believe that Mr. Johnson has turned the Senate race into a contest that will be determined by who can spend the most to reach voters. He has refused to say exactly how much of his own money he plans to spend, but has said he expects his campaign to cost $4 million, considerably more than the $2.5 million to $3 million that statewide candidates usually spend here.
Mr. Dodd, 48, a Democrat, is seeking a third term. A poll of 500 state residents done for The Hartford Courant and the Institute for Social Inquiry at the University of Connecticut in May found that 42 percent of those polled viewed Senator Dodd favorably. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 5 percentage points.
The same poll found that few people knew anything about his Republican challengers, State Representative Christopher B. Burnham, a Stamford Republican whose campaign video makes much of his service in the Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf war, and the former Connecticut House minority leader, Robert G. Jaekle of Stratford. (Mr. Johnson did not declare his candidacy until the last week of May.) A fourth contender, a schoolteacher from New Fairfield, William G. Hare, is running as a citizen candidate for the Republican nomination.
Citing money problems, Mr. Jaekle dropped out of the race on June 16 and threw his support to Mr. Johnson, saying he thought Mr. Johnson had a better chance against Mr. Dodd.
 
Given Pause by War Chest
 While rejecting the idea that money will determine who represents Connecticut in the Senate, the other candidates are clearly given pause by Mr. Johnson's wealth.
"Anybody who's going to spend $4 million, you'd better take seriously," Senator Dodd said in a telephone interview. He added: "The idea that the Senate seat has a 'for sale' sign on it is, I think, offensive to people. In Connecticut, you win Senate seats the old-fashioned way. You earn them."
Mr. Burnham, an investment banker who has promised to walk across Connecticut to make himself known to voters, has similar feelings. "Johnson has the ability to write himself a check," he said, "but I have a million dollars in sweat-equity. Much more than money, what matters is your vision, your volunteers."
As for Mr. Jaekle's decision to support Mr. Johnson instead of him, Mr. Burnham, who has a war chest of about $300,000, compared with more than $1.5 million for Mr. Dodd, seems unconcerned. "I think Bob was impressed with the money," he said.
Mr. Johnson insists that he is not a bottomless pit, financially speaking. "It's a stretch," he said. "It's a sacrifice. I have some friends who could write some big checks, but the law won't let them."
His reasons for entering the race are straightforward, he said: "I decided that like a lot of people, you spend a lot of time complaining about the problems in Washington. But very few people want to sacrifice their life style to try and change the system."
Others take a different view.
"When all is said and done, Brook Johnson will ride off on his polo pony into the sunset," said Edward L. Marcus, the state Democratic chairman. "No one begrudges him having made a lot of money. I think it's wonderful. But I don't think it says much to the guy worried about job security or making the mortgage payment on his house. This indicates somebody who has an enormous ego and wants to buy his way into the election."
 
Consensus on Abortion Rights
 For the most part, the major candidates line up similarly on several major issues. Mr. Dodd, Mr. Burnham and Mr. Johnson all favor abortion rights, and all three say creating jobs in the state is a priority.
Mr. Dodd has become a target for Republicans over his work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, especially his opposition to aiding the contras in Nicaragua. He responds by saying that he worked on many bills involving child care, higher education and other domestic issues, and says he will strive to help the state's military industry shift to other kinds of manufacturing that will preserve jobs.
Mr. Burnham seems especially interested in eliminating Government bureaucracy. Mr. Johnson says he would like to reduce spending, and recruit companies to Connecticut by being "a great ambassador to the world and the other states." His own factories are all in Tennessee and Canada, he said.

HEADLINE: 2 Environmental Bills Fail in Albany

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 1

 BODY:
The two most significant environmental bills facing the State Legislature this year were declared all but dead today, in large measure because two Republican Senators insisted on having the authority to block state land purchases in the Adirondacks and the New York City watershed in the Catskills.
As state lawmakers headed toward their annual end-of-session marathon, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey, a Saugerties Democrat who is chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, both conceded that their environmental agenda had been thwarted in the Senate. 
 One bill would have established an environmental trust fund, financed by existing taxes on beer and soda containers, to be used for land preservation, solid-waste management and other environmental purposes. The other bill was intended to protect wilderness areas in the 100-year-old Adirondack Park through zoning restrictions and other regulations.
The Republican-majority Senate, responding to pressure from the beverage industry and from local residents in the Adirondacks and the Catskills, has killed both pieces of legislation for this session, Mr. Cuomo said.
 
Land Plan as 'Swiss Cheese'
 "It was as though you were declaring war on ecology, but that is their choice," the Governor said.
Environmental advocates said the trust fund was blocked because of the insistence by two Senators, Ronald B. Stafford of Plattsburgh and Charles D. Cook of Delhi, that it be amended to exempt nearly all of the land purchases in the Adirondacks and the Catskills proposed in the state's open space plan, which was released last week.
"They've made Swiss cheese out of the state open space plan," said Neil F. Woodworth, a lawyer for the Adirondack Mountain Club. "This is two people holding hostage the needs of the entire state."
Mr. Cook said: "We have a real problem in our area. The state owns too much of our land already."
 
'Some Kind of Political Fix'
 Mr. Cuomo, the legislative leaders and their staffs were still struggling to break the political logjam blocking other significant bills, including an economic development bond act and a fiscal bailout for Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
The Governor faulted Nassau and Suffolk leaders today for providing insufficient information to his office about their respective budget crises. "They apparently thought there was some kind of political fix here," Mr. Cuomo said, suggesting that Nassau and Suffolk officials believed their cause could be shepherded through the Legislature by Mr. Marino and other Senate Republicans from Long Island.
Nassau County is seeking state approval to float more than $70 million in bonds and to impose a 1 percent mortgage recording tax. Suffolk County needs state permission to borrow more than $90 million and to increase the county's 8 percent sales tax by half of 1 percent. Both counties need the financial help to close operating deficits in their budgets.
Mr. Cuomo said he has yet to be convinced that the borrowing and tax increases are necessary. And if he becomes convinced, he and Mr. Weprin are insisting that the bailout be accompanied by the creation of some form of oversight panel, like New York City's Financial Control Board. That step is opposed by the Senate Republicans.
 
Curbing Teen-Age Smoking
 "Nobody is more respectful of the local governments than I am," Mr. Cuomo said. "But I'm not going to abdicate my responsibility either and give them a blank check, especially not in counties that are regularly accusing the state of making their life more difficult by raising taxes, which we haven't done."
Mr. Cuomo has argued that if the Senate Republicans want to help Nassau and Suffolk Counties, they should approve his plan for the state to assume the share of Medicaid costs paid by local governments. But the Republicans continued to argue today that the plan would subject the state to large and open-ended costs, and there seemed little chance that the plan could be resuscitated this year.
There were signs of new life, however, for a bill that would give New Yorkers an opportunity to vote on the Governor's proposed $800 million economic development bond act. Among the issues being discussed by negotiators today was how the infrastructure projects that would be financed by the bond act would be spread around the state.
And negotiators for Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature announced a last-minute agreement on a bill aimed at aiding the prevention and detection of lead poisoning. The bill would require doctors and other health-care providers to offer lead-screening blood tests to children and pregnant women when they first treat them. It also would require the State Health Department to develop regulations for a comprehensive prevention and screening program.
Other health-related bills were still being discussed in closed-door meetings. One is aimed at curbing adolescent tobacco use by a variety of methods, including restricting the placement of vending machines. Another would prohibit doctors from referring patients to laboratories where the doctors have a financial interest.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Forge An Economic Strategy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Eleven Senate Democrats today brought out a $22 billion package of bills that they said would revive the nation's competitiveness in international markets.
Competitiveness and trade policy have faded as issues in the Presidential campaign, as have unsuccessful candidates in both parties who focused on them. And the senators, led by George Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, conceded that many of the 30 proposals in their package were not new. But they contended that the presentation of their ideas as a package would dramatize the Bush Administration's reluctance to pursue an industrial policy. 
 They called the plan a comprehensive strategy to maintain American technological leadership, rebuild manufacturing, create high-wage jobs and tighten trade laws. At its core is a trade bill with two central provisions.
 
Reviewing Foreign Trading
 One would allow industries to force the Administration to review foreign compliance with trade bills. The other would revive Super 301, a section of American trade law, much criticized by foreign governments, that would force the United States trade representative to challenge foreign trade barriers on a faster and more rigid schedule. The bill would not include restrictions on car imports from Japan.
The plan also includes bills to expand Federal support for research and development, increase vocational training and commercialize products from Government laboratories.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumed Democratic candidate, has called for some of the same programs, notably to expand vocational training and spend more Federal money on civilian research. He publicly endorsed today's Senate plan.
Two hours after the Senators announced their plan, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said as expected that he would try to amend this year's House trade bill with legislation on automobile imports.
But the measure Mr. Gephardt proposed today would restrict auto imports much less than previous plans backed by him and other House Democrats who have taken a tough stand on trade issues, suggesting that House and Senate leaders are moving toward each other on trade policy.
 
Curbs on Japanese Car Imports
 Rather than limit the sales of cars made by Japanese-owned factories in the United States, the bill would require the Administration to ask the Japanese Government for long-term restrictions on Japanese car imports. It would also require the Administration to monitor whether Japanese companies complied with their Government's informal offer to President Bush in January to more than double Japanese purchases of American auto parts by 1994. It would force the Administration to impose penalties on imports from Japan if the purchases fell short.
The offer was made during President Bush's visit to Tokyo. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, stopping in the United States on his way to next week's economic summit meeting in Munich, met with Mr. Bush at Camp David today.
In the House, Democrats have avoided setting forth a comprehensive set of trade proposals out of concern that they would look weak if few of their bills were enacted. The 11 Senate Democrats set aside such concerns today in presenting their package of initiatives.
The plan reflects an alliance of two large factions among Democratic senators. The high-technology faction, which includes Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, strongly favors a greater Federal role in paying for civilian research and better educating American workers.
Another faction, represented today by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, is more interested in enacting trade legislation that would open foreign markets while possibly restricting foreign access to the American market. Senator Riegle has also been seeking legislation to amend Congressional rules to allow amendments to the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that the Bush Administration is negotiating.
Conspicuously absent from the senators' news conference was Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, which writes trade laws. He said in an interview this evening that he had been too busy to attend and had not yet made up his mind on whether to proceed with a trade bill this year.

HEADLINE: Hector I. Vasquez Is Dead at 63; First Puerto Rican on School Panel

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Hector I. Vazquez, who in 1968 became the first Puerto Rican member of the New York City Board of Education, died on Monday at his home in Briarwood, Queens. He was 63 years old.
He died of prostate cancer, said a son, Jaime. 
 Mr. Vazquez was named to the Board of Education by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1968 and served until late 1969. In 1968, Puerto Ricans made up 22.1 percent of the New York City school system's enrollment, and Puerto Rican groups had long protested that they lacked representation on the board.
The problems of Puerto Rican students were of particular concern to Mr. Vazquez. "High unemployment among Puerto Ricans," he once said, "is a chronic situation" because of the large number of high school dropouts and "the language problem."
From 1967 until 1974 he was executive director of the Puerto Rican Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting educational and job opportunities. It is now called the National Puerto Rican Forum and is an employment and training agency serving Puerto Ricans and other members of minority groups.
Mr. Vazquez was born in Cayey, P.R., and lived there until he was a teen-ager, when he moved to New York, where his family lived in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan. He earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Miami in Florida in 1952 and a master's degree in economics from American University in Washington in 1956. He did further graduate work at Pace University.
From 1957 to 1966 he worked in the Puerto Rican Economic Development office in New York and as an executive of a manpower training program operated by the forum, the Urban League and Cornell University.
After leaving the forum he held posts in the New York State Department of Commerce, in the New York City Office of Business Development and elsewhere. From 1987 until his death he was president of Hector Vazquez Associates, which does business-development consulting.
Besides his son Jaime, of Queens, he is survived by his wife, the former Carmen Inoa; three sisters, Aurora Vazquez of Manhattan, Amelia Vazquez of San Juan, P.R., and Carmen Morgan of Vero Beach, Fla., and another son, Miguel, also of Queens.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasuries Rise Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Additional signs of economic weakness helped push prices of Treasury securities up again yesterday and heightened anticipation among credit market participants about the release of June employment data today.
Prices fell early in the session after the Market News Service reported that representatives of the American Bankers Association's economic advisory committee met with a group from the Federal Reserve Board last week and found Fed governors reluctant to ease monetary policy. The group included the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 But traders and analysts noted that data released since that meeting had been uniformly weak. The sense of slowdown was reinforced yesterday by data from the nation's purchasing managers, who reported in their latest monthly survey that manufacturing activity in June had slowed from May levels.
The decline in the purchasing managers index, to 52.6 from 56.3, was led by declines in orders, production and employment.
"We are being overwhelmed by negative news," one government bond trader said.
 
'Desperate for Yield'
 To capture an acceptable yield, investors are moving into longer-dated securities.
"Rates in the short end are turning negative, once you take inflation into account," the trader said. "That is forcing people out the curve a little bit, and it could continue if rates were to go lower. People are desperate for yield."
So far, the desire to lock in higher yields does not encompass long-term Treasury securities. Bond yields moved a bit lower yesterday, but remain mired around the 7.75 percent level that has proven a stern resistance point.
"It is very odd to me that customers will extend out to buy product in other markets with some credit risk attached to it, but they will not move out on the Treasury curve," said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers.
"I'm not sure I understand the reasoning, but that is what they are doing," Mr. Slifer said. "And it makes long-dated Treasuries the cheapest thing around."
 
Market May Be Vulnerable
 Some analysts and traders said that with prices at current levels, the market will be vulnerable if the employment data released today turn out to be stronger than expected.
Most economists are expecting the report to show that nonfarm payroll employment probably rose by 75,000 to 100,000 last month. An increase of more than 125,000 would almost certainly delay a move by the Fed to ease monetary policy.
But analysts said that a gain of less than 75,000 in nonfarm employment would probably pursuade the central bank to make another move.
 
Long Bond Yield: 7.74%
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10230/32 , up 3/8 of a point, to yield 7.74 percent, down from 7.77 percent on Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10231/32 , up 10/32 , to yield 7.07 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, up 1/32 , to yield 4.80 percent.
 
Sale Set for 7-Year Notes
 Late yesterday the Treasury announced it would sell $9.75 billion of new seven-year notes on July 8, next Wednesday.
After the announcement the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.71 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates dipped slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.53 percent late yesterday, down two basis points, or 2 one-hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late rate of 3.61 percent.
 
Offering by Waste Management
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Waste Management Inc. offered $250 million of noncallable five-year notes through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 6 3/8 percent notes were priced at $98.85 to yield 6.651 percent, 38 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Italian Bank's Notes
 Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager on a $200 million offering of 15-year subordinated notes for Banca Commerciale Italiana, Italy's third-largest commercial bank. The noncallable 8 1/4 percent notes were priced at $99.914 to yield 8.26 percent, 1.16 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The debt sale is the Italian bank's first in the American capital market. Bankers familiar with the transaction said that demand for the notes was hampered somewhat by the 15-year maturity, as well as by Italy's uncertain economic future.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up 1/8 of a point, in light trading.

HEADLINE: Revised Urban Aid Plan Is $5 Billion Compromise

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Eager to display an ability to govern amid rising disenchantment with partisan bickering, the White House and Congressional Democrats agreed tonight on a $5 billion aid package for the nation's cities. It includes tax incentives for businesses willing to invest in inner-city neighborhoods and $2.5 billion for a variety of social programs.
While the program falls far short of a sweeping effort to uproot urban poverty, it represents a victory for Republicans and Democrats alike who were able to weave their differing policy approaches into one package. While final enactment is still in doubt, President Bush appears on the way to achieving the core of his urban program: the establishment of urban enterprise zones meant to flood neighborhoods like Harlem and Watts with new capital investment. 
 At the same time, Democrats were able to get an Administration endorsement for five years of fresh spending for a $2.5 billion bundle of their favorite projects: Head Start education for preschool children, job training for the hard-core unemployed, inoculation for children and remedial education services for the disabled and others in danger of falling behind in the public schools.
 
Majority Leader Optimistic
 "This is not the millennium in urban policy," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader who was the lead Congressional negotiator. "But it's a step in the right direction. We obviously have lots of problems and they manifested themselves in Los Angeles and every night in our nation's cities."
Mr. Gephardt said that he thought "we ought to be able to pass this" in the House on Thursday.
A senior White House official said, "The President is pleased with the progress we have made." But he added that final passage was not certain, noting, "Bills like this are always volatile."
The volatility is rooted in a package that offers a target for conservatives and liberals alike. Many Republicans have resisted funneling $500 million a year more into programs they believe have created few benefits while contributing to the budget deficit. And many Democrats warn that the enterprise zones will create few new jobs and do little more than grant incentives for businesses to move from one neighborhood to another.
 
5 Weeks of Wrestling
 Coming nearly two months after the Los Angeles riots, the compromise package culminates more than five weeks of horse trading and political posturing that put the result in doubt until only hours before the deal was struck. At times when deadlocks loomed, members of the Administration and Congress told one another that their failure would only fuel the campaign of Ross Perot, the undeclared independent candidate who has exploited public exasperation with the fractious partisanship that has characterized relations between the White House and Capitol Hill.
In recent days, there have been intensive two-track negotiations to reach a compromise. On one, Mr. Gephardt worked out the compromise on the capital-gains tax provisions with Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and Nicholas E. Calio, assistant to the President for legislative affairs. Mr. Kemp held to the Administration's position of exempting all capital gains until the bitter end, but Mr. Calio and the Democrats persuaded him to accept the deal.
On the other track, Mr. Gephardt and Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, worked out the accounting methods by which the spending provisions would be paid for without raising taxes. Details of their compromise were not immediately available.
The agreement arose from a smaller $1.3 billion aid package enacted two weeks ago, providing loans and grants for businesses and houses destroyed in the Los Angeles riots, and 360,000 summer jobs for urban teen-agers.
 
Urban and Rural Zones
 Under the new package, 50 enterprise zones would be established, 25 in the cities and 25 more in impoverished rural areas with high unemployment. Companies willing to invest in the zones would be able to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains as long as their interests were not sold for five years after the initial investments were made. Businesses in the zones would also be exempted from paying an alternative minimum tax, and they could roll over gains.
Democrats had already agreed to create enterprise zones as part of a $14 billion tax bill passed by the House Ways and Means Committee last week. But the Democrats, who had previously characterized capital gains cuts as a Republican plan to enrich the privileged, have now decided to go along with the Administration. Other tax measures, including repeal of the luxury tax on expensive cars, private airplanes and boats, as well as an extension of tax breaks for research and development and low-income housing and restoration of tax preferences on real estate losses, are also included in the measure.
 
Based on 'Weed and Seed'
 The House tax bill, which will now be amended under the White House-Congressional compromise, calculated that 50 enterprise zones would cost the Treasury $2.5 billion over five years. The amended tax bill should reach the House floor for a vote on Thursday.
The $2.5 billion in social spending would combine Republican aspirations for better law enforcement with Democratic hopes for improving the opportunities of urban poor. Adopting the principle of Mr. Bush's proposed "Weed and Seed" program, the new spending would be combined with intensive police activities. SWAT teams and special detectives would be used to sweep gangs and drug dealers out of neighborhoods before the social programs were initiated.
Mr. Gephardt said the Weed and Seed program would focus on the urban enterprise zones, so that job training could be offered to prepare neighborhood residents for the new businesses expected to locate near their homes.

HEADLINE: Russia's Rust Belt -- A Special report.;
On the Path to an Open Economy, A Decrepit Steel Plant in the Urals

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAGNITOGORSK, Russia

 BODY:
The 64,000 steelworkers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex, the world's largest steelworks, are beginning to get nervous. The company is 90 days behind in paying wages and is offering instead 50-pound sacks of sugar and pieces of steel that the workers can try to resell.
As production falls, 5,000 of the workers do not have a full day's work and some have been sent home on forced vacations. 
 "The steelworkers do not yet grasp what is happening to them," said Valery Kucher, former editor in chief of the Magnitogorsk Worker, the city's daily newspaper. "They still believe that they are the pillars of the country."
 
Surviving on Subsidies
 Like dinosaur steelworks in the United States that were forced to close a decade ago, the Magnitogorsk plant is threatened with bankruptcy and extinction. But it is so far managing to squeeze out enough profit to stay alive.
It survives because some major costs are subsidized by the Government and profits are used not to enrich investors, but to build workers' apartments and rest homes, subsidize the city's trolley system and construct new rolling mills deemed essential for modernization and survival.
The steelworks are one of many giant state enterprises in company towns across Russia that have emerged as a powerful political force because they keep workers housed and fed.
But their clout runs counter to the pressure from industrial nations on President Boris N. Yeltsin to move quickly toward a market economy, even if this leads to layoffs and labor unrest. The state enterprises are a key to the balancing act as Mr. Yeltsin seeks billions of dollars in foreign aid while yielding on occasion to domestic pressures.
 
Magnitogorsk, or Else
 "If we close the plant, there are no other jobs," said Anatoly Starikov, the 51-year-old general manager of the steelworks. "People would have to look for work elsewhere, and in Russia that is unrealistic. If we halt part of the production, then half the city will be hurt. That is also inadmissible."
"And while we are not expanding social services, we do not cut them back," he continued. "We have to take care of people."
Once a proud symbol of the forced industrialization in the 1930's that made Russia a world power, today the Magnitogorsk steelworks have deteriorated into a vast complex of blackened buildings and ancient furnaces along the Ural River. From a skyline of smokestacks comes a constant flow of orange and white smoke that makes the steelworks one of the world's worst air polluters, adding to the pressure to close them.
Its managers acknowledge that to avoid the fate of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation mill in Lackawanna, N.Y., and United States Steel's Homestead Works in Homestead, Pa., which closed in the 1980's, Magnitogorsk needs $10 billion or more for a sweeping modernization that would make high-quality products at a lower cost. Such an investment is far off.
"The Soviet Government, before it collapsed, was on the verge of a decision to rebuild the steel works, financing the $5 billion project with subsidies," said Mr. Starikov. "Now the state has no money and cannot invest and, as a result, the steelworks and the city find themselves in a difficult position. We are facing the same crisis that Pittsburgh and the American steel industry faced 20 years ago."
 
Protecting Workers, Not Stockholders
 While the executives who closed Lackawanna and Homestead responded to pressure from stockholders, Mr. Starikov will not have shareholders until the steel works are privatized, which is not expected for at least a year and could take much longer. His constituents remain the townspeople he would have to lay off. They and their families make up half the population in this company town of 450,000 people.
"The workers have the power, and the managers try to satisfy them so that they can hold on to their own positions, and keep alive their hopes of some day becoming owners," said Aleksei Titkov, a Russian economist and sociologist. "These managers are operating in a middle ground between the old socialist state and the markets."
Mr. Starikov, who moved up to general manager last year from chief engineer at the steelworks, where he has spent his working life, is not alone in presiding over a difficult company.
While the Government remains the nominal owner of these giant enterprises, Mr. Starikov and his peers exercise most of the authority. They set production and wage levels, bank their revenues instead of turning them over to the state, buy their raw materials and make their own investment decisions. The Government, in fact, has become more adversary than ally.
Under pressure from the West to balance its budget and put the nation's finances in order to qualify for foreign loans, the Government in turn is trying to raise money by taxing the steelworks and other enterprises.
It is also trying to maintain high interest rates to discourage the steelworks and similar giants from borrowing money to stay afloat.
 
Caught in the Maze Of Market Reform
 The industrial nations are backing Mr. Yeltsin and his economic team, even at the cost of layoffs and bankruptcies. But the unrest that might result from widespread unemployment has become a bargaining weapon for the managers and their representatives in Parliament, among them Vladim Kluvgant, the 34-year-old Mayor of Magnitogorsk.
"I understand the position of Mr. Gaidar to stabilize the ruble," Mayor Kluvgant said, referring to the acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar. "But don't forget: You can bend a stick up to the point that it breaks. Otherwise you will have social explosion."
While Parliament manages to slow the transition to a market economy, Mr. Starikov, a stocky, quiet man with imposing black eyebrows, finds ways to sell enough steel to keep his expensive operation going.
One method has been to chip away at labor costs. Twice this year, Anatoly Kusov, a 47-year-old machine operator, has been ordered -- like the 150 others on his shift -- to take a leave, the most recent one covering most of June. Over dinner at his apartment, Mr. Kusov attributed his forced vacation to a company effort to revise work schedules. "I am not laid off," he said.
But Mr. Starikov made it clear that eventually many jobs at the steelworks might have to disappear. Production has fallen to an estimated 13.5 million tons this year, from a peak of 16 million in 1988, partly because the huge ore deposit that prompted Stalin to locate the steelworks here is now exhausted and other materials have become harder to obtain.
 
It's Steel, Yes, But Not Great Steel
 The complex still produces more steel than any other plant in the world, and 26 percent of Russia's tonnage.
The problem is that the steel coming out of this giant museum piece is below world standards. Within the Commonwealth of Independent States, Mr. Starikov can sell the steel at only 9,000 rubles a ton, or $90, less than half the world price.
The main customers are 8,000 domestic companies that cannot afford better quality imported steel and are themselves struggling to survive as Russia moves toward competition with more efficient foreign companies.
As a result of their own problems, these customers owe the steelworks 12 billion rubles, or 12 percent of the complex's expected revenue this year. Mr. Starikov and his managers offset the losses by simply running up a 12 billion ruble debt of their own with their suppliers and workers -- a practice that has complicated the effort by market-oriented economists to analyze the profits and losses of enterprises.
"If these customers go under, then the steelworks are doomed," said Mr. Kucher, the newspaper editor. "The steel is good for making tanks but not for making computers and modern cars. The world does not need Magnitogorsk's steel."
The world, in fact, treats Magnitogorsk steel not as a finished product, but as raw material. The company has exported more than 200,000 tons so far this year, but as slabs, sold mainly in Thailand and Western Europe. There they are turned into thin steel sheets and other finished products at rolling mills a generation younger than Magnitogorsk's newest machines.
The steel company estimates total revenue this year at 100 billion rubles, or $1 billion at current exchange rates -- alarmingly little for a major steel company. But in Russia, 100 billion rubles gets a company by when two major costs -- rail transportation and energy -- are still subsidized.
The company estimates its total 1992 outlay at 87 billion rubles, which leaves 13 billion, or $130 million, for investment in new equipment. That is not nearly enough.
The strategy to lure foreign investments, as described by Mr. Starikov and Valentin F. Sarychev, the 41-year-old deputy chief engineer, is to use the money to build much-needed rolling mills and new oxygen furnaces. The return on the investment would be paid in exports of finished steel. The Government recently authorized such an arrangement, but so far no investors have come forward.
If new facilities ever replace the old equipment, the work force would have to shrink to 40,000, from 64,000 now. "But we are not going to lay people off," Mr. Sarychev said. "We are creating new products and new jobs."
He listed a plan to diversify the plant's operations and the town's industries, expanding such current operations as a furniture subsidiary, a tin-can division and a unit that makes enamel-coated steel pots. In the future, car parts and steel ladles are to be made. But these operations will probably not be enough to re-employ all the steelworkers.
 
The City's Mask Of Prosperity
 However bleak the future might seem, the city of Magnitogorsk appears to be very much a going concern, even booming.
A new hotel is going up on the west bank of the Ural River, with a view of the steelworks across the river. A red-brick brewery is nearing completion. Construction cranes poke out from the roofs of a dozen nearly finished concrete-slab apartment buildings, built by the Kombinat. And nearby, a fourth river bridge is under construction.
Only gradually does the town's incipient decline become apparent. The trolley system, owned by the steel works, has not yet been extended into the newer neighborhoods. Many roads are unpaved and it still takes 10 years to get an apartment. Indeed, many people are on the waiting list to migrate from the east bank of the Ural to the relatively less polluted west bank.
Responding to the public outcry over pollution, Mr. Starikov last year named Anatoly Kostyukov, a metallurgical engineer, as the company's chief ecologist. But Mr. Kostyukov does not offer much relief. Given the high cost of pollution control and the old facilities, he says, reducing pollution to acceptable levels will take until at least 2000.
Offsetting this hardship, the steelworkers' pay averages more than 5,000 rubles a month and the most skilled earn 8,000 to 15,000 rubles in a nation where the average monthly wage is less than 3,000 rubles. The 8,000 to 15,000 rubles converts into only $80 to $150, but represents substantial purchasing power in a city where a four-course meal is only 100 rubles.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA FORCED TO TURN TO I.O.U.'S

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 1

 BODY:
Its economy racked by recession and its political leadership paralyzed by stalemate, the State of California ran out of cash today and began to pay its bills with I.O.U.'s for the first time since the Great Depression.
State Controller Gray Davis sent out the first 12,000 of the I.O.U.'s after the Democratic-controlled Assembly failed to reach agreement with the Republican Governor, Pete Wilson, on how to erase a $10.7 billion shortfall in the new state budget before the fiscal year began at 12:01 this morning. 
 Major banks said that for now they would honor the notes as they would regular checks, but they did not say for how long. Sooner or later, if no agreement is reached, the largest state will close schools, parks and libraries and curtail vital state services.
 
Much Finger-Pointing
 "This morning, California is running on empty," Governor Wilson said. He and the Democratic leadership of the Assembly are blaming each other, each party hoping the other will pay a political price this election year.
"We are prepared to wait through the Fourth of July, through the Democratic National Convention, all summer long," said the Governor's chief spokesman, Dan Schnur. "The more headlines in hometown newspapers talk about the mess in Sacramento, the more Democrats with election challenges are going to come to their senses."
The Governor said Democrats were at fault for rebuffing his demand that the state "recapture" about $1 billion that he said it overpaid local school districts last year. The main point of contention was the Governor's proposal to cut public-school support by reducing the number of children entering kindergarten and by other means.
The state's I.O.U.'s were the most dramatic symbol yet of the reversal of fortune for this once-booming state, which has been hit hard by the recession, widespread layoffs by military contractors and the riots in Los Angeles, as well as by earthquakes, fires, floods and drought.
Revenues to pay for the $58 billion spending plan are expected to be $10.7 billion short, including a $2.5 billion shortfall from last year. California's budget gap is about equal to the entire gross national product of Tunisia or Ecuador for 1991.
Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Florida also began the new fiscal year Wednesday without budgets. But none of their problems compare in size to that of California.
Even liberal Democrats are resigned to reducing welfare grants by 4.5 percent, cutting salaries by 4.7 percent in the state's university system, sharply raising student fees and repealing subsidies to local governments for police and fire departments and other services. The Governor wants still deeper cuts, including 15.3 percent from health and welfare spending.
No speedy resolution appeared likely in the standoff between Governor Wilson and the powerful Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco.
The I.O.U.'s mailed out today look like real checks but are printed with a statement saying they cannot be paid "for want of funds" and will not be until the State Treasurer advertises that the cash is in hand. They will pay 5 percent interest. Jay Ziegler, spokesman for Controller Davis, said the warrants are being used first to pay 12,000 state income-tax refunds totaling $4 million and 1,000 contractors due $30 million.
Last year, facing a $14.3 billion gap, Governor Wilson angered his own party and voters by joining Democrats to raise taxes by $7 billion. This year he vowed to veto tax increases.
The Democrats proposed to solve the budget crisis by cutting spending, extending a temporary sales-tax hike passed last year, raising state income taxes by suspending indexing for inflation, and passing a two-year budget in the hope that the economy would improve in the second year.
Mr. Wilson said this amounted to deficit financing, forbidden by the state Constitution. He asked the Legislature to approve a recovery of $1.1 billion given to local school districts under Proposition 98, a voter measure passed in 1988 that guarantees that 40 percent of the state's general-fund spending will go to elementary and secondary schools and community colleges.
On Tuesday, the Democrats agreed to give up on the new taxes and the two-year budget. The state Senate, agreeing to education cuts as preferable to other cuts, passed a budget measure largely acceptable to the Governor. But the whole package bogged down in the more fractious Assembly. The Assembly Democrats agreed to forgo the two-year budget and the tax increases but could not get the 33 Republicans in the 80-member House to go along, and thus could not get the two-thirds vote needed to pass a budget. Then they rejected the school cuts.
"We went two-thirds of the way," said James Lewis, spokesman for Speaker Brown. "We told the Governor all along our bottom line was to protect education. It's time for him to show us he is willing to seek some sort of compromise."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Florida Avoids Crisis
MIAMI, July 1, (Special to The New York Times) -- Florida began the new budget year without a spending plan at 12:01 A.M. yesterday, but by the afternoon a fiscal crisis had been averted when Gov. Lawton Chiles and the state Legislature agreed to a compromise calling for $532.5 million in new taxes and fees.
Governor Chiles, who has been battling lawmakers to increase revenues, had said he was considering shutting down some government operations in order to maintain essential services until an accord was reached.
After twice sending Mr. Chiles budgets without new taxes that he promptly vetoed, legislators reluctantly agreed to a package with $135 million in taxes on stocks and bonds, $109 million in extensions of the state's 6 percent sales tax and a 15 percent tuition increase at state colleges and universities. These, however, fell far short of the $1.35 billion in new taxes that Mr. Chiles had initially sought.
Even before the budget deadline expired today, Mr. Chiles had taken steps to ease the impact of a possible government shutdown. On Tuesday, he signed executive orders promising that essential state employees in law enforcement and health that they would be paid regardless of what happened, and giving his word to other workers they would be paid once a budget was adopted.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis
Focus Is Elusive for Bush
President Is Aimiable in Breakfast-TV Debut But Some Visitors Leave Hungry for Ideas

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
President Bush made his reluctant first foray into breakfast television politics today, an event that gave a taste of the potency of Presidential imagery but at the same time underscored the narrowness of the domestic policy agenda on which he is running.
For nearly 90 minutes on the program "CBS This Morning," Mr. Bush sat among the flower beds and crab apple trees of the majestic Rose Garden, the colonnaded veranda outside the Oval Office framing the shot, and took questions from 125 slightly bewildered tourists who had been plucked by CBS producers from the White House tour line on Tuesday. 
 They questioned him politely but persistently about education, the budget deficit, crime, drugs and family values and seemed hungry, in an amiable, supportive way, for the President to offer new ideas about leading the country.
 
'Hung Up in the Capitol'
 Mr. Bush, who remarked more than once with evident relief that the audience's questions were less "controversial" than reporters' queries, responded by promising action in each area. But instead of offering sweeping initiatives aimed at pressing national problems, Mr. Bush harkened back to legislation that he has long talked about and complained that it was being blocked by Congress.
"How are you going to educate your children? We've got a wonderful program on that," he said, adding that he also had "a great anti-crime, anti-drug program hung up in the Capitol."
In the end, the President was forced to retreat to his argument that he should get another four years because he has worked hard and shown he can handle international crises.
Mr. Bush, who has ridiculed Gov. Bill Clinton for playing his saxophone on late-night television and complained about Ross Perot's appearances on call-in programs, rounded up the children in the audience afterward and gave them a tour of the Oval Office while their parents gaped in astonishment.
White House strategists had designed the event to turn the video politics of 1992 to Mr. Bush's benefit, to show him at ease and in command. Members of the audience, who gave Mr. Bush a standing ovation, said they had been impressed by merely being at the White House and in the presence of the President, who they said seemed personable and eager to answer their questions.
But their enthusiasm and broad questions only seemed to underscore how much trouble the Bush team has had in making the power of Mr. Bush's incumbency work for him, and in developing a public relations strategy that will depict the President as engaged in offering big solutions to big problems.
Torie Clarke, Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary, said the President "talked about the accomplishments of the last three and a half years.
"He talked about low inflation and low interest rates, about historic arms-control agreements," she said, "and he said there are more things we need to do."
But Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, a conservative political organization, said the television appearance seemed to crystalize what is wrong with the Bush campaign.
"This is a year when the trappings of the Presidency are not enough to cause the President to win re-election," Mr. Bauer said. "He's got to come up with a more sharply defined program to offer broadly to the American people, and it just didn't strike me that the vision was there today."
 
Guarding Office's Dignity
 While the Arkansas Governor and Mr. Perot have been getting vast amounts of television time, the President has found it hard to get a flattering sound bite on the evening news. He agreed only reluctantly to the sort of television appearance he made today because he had considered such programs beneath the dignity of his office.
Mr. Bush was clearly reaching for a sense of connection with his audience. "I think people are worried about their future," he said. "People that have a job wonder whether they're going to have it tomorrow."
But Mr. Bush continued to blame Congress for his problems. "I think we've got good programs to correct that," he said. "I will admit to having great difficulty getting them through the Congress."
 
Scoring Some Points
 And in his evident desire to demonstrate sympathy, the President made what may have been a political misstep. Asked at the end of the program about interest rates, Mr. Bush said, "I think every American would like to see them lower -- that includes the President -- because that will stimulate economic growth."
His comments did not take into account the tens of millions of retired people as well as other Americans who live at least partly on investments, such as certificates of deposit, on which income has been cut sharply as banks lowered interest rates to stimulate other sectors of the economy.
The participants' comments -- "warm," "nice" and "trustworthy" were frequently used -- suggested that Mr. Bush managed to project at least part of the image he was seeking.
But his reliance on blaming Congress for what some voters perceive as his own failings seemed to strike a sour note with some members of his audience. Interviewed afterward by the hosts of the program, William Lark, a police officer from Philadelphia, said Mr. Bush was "just passing the buck."
Pat Cardel, a computer programmer from Franklin, Tenn., said she was impressed by Mr. Bush's willingness to answer a variety of questions, but she added that she had heard little she had not heard before.
 
'An Energizer Bunny'
 Lonnie Thomas, 11, told The Associated Press after the Oval Office tour that Mr. Bush was "cool" but long-winded. "He kept going and going and going, just like an Energizer bunny," he said.
Asked bluntly by one member of the audience for a reason to vote for him, Mr. Bush responded with a rambling discourse on his election strategy.
"I think in the final analysis, people are going to say, 'Who has the experience, who has the temperament to take on these big problems day in and day out?' " he said.
"Sometimes at night, the phone rings over there, and I'm going to try to make that case to the American people. Not that I'm perfect, but that I've got a proven record of being tested by fire, and I, I think that's a good qualification. I think that's a good -- good reason to ask for some more time as President."
Michael McCurry, a Democratic political consultant, suggested that this approach may be inadequate at a time when the other candidates are working to sharpen their own ideas.
"Clinton seems to be working on getting some type of message together," he said. "Perot has a lot of message but not a lot of substance. Clinton will continue to work at it, and if Perot comes forward and says, 'I've been working on this hard for the last two months, and this is what I'm going to do,' what is Bush going to say? They have no mechanism in that campaign right now to break through the gridlock that traps them."

HEADLINE: U.S.-French Relations Turn Icy After Cold War

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 1

 BODY:
As a meeting in Washington on May 11 between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, went from bad to worse, an exasperated Mr. Baker asked bluntly, "Are you for us or against us?"
The remark, contained in an official French transcript of the meeting, underscores the mutual suspicion, even outright anger, which has come to characterize relations between France and the United States in recent months. While tensions between the two countries have long existed, it appears that the end of the cold war has brought a new level of mistrust. 
 "There is extreme irritation on both sides," a senior French official, who read extracts from a transcript of the Baker-Dumas meeting, said on condition of anonymity. "We cannot accept that world diplomacy should be a one-man show, while Washington seems convinced that our reflections on the future of Europe are necessarily anti-American."
Relations have become so troublesome that senior French officials said they tried for several weeks to persuade President Bush to come to Paris and hold talks with President Francois Mitterrand on his way to the annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies, next week in Munich, Germany. But United States officials said the President's agenda was too crowded.
 
Bush-Mitterrand Meeting
 A private dinner between the two leaders is now planned in Munich in an effort to resolve what one American official called "a whole lot of difficulties in recent months."
Among the many sources of friction are the new French-German army corps, which France sees as as the embryo of a potential European army; a festering quarrel in the world trade talks over French agricultural subsidies; differences on environmental policy; American demands for more trans-Atlantic air routes, and French insistence that Europe play a more independent role in issues ranging from the Balkan fighting to the Middle East peace talks.
The barbed state of relations was illustrated this week when France's European Affairs Minister, Elisabeth Guigou, compared Mr. Mitterrand's decision to visit besieged Sarajevo, disparagingly with what she called Washington's rhetoric on the Balkan war. "We in France prefer to remain sober and act," she said.
According to several officials, difficulties have been compounded by the fact that Mr. Baker and Mr. Dumas have trouble concealing their personal dislike for each other. Mr. Baker's blunt Texas style grates on Mr. Dumas, who is a study in the use of nuance.
 
New Tensions
 The two Presidents get along much better, and President Bush called President Mitterrand on Tuesday to praise him for his courage in going to Sarajevo. But the closeness they established during the Persian Gulf war has been undermined by the recent tensions, the officials said.
Strains between the two countries have long existed. But while differences were mostly contained during the cold war within the broad sense that the countries saw eye to eye on the key issues, that certainty now seems to have fallen away in a Europe that the French hope may become as powerful as the United States.
France has been a main force in pushing for greater European unity, and Mr. Mitterrand announced today that the French referendum on a treaty leading to the monetary and political union of the European Community will be held on Sept. 20.
Mr. Mitterrand decided to put the European unity issue directly to the French voters after Danish voters rejected the treaty. Since the Danish referendum, Irish voters have endorsed the treaty.
While the United Staes has formally supported the push for European union, some aspects of the drive are worrying to Washington.
"The two countries have a rather different vision of the future," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. "The U.S. sees continuing having substantial influence in Europe. The French want some U.S. presence, but in a Europe that can carry far more weight. I don't think the views are irreconcilable, but they are far less convergent than during the cold war."
Nowhere has this lack of convergence been more apparent than in military matters.
At the heart of the heated exchange on May 11 between Mr. Baker and Mr. Dumas lay NATO, and particularly the question of how threatening the 35,000-man joint French-German army corps could be to the future of the Atlantic alliance.
France contends that the force, which it sees as the potential core of an army for a united Europe, is an essential response to a changed world in which the United States military presence in Europe is being cut and Europe will have to take more responsibility for its own defense. The number of United States forces in Europe has already been reduced from 320,000 in 1990 to about 200,000 now.
French Government officials do not conceal their desire that what they call the "Eurocorps" grow to embrace other countries. "Maybe soon it will be a four-country corps," Defense Minister Pierre Joxe said this week. "The idea is to enlarge."
But the United States and other European countries, including Britain and the Netherlands, are deeply concerned that the French-German force will undermine NATO, and they question exactly what its future mission is to be.
"How do NATO command-and-control mechanisms fit in with this Eurocorps?" asked one American official. "Which hat do the German soldiers wear? Whom do they report to? Are they under NATO? Over NATO? We need answers."
The Germans, ever cautious over postwar perceptions of rearmament and treading a fine line between their American and French allies, answer that the corps does not weaken NATO, which remains the cornerstone of European security, and that if anything it brings French soldiers closer to NATO.
 
Americans Leaving Anyway
 "It's not the Eurocorps that's encouraging American soldiers to leave Europe," said one official close to President Mitterrand. "They're leaving anyway. We need some of them to remain, of course, just as the U.S. needs a strong Europe with France and Germany at the center of it."
Jean Daniel, editor of the weekly magazine Le Nouvel Observateur and a man who has the ear of President Mitterrand, compared the American anger at the French talk of a European army to "a father who has told his son to emancipate himself and then starts telling him that he is ungrateful."
But Mr. Baker articulated a different vision in the meeting with Mr. Dumas, telling the French Foreign Minister: "I am sure you want U.S. troops to remain in Europe, but you doubt our capacity to stay there."
The delicate question now apparently facing President Bush and President Mitterrand is how to manage the post-cold-war transition in a way that maintains the fundamental identity of interest between the two countries that has in the past outweighed their differences. Most American and French officials believe the balancing act is possible, but concede that a new phase in relations has opened.
"The danger," said Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs, "is that if the notion persists that Europe and particularly France want to go its own way militarily, a lot of people here may want to cut troops a lot more than Europe actually wants."

Ford Accord With Mazda Is Completed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company has completed the purchase of a half interest in the Mazda Motor Corporation's $760 million auto assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich., the auto makers announced today.
The plant 25 miles south of Detroit assembles 240,000 cars a year including the Ford Probe and the Mazda 626 and MX-6. Opened in 1987, Flat Rock has 3,500 employees. 
 The deal apparently grew out of recession-pinched Mazda's need for cash and Ford's desire for more control over production of the Probe, said Chris Cedergren, an analyst at Autopacific Group Inc. in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
 
Avoiding Leftovers
 Under Mazda's full ownership of Flat Rock, Ford was committed to buy a fixed number of Probes a year regardless of demand, Mr. Cedergren said.
"Last year, they couldn't sell that stated level, and they ended up with a big inventory of leftover Probes," he said.
The slowed Japanese economy has cut into car sales and sent auto makers there looking for money, Mr. Cedergren said.
"All Japanese manufacturers have been hit pretty hard by the recession," he said. "Mazda could use an infusion of capital right now."
Ford bought a 25 percent stake in Mazda in 1979. Since then, the companies have collaborated on a number of joint projects. Last month, Ford increased its stake in a Ford-Mazda company that sells Fords in Japan.
Mazda also makes Ford Laser and Telstar models in Japan, while Ford makes the Mazda Navajo at its Louisville, Ky., plant. And next spring, Ford will begin supplying Mazda with 80,000 to 100,000 pickup trucks a year based on the Ranger model.
The companies announced tentative plans for the Flat Rock plant deal in April. They said they completed the transaction Tuesday after receiving approval from the United States Justice Department.
Ford and Mazda created a joint subsidiary, Auto Alliance International Inc., to run the plant in place of the Mazda subsidiary, Mazda Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. Corporation.
The companies named W. Wayne Booker, Ford vice president for Asia-Pacific auto operations, as chairman of Auto Alliance. Mamoru Takebayashi, who had been executive vice president of Mazda U.S.A., was named the subsidiary's president.
In related moves, Masahiro Uchida, the former Mazda U.S.A. president, was named senior director of Mazda in Japan, where he will oversee the auto maker's overseas operations, and Konen Suzuki, Ford of Japan president, was named president of Autorama Inc., the Ford-Mazda company that sells Ford models in Japan.
Ford shares fell 50 cents, to $45.375 today, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Separately, Ford said it was cutting the price of its 1993 model Mercury Tracer station wagon by $234 as part of a plan to expand a "one-price" strategy that is used to sell Ford Escort small cars.
Effective immediately, Ford will sell well-equipped versions of both its Tracer sedans and wagons for $11,665, excluding a $200 rebate in effect until Sept. 23.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE PLEDGES PUSH FOR GROWTH

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
In their first meeting since President Bush's ill-fated trip to Tokyo in January, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa promised Mr. Bush today that he would use "every possible means" to expand his country's domestic growth to stimulate more markets for American exports.
Mr. Miyazawa stopped over in Washington for consultations with Mr. Bush in advance of the meeting next week in Munich of the leaders of seven major industrial democracies. It was also an effort to put an end to the bout of name-calling and mutual accusations of unfair trade practices. 
 The January meeting was widely viewed as a disaster after Mr. Bush collapsed and vomited at a state dinner, an attack attributed to the flu. Relations were aggravated when the Japanese rebuffed pressure from the President, and from the heads of the Big Three auto makers whom he brought along, to buy American cars.
Today, both sides were determined not to have a repetition of that, and they left any airing of differences to private meetings, In public, they emphasized only the positives, and were all smiles.
 
Miyazawa Speaks in English
 Mr. Miyazawa set the tone, taking the unusual step for a visiting foreign dignitary of delivering his statement after their meeting in English, which he speaks fluently.
He began: "This is my first official visit to the United States as Prime Minister. I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak directly to the American people, for whom I have profound respect. Today, I am also very pleased that as an ally and a friend I have had very frank and productive talks with President Bush."
Japanese officials said Mr. Miyazawa outlined to President Bush a readiness to introduce a supplementary budget later this year that the Japanese press says would provide $47 billion to $55 billion to stimulate the nation's ailing economy. Details of that plan, though, remain sketchy, because the Prime Minister and his Liberal Democratic Party must still agree on the exact size and timing.
While the Prime Minister's promise was hailed by Mr. Bush, many economists pointed out that such Japanese economic stimulants would primarily focus on major public works, like bridges and roads, and that those are areas where it will not be easy for American companies to take part.
Mr. Miyazawa said Mr. Bush "on his part, expressed his determination to reduce the budget deficit and to raise the competitiveness of the U.S. industries."
The President did not spell out how he would fulfill such commitments, but he pronounced himself satisfied with the Japanese growth proposals. This has been a recurring pattern in American-Japanese relations, where Tokyo makes specific promises while Washington makes general ones, like reducing the deficit and increasing spending on research and development.
The Japanese commitment comes at a time when American officials are concerned over the rising trade deficit, despite a series of market-opening agreements with Japan. Last year's deficit was $43 billion, and this year's is running a little ahead of that, reaching $15 billion in the first four months. This is deeply troubling to White House officials in an election year.
"I'm encouraged by what the Prime Minister told me about Japan's plans to stimulate economic growth," Mr. Bush said in their joint appearance in the White House Rose Garden. "I had a chance to fill him in on ours. Both of us confirmed our desire for a strong and lasting recovery."
After their closing statements, Mr. Bush took Mr. Miyazawa by helicopter to Camp David, Md., for informal talks.
 
U.S. Aides Defend January Trip
 American officials argue that while the trip in January was awkward, it has had some positive results. They point out that the Ford Motor Company just bought 50 percent of Mazda's plant in the United States in order to produce a right-hand-drive Ford Probe intended almost entirely for Japanese export.
The officials said Toyota will soon be opening a supplier support center in Lexington, Ky., which will keep American auto-parts producers up to date on developments in Toyota technology, so that they will be better positioned to bid on contracts.
Two areas where Japan has not opened its market as much as American officials expected have been in computer semiconductors and glass. The Japanese promised to give American companies 20 percent of their semiconductor market, and the level today is around 14 percent. American glass companies have only about 1 percent of the Japanese market.
The two sides also discussed the dispute between Japan and Russia over four northern islands that the Soviet Union seized from the Japanese at the end of World War II.
The Americans have in principle supported Tokyo's insistence that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia acknowledge that the islands belong to Japan before it provides large-scale aid. Still, American officials would welcome Tokyo's adopting a more flexible position, since it is a major industrial democracy with enough cash to bolster the Yeltsin Government.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher After Reversing Early Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher against other currencies yesterday, erasing an early fall as traders bought the currency to cover short positions -- sales of borrowed holdings made in expectation of being able to pay them back at a lower price.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $344.30, up $1.20 an ounce from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $1 to a late bid of $344. 
 The dollar fell in overseas trading, and after domestic markets opened it was depressed further by a report that showed slower-than-expected economic growth.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of business activity fell sharply to 52.8 percent last month from 56.3 percent in May. Sluggish economic activity usually hurts the dollar's value against other currencies.
But the dollar recovered in the afternoon as traders covered short positions to prepare for today's release of employment figures for June, said John McCarthy, chief dealer with Algemene Bank Nederland in New York.
The jobs report normally is released on the first Friday of the month but was pushed ahead by the July 4 holiday, which is being celebrated a day early in the financial markets.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.43 yen, down 0.12 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.90 yen. In New York, one dollar bought 125.40 yen, down from 125.60 yen late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9111 from $1.9030 late Tuesday. But in New York, one pound cost $1.9055, cheaper than $1.9060 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5230 German marks, up from 1.5215; 1.3700 Swiss francs, down from 1.3710; 5.1245 French francs, up from 5.1180; 1,152.50 Italian lire, up from 1,150.50; and 1.20245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1985.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Need Zionism Equal Socialism?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ISRAEL'S Labor Party surprised the experts by trouncing the ruling Likud coalition in last week's elections. Could the torch bearers of the Zionist welfare state surprise them once again by transforming Israel into a modern free-market economy?
The prospect seems bizarre: foxes generally can't be expected to spruce up the chicken coop. But these foxes have learned pragmatism -- and they are certainly aware that Israel's security and capacity to absorb Jewish immigrants turn as much on its economic productivity as its military prowess. "This is the best chance in years to reform the economy," concludes Howard Rosen of the Institute for International Economics. 
 Israeli Socialism has never much resembled the house that Marx and Lenin built. Price controls did not generate chronic shortages; neither private ownership nor the accumulation of wealth was actively discouraged. But the inclination to find a bureaucratic solution for every economic problem left Israel almost as unprepared as the East bloc for the global economic free-for-all of the 1970's and 1980's. The skills needed to design a computer chip faster than NEC or build a jet fighter for less money than General Dynamics apparently aren't the same as those needed to make the desert bloom.
Economic stagnation explains in part why Israeli voters turned to the conservative Likud Party in the late 1970's. In contrast to the intellectual mandarins of Labor, Likud's tough nationalists owed nothing to organized labor or to Socialist ideology.
But those who expected a new Singapore to rise from the ashes were disappointed, for the business of governing Israel's fragmented parliamentary democracy is the business of perpetual coalition-building. And while Likud partisans can point to some victories in lowering tariffs and deregulating markets, the temptation to win new friends by protecting old sinecures proved irresistible.
Privatization of some $5 billion worth of state enterprises, for example, was put on indefinite hold because both jobs and bureaucratic turf were threatened. And just last month, Jerusalem forgave the debts of some hopelessly inefficient farm cooperatives. Over all, argues Stanley Fischer, an M.I.T. professor and former chief economist at the World Bank, the Likud years represented a "wasted opportunity by a Government that should have known better."
Why is the new old gang likely to make a difference? For one thing, Prime Minister-designate Yitzhak Rabin has pledged to slow Jewish settlements in the disputed territories. That could free as much as $600 million to $800 million that was being invested annually in housing, roads and basic services for the West Bank settlers -- no small change for an economy only one-hundredth the size of America's. For another, the Bush Administration is likely to reward Mr. Rabin with at least a part of the $10 billion in requested loan guarantees on top of the current $3 billion annual aid package.
The guarantees are no longer desperately needed to cover the costs of large-scale immigration, because the immigrants are no longer coming; just a trickle of Russia's highly educated Jews, it seems, are willing to fight for decent jobs in an economy with 12 percent unemployment. But Michael Bruno, the former head of the Bank of Israel, argues that the formal blessing by Washington would still give Israeli investors a psychological lift and reduce the cost of borrowing.
The make-it-or-break-it question, though, is whether Labor will be able to sweep aside the rubble of state control and allow free markets to flourish. Mr. Rabin will be in no position to build a wall between economic policy and interest-group politics.
Like the last Government, notes Mr. Rosen, "Labor will have to buy the coalition." And the piece of the coalition that could prove most expensive is the union movement -- more accurately, the money-hemhorraging social insurance systems operated by the unions.
But Mr. Bruno believes that high unemployment has eroded union power. And last year's effective privatization of the unions' bankrupt business empire, Koor Industries, suggests that organized labor no longer always gets what it wants.
In the end, the Labor Party's greatest asset may prove to be its pragmatism. Unlike the last Government, this one will not obsessed with the vision of a Greater Israel and will thus not be inclined to pay a heavy economic price for ideological support from fringe parties. Nor is it likely to operate under the illusion that it can stay in power long if it does not deliver what Likud never managed: a living standard approaching Northern Europe's.
"This is the 90's, not the 60's," concludes Mr. Bruno. The old rules no longer apply.
Mr. Fischer agrees: If big government in Poland, Argentina and Mexico can embrace free markets, he asks, why not Israel?

HEADLINE: Discrepancies In N.F.L. Revenue

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, July 1

 BODY:
Roger Noll, a Stanford University economics professor, testified today in the National Football League antitrust trial that the league's reported $1.3 billion in revenue for 1990 was "substantially understated" because of the way the owners do their books.
He said his research found that the N.F.L. reported 1990 total operating expenses of $411 million. Operating profits were reported as $163 million, but Noll said the profits were shielded from costs such as the $600,000 per team contributed to the World League of American Football and two antitrust lawsuits that are "the costs of defending and maintaining a monopoly." 
 Noll said his analysis of the N.F.L.'s financial statement showed that Norman Braman, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, paid himself a salary of $7.5 million for 1990. That salary was recorded as general expenses, when it could have been counted as profit for Braman, Noll told the jury.

Designed by a Gardener, for Gardeners

BYLINE: By Elaine Louie

 BODY:
A YEAR and a half ago, at the age of 37, John Danzer, an economic adviser at Data Resources in Manhattan, abandoned finance for the bucolic world of his garden -- and a garden-furniture business.
"I had always been an avid gardener," said Mr. Danzer, who owns 7,000 photographic slides of garden furniture. 
 On Aug. 1, he will open Munder Skiles, which reproduces old garden furniture and manufactures new designs. He works at his home, Surprise Pond Farm, in Old Chatham, N.Y.
One of the first 17 pieces is a green cedar wheelbarrow with red wheels, shown here. It comes in two sizes: a child's version ($325) and an adult's ($450). He can be reached at (212) 724-9438 or (518) 794-8123.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
House Votes to Eliminate Money for Regulatory Council Headed by Quayle

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
In a pointed rebuke to the Bush Administration's environmental and labor policies, the House voted today to cut all financing for the Council on Competitiveness, the regulatory review board headed by Vice President Dan Quayle.
The action came as a response to the Administration's growing aggressiveness in narrowing environmental regulations that it says prevent businesses from expanding. The council, which seeks to reduce or eliminate rules that it believes decrease trade competitiveness, only last week dismayed many lawmakers on Capitol Hill by recommending that companies be allowed to increase emissions of air pollutants. 
 The vote was one of a handful of real votes today as Congress negotiated and postured over a wide range of issues. There was almost an end-of-session pace to the activity, as the Senate planned to take off two weeks after Thursday's session. The House only planned a long weekend for the Fourth of July, but had worked late Tuesday and was in a cranky mood as it approached another long night today.
The House, on a 236-to-183 vote, defeated a Republican amendment that would have provided financing for the council. The amendment was intended to reverse an earlier Appropriations Committee decision. The Senate still must vote on the issue.
Attacking the council during a partisan floor debate, Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon, said: "It has watered down restrictions on worker exposure to cancer-causing chemicals. It has delayed requirements for employers to report work-related deaths and injuries."
Representative Andy Ireland, Republican of Florida, defended the council, saying that cutting back on financing for the council "would be devastating to small business and our economy."
The House vote to end financing of the council came as part of a $22.8 billion appropriations bill for financing operations of the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and the President's executive offices. The bill was approved, 237 to 166. While the measure is $275.7 million less than the President requested, it still represents an increase of $2.9 billion over last year's budget.
The President had requested an appropriation of about $85,000 for the council and some other executive office expenses.
Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, the Democratic chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that will deal with the bill, said he would not move to strike financing for the council, even though "Quayle and Bush have used it politically." Should the Senate follow Mr. DeConcini's lead, differing Senate and House bills would have to be reconciled in conference.
Mr. Quayle himself lobbied on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to retain financing for the council. He said, "This is simply a political ploy by partisan Democrats who want to give power to the unelected Federal bureaucracy instead of to the elected leaders of the executive branch."

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's X Percent Solution

 BODY:
President Bush bristles at the criticism that voters can't find his domestic agenda. He reminds audiences that he's sent scores of bills to Capitol Hill -- on crime, education, welfare reform, tax cuts. But people don't pay attention, he says, because this is "a weird political year."
On CBS's "This Morning" yesterday, he called attention to his program, one that "controls the growth of mandatory spending. . . . And we have a program. It's there. It's definitive." In an interview last week with The Times, he challenged the idea that only Bill Clinton has offered a coherent economic plan. His Administration has "32 pages of alternatives and options up there right now before the Senate." 
 In principle, the President has a point. The problem is that he has not pursued it in practice.
What is his "definitive" program? In the 1,000-page Federal budget for 1993, Budget Director Richard Darman devotes 2 1/2 pages to the idea of limiting mandatory spending -- spending for programs that automatically continue from year to year -- by a formula accounting for inflation and population growth.
It's a conscientious idea, but nowhere do Mr. Darman or his President suggest how they would cut spending to fit the formula. Would Mr. Bush charge retirees higher Medicare premiums? Would he cut back food stamps? He never says.
The 32-page plan Mr. Bush cited in the Times interview turns out to be a booklet advocating the balanced budget amendment. It consists mainly of charts; only three pages describe policies, largely a laundry list. Some proposals, like the one for health care reform, are innovative but lack tough measures needed to work. Others, like education and urban aid, involve so little money they can't possibly achieve their lofty goals.
This document describes Mr. Bush's proposal for a cap on mandatory spending in a few lines, none detailed. Indeed, the cap is described only as growth of "X%" after accounting for the impact of inflation and population growth. It's not hard to see why voters fail to understand where the President stands, not when he flaunts "definitive" solutions of X percent.
Though sketchy, Candidate Bush's proposal to cap mandatory spending is a responsible idea for controlling the deficit. Too bad that, in 42 months, President Bush has done so little to achieve it.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Hamilton Era?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Barring surprises like being elected Vice President, Lee Hamilton will become chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee next year. His career and character suggest he could spark far-reaching changes in how U.S. foreign policy is made and in the policy sausage that oozes from this new grinder.
Look for an end to the traditionally cozy connection between the White House and the chairman of the House panel. Look for stunning proposals to reorganize Washington's foreign policy machinery, including perhaps eliminating the enfeebled Agency for International Development. Look for a drive to recast priorities, much more economic emphasis and much less military-mindedness. 
 The Indiana Democrat does not want his approaches confused with isolationism. "I want the United States to be a world leader," he told me. "I don't agree with those who think we should play a reduced role in foreign affairs."
His goals could readily vaporize in the hands of a less determined and knowledgeable politician. But Mr. Hamilton, though gentlemanly and soft-spoken, also seems to have the steel and skill to be a powerhouse.
What, then, could derail a Hamilton era in the House, one that might rival and even exceed William Fulbright's mastery of Senate debate during the Vietnam War?
Bill Clinton could choose Mr. Hamilton as his running mate. But joining the ticket would not force the Congressman to abandon his safe seat. Indiana law, unusually, permits running for both offices. So even if a Clinton-Hamilton ticket loses, Mr. Hamilton almost certainly would be back in Congress.
Committee Republicans could fight Hamilton reforms. That is not likely either. Benjamin Gillman of upstate New York will replace the retiring William Broomfield as the ranking Republican, and Mr. Gillman is a genial man with no strong policy agenda. That leaves fellow Midwesterners Jim Leach and Jeff Bereuter as two key G.O.P. players, and both lean toward Mr. Hamilton's ideas. Only Henry Hyde, a partisan infighter, promises to be a problem.
Mr. Hamilton's strongest opposition could come from the institutional inertia of the committee itself. Congressional committees tend to develop their own styles. The House Armed Services Committee, for example, has been an independent and highly centralized operation since the days of Southern barons Carl Vinson and Mendel Rivers. This perfectly suits Les Aspin, the current chairman of that panel.
But the House Foreign Affairs Committee has traditionally been a far more decentralized operation -- dating back decades from the leadership of "Doc" Morgan and Clement Zablocki to its present leader, Dante Fascell, who will retire in December. Under their loose reign, subcommittee chairmen tended to go their separate ways.
Mr. Hamilton, however, has the necessary sway among Democrats to gather power in the committee as a whole. Stephen Solarz, who will be the number two Democrat on the panel if re-elected, is unlikely to challenge him. Besides, at least 7 of the top 11 Democrats on the committee will not be back next year.
Nonetheless, Mr. Hamilton cannot ignore the even deeper Morgan-Zablocki-Fascell tradition of helping out the White House. Since World War II, Presidents of both parties often got grief from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but could count on its House counterpart. The House committee help proved decisive on crunch issues like Vietnam.
More recently, Mr. Fascell rounded up crucial Democratic votes for aid to the contras in Nicaragua and President Bush's decision to use force against Iraq. Mr. Hamilton opposed contra aid and favored giving economic sanctions more time before attacking Saddam Hussein.
Lee Hamilton is far less likely than his predecessors to salute a desperate call from the White House. He will listen, politely and seriously as always, then make up his own mind.
Besides his independence, Mr. Hamilton's greatest strength is also his weakness. He is an educator, a persuader. He believes in exposing the facts and issues, then engaging in reasoned debate. That gift was sufficient for Senator Fulbright gradually to shift public attitudes toward the Vietnam War. But it was not enough to win legislative battles.
To fulfill his promise, Mr. Hamilton will have to go beyond teaching -- and put his legislative mark on machinery and policy.

Latest From Olympus

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Let me set down my muckrake for a moment to don Olympian robes and deliver a thumbsucker: Whither the Presidential campaign of 1992?
Clear the palate: What is the campaign not mainly about? Contrary to what you have been told, it is not primarily about vague themes like "character" or "leadership" or "change," nor ideological differences, nor health plans or abortion rights or deficit reduction, nor fears of endless recession. 
 This campaign is, first, about your assessment of George Bush's Presidency -- whether you trust his old-shoe experience to keep the nation out of major trouble.
Second, it is about your willingness to risk the alternatives. (Political scientists use the Henny Youngman formulation: "How's your wife?" "Compared to what?") This is a personal choice, in which personalities count heavily, but your central decision is whether to accept or reject George Bush.
Ignore all polls, which at this stage are only misleading. Scorn all other pundits who see this as a close three-way race, titillating each other with visions of an Electoral College dropout into the House; it's fun as a civics lesson but it won't happen.
What will happen to the three campaigns is this:
President Bush will not really bottom out until he returns from Europe and the Democratic Convention ends in mid-July. He faces further downward pressure from the coming call for an Iraqgate special prosecutor and from sluggish economic growth, but like Rommel in retreat, he gathers strength for a counterattack. The story around Labor Day will be the new signs of life in an underdog President and confidence about his steadiness in debate.
As the novelty wears off, as summer wears on, and as more troubling facts emerge about Ross Perot's manipulations, Perotmania will ebb. The outrage groupies from the Buchanan and Brown camps will continue to lionize their latest protest vehicle, but his expensive midnight-in-America ad campaign will fizzle, and the large "I'm-only-looking" element of his support will remain only tentatively committed.
Bill Clinton's convention in New York will be adjudged a success, compared with the 1988 debacle; his acceptance speech will also shine by comparison with his speech then. Blacks will be on board, with or without Jesse Jackson, but women and ethnics and flags will predominate; viewers will not feel threatened, and Democrats will no longer think of their candidate as a young stranger.
Come the fall, polls, debates and the competition-loving media may preserve the illusion of a three-way race. But let us keep our eye on the central dynamic of the campaign -- yes or no to Bush -- which will ultimately force anti-Bush voters to dump the weaker anti-Bush candidate.
Added urgency will be given them to switch to the strongest by the Bush comeback in the finally significant polls. By picking up a good portion of the undecided-about-Bush vote, the President will draw ahead of the second and third candidates, who at first split the undecideds-about-Bush.
Conservative women who feel strongly about abortion rights will also have to decide "most likely to beat Bush" and will choose pro-choice Clinton over pro-choice-but Perot; they will far outnumber Democratic or independent women who are anti-abortion enough to switch to Bush.
Toward the end, with Bush leading, the third man's vote will "break," much as George Wallace's 24 percent in the polls broke to 14 percent on Election Day in 1968; in that case, the majority of Wallaceite union members went home to the Democrats, enabling Hubert Humphrey almost to catch Nixon at the finish line.
The way the Perot protest support breaks will decide the election. This means that the early peace between Clinton and Perot, as both pound Bush, will turn into a furious don't-waste-your-vote altercation at the end, as Bush's opponents pound each other. That's why the Perot vote will ultimately shrink to one-half the Clinton vote, despite equal advertising.
Will this give Clinton enough to catch Bush and win? We here on Olympus know the answer, of course, but that would require revealing the stunning, unexpected event that will take place in the run-up to Halloween, which I am not at liberty to vouchsafe to readers at this time.

HEADLINE: First Airlifted Food Supplies Reach a Needy Sarajevo

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 1

 BODY:
The first food supplies to reach Sarajevo's 400,000 hungry residents by the tenuous air bridge opened earlier in the week were distributed today, but major problems continued to hinder plans to broaden the effort into a full-scale airlift.
The problems include the continuing fighting in areas near the airport and the fact that Sarajevo continues to be bombarded by Serbian guns on the hills surrounding the city, despite pledges of a cease-fire from Serbian leaders. 
 Among senior officials of the Bosnian Government, which is resisting Serbian attempts to carve out wide areas of the republic for an "ethnically pure" Serbian republic, there is still a widespread conviction that sustaining the airlift, and saving Sarajevo, will ultimately require some form of direct Western military intervention.
Disappointment at the failure of Western nations to intervene has been such that few people in Sarajevo took much notice of the Bush Administration's announcement on Tuesday that it is prepared to use United States air and naval units in support of an international military effort if fighting interferes with the airlift.
With five people killed in Sarajevo on Tuesday by Serbian snipers, and other casualties from the continuing bombardments by heavier guns, there is still widespread dismay that Western nations are not yet ready to do anything concrete to halt the relentless Serbian attacks on civilians.
 
Smiles on Refugees' Faces
 In the Skenderija sports hall, where medal ceremonies were held for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, officials of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees worked with local relief agencies to distribute French military ration packs to about 1,500 Muslim refugees.
Trucks also delivered eight tons of long-life milk and medical supplies to the Kosevo hospital complex, where many of the sick and wounded from the three-month siege are being treated.
The smiles on the faces of the refugees were a testament to the relief felt around the city at the breakthrough achieved by the United Nations officials in taking control of Sarajevo airport from Serbian nationalist forces.
But after the four French military aircraft that flew in on Monday and Tuesday, there were no new relief flights today and only a trickle of flights, at best, was expected before security arrangements at the airport are improved, possibly this weekend.
The United Nations military force at the Butmir airfield on the southwest outskirts of Sarajevo needs to be built up to the point where a credible defense can be mounted against possible attempts to disrupt the airlift.
Today, the skeleton crew of about 30 officers and technical personnel who took over the airport on Monday were strengthened by the arrival of nearly 170 French marines, 120 of them on four French military planes and nearly 50 others in the United Nations weekly overland convoy from Belgrade, the Serbian capital.
Full control of the airport and its perimeter will only be possible when an 850-member Canadian armored battalion arrives from Croatia, where the battalion was involved in a separate United Nations peacekeeping exercise related to last year's Croatian war.
 
200-Mile Journey
 But the Canadians' 200-mile journey, in a convoy of 300 vehicles that include 80 tracked personnel carriers, has been repeatedly interrupted by local warlords in northern Bosnia, and the Canadian convoy was still five hours away from Sarajevo when it halted tonight.
Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the United Nations commander in Sarajevo, said arrangements had been worked out with the Bosnian Government for the Canadian soldiers to take a route across backroads that will take them around some of the barricades put up by rival Serbian and Croatian militia groups.
The fact that the operation has gone as far as it has, with four flights carrying 38 tons having made it into the airport since Monday, is due largely to the personal initiative of President Francois Mitterrand of France and his Health Minister, Bernard Kouchner, who visited here on Sunday.
But to some, including senior officials of the Bush Administration and of several other European governments, the French initiatives have had an air of scene-stealing. For months before Mr. Mitterrand's visit here, France had resisted sanctions against Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia for its role in the killing here. More recently Paris vacillated, along with other European nations, in assessing what to do.
One senior United Nations official put it succinctly as the French food packs were distributed today. "What's been broken here is not just hunger, but the siege psychology," he said. "These people finally have the feeling that somebody out there cares."
The United Nations has much to worry about as it prepares for the full-scale airlift, which is expected to involve American, British and German military aircraft, as well as some planes chartered by relief agencies.
As matters stand, the entire operation could be interrupted or destroyed by any of a number of factors, each related to the fact that there is no cease-fire around Sarajevo, much less any prospect of a broader peace in the war across Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community's conference on Yugoslavia, is expected here on Friday. He will try to persuade the Serbian nationalist leaders and the Bosnian Government to resume negotiations under Portuguese mediation for a peace settlement.
The negotiations broke down in May when President Alija Izetbegovic, his capital being progressively destroyed by Serbian attacks, walked out of talks in Lisbon.
The war, and the widespread atrocities committed by the Serbian forces, has hardened opinion among Muslims and Croats, and the Bosnian Government issued a new political charter over the weekend in which it rejected any future division of the republic among ethnic lines.

U.S. Agrees to Contribute Planes
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States agreed today to contribute two military cargo planes to the United Nations effort to deliver relief supplies to Sarajevo.
But both President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d repeated the Administration's opposition to committing ground combat troops.
"It's right for the United States not to go ramming in as the sole perpetrator of force," Mr. Bush said in an interview on the "CBS This Morning" program. "Yes, we have two task forces right now in the Mediterranean. I have no plans at this juncture to use those forces."

American Takes Yugoslav Post
 The Bush Administration cleared the way yesterday for an American business executive of Serbian origin to become the Prime Minister of the truncated Yugoslavia.
Milan Panic, chairman of ICN Pharmaceuticals, a conglomerate based in Costa Mesa, Calif., said he received word that the Treasury Department had exempted him from American sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia by executive order last month.
The sanctions, economic and political, are intended to bring pressure on the Serbian leadership of President Slobodan Milosevic to cease attacks against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr. Panic was asked to accept the Prime Minister's post two weeks ago by Dobrica Cosic, the new Yugoslav President, who is a novelist. Mr. Cosic's candidacy was pushed by Mr. Milosevic.
The new Yugoslav Government retains authority only in the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
Asked how he intended to deal with the Milosevic leadership, Mr. Panic said: "I think that will be resolved in the form that power will be transferred to us -- Defense, the Interior Ministry, Foreign Affairs."
Initially Mr. Panic, who is 62 years old, expressed strong reservations about the job, saying he would do it only if he received support from broad sections of Serbian society, including opposition political parties.
Aides to Mr. Panic said President Bush and Mr. Baker had approved the exemption without specifically endorsing the businessman's candidacy.

HEADLINE: Feeling Pressure, Cheney Agrees To Allow Work on Novel Aircraft

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Yielding to political pressure from powerful members of Congress, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today reversed his decision to kill one of the Pentagon's most expensive new weapon systems.
The decision to devote $1.5 billion to development of the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane, is both a substantive and symbolic retreat by Mr. Cheney from Pentagon budget-trimming plans that have been strenuously resisted by Congress. 
 Congress has been of two minds on military spending. While wanting to pare the Pentagon budget so that money could be diverted to domestic programs, many lawmakers have been reluctant to make deep cuts in military spending during an election year, worried that it would hurt Pentagon contractors and increase unemployment in their districts.
The Osprey has already figured in the Presidential campaign, and Mr. Cheney's decision could well help Mr. Bush's re-election prospects, particularly in the states where the plane is being developed, Texas and Pennsylvania, each of which has a large number of electoral votes. The Osprey, is being developed by Bell Helicopter Textron in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia.
The companies developing the Osprey had cut back manufacturing plans during the stalemate between the Pentagon and the Congress over the V-22 program, according to press reports.
Several hundred workers were reported to be now assigned to the program, but a decision to go into production would create thousands of jobs and encourage the development of the plane for commercial transport purposes, creating still more employment.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the probable Democratic Presidential nominee, had endorsed the development of the Osprey, saying it might have important commercial applications.
Mr. Cheney, who made the Osprey a symbol of the Defense Department's ability to cancel costly weapons programs that have powerful constituencies on Capitol Hill and in the military, has repeatedly criticized the program as too costly. He has complained that the prototype aircraft was 3,000 pounds over its weight limit.
But today, the Defense Secretary backed down, proposing a compromise in a letter to Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader. Under the proposed compromise, about $1.5 billion would be spent in the fiscal years 1992 and 1993 to develop the V-22 and to begin a program to develop a alternative helicopter. A final decision whether to go for the Osprey or for the new helicopter would be decided in the future, Mr. Cheney wrote.
The effect of Mr. Cheney's decision is to maintain some momentum behind the program to develop the V-22 plane, while withholding final judgment on buying the aircraft for the armed forces.
The compromise echoes a similar agreement that was reached on May 21 to keep the Seawolf submarine program alive and keep shipbuilding jobs in Connecticut. President Bush had wanted to terminate a contract to build two submarines, but Congress voted to build only one. Mr. Bush then accepted the scaled-down project.
If the Pentagon and Congress ultimately decide to buy the plane on the basis of the program's merits or as a result of political pressures, tens of billions of dollars would probably be spent on the plane. The original plan, which Mr. Cheney deemed to be unwise and too costly, was to buy more than 500 of the V-22's. Mr. Cheney said today that the estimated cost of the program had soared to about $30 billion.
The Pentagon's insistence that the program be canceled as a waste of taxpayers' money has long been unpopular with lawmakers concerned with creating jobs at a time of high unemployment.
The Marine Corps and the Special Operations Forces have also long favored the development of the plane, despite Mr. Cheney's opposition.
Pete Williams, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, portrayed Mr. Cheney's decision as an effort to break a logjam with the Congress and denied suggestions by some lawmakers that the Defense Secretary had been told by the White House to drop his adamant opposition to the politically popular V-22 program.
In his letter to Senator Mitchell, Mr. Cheney made clear that he was still opposed to the Osprey program.
"If the V-22 was unaffordable in 1989, it is even more unaffordable now," Mr. Cheney said in the letter. "I remain convinced that we can find lower cost alternatives to satisfy the needs of the armed forces for a medium-lift aircraft."
Mr. Cheney said he was proposing a compromise because the Congress had adopted legislation blocking the Pentagon from examining a helicopter alternative to the Osprey and because he wanted to resolve a legal tangle with Congress over accusations that the Pentagon had illegally impounded funds by refusing to spend money that Congress had approved for the project.
The Pentagon has refused to spend $790 million authorized by Congress for the development and manufacture of three V-22 planes, asserting that engineering problems made it impossible to build three prototypes, as required by Congress, with the allotted money. But the Comptroller General later asserted that an illegal impoundment has occurred, setting the stage for a possible battle in the courts.
 
Partial Retreat, Official Says
 Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a research organization that favors reductions in the Pentagon budget, described Mr. Cheney's move as a partial retreat and not a complete capitulation to the Congressional proponents of the V-22. The compromise allows development of the program to proceed, but it does not commit the Pentagon to equip the military with the planes. Political pressure had made the V-22 a "hot potato," Mr. Adams added. "This allows you to avoid the hot potato, if nothing else."
Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, a Republican member of the House Armed Services Committee, who has strongly supported the development of the plane, described Mr. Cheney's decision as an important victory for the the Osprey's proponents. As a result of the decision, "there will be that much more expertise and that much more momentum" in the V-22 program. Mr. Weldon said that there was no Republican support on the committee for Mr. Cheney's opposition to the plane.
Although Congress is expected to lift its prohibition of developmental work on a medium-lift helicopter, in light of Mr. Cheney's compromise, some experts say it would take so long to develop that it would not be a serious alternative to the V-22.
Mr. Cheney suggested in his letter that the decision whether to procure the V-22 or a new helicopter might not be made for years, saying it was a matter for "a future Congress and a future Administration."

 GLUT OF OFFICE SPACE HAS SIDE EFFECT
A glut of Manhattan office space has produced an unexpected side effect: Declining rents have slowed the pace of business relocations elsewhere.

Two New York City police officers were indicted -- one in Brooklyn for murder, the other in Manhattan for assault -- in the shootings of civilians. The officer indicted for murder, Robert Cabeza, was accused of shooting a Brooklyn liquor store owner during an attempted robbery in 1991. In the Manhattan case, Officer Sean Gelfand was accused of shooting an unarmed taxicab driver, who the police said was innocently caught up in a robbery in April. B3.
 
 AN OFFICER'S ANGRY REACTION
When Officer Michael Dowd, a policeman who is charged with leading a ring of cocaine-dealing police officers, was served with departmental charges at his home early last month, he yelled at the New York City police investigators who confronted him, and his wife ordered them off the family's property, according to investigators.

The Fed Takes Action
The unemployment rate rose sharply in June, and the Fed quickly responded to the news by cutting two key interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy. Analysts said the data were so grim the Fed had little choice, despite concerns that it would appear to be bowing to political pressure. [Page A1.] The news underscores a split on the President's staff over whether he should appear optimistic or sober on the economy. News Analysis. [A1.]
The Labor Department said the nation's jobless rate spurted another three-tenths of a point in June, to 7.8 percent, while payroll jobs slumped 117,000. The figures were stunningly gloomy and challenged assumptions of continued economic recovery. Analysts found little comfort in data that included a shorter work week, lengthening spells of unemployment, more layoffs and a swelling in the ranks of the jobless by 470,000 to a total of just under 10 million. [A12.] In an employment picture nationwide that is unremittingly bleak, the scene in the New York region appears blacker than most. [A12.] 
 Congress passed a major change in unemployment laws, making it easier for workers to collect extended benefits. [A13.]

HEADLINE: Pact in Albany Limits Profits Of Criminals

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Friday, July 3

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached agreement this morning on a bill that would force criminals who profit from books or films about their crimes to share the profits with their victims. The measure is intended to replace the celebrated "Son of Sam" law that was struck down by the United States Supreme Court last year.
The accord was one of few to emerge from horse-trading in the round-the-clock drive to end the legislative session this morning. Many other bills were essentially being held hostage to one another, and officials were reluctant to declare final agreements on any measure until they had agreed on all. 
 Lawmakers said they were set to revive an $800 million bond act for economic development, with a bill negotiated by Governor Cuomo and the legislative leaders. It was delivered to Senate Republicans for consideration just after midnight. Lawmakers also said they had agreed on a $40 million deal to help balance the budget by selling part of the Aqueduct Race Track in Queens to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 
Revision of 1977 Law
 Details of what will likely be dubbed the "Son of Son of Sam Law" were sketchy, but the premise was to require criminals who sell their stories to share at least part of the proceeds with the victims who can prevail in civil court claims against them.
The original 1977 law was named for the serial killer David Berkowitz, who called himself "Son of Sam." The law restricted criminals from profiting by selling their stories, but the Supreme Court ruled last December that the statute violated the First Amendment.
Under the new measure, sponsored by Senator Emanuel R. Gold and Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, both Queens Democrats, no limits would be placed on the criminal's ability to sell his story, but it would be easier for crime victims to share in the proceeds by making claims against them. Among other things, the measure would increase the statute of limitations for collections to seven years, from the present limit of one year.
Mr. Hevesi said the new measure met the suggested provisions that the Supreme Court had spelled out in its decision. "Speech is protected here," he said, "profiting is not protected."
A vote on the measure was not expected until close to dawn.
Several other bills that appeared on the verge of passage Thursday died as legislative exhaustion set in.
A tentative accord on stringent new measures to deter teen-agers from smoking collapsed. And a fiscal bailout desperately sought by county governments on Long Island also appeared in trouble, in large part because Governor Cuomo insisted that he would not approve of tax increases in the bill until county leaders demonstrated to him that they were necessary.
 
Chiding From Cuomo
 There was a clear sense in Capitol hallways that the end of the legislative year was imminent, a feeling that was compounded by word on Thursday that monthslong redistricting battles had been settled in the courts and in the United States Justice Department. Many lawmakers had feared they would have to return to Albany next week to haggle over that issue some more.
Governor Cuomo derided the lawmakers for failing to act on some of his major initiatives, including a fund for environmental protection, laws to strengthen protections of the Adirondack wilderness, and a state assumption of all responsibilities for Medicaid. But he, too, seemed prepared to bid the lawmakers farewell.
"They want to go home," Mr. Cuomo told reporters. "Some of them are out of socks. They've been here for 11 days now."
The unraveling of a bill on youth smoking appeared to be the most serious casualty of the rush to adjourn, and several watchdog groups blamed the tobacco industry for mounting a last-minute blitz to beat back the bill.
"Senator Marino has chosen to put the financial health of the tobacco industry ahead of the health of New York's children," said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

HEADLINE: American Flies to Belgrade To Take Top Yugoslav Post

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
After receiving permission from the Bush Administration, Milan Panic, an American pharmaceutical manufacturer, left today to become Prime Minister of federal Yugoslavia and carry out what he called a "peace mission" to help end the year-long conflict in the Balkans.
Mr. Panic had to receive United States permission in order to travel to a country that is under an international embargo and whose relations with the United States remain frozen, and to serve there as one of its top leaders while retaining his United States citizenship. 
 The Administration permission was required because the American sanctions against Yugoslavia prohibit United States citizens from carrying out any project, whatever its nature, that might help the country.
According to an aide of Mr. Panic (pronounced PAHN-itch), the exemption to United States sanctions, which was announced Wednesday evening, was approved by President Bush.
 
Hope for Changing Behavior
 Senior Administration officials said the waiver was issued in the hope that Mr. Panic might contribute to changing the behavior of the Serbian leadership, which is regarded as a principal instigator of the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the siege of the Bosnia capital, Sarajevo. Other officials were more skeptical about the Panic mission.
Mr. Panic was selected for the federal Yugoslav position by politicians who said they viewed him as a credible leader at a time when the Serbian leaders in Belgrade are facing mounting opposition in their own capital, and in the hope that he would help improve relations with Washington.
"This is a peace mission," Mr. Panic said in an interview today. "I know I am going on a pirate ship. But if I become captain, the pirate ship will be turned into a ship of peace."
He said he believed that his premiership of federal Yugoslavia would marginalize Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Serbian republic, because under the new Yugoslav constitution, authority over Ministries of Defense, Interior and Foreign Affairs would be held by the new Prime Minister.
 
Leaves for Budapest
 Mr. Panic departed Thursday evening for Budapest and is expected to drive on Friday to his native Belgrade, where he is scheduled to be formally elected Prime Minister by the federal Yugoslav Parliament on Monday. Permission for Mr. Panic to become the Yugoslav Prime Minister was granted by the Administration after more than a week of deliberations. The country he will govern has been reduced to less half its size by secessions of four republics of the old Yugoslavia -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. Yugoslavia now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr. Panic, the 62-year-old chairman of I.C.N. Pharmaceuticals, a conglomerate based in Costa Mesa, Calif., has taken leave of absence from his executive positions in his $460 million international drug company. Over the last 22 years, Mr. Panic and his companies have been investigated by two federal regulatory agencies and assessed penalties, while stockholders have also contested some of his actions.
A national bicycle racing champion before he legt Yugoslavia in 1956, Mr. Panic became a successful entrepreneur in California by fostering biotechnology research. In the past, his zealous promotion of I.C.N. products drew censure and penalties from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Food and Drug Administration.
Recently, I.C.N.'s most profitable undertaking has been the Galenika pharamaceuticals company, a Belgrade concern whose American vice chairman is John D. Scanlan , formerly United States Ambasador to Yugoslavia. Mr. Scanlan had been advising Mr. Panic during his consideration of the position.
In the interview, Mr. Panic said he expected to serve as Prime Minister for a maximum of two years and then return to the United States. "I intend to stay American," he said.
He was offered the post of Prime Minister two weeks ago by President Dobrica Cosic (pronounced DOE-bree-tsah CHOE-sitch), a Serbian novelist who became head of state in Belgrade last month.
Mr. Panic finally accepted on the condition that he receive a guarantee from the Bush Administration that he would not face penalties under United States political and economic sanctions imposed by President Bush on federal Yugoslavia on June 5.
Those restrictions, part of a larger United Nations package of sanctions, were directed principally against the Serbian leadership of President Milosevic as pressure to stop aggression by Serbs against Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
100,000 in Belgrade Protest
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, July 3 (Reuters) -- More than 100,000 Serbs marched through the center of Belgrade today to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. There were no indications that opponents of the President were mollified by the nomination of Mr. Panic as new Yugoslav Prime Minister.
Mr. Milosevic has come under increasing pressure from the opposition in the past week to step down as residents of the capital feel the effects of United Nations sanctions imposed because of his policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The opposition organized the biggest anti-Government demonstrations since World War II on Sunday, and they have continued for five days and nights.
The number of people joining the nightly demonstrations steadily rose and today's protest drew the most crowds, according to independent estimates.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Jobless Aid And Bush Says He Will Sign

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Congress passed a major change in unemployment laws today to make it easier for workers out of a job more than six months to collect extended benefits in future recessions, and President Bush said he would sign the bill.
The permanent changes would take effect after the expiration next March of the third emergency benefits extension of the current recession. That extension is also included in this bill. It is expected to aid between 2 million and 2.5 million workers who will exhaust their basic 26 weeks of benefits through March. They will be eligible for up to 26 more weeks of benefits. 
 After the Government announced this morning that the June unemployment rate had soared to an eight-year high of 7.8 percent, the bill sailed through both Houses. The vote in the House was 396 to 23; in the Senate it was 92 to 3. The details of the measure were proposed last night by House conferees and agreed to by Senators this morning.
 
Bush Turns Around
 President Bush had opposed making permanent changes but had sought another emergency extension. This morning he said he might veto it, but tonight he said before leaving for Camp David, "I will sign this bill as soon as it reaches my desk."
He praised it for preserving fiscal discipline and avoiding new taxes, and said that the possible 52 weeks of regular and extended benefits combined were "an important safeguard for workers who still can't find jobs as the economy continues to grow."
As insisted on by both the White House and the Senate, the $5.5 billion measure will not increase the budget deficit. It will be financed through changes in the tax law that will require higher corporate estimated tax payments, increased taxes on lump-sum pension distributions and a one-year elimination of the personal exemption for high-income taxpayers.
Under the existing law, passed in 1982, a Federal-state extended benefits program paid long-term unemployed workers benefits only under extreme conditions. Despite the current 7.8 rate, only workers in Alaska and Puerto Rico would now be eligible under the existing law.
Because few workers were covered, Congress started passing emergency extensions of benefits last summer. President Bush killed two such bills but agreed to measures passed in November and February.
Under continuous pressure from Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, leaders in Congress came to support a permanent change in the law to end the frequent partisan battles over extensions.
In the brief House debate, Mr. Downey said: "The President is going to sign this bill for two reasons. Unemployment is up, and his popularity is down."
The bill passed today would make unemployed workers in a state eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the state's total unemployment rate for the last three months was at least 6.5 percent and was at least 10 percent higher than it was in the same period in either of the preceding two years. Up to 20 weeks of extended benefits could be paid in a state where the total unemployment rate was at least 8 percent and was 10 percent higher than in either of the previous two years.
If they preferred, states could still use the old, more restrictive standard, though in serious recessions they would face intense pressure to adopt the new, more generous and consequently more expensive formula.
The old requirement for eligibility for extended benefits was based on the Insured Unemployment Rate, which includes only workers covered by unemployment insurance. Workers joining or rejoining the work force were usually not covered, now were workers who had exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits. That rate is much lower than the total unemployment rate, which reflects everyone out of work and looking for a job.
Under the old law, workers have been eligible for up to 13 weeks of extended benefits if the Insured Unemployment Rate in their state was 5 percent, and if it was 20 percent higher than it was in the same 13 weeks of the two previous years. They could also be eligible for 13 weeks if the Insured Unemployment Rate reached 6 percent.
The old system did not extend benefits in West Virginia, even though that state's total unemployment rate today is 11.6 percent. Nor did it cover workers in California, though the rate is 9.5 percent, or in New York or New Jersey, both at 9.2 percent.
Unemployment benefits, about half a worker's previous salary, average $170 a week nationally.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes $981 Million in Aid for Ex-Soviet Bloc

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The Senate approved today a long-delayed aid package to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that authorizes nearly $1 billion in new spending and billions of dollars in credits and loans, all conditioned on continued movement toward democracy and a free market.
By a 76-to-20 vote, the Senate passed a bill that supporters said established a new framework for friendly relations between Washington and its former cold-war foes. The House is expected to take up a similar package later this month. 
 President Bush has made the aid program a top foreign-policy priority and, anticipating the Senate vote, he said today that he would brief President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on the legislation when they met after a gathering of the Group of Seven industrial democracies in Munich next week.
The Senate acted after a two-day debate in which lawmakers struggled to overcome suspicions left over from decades of confrontation with the Soviet Union. In response, the bill included a provision to cut off aid after 12 months if Russia had not shown progress in withdrawing former Soviet troops from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
The package, along with measures already enacted, is to provide $2.5 billion in direct and indirect assistance, much of it in loans and loan guarantees, to Russia and 11 other republics in 1992 and 1993. The package for the former republics of the Soviet Union will account for about 5 percent of all United States foreign aid, according to Sen. Richard J. Lugar of Indiana, the second-ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
 
Who Gets What
 The legislation creates a total of $981 million in new budget authority for 1993, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.
Russia and 11 other republics of the former Soviet Union would receive $470 million in bilateral assistance, while $450 million would go to nine Baltic and Eastern European states, including republics that were part of Yugoslavia. Another $61 million would be spent to set up new diplomatic posts and centers to promote trade and investment by United States companies.
The bill also sets out Washington's contribution to multilateral aid efforts.
It increases financial backing for the International Monetary Fund by $12.2 billion and authorizes a $3 billion contribution to currency-stabilization programs, first for the Russian ruble and later for the currencies of the other former Soviet republics. The programs would be administered by the I.M.F.
Supporters of these multilateral efforts said they would not require any immediate outlay of taxpayer money. The ruble fund, for example, would be used only if the ruble fluctuates wildly.
 
The Non-Money Items
 The package also expands agricultural credits, student exchanges and other contacts, while eliminating numerous barriers to trade and investment by United States businesses.
The bill sets strict requirements for recipients.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said, "We have conditioned aid to any republic on good-faith conduct by each of these new states in several important areas -- human rights, economic reforms, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology, and avoiding the use of military force against other states."
Conservative Republicans introduced several amendments to make these conditions stricter, but most were overwhelmingly defeated after the bill's proponents argued that Congress might actually set back Mr. Yeltsin's democratization plans by demanding too much of him.
The Senate also turned back efforts by liberal Democrats requiring that aid to the Soviet Union be matched by similar amounts of spending on domestic programs like the Job Corps and vaccinations for children.
President Bush first proposed the new aid in a speech on April 1, and two days later sent a letter to Congress appealing for bipartisan support. The letter said the package was "an issue that transcends any election."
Since then the aid request has been much debated and long delayed.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Told to Publish New Air Pollution Rules Before Compliance Deadline

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency cannot wait until next January to publish new air pollution rules that the states are supposed to put into effect this November, a Federal District Court judge has ruled.
The E.P.A. had planned to wait until Jan. 28, 1993, to publish its regulations for a car-inspection program that the Clean Air Act says must be in place by Nov. 15, 1992. 
 The agency's acting general counsel, Raymond B. Ludwiszewski, acknowledged that expecting the states to comply with rules before they are written "might appear to be an anomaly."
Late Wednesday, Judge Denis R. Hurley ruled that it was also illegal.
Judge Hurley gave the E.P.A. until Nov. 6, leaving the states nine days to comply with the regulations, which are expected to run several hundred pages.
 
Tests Are Inadequate
 At issue are automobile inspections in 75 metropolitan areas that fail to meet Federal smog standards in 22 states. By some estimates, 5 percent of cars emit 50 percent of smog-forming ozone. Many states already conduct annual inspections, but experts say they miss dirty cars, in part because nearly all states test emissions while cars are idling. Newer cars with computer-controlled fuel injection behave differently at different speeds, so idling tests are ineffective.
When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, it required "enhanced inspection and maintenance" procedures, to be put in effect by Nov. 15, 1992, and gave the E.P.A. until Nov. 15, 1991 to issue the regulations.
That is what the E.P.A. has yet to do.
"If you look at the Clean Air Act, there are literally hundreds of deadlines in the first year and a half," said Mr. Ludwiszewski. "You try as hard as you can to make as much progress as you can. You try to push the most important regulations up, but sometimes you have slippage."
Not everyone was understanding.
"It's almost like they're saying, 'The dog ate my homework'," said S. William Becker, the executive director of the Association of State and Local Air Pollution Control Officials, which is based in Washington.
 
States Risk Lawsuits
 The E.P.A. cannot be lenient, even if it wants to, because the Clean Air Act gives citizens the right to sue states that are not in compliance. A judge who found a state to be in violation could hold up Federal highway funds or ban new construction, public and private, on the grounds that it would add to pollution.
The suit was originally brought against the E.P.A. by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group. A lawyer there, James F. Simon, said that while implementing the law would cost the states money, violating it would cost more. He said that the rule was opposed by some service stations that now do inspections and would be forced out of the business if more elaborate equipment is needed.
"One hundred million people live in areas with unhealthy air," he said. "For the E.P.A. to hold up this rule because of the economic interests of some small gas station owners seems unjustifiable to me."
In many cases, car owners will probably have to take their vehicles to central points, to be tested on treadmills. The regulations that the states are waiting for include questions like whether the repair work can be done at the same site or must be performed elsewhere, and how often cars will have to be tested.
 
Deadline's Meaning Debated
 A spokeswoman for the E.P.A., Martha Casey, said that her agency had finished writing the rule in February, only three months past deadline, but that the Office of Management and Budget had been very slow in its review, and is only now returning it for further work.
The E.P.A. and the states disagree on precisely what must be done by Nov. 15. The E.P.A. believes that the law requires the states to present detailed plans for implementing an enhanced inspection and maintenance program. Given its own tardiness, the E.P.A. had said that, in lieu of detailed plans to comply with nonexistent regulations, it would accept a promise by states to comply when the regulations were issued.
But Mr. Becker, of the association of states, said that the states were supposed to have actual inspection programs in place by the deadline, which is now clearly impossible.
The states do have some clues, Mr. Ludwiszewski said, because his agency has met with them and circulated draft regulations. If they are really concerned about huge penalties, he said, "then you take your best guess and go with it," instituting a program before the Federal requirements are spelled out. But, Mr. Becker said, that could mean state air pollution commissioners asking their legislatures to enact new, unpopular rules that might never be required by the E.P.A. If, for example, the state officials ask legislatures to require that repair shops be separate from inspection stations, and the E.P.A. regulations do not include that requirement, the officials will be accused of "crying wolf once too often."

HEADLINE: A Murky Recovery;
How Many Lean Years Must Follow The Long String of Very Fat Years?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Fifteen months after the recession supposedly ended, the economic recovery remains wobbly, slow and, to many Americans, barely perceptible.
Why can't this economy get moving? The answer is that the economy still has a hangover from the eight-year Reagan boom. The longest peacetime expansion in postwar history has left the Government with too much debt, consumers with too little savings and many businesses, especially in the sprawling service economy, too bloated. 
 Coping with these ill effects is as much a matter of time as it is of cheaper money.
"The economy needs a prolonged period of recuperation from the excesses of the 1980's," said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
The Federal Reserve Board, after all, has hardly been sitting on its hands. The central bank has cut interest rates 23 times since mid-1989 and the Federal funds rate, what banks pay each other for overnight loans, is now at 3.25 percent, its lowest level in decades. A more aggressive approach, much as it might have been desired by the White House, might very likely have backfired by fanning inflation fears and spooking investors.
So while forecasters expect the Federal Reserve's action to do some good, they warn that the pattern of sluggish and uneven recovery will probably persist for at least several quarters.
Three obstacles to growth make this likely: long-term interest rates remain high; consumers want to pay off debts, and, most important, businesses are determined to keep their costs under control.
 
'Symptom of Our Nervousness'
 Long-term rates -- which affect what home buyers pay for mortgages, municipalities for a new public works projects or businesses to modernize -- have come down far less than short-term rates, one reason the housing recovery has been so muted and construction employment so weak. Yields on 30-year bonds are above 7.6 percent -- 3 or 4 percentage points above the inflation rate most economists expect for a few years.
"It's basically a symptom of our nervousness," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist of the Shawmut National Corporation.
By all accounts, investors are edgy because of the $390 billion Federal deficit this year. Bondholders are evidently not convinced that the deficit will shrink by the time that private credit demands -- currently weak because of the sluggish world economy -- start to swell up again. If their fears were allayed and the difference between long- and short-term rates turned more normal, home buyers might be shopping for 6 percent, instead of 8 percent, mortgages.
It is that very deficit that makes it all but impossible for the Government to spend its way out of recession. At the same time, the deficit makes a significant tax cut unlikely.
"Why is fiscal policy dead?" Mr. Perna asked. "The budget deficit has prevented us from acting."
Consumers are still struggling with too much debt and too little savings. They are paying down installment debt and restraining spending on big-ticket items like housing and cars. With inflation tame and house prices unlikely to rise much, consumers also have less incentive to go into debt to put a deed in their pockets.
The trouble is that incomes are stagnating so that the ratio of debt to income has barely declined from its peak. "It's a prolonged process," said Mr. Steinberg at Merrill Lynch. "Eventually there's a way out, but only when the real constraining force -- debt -- begins to fade away."
But the biggest drag on the economy is the streamlining and cost-cutting that is evident in dozens of industries, and in state and local governments. With the end of the cold war, military suppliers are shedding thousands of jobs. The shakeout in the computer and car industries continues. And after years of open-handed hiring, service companies are focusing on increasing efficiency.
"Job growth is more important than ever before for income growth," said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. Pay increases are not keeping up with inflation, interest income is shrinking and no tax relief is in sight.
Some of the cost-consciousness reflects the executives' views that the recovery will be unusually anemic. Given those views, many executives believe that price increases will be tough, if not impossible, to get. Thus, they see squeezing labor costs -- by cutting their work forces, holding down pay increases, hiring conservatively and getting more out of the hands that are already on board -- as the only way to raise profit margins.
"Most companies are telling us that there is no price flexibility out there," said Mr. McKelvey at Goldman, Sachs.
Take Compass Transportation in Youngstown, Ohio. The company, which ships cars and steel all over the Midwest and East, says business is brisk and it is trying to hire more drivers. But though it is having trouble finding qualified applicants, the company is not raising its starting salary.
"We can't raise wages to attract more drivers," said one of the company's partners, Joseph Fleming. "Customers just aren't willing to pay more."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
AIDS Demonstrators Disrupt Perot Rally

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash., July 2

 BODY:
With 200 American flags held aloft by volunteers standing on the steps of the Capitol under a crystal blue sky, it was the kind of camera-pleasing visual feast that organizers of Ross Perot's rallies strive for. But in their eyes this snapshot of Americana was marred for a time today by the presence of another image of late 20th century America: protesters.
A handful of members of Act Up, an advocacy group for people with AIDS, briefly took over the stage at Mr. Perot's rally here today, vowing not to leave until the Texas billionaire addressed issues of AIDS and gay rights. They wanted him to explain comments he has made saying he would not appoint homosexuals to his cabinet and would not lift the military's ban on homosexual soldiers. 
 "We want to know what Ross Perot stands for here in Olympia in Washington State," Stephen Michael, a member of Act Up from Seattle, shouted through a hand-held public address system. "We want answers. What does Ross Perot believe? Nobody has any idea, because Ross Perot won't say."
To head off further disruption, Mr. Perot met for 20 minutes with Mr. Michael and several other Act Up representatives, delaying the start of his rally. Mr. Michael said that Mr. Perot promised he would address gay rights issues. But in his brief remarks to the crowd of about 4,000 people, Mr. Perot did not refer to the demonstration or to gay issues.
Instead, Mr. Perot kept to his standard speech, urging the crowd to remain involved in the political process.
"Does everybody here understand that you cannot elect someone and send that person to Washington and have that person do it for you?" Mr. Perot asked the crowd. "You are going to have to stay deeply involved at the local, county, state and national level, as an owner, for these revolutionary changes to occur. But if you, the taxpayers want it, you can get it."
Mr. Perot urged the audience to register voters, whether or not they intend to vote for him, and he praised Washington's voter registration law, which allows individuals to register when they renew their drivers licenses.
His comment came the same day President Bush vetoed legislation passed by Congress that would have allowed voters nationwide to register when they renew drivers licenses, at unemployment offices or when they apply for welfare. Mr. Bush said the measure would encourage voter fraud.
 
Lifestyle Questions Arising
 While gay rights demonstrators have appeared at a number of Mr. Perot's rallies in recent weeks, today was the first time they succeeded in disrupting the proceedings. The presence of the protesters indicates that while Mr. Perot strives to focus his embryonic campaign on the issue of economic growth, questions concerning his tolerance of diverse lifestyles may continue to haunt him.
The demonstration came a day after the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith released a letter from Morton H. Meyerson, former president of Electronic Data Systems, and a top aide to Mr. Perot, defending the company's dismissal in 1983 of an employee in Seattle who grew a beard in violation of company policy. The employee, Reginald Dallaire, claimed to be an Orthodox Jew and refused to shave for religious reasons.
A Federal judge ruled that Mr. Dallaire had been discriminated against because of his religion and ordered his reinstatement. Mr. Dallaire later quit the company and moved to Alaska.
A two-page memorandum that accompanied Mr. Meyerson's letter questioned Mr. Dallaire's sincerity and raised questions about his motives and his character, issues that E.D.S. had not raised during the court hearing on the case, according to Mr. Dallaire's lawyer. The memorandum also indicated that after the suit had been settled and Mr. Dallaire had moved, his supervisors questioned his former neighbors about him.
According to the memorandum, Mr. Dallaire's neighbors told his supervisor, "that they had been somewhat afraid of him. It seems that he had the habit of mowing his lawn while wearing visible firearms. He also told some neighbors that he been (sic) a sharpshooter in Vietnam and stalked people through the wooded areas in Washington with his rifle to prove that he still had his sniping abilities."
The memo did not say why neighbors were questioned after Mr. Dallaire had already left the company.
"That's an incredible set of allegations, none of which were raised at the time," said Michael Reiss, a lawyer with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who handled Mr. Dallaire's complaint against E.D.S. "Either it's a fabrication or a case where they're going out to try and get dirt on somebody after he's left the company."
In a telephone interview today, Mr. Meyerson said he "did not have the foggiest idea" why Mr. Dallaire's supervisor questioned his neighbors.
Today's disruption also highlighted the mistakes that can be made by a his grass-roots campaign organization that relies on enthusiastic but often inexperienced volunteers. In organizing the rally at which they turned in petitions containing more than 55,000 signatures, Mr. Perot's volunteers failed to get a permit to hold the event on the steps of the State Capitol. As a result, they did not have exclusive use of the steps, and could not force the ACT UP demonstrators to leave.

HEADLINE: House Approves Tax Bill With $14.5 Billion in Breaks

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Riding a wave of support for encouraging investment in depressed neighborhoods, the House of Representatives today overwhelmingly approved a broad package of tax legislation that includes an estimated $14.5 billion in tax breaks for businesses and individuals over six years.
But the legislation also raises additional taxes to avoid causing an overall increase in the Federal budget deficit. 
 The bill centered on provisions to create urban enterprise zones, in response to the Los Angeles riots in late April. It won wide support for many reasons, among them the Administration's endorsement, even though many members objected to one or another of its diverse provisions.
The bill's highlights include the extension of several tax benefits that had expired on June 30; the repeal of the luxury tax on jewelry, furs and expensive pleasure boats; the reinstatement of passive-loss deductions, which allow investors who incur losses in real estate to shield other income from taxation, and a provision that would let businesses depreciate their intangible assets -- but it would not allow this technique, which has been hotly debated, to be used retroactively.
The vote in the House was a significant step toward resolving dozens of questions about taxation that have been lingering since President Bush in March vetoed a previous tax bill that was much bigger and included a Democrat-backed tax break for the middle class at the expense of wealthier people. That provision was not in the bill that passed today.
Republicans backed the measure with the Administration's blessing, even though it included nothing along the lines of the President's longstanding central tax proposal, a reduction in the capital gains tax, which he was once again promoting in a talk to Republican representatives before the bill was approved.
Despite the House vote, considerable horse-trading remains to be done before a final agreement is reached with the Senate, which is developing several tax laws that in their current drafts conflict with the measure that the House approved today. The Senate will not consider its version of the legislation until later in the month.
 
Fourth of July Rush
 For its part, the House, after several days in which its leaders argued over both substance and procedure, voted its approval in a rush before leaving for an extended Fourth of July holiday, an important time for members to go home and campaign.
The House suspended its normal rules so that the bill could not be amended on the floor, an approach that required a two-thirds vote of approval. The vote to approve the bill was 356 to 55.
Some members shunned the compromise. "I oppose the bill," said Representative James A. Traficant Jr., Democrat of Ohio. "The bill is half good, half bad -- and where I come from that is mediocre."
But more common was the approach of Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who in the brief time allocated for debate rose to praise one particular provision or another. She singled out for approval the permanent extension of tax breaks for small issues of industrial development bonds, which she called "the only measure targeted to the industrial backbone of our economy."
 
Three Other Measures
 That was one of four measures made permanent by the House bill after having previously been extended temporarily again and again, only to expire once more at the end of last month. Like the other three -- a low-income rental housing credit, a credit for employing economically disadvantaged young people up to age 24, and mortgage-revenue bonds -- this one was considered a useful spur for the economies of inner cities and thus a counterpart to the tax provisions included in the urban enterprise zone bill.
It is, at least on paper, more costly to extend this kind of tax break permanently than to eke out the breaks for a year or so at a time the way the Senate Finance Committee has tended to do. This difference is an example of how the negotiating must continue, often less because of differences over policy than because of the arcane accounting rules that the two chambers of Congress use to calculate whether tax provisions increase the budget deficit.
The House also temporarily extended several other tax breaks, including a tax credit for business research and development, the tax-free treatment for employer-provided educational assistance and the 25 percent deduction for medical insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals.
Another provision extended for 18 months was special tax treatment for the charitable donation of property that has appreciated in value. To encourage such gifts, the bill would exempt the donors from the alternative-minimum-tax provisions of the tax law.
 
Moving Deductions Cut
 But to avoid throwing the budget further out of balance, there had to be some provisions that clearly raise revenues. One provision in the House measure cuts back on the kinds of moving expenses that can be deducted when people change jobs, including a $5,000 limit on allowable deductions. This provision alone, if it takes effect at the end of the year, is expected to raise an estimated $3.5 billion over next six years.
One of the hardest fights of the emerging tax law is over the ability of businesses depreciate intangible assets, like newspapers' subscriber lists, independent insurance agents' customer lists and the core deposits held by banks.
With many millions of dollars at stake, businesses are entangled in innumerable negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service over whether they can write off such assets over the years after they have been acquired, on the principle that a list of customers can lose value just as an automobile or a building can.
Proponents say that simplifying the law in this regard would be fairer to companies, would avoid litigation and, depending on how it is done, might even raise money for the Government. Opponents say that it would unduly reward participants in leveraged buyouts, especially if such depreciation was allowed retroactively, and that in the end it would cost the Government money.
 
Split on Retroactivity
 The House has now agreed to allow this kind of depreciation in the future but not retroactively. The Senate has not yet voted, but its Finance Committee favors allowing the retroactive use of these deductions for past tax years under certain limits.
This is just the kind of issue that will keep what one lawyer today laughingly called "the tax wonks" busy for a few more weeks before a tax law eventually emerges.
The provision allowing passive-loss deductions in real estate is an example of Congress's voting to undo one of the features of its last major tax overhaul, in 1986, when tax shelters were attacked across a broad front.
The unintended result of killing passive-loss deductions was to remove a tax break from people who actually spend most of their time in real estate, a decision that whipsawed many builders just as the real estate market turned sour on them. Part of the appeal at this time for restoring this tax break was the argument that it would add to the broader push for investment in urban areas.

HEADLINE: As Jobless Ranks Grow, Hope Falls in California

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

 BODY:
As the recession has deepened here in Southern California, the unemployment line on Venice Boulevard has grown longer, quieter and more angry.
Shuffling slowly forward, the podiatrist, the financial planner, the insurance saleswoman and others spoke with dignity about the humiliations of joblessness and about their sinking hopes for the future. 
 But on this day when new unemployment figures showed their numbers to be higher than in any other big industrial state, they also spoke bitterly about what they called the betrayal of an American ideal of success through hard work, and even of the fulfillment of a biblical prophecy of doom.
"Is this what America is built upon?" said Alex Spriggs, a 42-year-old podiatrist who has been out of work for nine months. "You get an education, you get a job, you try to live right and go by all the rules, and then you're out on the street. What can our kids look forward to? What about the ones that are coming out of college right now?"
Ron Ferraro, 51, an auto-body appraiser who has not worked since last year, was here to ask for an extension of his unemployment benefits, and also to pick up job-training forms for his 18-year-old son, who is out of work and homeless.
"I was on the telephone with him last night, and he was almost sobbing about the fact that he was scared," Mr. Ferraro said. "He's scared. I'm scared. It's almost as if the biblical prophecy of violence, pestilence and lawlessness was coming true."
Nationally, the unemployment rate for June was 7.8 percent, higher than it has been for eight years. The figure for California was still higher at 9.5 percent, the highest among the 11 major industrial states.
California's growing unemployment rate, up from 8.7 percent in May, is the latest evidence of the state's worst economic troubles since the Great Depression. Recovery here is not expected until at least next year, well behind the rest of the nation.
On Wednesday, with the Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson unable to agree on a deficit-reducing budget package, the state began paying its bills with I.O.U.'s. Any reductions in state spending will almost certainly involve cuts in employment by state and local governments, pushing the unemployment figures still higher.
In the unemployment office on Venice Boulevard, the manager, Bob Fisher, said an internal report last month showed that claims had risen locally by 31 percent over the previous year.
"The more people we get here in our lobby, the more calm it seems to get," he said, almost as if people are becoming aware that their individual problems are only a small part of a large-scale disaster.
He said his office had yet to feel the effects of a layoff announced this week of 9,000 employees at the Hughes Aircraft Company, the state's largest industrial employer. Over the last six years, the gradual decline in military spending has cost the Los Angeles region alone about 100,000 relatively high-paying jobs.
In addition, the state's multibillion-dollar tourism industry has been shaken by the twin jolts of the riots and a series of earthquakes to the east of Los Angeles.
 
'There's No Recovery'
 "The Southern California economy is dead in the water," said Jack Kyser, the chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles, a privately financed research group. "Out here, there's no recovery, and the unemployment statistics just indicate that we have a lot of work ahead of us, and that it will be 1993 before there is any recovery."
Though the economic problems affect the entire state, they are felt most deeply in Southern California, which accounts for more than half of the state's economic activity.
Nevertheless, E. W. Kelly Jr., who represents veterans' affairs for the State Employment Development Department, said that what he called the "Golden State syndrome" still seemed to be alive, and that he still saw people coming here from other states in search of opportunity.
Standing in the sunshine outside the unemployment office, Mr. Kelly said, "I still run into those individuals walking up and down the streets looking for those Golden Streets of opportunity."
Waiting her turn on a plastic seat inside sat one of these seekers, Florestine Johnson, a 35-year-old insurance saleswoman who had come here a few weeks ago looking for work after losing her job in Washington State.
"With all my skills and qualifications and background, I would hope I would be successful," she said.
And indeed, success seemed to be smiling on her today. On the plastic seat beside her, Doug Knoblauch, an out-of-work financial planner, opened his notebook to suggest job contacts for her in the fields of insurance and banking.
Mr. Knoblauch, 31, said he had been having trouble collecting unemployment benefits because he continued to offer financial planning services on a private basis whenever he could.
But he said, "Brokers make money when money moves, and money isn't moving now." Though he spent $800 last year in professional insurance and licensing fees, he said he earned less than $3,000.
Surveying the slow-moving line from behind an information window, Howard Patton, an employment office official, said he was sure that even today's high figures understate the problem.
"They don't consider all those people who are frustrated and have given up," he said, "those that have resigned themselves to the fact that there is nothing out there and don't even come in here to see us."
Among those who had given up were Riffey Trawick, 28, and his friend James D. Carter, 30, who were going through the bins today outside a Salvation Army office looking for shoes.
Both men moved here from out of state in search of work, and managed fairly well for a while in construction and warehousing work. But as the economy contracted, both men fell off the bottom of the social ladder.
"I just feel like there's nothing else I can do," said Mr. Carter, who had shaved and had recently had a haircut. "I've looked for work and there isn't any. And if there was any, I don't think they'd hire me, not having a place to live and all."
Mr. Trawick said he was ineligible for unemployment benefits because he had always worked off the books for various employers. And now, he said, he believed he and Mr. Carter no longer had any place at all in society.
"I think they'd like to get rid of us, forget about us," he said. "We're an embarrassment."

HEADLINE: Russian Minister Warns of Coup Threat by the Army

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 2

 BODY:
The Russian Foreign Minister has caused a stir in Moscow by his warning this week that Communist and nationalist forces are manipulating the military in an effort to destabilize or overthrow the democratic Government here.
The minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking to Izvestia, warned that pressure for the Russian Army to intervene in support of Russian-speakers living outside Russia's borders, in hotspots like Moldova and South Ossetia, was being orchestrated by politicians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 "The party of war, the party of neo-Bolsheviks, are raising their heads," he said, using their supporters in the military to fan the ethnic flames in Moldova and South Ossetia and then appealing to Russian patriotism to attract support for their undemocratic aims.
"I think the threat of an antidemocratic coup exists," Mr. Kozyrev said, "either through another congress of the Soviet Communist Party or by a reversal on the part of the apparat," the still-powerful state bureaucracy.
 
Turn to the West Criticized
 The essence of Mr. Kozyrev's concerns have been a common topic of conversation here, as Russia's much-ballyhooed economic reforms have slowed while living conditions for the great mass of people have worsened. The conservative opposition to Mr. Yeltsin in Parliament, elected in March 1990 when the Communist Party still held sway, has been searching for sticks with which to beat the President and his chief economic adviser, Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar.
Having failed to elicit much active popular discontent on purely economic grounds, they have been criticizing Mr. Yeltsin's turn to the West, in particular his willingness in Washington to scrap Russia's main nuclear deterrent, the multiple-warhead, land-based SS-18, and his alleged failure to provide support for Russian-speakers and soldiers in Moldova and South Ossetia. The last is a criticism widely voiced by Mr. Yeltsin's own Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi.
Mr. Kozyrev's warnings have been expressed by other politicians, according to Oleg T. Bogomolov, director of the Institute of World Economic and Political Research and a member of Mr. Yeltsin's Presidential Consultative Council. "But when such an official speaks about such a danger, it seems more important," he said in an interview.
It also was a reminder of former Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's warning of a coming right-wing coup when he resigned in December 1990, eight months before last August's effort to overthrow the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Mr. Kozyrev is uncomfortable with that comparison, Mr. Bogomolov said in an interview. But the Foreign Minister repeated his concerns today, in a seminar Mr. Bogomolov attended, saying, "The pro-Communist and nationalist forces are trying to challenge the President's efforts to transform Russia into a democratic state and enable it to join the community of civilized nations on the basis of equality."
 
Right-Wing Reaction Grows
 There is a growing right-wing reaction, Mr. Bogomolov said, which largely and unsurprisingly stems from national humiliation and economic distress. "Many people, including many democrats, think Mr. Gaidar's economic policy has failed and only aggravated conditions in the country," he said.
With a difficult economic situation and the violent conflicts on Russia's periphery, "of course many people demand some action."
Mr. Bogomolov said he did not think the conservative forces were powerful enough to accomplish their aims, "but when the conservatives promise order and a strict fight against corruption they gain some support."
He said that a new military coup was much less likely than a continuing effort to place more conservative politicians within the existing government structure. "The new people would determine the policy, which would become quite different," he said.
 
Where the Danger Lies
 Mr. Kozyrev is not alone in his fear of "these red-brown forces," Russian shorthand for the alliance of convenience between former Communists, the reds, and Russian ultranationalists, who are regarded by democrats here as fascist, and hence brown, as in Hitler's Brownshirts.
Sergei Shakrai, until recently a Yeltsin adviser, himself warned today that there would be a move to oust Mr. Yeltsin by Communists and the leaders of the powerful state military-industrial complex, which is threatened by economic restructuring and reform.
Speaking to the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta a few days before the Constitutional Court hears a case challenging the legality of Mr. Yeltsin's ban on the Communist Party, Mr. Shakrai said there could be an effort to impeach Mr. Yeltsin on some pseudo-constitutional pretext. The Communists are discredited and cannot regain power on their own, he said, but democrats have failed to consolidate authority. The real danger this year, he said, comes from industrial leaders in combination with forces in the military.
Some of these responses simply reflect the Russian love of conspiracy, rampant in a country where real power never operated in the open and democracy has tenuous historical roots.
But there has also been concern over Mr. Yeltsin's efforts to co-opt hard-liners in the military when the defense budget is being cut, Russian soldiers are being withdrawn from the territory of old conquests, and ethnic struggles are threatening to envelop soldiers still stationed where they were when the Soviet empire died.
Some democrats fear that Mr. Yeltsin is repeating the mistake of Mr. Gorbachev before last August's coup: relying too much on alliances with conservative forces whose aim is not to support him but to replace him.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
President Vetoes the 'Motor-Voter' Measure

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
As expected, President Bush today vetoed the "motor-voter" bill, which would have required all the states to allow voter registration when citizens apply for driver's licenses or government benefits.
The President's veto message said the bill would have imposed needless, costly and constitutionally questionable Federal regulation on the states and would also have exposed "the election process to an unacceptable risk of fraud and corruption without any reason to believe that it would increase electoral participation to any significant degree." 
 The bill, which both the Senate and the House had passed by majorities that were less than veto-proof, would almost certainly have helped Democrats by adding to the voter rolls large numbers of welfare clients, the working poor and the disabled.
Beginning in 1994, it would have required all the states to allow citizens to register to vote when they apply for, renew or change the address on their driver's licenses. Some states already allow voters to register that way. It would also have allowed voters to register by mail and would have required that registration forms be available at welfare, unemployment and other social service offices.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, the Kentucky Democrat who was the measure's primary author, said he would lead an effort to override the veto.

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea Arranged In Israel Kickback Case

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
A New Jersey businessman has agreed to plead guilty to two Federal fraud charges in a complex case that Congressional investigators say links the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation to a kickback scandal involving the sale of jet engines to Israel.
Pratt & Whitney is the second big military contractor to become entangled in the case. The General Electric Company was briefly suspended by the Pentagon last month from receiving new jet-engine contracts because of its involvement. G.E. is now negotiating a settlement of civil and possible criminal charges with the Justice Department. 
 Congressional investigators previously said they were studying whether Pratt & Whitney had agreed to pay kickbacks in return for contracts from the Israeli Air Force, but no charges have been filed against the company. Calls to Pratt & Whitney and to United Technologies in Hartford went unanswered last night.
 
2 Companies Detailed
 In documents filed in United States District Court in New York, Federal prosecutors said they could prove that the businessman, Benjamin Sonnenschein, operated two companies under the direction of an Israeli citizen, Yoram Ingbir. The documents said the companies received contracts for computer software work from Pratt & Whitney.
Staff members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on investigations said they had evidence that Pratt & Whitney was directed to award the contracts to Mr. Sonnenschein's companies by Gen. Rami Dotan of the Israeli Air Force. General Dotan, the central figure in the case, pleaded guilty last year in Israel to extorting money from military contractors in the United States, and is serving a 13-year prison sentence.
In a civil case against General Electric that is being prosecuted by the Justice Department, Mr. Ingbir is identified as a conduit for kickbacks directed by G.E. to the control of General Dotan.
The documents filed in Mr. Sonnenschein's case said that he funneled to Mr. Ingbir more than $500,000 of proceeds from the Pratt & Whitney contracts from 1988 through 1990, largely through small deposits to bank accounts in the United States and in at least one case through a deposit to a Swiss bank.
The documents do not say what Mr. Ingbir did with the money. Mr. Ingbir has not been charged with any wrongdoing in the United States or in Israel.
The investigators for the House subcommittee said Mr. Sonnen schein's companies had received at least $5.3 million in contracts from Pratt & Whitney at General Dotan's direction. The actual value of the work done by the companies was far less, the investigators said, and involved expenses of only about $500,000.
Mr. Sonnenschein was described in the court documents as a relative of Mr. Ingbir who had been unemployed at the time Mr. Ingbir asked him to manage the two companies, the Yrret Company and Air Tech Inc., both of Fair Lawn, N.J.
Mr. Sonnenschein agreed to plead guilty to one count of transporting $50,000 in cash to Switzerland without reporting it to the Federal Government, as required by law, and to one count of failing to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service $261,000 under his control in a Swiss bank.
Mr. Sonnenschein agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, the plea agreement said. Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of probation, plus a $50,000 fine and forfeiture of $2.8 million under Mr. Sonnen schein's control.

HEADLINE: Interest-Rate Payoff on California I.O.U.'s

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The inability of California to pay all its bills in cash is a black mark against its reputation in financial markets, but there is a silver lining for people and businesses who are issued i.o.u.'s instead of cash.
If the recipients of the i.o.u.'s hold the check-like pieces of paper, the state has promised to pay a 5 percent interest rate, which is much higher than the annual rate they could earn on a short-term bank deposit. If the i.o.u.'s are deposited or cashed at a bank, the bank will receive the 5 percent rate. 
 The 5 percent rate is well above average rates for money market accounts of 3.40 percent for large banks in Los Angeles and 3.30 percent in San Francisco. According to Bank Rate Monitor of North Palm Beach, Fla., investors would have to tie up their money in a bank certificate of deposit with a term of more than two years if they wanted to match the 5 percent rate being offered by the state.
Robert Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, notes that the interest rate offered by the state is likely to become even more attractive in coming days as banks reduce rates on deposits in response to the Federal Reserve's move yesterday to ease monetary policy and cut short- term interest rates.
The 5 percent interest rate was set by California officials in the Pooled Money Investment Board, which handles investments of excess cash by state agencies. After talking with local bankers, the state agreed to pay the maximum 5 percent rate allowed by law.
"We asked for the maximum interest rate to compensate for the expenses of handling the paper and customer inquiries," said Gregory Wilhelm, director of government relations for the California Bankers Association. So far, the state has issued only about 20,000 of the i.o.u.'s, although it expects to issue about 800,000 if its cash shortage continues through July.
Gray Davis, the State Controller, said interest paid to banks and corporations would be subject to state tax. For individuals, he said, the state had not yet determined if the interest was subject to tax or was tax-exempt, like the interest on bonds issued by the state.
Not all the state's bills are being paid with i.o.u.'s. Payments to local school districts and bond investors, which are required by the state Constitution, are still being made in cash.

HEADLINE: A Summer of Discontent

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
Today's bad economic news underscores a serious split on President Bush's staff over whether he should appear optimistic or more sober about the state of the economy at this critical point in election year politics.
Some important advisers like Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff; Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady argue that as a rule the President should talk favorably about economic prospects to build public confidence as the election approaches. 
 But others, particularly Vice President Dan Quayle and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, maintain that the President should not seem optimistic lest voters see him as unsympathetic and out of touch with their economic troubles.
The dispute, which had been building for weeks and reflects a fundamental difference in expectations for the economy, first surfaced on June 22 at a senior staff meeting, according to people who were there. Mr. Boskin noted that on a political swing to California the previous weekend Mr. Bush had referred at almost every stop to the poor economic conditions in the state. Mr. Boskin reportedly said he was pleased by what he saw as a new tone of realism from the President.
 
'Wait a Minute!'
 A staff assistant at the meeting described what followed: "Skinner jumped in and said something like: 'Wait a minute! Everyone here knows the economy is doing well.' Then Boskin blew his cork and said that was nonsense and economically crazy and politically dangerous. It was all over in a minute or two, but I'm sure that's not the last we'll hear of it."
The President was not at the meeting.
The shouting match between Mr. Boskin and Mr. Skinner was described by people on Mr. Boskin's side, and their goal may have been to win Mr. Bush's support on a matter of substance as well as tone.
Since last year, Mr. Boskin, Mr. Quayle and their supporters have advocated pressing Congress hard for what President Bush calls his "growth package" -- primarily tax breaks to increase investment and stimulate construction and real estate.
But Mr. Skinner, Mr. Brady and others believe the President would lose such a fight with the Democratic Congress and should not risk a confrontation.
The dispute also reflected a fundamental disagreement on the actual state of the economy. Mr. Boskin is said to believe that new economic data, including the grim employment statistics released today, are so bleak that the President will look remote and uninformed if he is upbeat in his public statements.
Mr. Skinner and Mr. Brady seem to feel that economic conditions are more favorable. In a statement today, Mr. Brady emphasized that "the fundamentals remain in place for steady growth and low inflation."
Mr. Bush himself took a middle course today in his news conference on Capitol Hill. "The economy is still growing," he said at first, noting that employment data are what economists call a "lagging indicator," meaning they begin to improve after the overall economy has turned around.
But Mr. Bush quickly added: "I've always said unemployment for one person, that's 100 percent, and that's too much. And so, we've got to keep moving till we get it back the way I'd like to see it in terms of economic growth."
 
The Heat of the Summer
 If the economic recovery is flattening out again, as it did last summer, it could hardly have happened at a worse time for the President. History shows that the condition of the economy is one of the most important factors in whether a President wins re-election and that the summer of election years is when voters frame their views about the economy.
Prof. Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa whose specialty is election forecasting, has calculated that all five times since World War II when the unemployment rate was falling in the second quarter of the election year, the incumbent's party won the Presidency: 1948, 1964, 1972, 1984 and 1988.
On the other hand, the unemployment rate was rising, as it was this year, or flat during the April-through-June quarter in six election years, and the incumbent party lost five of those elections, in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1976 and 1980. The only exception was in 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was re-elected.
President Bush has said publicly and, according to his staff, privately that he did not expect voters to begin focusing intently on the election until the fall. But some of his chief advisers are not sure he is right.
"We could be at a turning point right now," a member of the campaign staff said. "I hope I'm wrong, but I think people are really beginning to pay attention."
Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was President Jimmy Carter's chief domestic policy adviser, said he learned first-hand in 1980 the consequences of a sour economy four or five months before the election.
"Voters lock into the economy, not on Election Day but the summer before," Mr. Eizenstat said. "And unless something really dramatic happens, unless there's a really big change in circumstances, their perceptions don't change."
Don Sipple, a Republican political consultant, called today's employment data "very bad news for Bush and the Republicans."
"Right now, the American people are focused on economic issues," Mr. Sipple said. "Mr. Bush suggests that the economy is making a comeback, but events in the real world defy that."
 
Wrong Time to Fish?
 Mr. Sipple said he was worried that Mr. Bush's plans for the next month could send a signal that he is unconcerned about the economy. The President leaves next week for the economic summit meeting in Munich. Then he plans to take a vacation at his summer home in Maine and to go fishing in Wyoming with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Polls show that Mr. Bush's popularity rating first began to plunge not when the economy actually entered the recession in the summer of 1990 but in the summer and fall of 1991, when the recovery had clearly ground to a halt, and Mr. Bush seemed rather blase about it.
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll last month showed that only 34 percent of adults approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job, and that only 16 percent liked how he was dealing with the economy.
The dispute on the White House staff about the tone the President should adopt on the economy began building about six weeks ago. In the first three months of this year, the economy grew by 2.7 percent, meager by historical standards in the aftermath of a recession but still the strongest quarter in three years. Based on their public statements, Administration officials clearly felt they were out of the woods in terms of the economy.
But toward the end of May, economic conditions began to turn, much as they did last summer, and June was clearly worse than May. Statistics released in June about the housing market, retail sales and manufacturing were unfavorable. The trade balance took a bad swing, and the growth in the money supply was sluggish.
At staff meetings, officials said, Mr. Boskin began cautioning that the recovery might be lagging and said he was getting pessimistic reports from the business executives he sees regularly, but he met resistance from Mr. Skinner and others.
As a political matter, the President's advisers are especially concerned about the situation in California and New York, the states with the most electorial votes and among those with the weakest economies. Mr. Bush's recognition of the conditions in California on his trip there last month may have been an indication that Mr. Boskin has his ear, or it may have been the result of cautions from his political advisers.
Mr. Skinner was traveling today and could not be reached. Mr. Boskin said, "Whatever differences may occasionally occur, Sam Skinner has done a good job of making sure we all have an opportunity to convey our opinions directly to the President."

HEADLINE: House Passes Aid Plan for Inner Cities

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
House Republicans and Democrats today overwhelmingly approved a $5 billion urban aid package intended to help a limited number of depressed city neighborhoods attract new businesses, health clinics, job training and enhanced law enforcement.
Few legislators claim that the program will reverse the decline of the inner cities, where the flight of manufacturing industries, drug addiction and violent crime have accelerated in recent years. 
 But several Democrats from big cities said they hoped that after a decade of Federal neglect, the legislation signified a resurgence in Government efforts to address the social problems that touched off the riots in Los Angeles two months ago.
The package emerged from the realization by leaders of both parties that Ross Perot's independent Presidential candidacy was benefiting from a widespread perception that they were so busy playing politics they could no longer run the country.
"We will demonstrate to our constituents and ourselves that we can legislate and govern," Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, said, suggesting the self-doubt and frustration felt by many House members during a legislative session marked by scandal and inaction.
 
House Represented Hurdle
 Attached to a $14.5 billion tax bill, the program passed 356 to 55, as 198 Democrats were joined by 158 Republicans. The House, which is more representative of rural interests, was considered a higher hurdle for the bill than the Senate, which is expected to approve the bill in the coming weeks.
The package is essentially a pilot program merging Republican and Democratic strategies to alleviate crime and poverty. While President Bush won a limited capital gains tax cut to fuel investment in inner cities, Democrats won his support for modest expansions in Head Start and remedial educational programs, drug treatment centers for teenagers and pregnant women, child care and modernization of public housing.
"I feel great," Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, the Administration's strongest supporter of urban aid, said after the vote. "This is the first time the Democratic Congress has realized that cutting the capital gains tax is an incentive for investment."
 
HUD to Identify Zones
 Twenty-five urban zones will receive 80 percent of the benefits. They will be designated in the coming months by the Department of Housing and Urban Development from neighborhoods with unemployment rates 1.5 times the national average with at least 20 percent of their residents living below the poverty level.
Investors willing to put their money in the zones will get a number of tax benefits, including a 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax if they hold their interests for a minimum of five years. The idea is that new business investments will take root alongside Government anti-drug and anti-gang programs. In theory, new businesses and safer streets will anchor stronger families, improve productivity and create greater opportunities for minority teen-agers to rise into the middle class.
Since corporations are not eligible for the benefit, the tax changes are not likely to increase manufacturing or heavy industry in the zones. Businesses that are likely to benefit are small private retailers and service companies.
The tax breaks are expected to cost the Treasury $2.5 billion over six years.
 
Selling the Package
 To garner the votes of rural lawmakers, 25 more enterprise zones will be selected in impoverished farming areas, and they will receive about 20 percent, or $1 billion, of the tax and program benefits.
"Anyone who calls this 'urban aid' can't read," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, who voted for the bill. "It may not mean anything for New York, except maybe we can turn the Federal Government around to go beyond 'just say no' to give people a reason to live. This is only a beginning."
The centerpiece of the program is the urban enterprise zones, which have long been pushed by Mr. Rangel, Mr. Kemp and aggressive conservative Republican lawmakers. Following the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Bush picked up the banner, and the Democrats reluctantly followed on the condition that he support social programs.
Critics charge that the urban enterprise zones will do little more than transfer businesses from one neighborhood to another, but conservatives, joined by big-city mayors and finally the Democratic Congressional leadership, convinced enough members that the idea deserved a chance in the form of a pilot experiment.
 
Capital Gains Compromise
 The Administration wanted a total exemption on capital gains for investors in the zones as long as the investments were held for two years, but the Democrats refused to go along with more than the 50 percent exemption.
The enterprise zones will also receive $500 million in annual aid over five years in a combination of projects jointly called "Weed and Seed." As conceptualized by the Administration, SWAT teams and other specially trained law enforcement officers will "weed" gangs and drug dealers out of the zones. Then "seeds," like expanded Head Start and drug rehabilitation centers, can take hold.
The Administration originally wanted to put a lion's share of the funds for Weed and Seed into policing. But the Democrats, led by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, would only go along with the package as long as 80 percent of the funding went into social programs.
Negotiations almost broke down several times in the last two weeks. In the hours leading up to the vote, Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Tax Policy, attempted to apply the capital gains tax provisions to the sale of land. Mr. Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, threatened to nix the compromise.
Nicholas E. Calio, Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, intervened and convinced the Treasury Department to drop its demand.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
For This 4th, They're Putting Out Fewer Flags

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Patriotism in advertising has not died, but it certainly has faded away.
A year ago, marketers inundated America with ad campaigns that had patriotic themes, trying to exploit the national mood of celebration over the Persian Gulf war. 
 The star-spangled fever extended beyond advertisers, like Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and Anheuser-Busch, that usually weave red, white and blue motifs into their sales messages. Even Allied Fibers, Seagram's 7 Crown whisky and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America filled the summer of 1991 with a frenzy of flags and fireworks.
Now, though, that flood of patriotic hoopla and hyperbole has dwindled to a trickle, leaving the Fourth of July celebration this weekend largely devoid of corporate jingoism.
Notable exceptions, though, include Kmart, which is sponsoring a promotion to raise funds for a Star-Spangled Banner Monument in Washington, and Kraft General Foods, which is selling a new flavor of Sealtest ice cream called American Glory.
"The fervor went away in a hurry," said Susan Spaulding, vice president of research at Market Directions , a research concern in Kansas City, Mo., that has surveyed consumers on their attitudes toward advertising that uses patriotic symbols.
A primary reason why patriotism is being played down is a radical change in public attitudes that must rank among the most severe mood swings ever. The cheering over the Persian Gulf war has dissipated, replaced by recriminations over what the conflict actually accomplished. That attitude was cunningly summarized in a Democratic campaign slogan: "Saddam Hussein still has his job. Do you?"
"It's hard to be patriotic in the middle of a recession," said Bill Oberlander, a partner and creative director at Kirshenbaum & Bond in New York. Last year, for its client Moet & Chandon champagne, the agency ran ads pegged to the parade in New York City saluting the Gulf War veterans.
"For that one instant, there was a reason to celebrate," Mr. Oberlander added, "and we woke up with a hangover."
Advertising, he asserted, "is a reflection of society," so that if consumers are in a mood to wave flags, advertisers and their agencies will clamber aboard the flag-bedecked bandwagon. If they are not, if "there's nothing to be patriotic about," he said, ads will turn to alternative themes.
Earl Cavanah, executive vice president and group creative director at Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, expressed a similar belief.
"Somebody once asked, 'How does advertising stay fresh?' " he said. "Well, what's nice is, what happens around you changes. All you have to do is keep up with it."
Last July, Mr. Cavanah was among Scali executives who created a television commercial for Allied Fibers, in which a bright-red Anso "crush resistant" carpet was walked upon by the estimated 24,000 participants in the welcome home parade, then vacuumed back to shape by a lone cleaning woman.
Now, by contrast, "the mood is introspective," he said, "not flag-waving.
"It's looking inward to see what we can do to improve our country," he said.
Last summer was "Yellow Ribbon Summer" for the Anheuser-Busch Companies, which sponsored promotions like free admittance for members of the armed forces and their families to the company's theme parks, Busch Gardens and Sea World.
"Clearly, it's a different summer from last summer, when the troops were coming back," said Tom Sharbaugh, vice president for the Budweiser brands at Anheuser-Busch.
This summer's Budweiser ads, by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in St. Louis, will present patriotic themes in a different context, he added, by supporting the United States Olympic team, of which Budweiser is a sponsor.
One of the few advertisers now running an out-and-out patriotic campaign, the Kmart Corporation, traced that decision to the national mood last year.
"We obviously thought there'd be a lot more patriotic 'oomph' as we planned this nine months ago," said Mike Wellman, vice president of marketing, referring to his "Show Your Colors" monument promotion. "It's surprising."
The couple of hundred thousand dollars to be collected by Kmart's fund-raiser, which began May 24 and continues through Saturday, will be "lower than what we anticipated," he added, though "we're reasonably pleased with the results." The retailer is considering further promotions next year pegged to the monument, which will honor Francis Scott Key.
Ms. Spaulding, the research executive, said: "Putting a flag in an ad is very nice, but it doesn't enhance a company if it's just a symbol without relevance or benefit to the consumer."
Three cheers for the red, white and relevant?

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Jumps to 7.8%, Raising Doubts on Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
In a stunningly grim set of figures that challenged assumptions of continued economic recovery, the Labor Department reported today that the nation's jobless rate spurted another three-tenths of a point in June, to 7.8 percent, while payroll jobs slumped by 117,000.
Apart from suggesting that seasonal adjustment factors may have unduly magnified some losses, analysts found almost no comfort in data that included a shorter workweek, lengthening spells of unemployment, more layoffs and a swelling in the ranks of the jobless by 470,000, to a total of just under 10 million. 
 Among the 11 big industrial states, California's jobless rate, which rose to 9.5 percent last month from 8.7 percent in May, was the highest. New York had the biggest increase, up 1.3 percentage points, to 9.2 percent, while New Jersey's rate also hit 9.2 percent, up two-tenths of a point. The rate fell to 7.6 percent from 7.8 percent in Pennsylvania, the only industrial state to show a drop.
 
'Bummer' and 'Terrible'
 Economists used terms like "bummer," "terrible" and "Black Thursday" to comment on the report, which contrasted sharply with expectations for a downtick in the jobless rate and an increase of nearly 100,000 in payroll jobs.
The weak employment picture prompted many economists to review -- and in some cases notch down -- their forecasts. C. J. Lawrence, the brokerage house, for example, raised its estimate of the chances for a new dip in the economy to 1-in- 2 from 1-in-4.
Democrats took the occasion to attack the Bush Administration.
"Either the President must change his economic policy, or we must change Presidents," said Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
As the Federal Reserve moved almost immediately to ease monetary policy, cutting the discount rate a half point, to 3 percent, the White House did not seek to cast today's figures in a rosy light. Michael J. Boskin, the chief White House economic adviser, said he was "very concerned" about the increase.
By region, the Northeast posted the biggest increase, five-tenths of a point and now suffers the highest unemployment rate, 8.5 percent.
In a separate report on labor markets, the Labor Department found that first-time claims for jobless benefits totaled 420,000 in the week ended June 20. This was widely seen as confirming the sizable increase of the week of June 13 and was thus seen as a negative, despite 1,000 fewer claims.
The Commerce Department said in a separate report that orders to the nation's factories declined eight-tenths of 1 percent in May, the first decline in five months but a not unexpected development in light of a 2.4 percent drop in orders for durable goods reported last week.
More than half the rise in June joblessness occurred among teen-agers, whose unemployment rate jumped 3.6 percentage points, to 23.6 percent, as students and new graduates flocked into the job market but met with little success.
William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, cautioned that this annual influx can lead to gyrations in the statistics since seasonal adjustments may not fully capture current reality.
In fact, total employment as gauged by the Government's survey of households rose by nearly 1.4 million before seasonal adjustment, compared with an 82,000 decline after applying the adjustment factor. The survey of business payrolls showed a similar pattern last month -- up 457,000 before adjustment but down 117,000, to a total of about 108.4 million, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
"I don't put a great deal of credence in the employment report," said Kathryn Eickhoff, a New York consultant and former chief economist in the Reagan era for the Office of Management and Budget. "I would not jump to the conclusion that the economy's weakening."
But while others expressed sympathy for this view, most economists seemed quite disturbed by the June job report.
"It raises questions about whether there is any recovery under way at all," said Norman Robertson of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "There really was not a bright spot."
 
More Workers for Fewer Jobs
 The rising jobless rate, which hit another eight-year high, reflected continued sharp growth in the labor force, which expanded by 389,000 people last month at the same time that total jobs shrank by 82,000. Practically all of the labor-force increase was among adult women.
While teen-agers accounted for much of the rise in joblessness, the ranks of laid-off workers expanded by 169,000 and there were similar increases in the number of newly unemployed -- out of work less than five weeks -- and in the hard-core jobless who have been without work for more than six months.
The jobless rate for white teen-agers jumped nearly four points, to 20.6 percent, while the rate for black teen-agers fell modestly to 41.6 percent, with females doing much better while males did worse. The rate for black teen-age males climbed to 50.3 percent on a nonadjusted basis, up from 41.9 percent in June 1991.
Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group, said today that more than 17 million Americans were either unemployed or underemployed last month for a "real" jobless rate of 13.4 percent over all and about 40 percent for teen-agers.
The Labor Department's quarterly tabulation of discouraged workers -- those who have stopped looking for a job because they think they would fail to find one -- was almost unchanged again last month at 1.1 million.
The payroll survey showed particular weakness in manufacturing, which lost 58,000 jobs last month, and construction, which shed 32,000 after seasonal adjustment even though actual jobs grew by 128,000. Jobs in wholesale trade dropped 16,000 and health services expanded by just 7,000, far below the gains that have prevailed for years.
The index of aggregate hours slumped back to the 120.7 level that prevailed in April, today's report showed, while only 43 percent of industries added workers in June compared with 50.4 percent in May.
"The June employment figures show that the recovery is rockier than the Rocky Mountains," said John M. Albertine, a Washington consultant. "The economy simply cannot provide enough jobs for all the Americans who want them."

HEADLINE: Glut of Office Space In New York Market Lessens Relocations

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A glut of Manhattan office space has produced an unexpected side effect: Declining rents have slowed the pace of business relocations to the suburbs, the Sun Belt and other cities.
The glut has become so severe, in fact, that for the first time New York City's midtown business district was surpassed this year by Washington as the nation's most costly place to rent office space. 
 And while Manhattan developers, lenders and landlords are tallying the huge costs of a building binge that went bust, some experts maintain that the office surplus and falling rents have shored up New York's stature as a global center of corporate activity.
Yesterday, in the latest corporate commitment to Manhattan, Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, said it had signed a 15-year lease on 15 floors at Americas Tower, a vacant new office tower at 45th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. It will transfer 1,800 employees to the building from other locations in Manhattan in July 1993.
"New York City now has to be considered the best option available," said James J. Schiro, Price Waterhouse's vice chairman. Although he declined to say how much rent the firm will pay for its new offices, he said it had considered several other alternatives, including suburban sites, but had been swayed by huge amount of space available and declining prices in Manhattan.
Other executives said they expected similar deals.
"This recession is a disaster for real estate, but it is helping Manhattan retain tenants," said Michael Solomon, director of the New York office of Julien J. Studley, a real-estate brokerage. "The deals are so sweet they can't be refused."
Data compiled by Cushman & Wakefield, a real-estate concern, showed that asking prices for rents fell by an average of 10 percent since 1988 in the two principal Manhattan business districts, midtown and lower Manhattan.
The company says that the average asking rent in midtown was $37.56 a square foot in the first three months of 1992, before discounts. And many landlords are offering rich incentives to new tenants by covering the costs of renovations -- savings that sometimes amount to millions of dollars.
To be sure, business executives continue to grumble about taxes, labor costs, crime, noise, and a host of other Manhattan complaints, and companies continue to flee.
Recent departures include W. R. Grace, which moved last year with 500 employees from midtown Manhattan to Boca Raton, Fla., and the American Home Products Corporation, which has said it will move from 685 Third Avenue to a new headquarters in Madison, N.J., next year, eliminating 1,000 New York City jobs.
 
A Change of Plans
 But analysts say the business departures from Manhattan have been less frequent over the last three years than in the previous two decades, although no one has kept reliable, long-term records on the actual number of relocations.
One company that has decided to stay in Manhattan is Sterling Winthrop Inc., a pharmaceutical and health-care subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company that employs 1,000 people on Park Avenue. It had purchased a New Jersey golf course in the mid-1980's and planned to make it the site of a new suburban campus-style headquarters.
That plan was scrapped last year. "The market forces were obviously working in our favor," said Robin Mills, a company spokesman. With midtown rents falling, he said, Sterling Winthrop negotiated a lease for more space in its current building, at 90 Park Avenue, and sold the New Jersey site.
The city's economic development officials are gloating over the decision in March by Bertelsmann A.G., the German media conglomerate that owns RCA Records and the Bantam Doubleday Dell publishing house, to purchase a new, vacant 46-story office tower at 1540 Broadway, at 45th Street, in Times Square.
Bertelsmann had been considering moving most of its New York City operations, with 500 employees spread among several midtown buildings, to Chicago. But with the developers of the Times Square building in bankruptcy proceedings, the city offered property tax reductions and Bertelsmann agreed to purchase the tower as its headquarters and set aside several floors as an "incubator" for other foreign companies seeking space in Manhattan.
 
Opportunity From Bankruptcy
 Because of the recession, the cutbacks in employment at Manhattan companies, and the building boom of the 1980's, office vacancy rates in Manhattan are more bloated than at any time since records started being kept in the 1960's, with 21.9 percent of the space available in midtown and 17.9 percent available in lower Manhattan, real-estate industry studies show. Although the vacancies have fallen slightly this year in lower Manhattan, they have continued to rise in midtown.
At the same time, of course, rents have fallen elsewhere, and corporate planners are finding landlords across the New York region who are eager to negotiate. In Fairfield County, Conn., which has been luring business away from Manhattan for more than 20 years, studies show that asking rents have plummeted 18 percent since 1986.
But executives say many companies, even those casting covetous eyes on the suburbs or other cities, face new hurdles in pulling up their Manhattan roots. One is the depressed market for homes and apartments, which has created new headaches and expenses for companies that must cover part of the losses sustained by employees who are relocated.
Another problem is faced by companies that want to move before the expiration of their leases in Manhattan, which normally run at least 20 years. Although these companies have in the past been able to sublet their vacant offices to other businesses, sometimes at a profit, tenants willing to sublet space have now become a rare breed.
As a result, "it is safe to say there are a number of companies based in Manhattan that would not still be here" if the recession had not converged with falling office rents, said Karen Gerard, vice president of Moran, Stahl & Boyer, a corporate relocation consulting firm.
Fish & Neave, a law firm at 875 Third Avenue, might have left the city if not for the lower rents. For a decade the firm had considered relocating to the suburbs, but in March it signed a 20-year lease in the former Exxon Building at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street. "Office space has just gotten more affordable with time," said Lars Kulleseid, managing partner.
Telerep, an advertising firm on Third Avenue at 52d Street, in January signed a lease for new and larger offices on Second Avenue near 48th Street.
The firm's new rent, $26 a square foot, will be far below the $46 it is now paying, said Patricia Prie, chief financial officer, and the new landlord has promised to pay for $3.6 million in remodeling and construction. "Even the electricians are negotiating their prices," she said.
But Manhattan remains vulnerable to the loss of large, prestigious companies. Several Wall Street brokerage firms, including Kidder Peabody at 10 Hanover Square and Smith Barney, at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, have been rumored for more than a year to be considering suburban sites for new headquarters.
Morgan Stanley, long considered a corporate trend-setter on Wall Street, has acquired an option to buy land in downtown Stamford, Conn., and commissioned architectural drawings of a new headquarters there. If it leaves Manhattan, where the lease on its headquarters at 1251 Avenue of the Americas expires in 1998, the firm said it would take 4,100 employees.
"We are keeping our options open," said Jeanne Andrews, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman.
But at City Hall officials say the depressed real-estate market may now be proving more persuasive than the public incentives, like reduced taxes and energy subsidies, that were offered in the 1980's to persuade companies to stay.
"Renters are getting significant advantages in this market," said Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, "and that is going to benefit the city for years to come."
The industry's data suggest that the glut in part resulted from development incentives during the 1980's in the western part of the midtown area, where several new office towers still have huge amounts of vacant space on the market.

HEADLINE: New York Area Job Data Are Especially Grim

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In an employment picture nationwide that is unremittingly bleak, the scene in the New York region appears gloomier than most.
New York State experienced one of the sharpest jumps in joblessness in the nation last month, undermining hopes for the region's recovery soon. The Government said yesterday that the unemployment rate in New York State jumped to 9.2 percent in June from 7.9 percent in May, with most of the increase coming in New York City. 
 It said the jobless rate in New Jersey also rose to 9.2 percent in June, up from 9 percent in May.
"We are still losing jobs," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Federal Government's Bureau of Labor Statistics. He said New York and New Jersey "are in the same economic boat, and it is taking on a lot of water."
The increases in New York and New Jersey were sharper than in the nation as a whole, where the unemployment rate for June increased to 7.8 percent from 7.3 percent in May. Only California, where unemployment reached 9.5 percent in June, had a higher rate than New York and New Jersey, the Labor Department said.
Economists attributed the higher unemployment rates in New York to job losses in industries that have traditionally been large employers: advertising, accounting, management consulting, construction and retailing.
The effect has been most severe in New York City, where the Government said the unemployment rate jumped to 11.5 percent in May from 10.5 percent in April. Mr. Ehrenhalt said the city has lost 350,000 jobs since the end of 1988, including 45,000 since January. Elsewhere in New York state, he said, 5,000 jobs have been eliminated since January; New Jersey has lost 50,000 jobs this year.
Although economists said they were surprised by the increase, particularly in New York State, they say that the high and persistent rates of unemployment were simply another reminder of the severity of the recession in the New York region.
"It has been something akin to Murphy's Law: Anything that went wrong in this recession happened here," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chemical Bank in New York City. Consolidation and job losses in the banking industry, the streamling of corporate headquarters, and military industry spending cuts have all taken a harsher toll in the New York region than in most of the nation, he said.
Some segments of the regional economy offer prospects for improvement later this year, Mr. Kellner said, including employment on Wall Street, where the securities industry has benefitted from robust profits for more than a year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Jobs Data Push Bonds Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stunning weakness in labor statistics for June and the Federal Reserve Board's equally striking response to the data caused an eruption in the credit markets yesterday. Prices of fixed-income securities rose sharply and interest rates fell.
A drop of 117,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, and a sharp three-tenths of a percentage point rise in the unemployment rate, to 7.8 percent, were the highlights of a report that analysts said contained no rays of hope. 
 Aggregate hours worked fell sharply and hourly earnings fell to a five-year low, strongly suggesting that manufacturing output and incomes fell in June.
"The numbers were horrific," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "The only way to get any momentum in the economy is to do what the Fed did."
The Fed's announcement that it had cut its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 3 percent, came less than an hour after the employment data were released at 8:30 A.M. Eastern time.
The half-point cut in the overnight Federal funds rate, to 3.25 percent, was confirmed later in the morning when the Fed conducted open market operations.
 
23d Cut in Funds Rate
 It was the 23d time since the summer of 1989 that the Fed has cut the funds rate.
But many analysts said they were skeptical that this easing move would be any more effective at reviving the economy than the previous ones have been. They added that in the absence of a more stimulative fiscal policy, the Fed will probably need to lower rates again.
"Unfortunately, I don't think this will help," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America in San Francisco.
"The economy to me does not seem to be restrained by the level of interest rates or by a lack of liquidity," he said. "But my gut says the Fed is not finished easing rates. I think the economy will continue to be a slug, and that the Fed will have to help again."
The avalanche of buy and sell orders that emerged yesterday were telescoped into a few hours of trading, as the market closed at 1 P.M. to start the Fourth of July weekend. There will be no trading today.
The early close prevented market participants from reacting to an extremely weak set of money-supply figures released late yesterday by the Fed.
 
Money Supply Declines
 All three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week that ended on June 22, the Fed said. M-2, the aggregate most closely tracked by the central bank, fell by $10.6 billion, much more than the $2 billion drop many Wall Street economists had predicted.
At the close of trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10411/32 , up just over 1 3/8 points, to yield 7.62 percent, down from 7.74 percent late Wednesday and 7.77 percent on June 26. It is the lowest yield on the Government's benchmark issue since late January.
Among outstanding Treasury notes, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 1043/32 , up 1 1/8 points, to yield 6.91 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 10027/32 , up 15/32 , to yield 4.55 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills plummeted.
 
Short-Term Rates Off
 Three-month bills were offered yesterday at a discount rate of 3.22 percent, down 31 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 28 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.33 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 30 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.55 percent.
The sharp fall in market interest rates prompted corporations to price a total of $875 million worth of debt securities, an unusually large amount for a holiday-shortened session.
Among the issuers was the Fleet Financial Group, which priced $200 million worth of three-year senior notes through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 5 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.652 percent to yield 5.75 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable securities are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The sharp rise in prices of Government securities helped to bolster prices of outstanding corporate and tax-exempt bonds.
Corporate traders said prices of most issues rose by 3/4 of a point to a full point.
Prices of widely quoted municipal bonds were up by a point, market participants said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Jobless Data and Rate Cuts Cause Dollar to Close Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most currencies yesterday after the Government released weak unemployment statistics and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $346.50, up $2.20 an ounce from Wednesday. Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $346.25, up $2.25. 
 After tumbling in morning trading on the economic news and the Fed action, the dollar rebounded somewhat.
 
Surprise in Jobless Data
 The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate surged to 7.8 percent in June, the highest level in more than eight years. "The unemployment data bring into question the progress of the U.S. economy," said Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
The decline surprised economists and spurred the central bank to cut the discount rate -- the rate it charges on loans to member banks -- to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Several hours later, economists said the Fed appeared to lower its target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge one another on overnight loans -- from 3.75 percent to 3.25 percent.
Speculation about the Fed's monetary policy had driven the dollar lower in recent weeks. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, decreasing the need for the United States currency.
 
'Sell on Rumor, Buy on Fact'
 Traders described the dollar's bounce back from its lows Thursday as a classic case of "sell on the rumor, buy on the fact."
Mike Faust, senior currency strategist at MMS International, said the problems that have been plaguing the dollar in recent weeks -- low interest rates and the faltering economy -- are far from resolved. The currency could head lower, he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 124.45 Japanese yen, from 125.43 Wednesday. Later, in London, it rose to 124.60 yen. In New York, a dollar bought 124.40 yen, down from 125.40 yen Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9175, from $1.9111 late Wednesday. In New York, a pound cost $1.9235, up from $1.9055 Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5075 German marks, down from 1.5230; 1.3515 Swiss francs, down from 1.37; 5.072 French francs, down from 5.1245; 1,142.75 Italian lire, down from 1,152.5, and 1.20095 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20245.
In London, gold rose to $346.25 an ounce, from $343.30 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A SALUTE TO THE FOURTH;
Celebrating Columbus And the Age Of Sail

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
AS the tall ship Gazela glided past Penn's Landing in Philadelphia last week, her sails unfurled like a bird in full plumage display, the crowd onshore delivered the ultimate accolade: a thousand-kazoo salute.
The tribute, heartfelt and spontaneous, seemed about right for the Gazela, a hardy old Portuguese barkentine that once hauled codfish between the Grand Banks and Lisbon. Acquired in 1972 by the Philadelphia Ship Preservation Guild and later restored, she offers sail training to interested civilians, young and old, from her home port. It's a democratic mission, and the Philadelphia ship got a democratic salute as she led a flotilla of tall ships up the Delaware River. 
 The Gazela of Philadelphia (her full name) may not be the most beautiful, but at 109 years she will be the oldest of the 31 tall ships and about 250 smaller vessels that gather in New York Harbor this weekend as part of Operation Sail '92, organized in observance of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage to the New World. They will form what John E. Richard, the executive director of Operation Sail, never tires of calling "the largest grouping of tall ships since the age of sail began."
The tall-ship review will be the centerpiece of five days of ship parades, concerts, a street festival and concert at South Street Seaport, and a July 4 fireworks display in New York Harbor. Officials at Op Sail, as the organization is known for short, say they are expecting upward of 15 million spectators, and the Coast Guard says it predicts that 40,000 small craft will crowd into New York Harbor for a closer look at the ships.
The celebrations begin today when 60 smaller vessels, many of them replicas of historic ships, sail down the East River from Long Island Sound to Gravesend Bay from noon to 5 P.M. In the grand Parade of Sail on the Fourth of July, some 250 smaller ships will join the tall ships at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and, in a line stretching for 11 miles, sail up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge (tall ships) or 79th Street (Class B and C
vessels) before returning to berths along the East River and Hudson River, where designated ships will be open for public viewing. Replicas of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, which cannot make the necessary speed for the parade, will lie at anchor off Governor's Island during the parade. As a finale, on Tuesday, 1,700 uniformed tall-ship cadets parade up Broadway from the Battery to City Hall.
The ships of Op Sail's parade will come in all shapes and sizes, from Latvia's 399-foot Sedov down to the 30-foot Viking III, a Sea Explorers ship from Norwalk, Conn. Officially, vessels are divided into Class A, the tall ships (more than 160 feet long), Class B (100 to 160 feet) and Class C (less than 100 feet), although several smaller protocol ships, like Britain's Lord Trenchard, a mere minnow at 54 feet 6 inches, will sail with the Class A fleet.
With a bow to Columbus, the nucleus of the grand fleet started out from Genoa, Italy, and Lisbon in early April and headed to Cadiz, Spain, to pick up more ships. After racing to the Canary Islands, Columbus's last landfall before setting out westward across the Atlantic, the fleet started the second racing leg of the journey, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The first ship to arrive in New York was Norway's Christian Radich, a comely 240-foot training vessel for Norway's merchant marine, with a crew that includes 36 female and 42 male cadets. The last and, because of prevailing winds, the most difficult part of the race will take place when the ships leave Boston for Liverpool, England, on July 11.
 
Training Ships
 Nearly all the ships, like the Radich (pronounced RAH-dik), serve as training vessels for merchant marines and navies around the world. The Eagle, originally built for the German Navy in 1936, now sails out of New London, Conn., where she serves as the training vessel of the Coast Guard Academy. The military purpose translated into an impressive fashion statement. The cadets look sharp in mainsail white. They also put on a good show when approached by other tall ships, lining up along the railing and giving a crisp salute and a blast of the ship's cannon. Some crews shout out ritual cheers or songs.
The Gazela is a little different. Staffed by volunteers, the Philadelphia ship offers summer training courses to whomever signs up, or in some cases, wanders by. The uniform, such as it is, is modified camp counselor: khaki shorts, a blue or yellow knit shirt with the ship's name, and Topsiders or tennis shoes. On their belts, crew members carry knives in leather sheaths and steel spikes, the all-purpose tools for tightening and loosening knots. But the seafaring philosophy and shipboard discipline is pretty much the same as on the more grandiose vessels.
"They're here for the romance, but it's hard work," said Steve Morgandale, the Gazela's boatswain, scanning the deck as the crew prepared to leave the dock. "Also, it's like an industrial scenario. You can hurt yourself really easily." Mr. Morgandale, an aircraft mechanic who has been a Gazela volunteer for six years, casually noted the prime hazards, such as getting your fingers caught in a line, or falling from the yards and masts.
A quick look upward bore him out. As the Gazela prepared to set sail, or rather, start up her engines -- the wind was calm and the Delaware River is in any case too narrow to allow her to tack -- crew members scrambled up the rigging and sidled out to the end of the yards, supported by a single, very delicate-looking strand known as a foot rope. The distance from the top of the main mast to the deck is 94 feet.
"In winter it can be tricky, because the foredeck shrouds freeze your hands, and you can't wear gloves," said Cynthia Rugart, a crew member, referring to the iron lines that stabilize the mast. "Also, when the sail billows, it can blow you right off the foot ropes."
Ms. Rugart, a student nurse, also mentioned the difficulty of climbing past the foretop, a wooden platform about halfway up the mast. To negotiate the obstacle, crew members must climb with their backs at a 45-degree angle to the deck below.
In addition to the physical work, crew members must master the hundred and one routines required to operate and maintain the ship, as well as a substantial, arcane vocabulary. "Every line and sail has a name and a function," Mr. Morgandale said. "If I say tend the course sheet and you don't know what it is, you're in trouble and you're unusable."
With a normal complement of 35, crew members work through a rotation of five jobs on a standard four-hour watch. All of them eventually get a turn at the wheel, which is more a matter of symbolism than actual power. The striking, painfully obvious fact that strikes every landlubber who boards a tall ship is this: the helmsman cannot see to steer the ship. Yes, there is a compass, right in front of the wheel. But a compass cannot indicate that an iceberg lies dead ahead. Instead, ships rely on three pairs of eyes. Two crew members stand lookout at the bow of the ship, scanning the water for ships, markers, enemy submarines, whatever. A runner delivers breaking news to the deck officer standing aft near the helmsman. In most cases, the officer already knows what the runner is telling him, since he paces incessantly back and forth, leaning over the side and scanning the horizon.
 
Aura of Mark Twain
 On the Gazela, the stand-in for the deck officer was Charles Futcher, a Delaware River pilot who normally guides tankers and container ships up the river. Anyone who has read "Life on the Mississippi" has a pretty good idea of the job description, and of a pilot's encyclopedic knowledge of tides, currents, shoals and bottom topography. Rivers have not changed since Twain wrote the book, and the pilot still carries with him a certain aura.
Looking sharp in brokerlike attire (button-down shirt, tie and suspenders), Mr. Futcher signaled rudder commands to the helmsman with one hand. A set of headphones and wrap-around microphone kept him in communication with other ships and tugboats, an advance on the whistle signals of Twain's day.
"Today is pretty crazy," Mr. Futcher said. "You don't get small-boat traffic like this normally." Indeed, the river was dotted with pleasure craft that a Coast Guard boat, siren wailing, constantly shooed away from the ships, like a bodyguard protecting a celebrity. "Small boats seem to have a hard time gauging relative motion," Mr. Futcher said. "They place too much faith in their engines."
Mr. Futcher, whose habit of crunching ice cubes as he paced back and forth betrayed a certain level of stress, said of the job, "It's not tense, but it's intense." Mistakes tend to be very, very costly. It's more than a two-aspirin bad day when you run an oil tanker aground. "There's no room in this job for a weak stomach or a tentative personality," he said.
The same might be said of running Operation Sail '92, which seems to have been concocted with three ingredients: a shoestring, a wing and a prayer.
The event originated two years ago as a joint venture between Gran Regata Colon, an international association formed to celebrate the Columbus voyage, and Op Sail, a 30-year-old group that staged tall ship parades for the New York World's Fair in 1964, the Bicentennial in 1976, and the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986.
For the last year and a half, Op Sail has functioned with a full-time staff of one. Not until this spring was a secretary hired for the event.
If, by some miracle, all 280 ships should find their proper places and sail in orderly fashion up the Hudson and back, gale-force sighs of relief will emanate from Op Sail headquarters in the World Trade Center, where a tiny staff of 5 managers has now been fleshed out with between 10 and 20 volunteers. For the last two months the city has also helped out by lending personnel from the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission.
 
New Tack Needed
 "The project has brought out the best and the worst in people," said Mr. Richard, a Connecticut banker who was approached by Op Sail's board three months ago and presented, as he delicately put it, "with a challenge that was fast approaching."
Mr. Richard's company, A.J.T. Inc. of Westport, Conn., specializes in turnaround situations. This was one of them. Op Sail had raised virtually no money, and planning was in disarray. With ships already under sail from Europe, Op Sail had not yet created the 120-page handbooks that provide each of the 280 ship's captains critical information on tides, radio frequencies and parade order -- "basically it's to keep them from running into each other," Mr. Richard said.
A lean, silver-haired man with a flair for understatement, Mr. Richard said that "there was a certain fluidity about who was doing what in the office." There was a positive and a negative aspect to this, apparently. "Everyone had a job," Mr. Richard said, "but nobody else knew what it was."
 
Like Apple Pie
 Operation Sail found that in tight economic times, corporate underwriting was hard to come by. The lead sponsors include Pepsi-Cola and I.B.M., for an event that Mr. Richard projects will cost between $8 million and $10 million. The cost is an estimate because many campanies have provided goods and services rather than money.
Mr. Richard said he was dismayed at the number of companies that could see the event only as a marketing tool, a mind-set reflected in a number of ships that had to be turned away because they had company logos slapped all over their sails and hulls. "As Op Sail sees it, tall ships are like motherhood and apple pie," he said. "You don't mess with them."
If Op Sail seemed, until the last couple of weeks, to be a closely guarded secret, that is because, Mr. Richard said, "we're trying to run a P.R. effort with no bucks. It's not apparent, it's transparent -- it's invisible." On the plus side, a number of individuals and companies have stepped forward to offer assistance with no strings attached.
Most disappointing, Mr. Richard said, has been the eagerness of certain political figures to take credit for the event. "But the political animals will come and go," he said philosophically. "These ships will be around for 100 years."
 
Road to Oblivion
 By rights, they should no longer exist. When Op Sail was founded in 1962 to organize the first gathering of tall ships, "it was a last gathering of the elephants before they became extinct, these square-rigged ships that had carried the world's cargo for 3,000 years," said Peter Stanford, the president of the National Maritime Historical Society.
But a funny thing happened on the road to oblivion. There are now dozens of large sail-training ships around the world, kept alive largely because European countries stubbornly insisted that their merchant sailors and naval personnel needed traditional training in winds and tides aboard a sailing ship.
"That argument wore thin," Mr. Stanford said, "because you don't really need that kind of training to drive a powered vessel." But there was always a hidden agenda behind the ships. They were ideal for building teamwork and discipline.
"The ships are archaic, but maybe that's important, too," he said. "They go the roots of our civilization, and maybe we need to get a little closer to those roots now and then."
The point was made for him as the Gazela headed down the Delaware River to meet a flotilla of tall ships and lead them back to Penn's Landing. As she passed the Polish barkentine Iskra, a line of cadets in white uniforms saluted, shouted the name of their ship four times in unison, and cheered. With an ear-splitting boom, a tiny cannon fired a salute. Nearby, Bulgaria's sleek black Kaliakra and the American brig Niagara prepared to fall in line and head into port.
Throughout the morning, the light flapping of the Gazela's sails was drowned out periodically by passing airliners, the faster descendants of the clipper ships, brigs, barks and cutters that plied the oceans a century and more ago. As the Gazela made her last turn toward the dock, a final passenger jet flew overhead, once more silencing the wind, the waves and the sails -- and the chorus of kazoos. It was the victory of brute strength and commerce over romance and beauty.

Toronto Museum on Hiatus
In these hard economic times, many museums threaten to close; the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto is really doing it -- at least for six months, part of which had been intended for expansion. Tomorrow it will shut until Jan. 24. The museum is also laying off almost half its staff.
"I guess we're just one more on the casualty list," said Glenn Lowry, the museum's director. The Art Gallery of Ontario, considered one of Canada's most important cultural institutions, owns the world's largest collection of Henry Moore sculptures, as well as sizable holdings in European and North American paintings, drawings and sculptures. 
 Like the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which closed for two and a half years for renovation and expansion, the Art Gallery of Ontario was planning to close for three months to finish a three-part expansion begun in the early 1970's. As its financial problems increased, however, so did the amount of time it would be closed. "We really had no choice," Mr. Lowry said. "The layoffs and the closure were necessary in order to cope with the funding announced by the Ministry of Culture and Communications earlier this month."
The cultural minister for Ontario, Karen Haslam, said the blame should go not to the Government, but to the museum for not handling its finances better. "This was a business decision the gallery made on its own," Ms. Haslam said. "In fact, the gallery's operating budget wasn't cut; it was increased by $1 million."
The numbers the museum quotes for its annual budget and those released by Ms. Haslam's office differ, or at least the interpretations of the numbers differ. The museum, which calls itself the A.G.O., said in a statement: "The total of $10.5 million for 1992-1993 is considerably less than the $12.5 million in operating support provided to the A.G.O. by the Ontario Ministry of Culture and Communications in 1990-1991."
Ms. Haslam said the operating budget was $9.5 million this year and $8.5 million last year. She also said the figures released by the museum included a $1 million, one-time grant this year and a $4 million, one-time grant the year before.
Mr. Lowry said: "Since 1981, the ministry has always provided us with additional grant money. They say they are giving us a $1 million increase for our base operating budget, but nobody's buying that story. The reality is that it's a 25 percent cut."
The museum's problems go beyond its daily operating costs. The third part of the expansion cost $58 million, which "is quite separate from the operating budget," Mr. Lowry said. "We have to reinstall 113,000 square feet of gallery space, and we don't have the money to stay open and do that."
The Ministry of Culture is aware of the museum's growing pains, but officials say they are helping as much as they can, given the economic climate. Ms. Haslam's press secretary, Kirsten Kozolanka, said: "Every year, at the end of the year, the gallery has come to us asking for money, and they've gotten it. This year the minister, who has only been here 10 months, finally said no. There won't be any more bailouts."
A source close to the minister's office, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Haslam had little sympathy for what she considered "elitist cultural institutions."
Ms. Haslam responded: "That's totally untrue. We have increased funding to the arts community by $7.5 million at a very tough time."
Meanwhile, the museum sees a bleak future. "How can you run a bigger museum with half the staff?" Mr. Lowry said. "It's impossible. I really don't know what we're going to do."
 
Selling Odds and Ends
 This is the season when the New York auction houses will sell almost anything and call it a collectible. Last Friday, for example, Sotheby's sold a piece of a guitar smashed by Jimi Hendrix at a music festival in Monterey, Calif., circa 1967, for $8,800. This may seem like a hefty sum, but not to Sotheby's, which estimated that the fragment would bring $10,000 to $15,000. The buyer was an unidentified private collector.
Included in the sale were artifacts like the harmonica Bob Dylan used during the summer of 1961, which fetched $3,575, more than the auction house estimate of $2,000 to $3,000, and Buddy Holly's signed junior high school homework, from 1952, which sold for $880, just above Sotheby's high estimate of $800. The entire sale, which included toys, rock-and-roll memorabilia and animation art, totaled $1 million.
The sum is far lower than Sotheby's estimate of $2.8 million to $3.7 million. The reason the sale didn't do better, a spokeswoman at Sotheby's press office said, was that the estimate included a ship that was being auctioned, too: the H.M.S. Bounty from the 1962 movie "Mutiny on the Bounty." The ship, part of Operation Sail '92 in New York Harbor this weekend, was expected to bring between $2 million to $2.5 million, but she sank in the salesroom. Bidding stopped at $1.4 million, and she went unsold.
Joshua Arfer, who heads the collectibles department at Christie's East, said interest in its entertainment memorabilia this summer was "out of control." "When something is iconic, from a big name like Marilyn or Elvis, people go wild," he said.
But while entertainment sells, toys, dolls, and mechanical and cast-iron banks are having a poor season, as the Christie's auction on Monday showed. The entire sale totaled $179,245, far below Christie's presale estimate of $343,245 to $477,270. Both auction houses report that buyers were predominantly private collectors.
At Christie's East, collectors bid on objects including a pair of Killer Bee antennae from the television show "Saturday Night Live," which sold for $605, midway between the auction house's high and low estimates of $700 and $500. There was also a red-and-black nylon "engineering" tunic from the 1960's "Star Trek," which fetched a whopping $1,650, above the auction house's high estimate of $1,500.
But by far the star item of its sale was a black beaded and sequined cocktail dress that Marilyn Monroe wore in the 1959 movie "Some Like It Hot." It was sold to David Gainsborough Roberts, a collector who lives on the British Channel Islands. Mr. Roberts, a collector of film memorabilia for more than 40 years, said he was lending part of his costume collection to the Imperial War Museum in London for an exhibition in February.
"I particularly enjoy buying personal things," Mr. Roberts said. "I've just heard about a car belonging to Dutch Schultz, the 1930's gangster, that's going up for sale in Pebble Beach, Calif., next month. Years ago I tried unsuccessfully to buy Bonnie and Clyde's car. But Schultz's car would be great to put in my garage, too."
 
Sid Deutsch Is Closing
 The Sid Deutsch Gallery at 29 West 57th Street in Manhattan is closing this week after 20 years. The reason is, in part, Mr. Deutsch's health. "Doctor's orders," he said. "But the recession didn't help." The gallery specialized in 20th-century American art. Mr. Deutsch will be dealing privately.

United Nations Tours
United Nations
Visitors' Entrance
First Avenue at 45th Street
Manhattan
(212) 963-7713
Recommended ages: 5 and up
Once you step inside the United Nations headquarters, you enter a stream of foreign voices, languages and faces that makes you feel as if you have landed at Heathrow Airport near London; the feeling, of course, is a thrill for adults and children, who immediately seem to sense the kinetic atmosphere of the place.
The daily tours, for groups of 15 or more, can be tailored for children on request. The tours are packed with 45 minutes of head-swarming details, which few could absorb entirely, but sitting in the cavernous General Assembly chamber can make even the very young feel like worldly sages. 
 The tours leave every 15 minutes or so and are conducted in up to 20 languages, from Hebrew to Portuguese. Our group consisted of 22 people (including two boys wearing ties) who were first told the structure of the United Nations' six main entities (the Security Council, the Secretariat, etc.) and their purposes. We then moved quickly to a first-floor exhibition on disarmament, where maps, charts and display cases reveal the horrors of atomic bombs. In one display, was a melted and broken teacup that had nearly survived the wreckage of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.
We moved on to another, far less visually interesting exhibition: how the United Nations has improved the standard of living of people worldwide through its agencies. On the third floor, we were swept through (and got to sit down in) all the chambers: the Security Council, the Trusteeship Council, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. None of the rooms were in use, making visitors long to hear tempers flare in the General Assembly or to catch a glimpse of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the Security Council. But the assembly meets in the fall, and the council usually meets only when there's a crisis. (There wasn't one when we passed through.)
With or without dramatics, children might appreciate seeing the powder-blue berets of the peace-keeping forces, or the unfinished ceiling in the Economic and Social Council chamber, meant to indicate that the work of the United Nations is never done. Children might also find that some gifts to the United Nations from member countries would be toys worth behaving for: a carved-ivory replica of an old Chinese railway and a miniature royal gilded Thai barge.
At the end, after the two boys on the tour decided that the most impressive aspect was the institution's sheer size, and when questions were quickly dispatched with, our guide left us off in the lower-level lobby, to spend time in the many gift shops, a postal center (selling United Nations stamps) and a coffee shop (open daily from 9 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.). Before you leave, take a stroll along the waterfront (and pass the rose garden), where a tiny body of land, informally called U Thant Island, sits indolently in the churning river.
The tours are $6.50 for adults and $3.50 for children 5 to 14; no one under 5 is permitted. The tours are held from 9 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. daily. Picture-taking is allowed.
 
Strawberry Picking
Various Farms
Recommended for all ages
Though strawberry-picking time arrived at the beginning of June, many farms have berries left and other farms are just beginning their harvest. This year's coldness and damp spring forced some plants to bear fruit later than usual. But one farmer said this has made the strawberries just perfect: fat and fruity, shockingly red. To anyone who wants to pick, most farms will lend a wooden carrier that holds three one-quart containers, which you may usually keep. Then you go out into the field. How long it takes to fill up the containers depends on how fast you want to eat the berries. The best approach, one farmer said, is to "get down on your knees and go."
It would be wise to ask whether the farms use pesticides, and if so when the plants were last sprayed.
Children often end up getting the berries on their clothes, so it's probably best to avoid wearing anything light-colored.
These farms, provided from a list by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, (718) 260-2830, and from the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, (609) 984-2504, offer strawberries to pick (but call ahead): Berry Farm, Route 203, Chatham, N.Y., (518) 392-4609; Story Farm, Route 32, Catskill, N.Y., (518) 678-9716; Alstede Farm, Pleasant Hill Road, Chester, N.J., (908) 879-7189, and Matarazzo Farms, Route 519, Belvedere, N.J., (908) 475-3872. Prices vary, from about $1 a basket to about $3.
 
The Isamu Noguchi
Garden Museum
32-37 Vernon Boulevard
Long Island City, Queens
(718) 721-1932
Recommended for all ages
This small indoor and outdoor museum is a spot so Zenlike in its silence and repose that you can hear the breeze blow. Children respond to the stone sculptures by Isamu Noguchi as if they were rocks to reckon with. Children also like the nontraditional museum environment. "It's as if, too," said Lawre Stone, the museum's administrative director, "children are very comfortable with abstract artwork. They see a whole universe in them."
Visitors are asked to avoid touching the sculptures, but one marble bench in the garden and another seat in the first gallery are indeed meant to be used.
The first floor opens to the ivy-walled garden, giving the indoor area lots of natural light and making both spaces seem contiguous. The galleries on the first floor are mostly filled with amorphous stone sculptures made of granite, basalt and marble; children enjoy responding to the stones' textures, noting how they really seem smooth rather than rough.
The garden is a comfortable place for children. As a breeze ripples the Boston ivy covering the walls, birds fly from corner to corner. One chiseled sculpture, "The Illusion of the Fifth Stone," attracts children because it looks like four laundry bags bunched together; try finding the fifth one. The garden, a former junkyard, now keeps a bamboo, a weeping cherry and a Japanese black pine, among other trees, thriving. A traditional Japanese fountain by Noguchi disperses rather than collects water.
On the second floor are more sculptures and display cases showing bronze playground models Noguchi designed but never built. Children might want to decide whether these curving, pyramidlike playgrounds would be fun to play in. And they shouldn't pass by the "Ding-Dong Bat" sculpture. A continuing video, narrated by Noguchi, who died in 1988 at the age of 84, shows the sculptor at work. He talks about the virtues of mistakes, which he says force you beyond your imagination to something new, a message young visitors could probably appreciate.
The garden is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., from April through November. The admission is $4 and $2 for children; strollers are permitted. There are no refreshment stands. The N train, stopping at Broadway, is about a 15-minute walk away; just head west on Broadway to Vernon Boulevard, turn left on Vernon (Socrates Sculpture Park is directly across the boulevard), and left again on 33d Road. A shuttle bus also operates on Saturdays, picking visitors up at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, in Manhattan, and dropping them off at the Noguchi museum once an hour from 11:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. The round-trip fare is $5 a person.
 
Socrates Sculpture Park
Broadway at Vernon Boulevard
Long Island City, Queens
(718) 956-1819
Recommended for all ages
While the Noguchi museum down the street is steeped in the East, Socrates is like the Wild West. Its scrappy, weedy ambiance, with behemoth sculptures parked all over, give it the trappings of a frontier. But it's a welcoming place, right on the edge of the East River, where a windmill-chiming sculpture rings lightly.
The few benches are scattered; if you want to sit, take a blanket or beach chairs. And should your children feel the need to run, scream or touch sculptures after visiting the Noguchi museum, this is the place to go. One sculpture, by Emilio Cruz, is a blue hulk of a car hanging in midair; in a far corner is a brightly colored Keith Haring.
A "sound observatory" lets visitors play music by patting steel drums. You can also sing into a parabolic dish, but nothing much happens. Merle Temkin's glittery fence sculpture looks like rain. This park, named in honor of many Greeks in Astoria, has a distinctly American, individualistic sensibility, which makes it appropriate for the Fourth of July weekend.
The park is isolated, and it is a good idea to exercise caution when visiting it. It is open daily from 10 A.M. to dark. Admission is free.

MENTOR GRAPHICS' STOCK OFF 24% ON EXPECTED LOSS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Mentor Graphics Corporation's stock dropped $2.375 yesterday, or 24 percent, to a 52-week low of $7.50 in over-the-counter trading, after the company said it would report a second-quarter loss. Mentor blamed the weak Japanese economy and delays in introducing products for the earnings shortfall. "It appears that poor Japanese order performance has combined with product transition issues for disappointing quarterly results," said Thomas Bruggere, Mentor Graphics' chairman and chief executive. The earnings problems probably will continue into the third quarter, Mr. Bruggere said. 
 Mentor Graphics, based in Wilsonville, Ore., estimated that it would lose between 10 cents and 15 cents a share in the second quarter, which ended June 30. Revenues will total about $88 million to $90 million. The company, which makes electronics-design software, will release financial results on July 21.

HEADLINE: The Muddled Model Cities Model

 BODY:
In January 1966, President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress with a truly dramatic idea for urban aid. Model Cities it came to be called, and the idea was to show how urban America could be transformed.
As envisioned, the program would have concentrated billions in huge demonstration grants to a handful of cities. Such grants would have tested whether comprehensive aid could create a realistic chance of eradicating blight. 
 It didn't, because such aid never materialized. Every legislator had to have a slice of the pork. A few cities became 75, then 150. Eventually the money was shoveled around only a half-inch deep anywhere. The program was destined to fail.
Welcome to July 1992.
The urban aid bill that passed the House yesterday already suffers from a terminal case of Model Cities sickness. It offers a dubious solution to urban distress -- enterprise zones -- and then spreads a little money around so thinly that such zones are denied the chance to make a difference.
The enterprise zone theory, pushed by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, is that Government tax breaks and regulatory relief will lure businesses into distressed areas and create jobs for the urban poor. State-run enterprise zones haven't worked that way.
They don't give businesses enough incentive to risk moving to crime-ridden ghettoes. Businesses that operate in existing state E.Z.'s, as they are called, often have come from slightly less poor neighborhoods nearby. To have the desired effect, government would have to make huge investments in transportation, infrastructure and crime prevention. True, Federal tax breaks and regulation waivers are much more valuable. But the urban aid bill spreads too little money too thinly, in an obvious attempt to buy support.
It would spend $5 billion over six years -- but dissipated to 50 zones. And of those, only half would be urban. The rest of the zones in the package would be "rural development investment zones."
Enterprise zones, while not the magic bullet for America's cities, deserve a chance. They won't get it in this legislation. A wiser, if more politically difficult, approach would be to cut the number of zones drastically, perhaps to 10 or 20 of the most troubled inner cities. That would take courage, and leadership, on the part of both Congress and the White House.
Neither Congress nor the White House, however, seems much interested in testing enterprise zones. Like Model Cities, this measure has gone from legislation to help cities to something that permits members of Congress to help themselves.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
De Klerk And Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
When President F. W. de Klerk made his dramatic move to release Nelson Mandela and lift political bans, on Feb. 2, 1990, he seemed to have come to a crucial understanding: that the 15 percent of South Africans who are white can no longer govern this country.
He would try to cushion the transfer of power, it was thought, by negotiating constitutional guarantees. Those would include protections of individual liberty in a bill of rights, and safeguards of property to assure whites a continuing strong economic position. 
 But Mr. de Klerk has not pursued such limited aims. In the negotiations, now suspended, it became increasingly clear that he believed his National Party had a chance to stay in power with the help of political satellites, or at a minimum to have an effective veto over any real changes in national policy.
The turning point in Mr. de Klerk's position came at a surprising moment. It was the referendum among white voters in March on whether to go on with the process of political reform. A resounding 69 percent said yes. The logic of that great victory for Mr. de Klerk seemed to be that it freed him from concern about white ultras and allowed him to move quickly for an agreement with the African National Congress.
To the contrary, the referendum victory emboldened him to take a tougher, less flexible position in the negotiations. Everyone I have met here, regardless of his or her politics, says that happened. Some speak of a new "arrogance" in Mr. de Klerk.
Why? Euphoria from the referendum is one explanation offered. Another is that Mr. de Klerk had had great success abroad, persuading the U.S., the European Community and others to relax sanctions on the ground that apartheid was buried -- though in fact the core of the apartheid system, the denial of the vote to the overwhelming black majority, remains unchanged.
Moreover, the A.N.C. had been weakened by the terrible violence visited on black communities -- violence that made the A.N.C.'s constituency more distrustful of its leadership and of the whole negotiation. Elements in the Government may have orchestrated the violence, but that must be the subject of another column.
All this apparently led Mr. de Klerk to think there was a possibility of the National Party surviving a democratic election. That is, it could win enough support among the Asian and so-called Colored minorities, and from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu supporters in Inkatha, to keep a weakened A.N.C. in a subsidiary role.
In the negotiations the Government insisted on an interim regime hemmed in by blocking devices. There would be a rotating, collective presidency, and a powerful senate in which a party that won 10 percent of the vote in a region would have as many seats as one with 60 percent.
The interim government would stay until an elected constituent assembly wrote a new constitution. But Mr. de Klerk insisted that key constitutional provisions be approved by 75 percent of the assembly. If there was no agreement on that basis, the interim regime -- the status quo -- could go on forever.
The A.N.C. went very far toward compromise on those demands. But it balked when its leaders felt they were being co-opted into a system still essentially under white control. At one point, I am told, President de Klerk said to Mr. Mandela outside the negotiating chamber: "When you join my Government . . ."
On Feb. 2, 1990, most of us thought that F. W. de Klerk was preparing the way for Nelson Mandela to become president -- as the best guarantor of a stable and prosperous South Africa. Was that a misconception, or what has happened? The possibility is that Mr. de Klerk is like Mikhail Gorbachev: aware that a repressive system no longer works but in the end unwilling to abandon it. That impression was strengthened last night, when Mr. de Klerk gave a harsh reply to an A.N.C. letter suggesting conditions for the resumption of negotiations -- though he did leave an opening to resume them.
There is no Boris Yeltsin here, no visible substitute for Mr. de Klerk among white politicians. The only hope, then, is that he will find it in him to help bring about the genuine transition for which the country is aching. Safety for the minority? Yes. An attempt to maintain control? Disaster for all.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Deficit Must Cause Some Pain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"House Democrats Promise a Deficit-Cutting Plan" (news article, June 13) is enormously encouraging.
Our only hope of overcoming what seems nearly universal dissatisfaction with the apparent ineffectuality of our political institutions -- manifested, among other ways, in the broad support for Ross Perot's candidacy for the Presidency and the surrender of Congressional seats by worthy incumbents -- is for leaders such as the House Democrats to assume the responsibility that their opposition to the balanced-budget amendment entailed and that its passage would have merely postponed. 
 Any plan worthy of public support must incorporate such measures as Representative Leon Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee, suggests: a national sales tax, increased gasoline taxes, limitation on the tax benefit of itemized deductions -- to which I would add a limit on the tax exemption of fringe benefits. Also, a cap on annual deductions for mortgage interest, reductions in Medicare, Social Security, defense, veterans and farm programs.
The country needs a great deal more than deficit reduction. We must also fulfill our promises of aid to the former Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe and -- to cite an additional, small example of our inexcusable neglect dramatized by recent events -- Panama; make good the disgraceful arrearages in paying our share of the costs of the United Nations, and expand domestic investment for job and training programs in the cities. All of these will necessitate even larger tax increases and cuts in other spending.
A vote for such a program will look like political suicide.
But undeserved electoral defeat for having tried to serve the country well is better than deserved defeat for timidity and ineptitude.
If Congress puts together such a responsible package and it is rejected, whether by the President or under pressure from organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons, the Home Builders Association, organized labor, the farm lobbies, the American Petroleum Institute and American Automobile Association (to mention only a few that will oppose one or another part of the budgetary plan) -- along with our almost universal lobby to cut the deficit but raise no taxes and touch no program benefiting me -- then at the very least it will demonstrate where the ultimate responsibility lies. Go to it, Leon Panetta.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Deficit Must Cause Some Pain;
Solemn Obligations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Commentators on the budget deficit attack so-called Government entitlement programs as benefits that go to people regardless of need. This focuses on an irrelevant aspect of such Government payments. By the same logic, you could lump Treasury bondholders or vendors in the same category. They get their invoice paid or their interest and principal payments, regardless of need.
The recipients of payments from Social Security, veterans benefits, Government pension programs and others are in a similar relationship to the Government as Treasury bondholders. They have paid into the system, in effect investing in it, through payroll taxes, combat or other service in the military or loyal and effective Government service (often making retirement fund contributions out of their paychecks). At a specified time, they receive the payments the Government, in effect, contracted with them to pay. 
 In a test vote on a proposal to put caps on Government entitlement programs recently, 4 Democratic and 24 Republican senators voted against exemption of veterans benefits from proposed entitlement cuts. The passage of the exemption over their votes set aside the cap proposal. But what a disappointment that 28 senators place such a low value on service to our country in time of war. It is surely an insult to the many men and women who served during the Persian Gulf war so short a time ago.
The entitlement programs for veterans, Social Security, military service and Government staff retirement, and for others are a sacred obligation of the Government and the people of this country to people who have devoted their lives and careers to United States interests.
Of course we have serious problems in our finances; however, the basic benefits and inflation protection of the entitlement programs are solemn obligations.
Some believe we are in an emergency now, but their solutions to the fiscal problems seem more like proposals to cut payments for purposes they do not agree with. In a real emergency the solutions would be painful to powerful interests. We could look for delays and rescheduling of interest and principal payments on Treasury bonds. In that kind of emergency, everyone would feel pain and there would not be calls to inflict damage on particular groups that commentators and analysts believe unworthy for some unspoken reason.
We should primarily look for savings in the reduction of waste, fraud and abuse. It is arrogant and shows indifference to the outrage that ordinary citizens feel about wasteful perquisites and privileges that some senators vote for cuts in veterans benefits while accepting a huge pay increase for their own benefit.
And, finally, nothing can be written on the deficit without mentioning its primary causes -- the tax cut and military buildup under President Reagan.

JOBLESS FIGURES DAMPEN QUAYLE'S ASSAULT IN ARKANSAS

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 2

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle waded onto Gov. Bill Clinton's home ground today, loaded and primed for a political assault on Mr. Clinton's latest economic growth plan. Instead, he scrambled through the day to explain new unemployment figures that threatened to focus his Arkansas visit on the White House's own economic stewardship. 
 In a speech and news conference in Little Rock, Mr. Quayle charged that the nation's nagging economic anemia was the fault of the Democratic-controlled Congress and Mr. Clinton because he failed to urge the Democratic legislators to work with the President.

HEADLINE: UNEMPLOYMENT UP SHARPLY, PROMPTING FEDERAL RESERVE TO CUT ITS KEY LENDING RATE

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate, the most politically sensitive economic indicator in an election year, rose sharply in June. Minutes after the report was released today, the Federal Reserve responded by cutting its key interest rate in an attempt to stimulate the sagging economy.
The White House, counting on an economic pickup to buoy President Bush's re-election chances, had been putting intense pressure on the Fed to lower rates. Analysts said the unemployment statistics were so grim that the central bank had little choice but to act, despite its concerns that it would appear to be bowing to political considerations. 
 The rise in joblessness, to 7.8 percent in June from 7.5 percent in May, was a sharp blow to the Bush Administration, which has boasted in recent weeks that the recovery was gathering steam.
 
Bush Advisers Split
 "It's not good news," President Bush told reporters. "It just shows the economy -- the recovery we're in is not as robust as I'd like to see it." Mr. Bush's advisers have been sharply split over how positive the President should sound about the economy's prospects. Seeking to deflect accusations that he has not done enough to spur the recovery, Mr. Bush blamed Congress for failing to approve his economic package, which called for capital gains tax cuts and other tax incentives.
But Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, sought to throw Mr. Bush on the defensive. "The President just doesn't understand that people want economic leadership, not more political blame," he said. He added that the country "can't afford a President who is willing to do anything to keep his job, but nothing to help average hardworking Americans keep theirs."
Concerned about high unemployment, the Congress today passed legislation to make it easier for the long-term unemployed to collect extended benefits, and President Bush said he would sign it. The House also approved a $5 billion package that aims to help cities through job training and tax incentives for business. [Page A13.]
 
Discount Rate 3%
 The Federal Reserve's cut in its discount rate to 3 percent from 3 1/2 percent brought the rate at which it lends money to banks to its lowest level since 1963. The Fed also reduced the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 3.25 percent from 3.75. Several major banks followed by cutting their prime rate, the interest rate banks use as a basis for their loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and to consumers.
Interest rate cuts fuel economic growth by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow more for investment and cheaper for consumers to borrow for spending. Still, lower rates hurt some Americans, especially retirees who live on interest income from savings accounts or certificates of deposit. After inflation is taken into account, the effective rate on many savings accounts is close to zero.
The rise in the jobless rate surprised many analysts, who are starting to voice fears of a "triple dip" recession. "It's an ugly report," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley. "It raises a clear warning sign that this recovery is in trouble."
What upset economists in particular about today's employment report was that the survey of employers' payrolls showed a drop of 117,000 jobs, with most of the drop coming in manufacturing and construction. The report also showed that the jobless rate rose for adult males and females and had climbed sharply for teen-agers, rising to 23.6 percent from 20 percent. The report also showed a drop in the length of the workweek.
"It's excellent news for Ross Perot and Bill Clinton," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, an economics forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
 
'A Horrible Month
 "There is no favorable spin that can be put on this employment report," he added. "I don't think this is any kind of statistical fluke. This says June was a horrible month."
The President hailed the central bank's rate cuts as well as the decision by major banks to cut their prime rate. Citibank, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Bank of America, Chemical and Chase Manhattan were among the banks cutting this rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent.
"That is a good way to stimulate growth," Mr. Bush said. "And I think that will be very well received by the markets and by the businesses, large and small, across the country."
Concerned abut the weak economy, stocks slid today on the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 3,330.29 points, down 23.81 for the day. Bonds rose, however, as long-term interest rates dipped in reaction to the Federal Reserve's rate cuts.
The Fed said in a statement: "Action was taken in light of sustained weakness in credit and money growth, continued movement toward price stability, and the uneven progress of the economic recovery."
Seven hours after it lowered rates, the Fed announced in a report that M-2 -- the most closely watched definition of the money supply -- fell sharply in the last week. The Fed said that M-2 declined by $10.6 billion last week and that monetary growth over the last six months had fallen below the Fed's target range. Slow growth in the money supply can mean that not enough money is available for loans to fuel economic growth.
 
Brady Urged Easing
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has argued in recent days that the Fed should ease further, saying weak money supply growth could cause the recovery to slow, just as sluggish monetary growth caused a recovering economy to fall into a second dip last year.
Federal Reserve officials said Mr. Greenspan learned of the unemployment figure late on Wednesday, after the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee -- the central bank's main policy-making group. The board voted at a meeting this morning, 7 to 0, to cut the discount rate immediately.
The action was a sharp departure from the policy adopted at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in May. According to the minutes of that meeting, released today, the central bankers decided at that time to take a neutral approach, because most of them believed there was enough monetary easing already in the pipeline to fuel the recovery.
Speaking about today's jobs report, Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based bank holding company, said: "The Fed had to be absolutely startled by the unemployment rate, the drop in payrolls, and the drop in the workweek. There were no silver linings in that report."
He said today's rate cuts "are very close to being too late to help" the President before November. Many economists say the lag time before lower rates percolate through the economy to spur investment, spending and growth is about six months.
Secretary Brady welcomed the action, but said it was too late. "The momentum of the recovery and the sluggish growth of the money supply indicated the need for such action some time ago," he said.
 
 
First-Quarter Growth
 In the first quarter, the economy grew by a solid 2.7 percent, with economists saying the mild winter caused an unexpected jump in home building and consumer spending.
But the economy appears to have weakened substantially in the second quarter as consumer spending seems to have run out of breath, partly because job gains and wage gains failed to pick up strongly. It is often said that thanks to the good weather, the first quarter borrowed a lot of activity from the second quarter, helping cause the second quarter to be weaker.
Mr. Brinner of DRI/McGraw-Hill said there was a 50-50 chance that the economy would stumble into a "triple dip," meaning that growth would drop below 1 percent. He said there was a 50 percent chance that growth would average 3 percent in the second half of the year, and a 50 percent chance that under the stagnation or triple-dip forecast, growth would be a weak 1.5 percent.
"Before we said there was a 30 percent chance of this stagnation alternative, now we tell our clients it's 50 percent," he said.
Economists say the current recovery has been held back -- and past rate cuts have failed to spur growth much -- principally because of the huge debt burden weighing down consumer and business spending. Growth has been hurt by cuts in the military budget and high long-term interest rates, caused in part by the huge Federal budget deficit. Other negative factors include the unusual number of white-collar layoffs and past overbuilding in commercial real estate.
In reducing the discount rate from 7 percent in 1989 to the present 3 percent, the Greenspan Federal Reserve has usually acted in increments of one-quarter point. Today's move was just the third time it reduced the discount rate by more than a quarter point.

HEADLINE: JAPAN'S TRADE GAP IS GROWING AGAIN

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
After several years of reduction, Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world is soaring again to record levels, a development that could increase unemployment in other nations and contribute to a new round of trade tensions.
It is also likely to be a main topic at the summit meeting of the seven leading industrial countries next week in Munich, where Japan will be in the awkward position of being the only participant with a surplus. 
 "We've never seen a trade surplus like this in any country before," said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist and strategist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo. He said Japan's exports could exceed imports this year by $135 billion, well above the levels that followed the 1985 Plaza accord, under which the industrial partners agreed to raise the yen's value sharply to reduce Japan's trade imbalance.
 
Plan for Public Spending
 In Munich, the Japanese Government is expected to tell its counterparts about a new plan to stimulate its economy by increasing public spending by $47 billion or more later this year, which could increase imports. But economists say -- and Japanese officials concede -- that such measures will make only a small dent in the trade imbalance. They say more fundamental changes are needed: Japanese consumers must spend more and the Government must open its markets wider to foreigners.
Japanese officials say the recent rise in the trade surplus is a result of worldwide economic forces, not specific trade practices. In the late 1980's, while Japan's economy boomed, imports of everything from German cars to French wine and American lumber rose sharply.
But with the collapse of Japan's speculative bubble economy, imports have started to fall. That decline results in part from the fact that the prices of raw materials that Japan imports, particularly oil, have gone down. Meanwhile, prices of products that Japan exports have gone up, in part because Japan has shifted to making more expensive cars.
"This is essentially a price-generated change," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist for Salomon Brothers in Asia. He said that the balance of the volume of Japan's imports and exports had not changed much for three years.
In addition, a new fear is arising that Japan is no longer recycling its surplus to help other nations.
In the 1980's, Japan used the money it generated from trade to make long-term investments overseas in stocks, bonds, real estate and new factories. Such investment, while sometimes controversial, helped other countries to grow. But in the last year, Japanese companies, having been stung by unwise investments abroad and facing a recession at home, have sharply cut back on these investments. Now, more foreign capital is flowing into Japan than Japanese capital is going out, as foreigners rebuild their positions in Japanese assets.
Some economists say that unless Japan begins recycling the huge surplus, the world could face a shortage of capital. That could drive up interest rates, perhaps lengthening the current worldwide recession.
"For Japan, it is very important to recycle the capital that can serve the rest of the world," said Makoto Utsumi, a former vice minister for international affairs who is now an adviser to Japan's Ministry of Finance. Japanese investors, he said, have become afraid to take risks. "The Government should do something to mobilize this money," he said.
 
Defending Its Position
 The situation is potentially embarrassing to Japan because the nation has often defended its trade surplus as being a means of accumulating savings for the rest of the world to use. Such an argument is now harder to make.
But some economists say Japan's importing of long-term capital has not been a problem and will not become one. Instead of long-term investments, Japan is making short-term investments like sending money to foreign banks. Those banks could then make long-term investments, indirectly recycling the trade surplus.
Japan's surplus jumped more than 60 percent in 1991, to a record $103 billion, and it is heading even higher this year. Its surplus with the United States, $38.2 billion last year, is still significantly lower than it was a few years earlier, but it has started to move up again after years of decline.
Indeed, in May, Japan's overall trade surplus nearly doubled from the level of a year earlier, while the surplus with the United States jumped more than 50 percent. This is threatening to make Japan's trade practices, and the American response, a leading issue in the Presidential election campaign.
The Bush Administration, hoping to prevent worsening relations with Japan, recently tried to play down Japan's trade problems, particularly in meetings this week in Washington between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. The United States has pushed Japan, however, to stimulate its economy to spur spending and imports.
"The point is not to regard this as a bilateral problem," Michael Armacost, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said last week. "The sluggishness of the world economy affects everybody."
But in a sense, Japan's trade surplus is actually a multilateral rather than bilateral problem. After sharp increases in recent years, Japan's surpluses with the rest of Asia and with Europe are now roughly the same size as its predictably large surplus with the United States.
Just this week, South Korea and Japan signed an agreement aimed at alleviating the Korean deficit with Japan, which has more than doubled since 1989. The deficit with Japan accounts for 90 percent of the deficit of South Korea, a nation that can normally compete quite well in overseas markets.
 
Fewer Goods From Europe
 Japan's trade imbalance with the European Community jumped nearly 50 percent in 1991, to $27.4 billion. Japan's imports from Europe tend to be luxury items like BMW automobiles, French perfume and Scotch whisky, and such imports dropped sharply as stock and real estate prices here suffered a steep decline.
The surplus with fast-growing countries in southern and eastern Asia grew about 33 percent, to $37.4 billion. A main reason for this is that these nations, which are trying to build up their technology bases, are importing components and sophisticated factory machinery from Japan.
At the same time, many Japanese companies have shifted some manufacturing to Southeast Asia. Those shifts are an important reason Japan's deficit with the United States is lower than it was five years ago -- more Japanese products are coming into the United States from other parts of Asia.
Economists say that the Japanese Government's plan to increase public spending, which has not been made final, will not do much to reduce the trade surplus.
Naoyuki Haraoka, director of the international trade research office in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said his personal estimate, not that of his agency, was that the envisioned spending package might raise imports by $10 billion to $12 billion. "That is not substantial, compared to $100 billion," he said.
Some economists think the surplus will bring about more pressure for a rise in the value of the yen, which would tend to make Japan's exports more expensive in other countries and make foreign products cheaper for the Japanese. The yen has already strengthened recently to about 124 to the dollar. But there are doubts that any movement of the yen will make much difference, since Japan was able to adjust for the roughly doubling of the yen's value that resulted from the 1985 Plaza agreement.
Dr. Courtis of Deutsche Bank says the surplus will defy shrinkage. He says that the investments made during Japan's economic boom in new factories and in research and development, and the competitive lift it has provided, will carry the Japanese through the next few years. "There's no fundamental reversal going to occur," he said.
Some scholars also contend that the nature of trade has changed as companies have spread operations around the globe. A significant portion of trade is now intra-company, as when Toyota in Japan ships parts to the Toyota factory in Kentucky. Under this reasoning, the balance of trade will not change much until American and European companies make similar levels of direct investment in Japan.
In the long run, Japan's surplus might diminish if the nation consumes more, but such societal shifts are slow in coming.
Falling real estate prices might reduce how much people have to save to buy a house. But one way to reduce land prices would be to take farms out of production, which might not sit well with Japan's politically powerful farmers. Shorter working hours, another Government goal, would give the Japanese more time to spend their money. But that might require allowing more foreign workers into the country, a policy that many Japanese oppose.
Japanese officials are fond of pointing out that the trade involves two or more countries and that the United States and other nations need to become more competitive to cut their deficits. "Japan alone cannot resolve the problem," Mr. Utsumi said.

HEADLINE: Albany Lawmakers End Session Without Acting on 2 Major Issues

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 3

 BODY:
The state legislative session ended today in an angry morass of exhaustion and partisan bickering, and lawmakers left town near dawn without acting on two major economic initiatives: an $800 million bond act to create jobs and a fiscal bailout that would allow Nassau and Suffolk counties to borrow money.
As had been the case all week, the two measures remained, in essence, hostage to each other. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vigorously sought the bond act as a showpiece of his agenda to lift New York out of the recession, and the Republican-led State Senate desperately wanted the Long Island bailouts to head off the likely alternative, steep increases in local property taxes. 
 But while most lawmakers here had predicted that the two measures would be approved in the traditional flurry of last-minute dealmaking, it did not happen, in part because Mr. Cuomo strongly hinted on Thursday night that he would veto the bailouts as irresponsible. "Don't leave them on my desk," he said. "I'll throw them in the pail."
The measures would have allowed the counties to borrow a total of about $190 million, between 5 and 7 percent of their budgets, and county executives in Nassau and Suffolk said today that without them they would be forced to raise taxes, lay off county employees and cut services. They implored state leaders to reconsider the measures in special session.
Legislators could point to accomplishments this session, notably the completion of a budget virtually on time for the first time in eight years. But that did not obscure the failures. No one here was predicting that the Legislature would return anytime soon to take up the financial measure for Nassau and Suffolk. [News analysis and article, page 24.]
And there was no mistaking the air of bitterness as the session fizzled to a close.
"This is pure political blackmail," said the majority leader of the Senate, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican who berated the Democrats for blocking the bailout bills. "They clearly say to the people of Long Island and those they have elected: 'Drop dead.' "
Governor Cuomo, for his part, seemed to taunt Senator Marino for failing to win a borrowing measure that the Republican Party leaders on Long Island -- Mr. Marino's compatriots for all his political life -- had beseeched him to bring home.
"You know, it's a macho game," Mr. Cuomo said. "You go to your gatherings there where they hang elephants from the ceiling and everybody says, 'Ahh, you did the right thing, Ralphy-baby!' "
Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Cuomo was asked whether his quashing of the bailout was a payback for Mr. Marino, whom the Governor repeatedly depicted last December as the great obstructionist in budget talks who singlehandedly prevented Mr. Cuomo from being able to run for President. The Governor emphatically denied this was the case.
There were, to be sure, some 11th-hour deals here that produced important legislation, most notably a new bill to restrict the profits of criminals who sell their stories as books or films. The new measure replaces the Son of Sam law struck down by the Supreme Court in December. And lawmakers reached a landmark agreement earlier in the week to overhaul health insurance by banning discrimination in rate-setting.
But by almost any other measure, the session is likely to be judged by what was not accomplished at the end.
Aside from economic development and the Long Island fiscal measures, negotiations collapsed on bills to establish a trust fund for environmental protection, strengthen protections for the Adirondack wilderness and impose new measures to deter teen-agers from smoking.
Amid the dogfight between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Marino, the leader who emerged from the fray as comparatively calm and statesmanlike was the rookie in this year's negotiations, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin. The Queens Democrat took over the post last December after the conviction of his predecessor on fraud charges.
Mr. Weprin managed to get several of his major initiatives passed this year, including new property-tax limits in New York City and reinstatement of a bill he spearheaded several years ago to allow news cameras in the state's courtrooms.
Beyond that, Mr. Weprin also scored a major victory in the next-to-last day of the session when courts not only upheld the bulk of an Assembly redistricting plan but also effectively forced the Senate into approving a small modification that Mr. Weprin had been unable to wrest from Mr. Marino.
The Republicans had attempted to play political hardball by insisting on some changes to help G.O.P. Assemblyman. But Mr. Weprin said no, and managed to get what he needed from the courts instead.
 
'This Is My Territory'
 "I considered it a form of intimidation, and I wasn't going to stand for it," Mr. Weprin crowed to reporters who asked him about the Republican tactic.
Negotiations on the Nassau and Suffolk bailouts sputtered around 4 A.M. this morning and ultimately broke off after what both sides concurred was a shouting match over the telephone between Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino.
"He said some things on the phone he'll probably regret," Mr. Weprin said today of his counterpart.
"He said that Nassau and Suffolk were his domain and this is what he wanted to do," Mr. Weprin added. "He said, 'This is my territory and where do you come off telling me what to do?' I said, 'Ralph. I'm not telling you what to do, I'm just suggesting that we do it a better way.' "
The Assembly, mirroring what it called years of Republican demands for greater oversight of New York City's financial affairs, had pushed for some version of a financial review board in the two Long Island counties, but Mr. Marino balked at this.
"This is not a New York City default situation," Mr. Marino said in a telephone interview today. "It's entirely different. They have a short-term financial crisis, and they're just asking for permission to get out of it."
The Governor appeared embittered today over what he depicted as Mr. Marino's reneging on an agreement late Thursday to approve the bond act, which, even if approved here, would still have to be put before the voters in November. But Mr. Marino said there was no such deal, and that he had always made it clear to the Governor that it would not happen if his fellow Republican Senators did not go along with the bill's language.
The bill, which the Assembly passed in the final hours of the session but the Senate did not take up, reflected complicated haggling over how to allocate the money among various regions of the state.
Harold Holzer, an aide to the Governor who is spokesman for the state Office of Economic Development, said that in refusing to act, the Republicans had turned their backs on $85 million in development money for Long Island.
"One cannot escape the bitter irony of the fact the jobs bond act went down to indifference the day after the worst unemployment news in 10 years was released in Washington," Mr. Holzer said. "There's an old saying, in and out of economic development, that you don't cut off your nose to spite your face. Ralph Marino has just given Long Island an $85 million nose job."

Chart: "Legislative Sparring: The Bitter End"
In one furious telephone call early yesterday between Saul Weprin, speaker of the Democratic Assembly, and Ralph J. Marino, majority leader of the Republican Senate, the chance for agreement on the remaining issues of the legislative session fell apart. The call, about whether to help Nassau and Suffolk Counties close their budget deficits, took place about four A.M. Here's what the two leaders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had to say about the whole thing today:
 
Speaker Weprin: "[Marino] said that Nassau and Suffolk were his domain and this is what he wanted to do. And he told me, 'i've always leaned over backward for New York City, anything they've ever wanted I've always given them, but this is my territory, and where do you come off telling me what to do?"
 
"He seemed to think I had some personal vendetta against him for not doing the Nassau-Suffolk bills, and he expressed it accordingly."
 
Majority Learder Marino: "I became angry at the fact that it became clear that the Assembly and [Weprin] were not working in good faith, that I had been jerked around, and that my county and Suffolk County were being held hostage."
 
"I took it personally because it is personal - it's my county. I became irate and we had a few harsh words."
 
Governor Cuomo: "The best thing that coul happen would be for Senator Marino to wake up, put some cold water in his face, and say 'Look, I've thought better of this.' I think what I ought to do is call Saul first of all and say. 'Saul, it was four in the morning and tempers were a little hot." (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: The Students Left Behind

 BODY:
George Bush, the self-styled education President, insists on undermining public schools in order to save them. In the name of making public schools more "competitive," he would provide vouchers allowing parents to send their children to private and parochial schools. It's an odd remedy, but November looms ahead and he is searching for a domestic agenda.
Recently Mr. Bush announced the State and Local G.I. Bills for Children. This latest voucher proposal would provide up to $1,000 that low- and middle-income families could spend at private schools or even another public school. 
 The White House argues that the plan would benefit families with incomes below $40,000, giving them "more of the same choices of schools wealthy families already have." Mr. Bush wants $500 million in new financing for the program.
That's only marginally more palatable than an earlier proposal to convert the federally funded Chapter 1 program, which offers remedial help to students who are economically and educationally disadvantaged, into vouchers of $600 per pupil. Motivated students could have transferred to another public school or a private or parochial school, taking the public funds with them.
That would have robbed the old school of its better students and, inevitably, demoralized teachers and administrators. The proposal went nowhere in Congress. The latest voucher plan is likely to be dead on arrival too, since it suffers from many of the same deficiencies.
So what's the point? Is Mr. Bush merely playing election year politics, trying to attract Catholics and some inner-city minority parents struggling to send their children to parochial schools? How much private schooling is $1,000 a year likely to buy a low-income family?
Mr. Bush's instinct to shake up public schools is laudable. But his mechanism for doing so is cynically inequitable. The Administration says many kids will choose public schools instead of private or parochial schools. But since the $1,000 travels with the student, and since the President offers nothing to the schools left behind, the plan would inevitably create new imbalances in the system.
Why not instead a major effort to equip all public schools with adequate and decent textbooks and science laboratories? In theory, expanding choice makes good sense. But only if accompanied by a vigorous effort to meet the needs of those who don't really have a choice.

HEADLINE: Washington Could Do Something

 BODY:
The sharp jump in unemployment in June, following a similar spike in May, shakes confidence that the economy is improving. Monthly unemployment data can be unreliable barometers, but the new numbers follow a worrisome trend. Home sales, durable goods orders and consumer confidence are all off. Two months ago, people worried that the economy wasn't picking up enough steam. Now they fear it is slipping back into recession.
None of these figures portend disaster. But they do warrant corrective action by Washington. The Federal Reserve did what it could Thursday by lowering interest rates another notch. But few economists believe monetary policy can do enough soon. The economy needs another punch, from Congress -- a quick-hitting combination of temporary tax cuts and spending increases. 
 Is corrective action likely? No -- which offers a sad commentary on government. The economy needs a quick shot of adrenaline. But the idea that Congress and the White House would join to deliver it is nearly unimaginable.
The economy seemed to be recovering nicely in the first quarter, growing by nearly 3 percent. But then output slackened, hastened by a fall in exports to sluggish economies in Europe and Asia. Unemployment rose 0.3 percent in May and then again in June by an equal amount. Now the rate stands at 7.8 percent, representing more than 10 million Americans who can't find jobs. The news is even grimmer in New York City, where unemployment shot up a full point to 11.5 percent in May.
The Fed responded to the jobless figures immediately by lowering short-term interest rates to their lowest levels in decades. There may still be room for the Fed to do more, but its options are limited. If it becomes too aggressive, bond markets will shiver. Fearing inflation, traders will drive rates higher -- the opposite of what the Fed would be trying to accomplish. The Fed has cut short-term rates almost 30 times since the recession began, yet long-term rates -- the ones that affect business investment -- have hardly budged.
That puts the onus on Congress. Last December Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate economist at M.I.T., and Francis Bator of Harvard called on Congress to cut taxes and raise Federal grants to state and local governments for one year. The idea was to boost the economy temporarily and thereby ward off recession.
The key word was temporary. That way the plan would not raise long-term deficits and, therefore, do no long-term harm. Had Congress listened, millions more Americans wouldn't now be collecting unemployment checks.
The Solow-Bator plan made sense last winter. It still does. But though the skies look darker, Washington still isn't listening.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bush on the Environment: A Record of Contradictions

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Seventh article of a series.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENOVA, W. Va.

 BODY:
The people who live here in the hazy valleys cut by the Ohio and Big Sandy Rivers, where the air has been among the most polluted in the country, are benefiting from cleaner air these days, thanks to changes in weather patterns as well as to a law passed two years ago.
President Bush saluted that law, the Clean Air Act, and said it would "make the 1990's the era for clean air." 
 But now, with a Presidential campaign in progress and the economy stubbornly sluggish, the law, the most comprehensive and expensive environmental statute ever enacted, is under attack within the Administration, where business interests often seem to outweigh environmental concerns. And that is leaving many people here worried that the Clean Air Act's initial gains will not be followed by the more sweeping improvements the law was supposed to provide.
 
Views of Record Differ
 During the 1988 campaign Mr. Bush often said he wanted to be known as "the environmental President." But critics say that while he took strong stands on environmental matters for the first two years of his administration, his approach changed in the midst of the recession.
Mr. Bush now seems to place a much higher priority on reducing the costs of complying with environmental regulation than on cleaning the nation's air.
In every public accounting the President has offered of his domestic accomplishments, he ranks the Clean Air Act at or near the top of the list. "I invite comparison of the record that we as a country and an Administration have built," Mr. Bush said in a speech last month. "It is aggressive. It is comprehensive. And it is ambitious, but carefully balanced."
But leaders of environmental groups have a different view.
"In his commitments during the 1988 campaign, he was good on some issues, mediocre on others, and very weak on a few," said Carl Pope, associate executive director of the Sierra Club in San Francisco. "But what we did get in the first two years was environmental moderation. He did not treat the environment as an issue he would throw away to the right wing of the Republican party and the least responsible sectors of American business.
"But what we have seen in the last six months," he added, "is an almost compete reversion to the policies pursued by the Reagan Administration."
The available evidence lends support to that view.
 
Reversed Direction
 In his first two years as President, Mr. Bush approved sharp increases in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget, blocked a new dam in Colorado that would have flooded a scenic canyon, and added more than $100 million to the Federal budget for buying land for parks and refuges.
But in the last year, Mr. Bush approved a proposal that would make it much harder to halt a dam like the one in Colorado. And he backed two proposals approved by the Departments of Agriculture and Interior that would limit or eliminate the public's ability to block timber cutting in national forests and mining or oil exploration on public lands.
Two years ago, Mr. Bush put the coast of New England, southern Florida and most of California off limits to oil exploration and drilling for a decade. But a year ago, Mr. Bush tried to open the untouched Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration. Congress killed that plan.
In 1988 and 1989 Mr. Bush repeatedly promised to fashion a land-use policy that would produce "no net loss" of the nation's swamps, marshes and other wetlands. But last summer, he approved a plan that would allow development on 50 million acres of wetlands, half the nation's total, including parts of the Florida Everglades.
In his first two years, Mr. Bush signed international agreements to ban ivory trading, to eliminate large-scale drift-net fishing and to protect Antarctica. But Mr. Bush was the last leader of an industrialized nation to announce he would attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last month. Once there, he drew international criticism for weakening a treaty to combat global warming and for refusing to sign another to protect endangered species.
 
Job Losses Cited
 The President and his aides say they are trying to protect jobs. But environmentalists maintain that jobs would be created by tighter regulations that would spur development of new equipment and techniques to make American factories more efficient.
Since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, the Administration has failed to complete more than 30 regulations needed to put much of the law into effect, including most of the important ones. The few rules the White House has issued seem intended primarily to reduce the costs of regulation to business. Before the Administration began weakening the provisions last year, the oil industry had estimated that full compliance at the 200 refineries across the country would cost $40 billion over the next 10 years.
In the view of environmentalists, the most effective rules so far were those written by Congress when the law was drafted. Those provisions dealt with acid rain and cleaner fuels and amounted to about 30 percent of the law. The remaining rules are supposed to be written by the Administration.
Mr. Bush's aides, including Robert E. Grady, the acting Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Mr. Bush's commitment to environmental goals has not changed.
"The President has been the greatest defender of land and water since Teddy Roosevelt," Mr. Grady said.
 
The Stated Goals
Push for Clean Air Ends Up as Retreat
 With ambitious goals and high costs, the Clean Air Act was seen from the beginning as a test of the President's strategy of balancing environmental concerns with economic needs.
And in few other environmental efforts has the President's about-face seemed clearer. With prodding from the President's Council on Competitiveness, a cabinet group headed by Vice President Dan Quayle whose goal is to reduce the cost of regulations, Mr. Bush has responded to complaints from manufacturers and utilities by curtailing the law's reach.
In June the Administration issued a new rule that allows each of about 35,000 chemical, pharmaceutical and other plants to increase emissions of hazardous air pollutants by up to 245 tons a year, just by asking states' permission to do so. No public hearings or notification are required.
In March, four days before the Michigan primary, Mr. Bush told a group of Detroit businessmen that he was waiving a Clean Air rule requiring auto makers to install canisters in new cars to capture fumes during refueling.
"The manipulation of regulations is a direct result of industry lobbying at the White House," said Norm Steenstra, environmental coordinator for West Virginia Citizen Action Group, an environmental group in Charleston. "We're learning very quickly that one can pass legislation and then get murdered in the regulatory phase."
 
Awaiting Regulations
 In this region, where Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia come together in a lumpy landscape of narrow valleys and low hills, it's easy to measure any changes in the White House view of the Clean Air Act. An accident of man and nature often makes the air here dirtier than anyplace in the East, according to the E.P.A.
On windless winter and hot summer days, the valleys trap air carrying tons of dust and chemicals churned out by steel, coke and chemical plants along the Ohio and Big Sandy Rivers. During the dry summer of 1988, residents said, the air was so bad that doctors warned families to keep children indoors.
By every measure, according to air pollution authorities in the three states, the air in the Ohio River Valley is cleaner this year, especially around this town of 4,000 people. One reason is that temperatures have been much cooler. Another is that sulfur dioxide has been reduced by the Clean Air Act.
Across the Big Sandy River in Catlettsburg, Ky., the nation's 13th largest oil refinery, owned by Ashland Oil Inc., turns crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel and Valvoline motor oil. The refinery is one of the region's principal sources of sulfur dioxide pollutants, which can cause respiratory illnesses and which combine with moisture in the atmosphere to form acid rain.
Over the last several years, Kentucky air-pollution authorities have repeatedly levied fines against Ashland totaling several hundred thousand dollars. A report by the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission showed that in 1987, one of the refinery's units released caustic ash into the air that fell as thick as snow, peeling paint from cars and causing other damage.
 
Multimillion-Dollar Investment
 A provision in the Clean Air Act requires refiners to reduce the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel from 0.22 percent to 0.02 percent. Ashland responded by spending $68 million in the last year on new equipment to strip sulfur from the fuel and keep it from escaping into the air. That brought the sharply lower sulfur dioxide levels.
"We are complying with the law, and we supported the Clean Air law from the beginning," John R. Hall, Ashland's chairman, said in an interview at the company's hilltop headquarters. "We believe the new requirements for diesel fuel are right."
But Sue Holland, a mother of five and a leader of Tri State Environmental Impact, a local environmental group, complains that the cleanup of other pollutants in the Ohio Valley's air can't even begin until the Administration issues the necessary regulations.
 
Words and Actions
Regulatory Delays Slow Enforcement
 Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who was a principal author of the Clean Air Act, filed a lawsuit on June 5 asserting that the Administration was deliberately trying to thwart the intent of the law by delaying regulations to help businesses. Mr. Waxman said the Administration had missed 30 deadlines for writing regulations and had failed to follow 29 other requirements of the law.
"The record is clear," Mr. Waxman said in a statement accompanying the lawsuit. "After publicly pledging support for this law, President Bush worked closely with big polluters to undermine it, in many cases holding up vitally important regulations at the White House. This is very different than flip-flopping on a campaign promise. The new Clean Air program was enacted into law. Having signed the law, the President is legally bound to carry it out."
In interviews, the President's aides said the Administration's work on the Clean Air Act had been fair; their goal, they said, was to achieve cleaner air without bankrupting companies. The many delays in writing the law's more important rules resulted from the sheer volume of the work, they said.
"Deadlines are frequently missed," acknowledged C. Boyden Gray, the President's counsel. "The E.P.A. is being called on to issue more rules under this statute than any other act, in a concentrated period of time. It's all unfolding pretty much as Congress intended. There is a delay here and a delay there, but that is par for the course. It's very rare that anybody comes in on time under any statute."
Mr. Waxman and other critics assert that election-year politics have allowed the nation's largest corporations to influence the President's decisions on the Clean Air Act and virtually every other facet of environmental policy.
 
In-Fighting
E.P.A. on One Side, Quayle on the Other
 One reason for the delays is an angry battle within the Administration between William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, and Vice President Quayle and cabinet members over how rigorous the Clean Air rules should be.
The Clean Air program for reducing emissions of 189 toxic substances was to take 10 years. Under the law, the Administration was supposed to begin the process last November by listing every source of toxic contamination that would need to be reduced or eliminated. But oil, chemical and other industrial lobbyists have asked Mr. Quayle's Council on Competitiveness to reduce the costs of the new rules. Mr. Reilly opposes that, and because of this disagreement the Administration has not issued the rules needed to start the program.
"This law makes the states more responsible than ever to control air pollution, but we are not in control of writing the rules," said G. Dale Farley, director of the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. "Until they are finished, we can't begin to plan our work. The effect of all this is unfortunate. It means the air doesn't get cleaner."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
The event probably took no more than two minutes. In June 1989, at the Nathan Bishop Middle School graduation in Providence, R.I., Rabbi Leslie Gutterman thanked the "God of the free, hope of the brave" for "the legacy of America where diversity is celebrated and the rights of minorities are protected."
Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled that Rabbi Gutterman's prayers violated the First Amendment. They were, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for a 5-to-4 majority, a state-sponsored religious exercise in which students were pressured into joining. 
 The case probably drew more attention and stirred more passions that all the praying done at thousands of graduations. Defenders as well as opponents of the prayers invoked the relationships between religion, government and public life. Both sides spoke so often of the dangers of a "slippery slope" that they might have been talking about skiing rather than a constitutional clash.
To defenders of such graduation prayers, barring them is part of a steady drive to expunge from public life all references to religion, the disentangling of all the threads historically linking religion and government in America, from inaugural prayers right down to "In God We Trust" on the currency.
Opponents of the graduation prayers saw a different slippery slope. To them, the Bush Administration's brief on behalf of the prayers was part of a drive to please conservative religious voters by getting a reshaped Court to relax its previous church-state rulings, opening the way to prayer in the classroom and financial aid to parochial schools.
For the moment, it is the defenders of graduation prayers who feel the nation is still headed downhill. Although they include some maverick liberals, they are mostly conservatives and in a curious way they make their case much the way that liberals do in economic questions.
In economics, liberals are the ones who often think that too many reigning doctrines have not been adjusted to deal with the world as it really operates -- the world of vast inequities in riches and political power and of instantaneous information and environmental limits.
That is the way many conservatives feel about interpretations of the First Amendment. Robert P. Dugan Jr., director of the Office of Public Affairs of the National Association of Evangelicals, bitterly remarked the juxtaposition of the Supreme Court's ruling that "hate speech" was constitutionally protected with the decision, two days later, that a nonsectarian prayer in the graduation ceremonies for high school students was constitutionally impermissible.
Other critics of the Court's stance argue that this is no longer a culture where religious leaders hold absolute sway over mores.
Quite the contrary, they say. At a time when urban school boards are declaring it necessary to instruct grade school pupils about condoms and anal sex, these critics find absurd the Court's delicate sense that two minutes of standing attentively during a one-time graduation benediction constitutes government-instigated peer pressure on consciences.
Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in the graduation prayer case is a masterly expression of this view. Read after the finely balanced opinion of Justice Kennedy and even after the still more intricate weaving of historical scholarship and constitutional precedent in Justice David H. Souter's concurring opinion, Justice Scalia's dissent comes across like a blunt "Who are you kidding?"
For him, the idea that silent standing during a prayer equals unconstitutional coercion is a ludicrous "psycho-journey" that simply flies in the face of "a longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations."
Of course, there are rebuttals to Justice Scalia's sallies. Douglas Laycock, a constitutional scholar at the University of Texas, said that, for all its aura of realism, Mr. Scalia's dissent appeared "wholly oblivious to the social reality that goes on in these ceremonies."
Nor is it at all clear where, or why, Justice Scalia would limit religious exercises at government ceremonies. Nonsectarian public prayer is certainly a longstanding American tradition -- but so is sectarian prayer, like the one to Jesus at an earlier graduation of the Nathan Bishop Middle School. The Justice did not say how schools or other government agencies can patrol the difference without getting entangled in theology
Does any of this matter? The Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus, a Christian theologian, argues that "the premise that anything government touches should be thoroughly sanitized of any religious reference" is "societally suicidal."
American life "is riddled through and through with religious symbols," he said, and to expunge them from government would make the state "an alien force" and "pit government against society in a way that invites a reaction."
Others disagree. "I suppose there will always be people who will take the view that this is creating a naked public square," devoid of religion, said the Rev. Dean M. Kelley, counselor on religious liberty for the National Council of Churches. "But we don't have to embody religion by putting it on the courthouse steps when there are churches all around the public square that can be religious all the time."

HEADLINE: Oiapoque Journal;
Perilous Jungle Passage Leads Poor to 'France'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OIAPOQUE, Brazil

 BODY:
After a few shots of sugar cane rum, fishermen who gather nightly on a riverside wharf here often say that, peering through the tropical haze of the Eastern Amazon, they can see the bright lights of France.
Indeed, 15 minutes downriver by motorized canoe lies a thinly populated corner of Europe: Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, the southernmost town of French Guiana. 
 Historically, Brazil has been a nation that received immigrants, not one that dispatched emigrants. Traditionally, this remote edge of the country was a beacon for French convicts escaping Devils Island and fleeing Guiana's thick jungles. In a legacy of this era, one Brazilian border village carries the name Normandia -- a nostalgic tribute by a French fugitive to his faraway birthplace.
But now it is the lights of France that burn brightest in this region straddling the Equator. Fleeing a decade of economic stagnation, Brazilians are migrating to French Guiana in search of European salaries. French Guiana, slightly larger than Maine, has only 100,000 people. Brazil's five states closest to it have 20 million people, largely poor.
 
'Hit the Beach Running'
 Without life jackets and packed into precarious wooden canoes, hundreds embark every week from here for the perilous, seven-hour journey to Cayenne, the capital of the French department.
"You have to hit the beach running," Iran Bernardino, a Brazilian veteran of the trip, counseled a friend late one afternoon as they waited for the sun to set before climbing into a river canoe.
With French work visas virtually impossible to obtain, most Brazilians enter the department illegally by way of Cayenne. Some continue to Kourou, site of the world's busiest commercial satellite launching center.
"Until I was caught, I was earning 9,000 francs a month in a furniture factory in Cayenne," Mr. Bernardino said, an amount worth $1,730 today. By contrast, the 36-year-old former construction worker noted, Brazil's legal minimum salary is $67 a month.
Oiapoque, an isolated Amazon village without a sewage system, without a high school and without a working telephone at the town hall, has become the latest contact point between two tectonic plates -- the economically developed north and the economically deprived south.
 
One Million Have Left Since '80
 The deep recession has sent Brazilians knocking on all doors. As many as one million Brazilians have immigrated to the United States, Japan and Europe since 1980. Most recently, they have turned to French Guiana.
"We used to be one big family here," Mayor Romain Garros of Saint Georges said. "Now we have more and more canoes going downriver with illegals."
Outside the town hall, Saint Georges looks like a French village transported to the Amazon. French taxpayers foot the bill.
 
A Soupcon of France
 In the oppressive humidity, France's blue, white and red flag hangs limply near a whitewashed obelisk honoring local men killed in World War I. On a far side of the central square, a supermarket sells pate and Camembert cheese imported from the "metropole."
On a road to the airport, a new hospital and high school attest to Government largess flowing from Paris. The only major convenience missing is a road to the Atlantic coast. Road construction has progressed slowly, largely because of French fears that the road will become a highway for Brazilian immigration.
In town, sun-faded posters from France's recent regional elections serve as reminders that French Guianese are full-fledged French citizens. Attracted by social benefits befitting a European Community nation, local nomadic Amazon Indians routinely cross the Oiapoque River from Brazil to register as French citizens.
At the local gendarmerie, a police officer complained about the difficulty of blocking Brazilian immigration.
 
A Growth Industry
 "For every 2 boats you catch, 10 get through," said the sergeant, outfitted in khaki shorts and shirt. "The Brazilians don't stop, and you can't shoot them."
Border tensions increased one night in April when a Brazilian team slipped into Saint Georges. Boarding the gendarmes' only river patrol boat, the Brazilians cut steering cables and stole the two outboard motors.
Oiapoque's locals admit that smuggling illegal workers into French territory has become a growth industry for Brazil's northernmost town near the Atlantic coast.
"It started two years ago with the Collor Government," Newton Torres da Silva, a former boat pilot, said. He was alluding to the recession, for which many blame Brazil's President, Fernando Collor de Mello.
 
Plastic Baggage
 Today, boat pilots shouting fares to "Franca" greet a bus that arrives daily from Macapa, a state capital 370 miles to the south.
Facing the river wharf is a line of tent restaurants selling cheap plates of beans and rice, and Oiapoque's largest rooming house, appropriately named Hotel de Transito. On a recent afternoon, one quayside merchant openly hawked "plastic bags for Cayenne."
"You have to keep your clothes and documents wrapped in plastic," counseled Mr. Bernardino, who recalled wading ashore at dawn on previous arrivals at Cayenne. Canoe pilots rarely beach their craft, fearing that the French police will seize their motors and cut up their boats with chainsaws.
Boat pilots, who charge about $30 a passenger, find they can pack as many as 50 people into one canoe, if they dispense with life jackets. The 125-mile journey to Cayenne entails negotiating open seas for five hours with a 40-horsepower engine. When boats capsize in the dark, passengers often drown.
"It's a risk," admitted Mr. Bernardino, who said he supported his wife and two children on earnings he sent home from Cayenne. "But it's a bigger risk to stay home and to try to survive on Brazil's starvation salaries."

HEADLINE: Man Kills Wife, 2 Others and Himself, Police Say

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
A man obsessed with the idea that his wife was having an affair killed himself last night, a day after he killed his wife and two other women in the Bronx, the police said.
The man, Jose Dolores Martinez, 41 years old, shot his wife and her niece to death in their Bronx apartment on Thursday night and then went to the home of his former girlfriend minutes later and stabbed her to death, the police said yesterday. 
 Last night, the police said Mr. Martinez, an unemployed gypsy-cab driver from the Dominican Republic, barricaded himself in an apartment in Manhattan, holding a woman and two children hostage. After an hourlong standoff with police officers, he released the hostages and then fatally shot himself, the police said.
The incident ended a search that began on Thursday night with the shooting deaths of Mr. Martinez's wife, Maria Altagracia, 40, and her niece, Moraima Rosario, 33, in their apartment at 38 Marcy Place, in Morrisania.
Lieut. James Malvey, the commanding officer of the 44th Precinct Detective Squad, said that Mr. Martinez then killed of his former girlfriend, Ana Rodriguez, 39, at 1060 Sherman Avenue, seven blocks away.
"What set him off, we don't know," Lieutenant Malvey said. "So far, there's no information from anyone we interviewed that his wife was having an affair."
Lieutenant Malvey said Mr. Martinez entered the apartment about 8 P.M., walked into the living room with a .357 Magnum revolver and pulled his wife into the bedroom, demanding to know the identity of her lover. When she denied having an affair, he went back to the living room, pointed his gun at Ms. Rosario and yanked her into the bedroom.
Mr. Martinez closed the bedroom door and shot both women in the head, Lieutenant Malvey said. When some of the children ran screaming into the hallway for help, Mr. Martinez jumped from the bedroom window and went to Ms. Rodriguez's home, the police said.
The police said Mr. Martinez demanded that Ms. Rodriguez tell him, in front of her two children, the identity of his wife's lover. He stabbed her repeatedly and left the apartment, the police said.
A police spokesman, Sgt. Norris L. Hollomon, said that Mr. Martinez appeared at an apartment at 514 West 176th Street about 9 P.M. last night and took a woman and two children, who were not identified, hostage.
Mr. Martinez released the hostages about 10:25 P.M., and when officers entered the apartment, they found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sergeant said. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Martinez knew the woman or children, he said.

 LEGISLATIVE SESSION ENDS IN DEADLOCK
The New York legislative session ended in partisan bickering, as lawmakers left town near dawn without acting on two major economic initiatives: an $800 million bond act to create jobs and fiscal bailouts for Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The Governor squared off against the Senate's Republicans, and the two measures remained hostage to one another. Page 1.
 
 THE LEGACY OF '92
The enduring legacy of the 1992 session of the New York State Legislature may be that lawmakers, for the first time in eight years, passed a budget almost on time. But though there was hope that the timely passage of the $56 billion budget would free the Legislature to address the state's most serious problems for three months, that hope dissolved in the final days of the session when more deals fell apart than came together.

HEADLINE: U.S. Puts Victorious Spin on Summit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
With President Bush due to leave this weekend for the economic summit meeting in Munich, the White House has begun a campaign to turn it into a pep rally for economic growth to demonstrate Mr. Bush's determination to do something about the sagging American economy.
Especially after the sharp jump in the nation's jobless rate announced Thursday, which was a blow to Mr. Bush's re-election hopes, the White House is eager to declare Munich a victory. 
 In effect, the White House is telling the people back home that the meetings were a diplomatic triumph, even before the leaders of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan gather on Monday.
At the same time, with President Bush slumping badly in public opinion polls, some American officials say the leaders at the summit meeting are deliberately pursuing a modest agenda that seeks to prevent any potentially embarrassing blow-ups among the leaders.
In briefings and statements this week before the summit, Administration officials have asserted that they have been trying for 18 months to persuade Japan and Germany to put more emphasis on economic growth. The officials said Tokyo and Bonn had finally agreed to measures that will promote growth.
 
'Modest Expectations'
 As evidence that the strategy has been successful, the Administration is citing a commitment by Japan's Government to spend an extra $45 billion next year on public works and other projects to spur its flagging growth. It is also citing measures by the German Government to hold down its budget deficit in the hope that this will enable the Central Bank to lower interest rates.
The Japanese and Germans insist that they are not taking these actions at Washington's bidding, but to restore health to their sagging economies.
While not taking credit for Tokyo's and Bonn's new policies, the Administration is publicizing them as if they were part of President Bush's economic growth package.
"These actions demonstrate forcefully the high priority which the summit places on strong global economic growth," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a news briefing this week.
Many officials say they doubt the United States will push hard to resolve the long dispute over farm subsidies that has blocked completion of talks to liberalize world trade. Many foreign policy experts say a breakthrough in the trade talks, which would be a boon for developing nations, is needed far more than a lofty-sounding communique to send a growth message to the world.
"The Administration is downplaying the summit and is trying to keep expectations quite modest," said Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state for economic affairs who is vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "There is good reason because the prospect of anything big coming out of Munich is not great."
 
No More Mr. No
 Some analysts say that after President Bush's last two embarrassing trips abroad -- the trade-promotion trip to Tokyo and his trip to the Earth Summit in Rio, where he was called Mr. No -- the last thing he needs on this trip, which will also take him to Poland, is a bruising fiasco over trade or any other subject.
It has been suggested that the leader attending the Munich summit who enjoys the most popularity at home is not a Group of Seven member but President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The Western leaders will meet with Mr. Yeltsin to discuss Moscow's progress on reforms and its need for aid, but some officials say that they doubt Mr. Yeltsin will go home with anything beyond the $24 billion package that the Group of Seven leaders promised him last April.
To show their concern for Russia, Bush Administration officials hope the International Monetary Fund will approve a $1 billion aid package for Russia before the summit. Not wanting to be embarrassed by any snags, however, American officials say that it will not be a tragedy if an agreement is not signed until after the summit if that is necessary to get Russia to commit to a good reform package.
Secretary Brady has signaled the leaders' desire to give Mr. Yeltsin a special gift, saying they want the industrial nations to take the rare move of restructuring Russia's debt burden even before Moscow signs a comprehensive reform agreement with the monetary fund.
President Bush told foreign journalists on Thursday that the Munich meeting was important because, by encouraging world growth, it could help increase American exports. He noted that 70 percent of American economic growth over the past five years has come from exports.

Japan's global trade surplus is soaring again to record levels, a development that could increase unemployment in other nations and contribute to a new round of trade tensions. It is also likely to be a main topic at the summit meeting of the seven leading industrial countries next week in Munich. [Page 1.]
Bush hopes to turn next week's economic summit meeting into a pep rally for economic growth, despite the sharp jump in the nation's jobless rate. [5.] 
 Japan's new high-definition television system is being re-evaluated because of a technological shift that may doom it to early obsolescence. [30.]
Spain's national airline, Iberia Lineas Aereas, is casting its lot overseas, namely to Latin America, hoping to avoid the nasty price wars expected to develop closer to home. [33.]
 
THE ECONOMY
Consumers in Reading, Pa., are still pinching pennies, a habit ingrained by the long recession. If conditions in Reading are representative, this consumer attitude implies a reshaping of retailing and raises questions about a recovery. [30.]
Bankers said they expected no spurt in borrowing and spending by businesses or consumers in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move on Thursday to cut interest rates, or in response to banks' own cut in the prime lending rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent. [33]
There was no bailout for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and no agreement on Cuomo's $800 million economic development act, as New York's state legislative session ended. [1.]
Leaders of Nassau and Suffolk huddled in separate emergency meetings today, each faced with bankruptcy, huge layoffs and property tax increases after the State Legislature adjourned. [24]
Bush strategists, surprised by the jump in unemployment, are reasssing their assumption that an improving economy will revive the President's political standing. [1.]
The Clean Air Act is under attack within the Bush Administration, where business interests often seem to outweigh environmental concerns. [1.]
Federal money will give summer jobs to 22,000 New York City youths in addition to 30,000 who began work on Monday. [21]
 
COMPANIES
A.T.& T. and its unions displayed common purpose in the tentative labor agreement announced this week. What both sides really feared was not each other, but an uncompetitive A.T.&T. in the global marketplace. [30.]
A plan by Olympia & York and its creditors to share general, administrative and restructuring costs was approved by an Ontario judge. The move should allow bankrupt Olympia to proceed with a more important task: its corporate restructuring plan. [32.]
A famed Kansas City barbecue house has plans for franchise restaurants and national distribution of its legendary sauce. [34.]
The oldest amusement park in America appears to be dead after years of financial struggle. [21]
Dutch Auctions, the second-largest U.S. auction house, draws bidders from England and Israel, Phoenix and Philadelphis. [25].
 
MARKETS
The dollar gained about half a pfennig against the mark in a holiday-shortened domestic trading session as the market was cautious ahead of next week's Group of Seven summit meeting. [34]
 
TODAY'S COLUMNS
"How can I get at the money in my 401(k) plan?" A surprising number of people well below retirement age have asked that question in recent weeks. Jan M. Rosen: Your Money. [32.]
Exotic special effects are available through a system that a small company has developed for television news shows. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents. [32.]

HEADLINE: Munich Cleans Up the Castle To Welcome World Leaders

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 2

 BODY:
The regal palace that was the seat of Bavaria's monarchy for nearly five centuries is covered with scaffolding this week. The elaborately carved clock on the front of City Hall is being oiled. And some residents are cleaning their lederhosen and feathered hats so they can look their best for world leaders who arrive Monday.
By the time the so-called Group of Seven summit meeting opens, Munich will be glistening even more brightly than usual, and Bavarians are preparing to show off their fairyland state to an unusually distinguished group of visitors. 
 Both previous meetings of the seven leading industrialized democracies held in Germany were in Bonn. But this time Chancellor Helmut Kohl decided that Munich, with its castles and world-class beer drinkers, would be a more exciting place for him to welcome the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the United States. In addition, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia will join the Group of Seven leaders in Munich.
Daily sessions of the conference will be held at the palace of Wittelsbach, the ancestral home of the dynasty that ruled Bavaria from the late 12th century until the end of World War I. Construction of the palace complex began in the 14th century, and it boasts seven courtyards and a dazzling collection of artworks including jeweled crucifixes and a gold panel from 1590 depicting St. George slaying the dragon.
Among the formal events scheduled during the summit meeting is a dinner at Nymphenburg, a rococo chateau set amid elaborate gardens in an outlying section of Munich that was a summer residence for Bavarian rulers.
 
U.S. Delegation Is Largest
 According to official estimates, there will be 1,800 official participants in the meeting, along with nearly 6,000 accredited journalists and an estimated 4,000 protesters attending what is billed as an "Anti-Summit."
The largest delegation by far, reportedly totaling more than 700 and more than twice the size of any other nation, is being brought by President Bush, who is also the only leader bringing his own limousine.
The hotel suite where Mr. Bush will stay has been renovated at a cost of $300,000. Among the additions were a marble bathtub and a library.
The costs of staging the meeting is estimated at $21 million, of which three-quarters is being paid by the German Government and the rest by Bavaria.
 
9,000 Police on Duty
 But because of the tight security to be imposed on the city for the event, some people fear that the investment will yield little, if anything, for the local economy. The Bavarian share, according to one disgruntled legislator, would be enough to build 50 housing units or a kindergarten for 200 children.
Nine thousand police officers, 3,500 from local police forces and the rest from other parts of Germany, will be on duty here. Police planners say they are hoping to keep security as unobtrusive as possible, but concede that armed officers will be standing on every corner, prowling in every park, scanning the city from dozens of rooftops, and monitoring the proceedings from helicopters. Special units will be posted along highways and rail lines leading into the city.
But few people here can fault the authorities for taking security seriously. In the minds of many, Munich is still linked with the Palestinian terrorist attack at the Olympic Games here 20 years ago in which Israeli athletes were taken hostage. The attack horrified the world and ultimately cost 17 lives.
"For the situation of 20 years ago to repeat itself is completely unimaginable," said Walter Renner, a policeman who was at the 1972 Olympics. "At that time, we had no preparation or training in antiterrorist tactics. The whole idea was foreign to us. We were practically helpless. Things are very different today."
To assure that the visitors can move easily through the city, most downtown streets will be closed, and parking throughout the "security zone" will be banned. These plans have irritated residents, and struck fear into the hearts of merchants.
"No one is going to come downtown for three days," worried Franz Hermann, manager of a shop that sells porcelain beer mugs and other Bavarian curios. "There will be nowhere to park, and probably nowhere to walk without bumping into police. It will definitely be bad for business."

HEADLINE: A Series of Visits to Reading, Pa.

DATELINE: READING, Pa., June 27

 BODY:
Since late 1990, in the early stages of America's ninth postwar recession, The New York Times has been visiting Reading and surrounding Berks County periodically to gauge economic conditions. The area's mix of retailing, manufacturing and services is typical of the Northeast.
The articles, appearing at intervals of roughly three months and consisting of interviews with shoppers, business people and workers, seek to portray the current activity and mood, thereby providing a glimpse of the future. 
 The first, 18 months ago, found Reading gripped in malaise and braced for a recession that was not officially designated as such until the following April -- and that is still not officially ended. The second article found this city of row houses and blue collars mired in recession's reality.
In April 1991, The Times focused on the Glen-Gery Corporation, a major brick producer that appeared on the verge of signaling a recovery that proved elusive for it and the economy at large. In June of last year, people here were anticipating recovery by Labor Day; but as school started people here said they still did not see much improvement.
This past February found optimism rising -- and the return of some shoppers -- but a continued wariness that kept spending subdued.

HEADLINE: Tales of the Tightfisted Consumer

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., June 27

 BODY:
Though some might call it false economy, considering the value of time and gasoline, Linda Startzel was intent all the same on driving 20 miles round trip to buy a picnic cooler at Reading's spanking new 114,000-square-foot Wal-Mart out on Perkiomen Avenue.
Indeed, it was with a certain satisfaction that she emerged from the discount colossus, having spent just $14.88 for an item that had been marked $17.97 at a Kmart -- no slouch at price-cutting itself -- near her home in Pottstown. 
 Mrs. Startzel, who with her husband usually spends a week each year vacationing in Cancun, Mexico, is not by nature a skinflint. It's just that the Startzels are trying to save some money, since they feel none too secure about their jobs. Both work at Bell Atlantic and face the possibility of a strike this summer.
To the dismay of merchants, there seem to be all too many Startzels around these days. "People are value conscious, looking for basic value rather than frills," said Edwin Lakin, president of Boscov's, a medium-sized regional department-store chain that has its headquarters and three stores here.
 
Questions About Recovery
 This "don't spend more than you must" attitude threatens not only merchants in Reading and surrounding Berks County, where The New York Times has taken seven soundings of business conditions over the last 18 months. It implies a reshaping of American retailing and raises questions about the nation's economic recovery. While consumers do not usually initiate recoveries, consumer spending -- representing two-thirds of the nation's economy -- has traditionally fueled recoveries. But this recession, if Reading is any indication, has trained consumers to pinch their pennies.
This reluctance to spend also tends to be a strong antidote to inflation. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Bank in New York, finds consumers these days nothing less than "defiant" about price increases, which during the recession they have learned can often be resisted successfully.
"With job security increasingly problematic and income growth slowing, cost-conscious consumers are embracing retailing discounters with unabashed enthusiasm," Mr. Kellner said, noting that discounters now account for more than 40 percent of general merchandise business and one-third of apparel sales.
Discounters probably do not pose a severe threat to retailers like Boscov's. The chain is said to enjoy a loyal following of well-served, middle-income customers, and after a flat period earlier in the year it reported a May-June sales pickup to levels about 5 percent above those of a year earlier. But traditional stores like Boscov's are finding that the range of goods in which they can be competitive is narrowing.
Increasingly, according to Joseph B. Siegel, a merchandising specialist and vice president of the National Retail Federation, department stores are being limited to apparel and related "soft" goods while ceding the mass-produced "hard goods" like snow blowers and tennis balls to the discounters.
"They've got to hurt some businesses there," Mr. Siegel said when asked about the effect on Reading of two recently opened Wal-Marts and a Sam's Club, a Wal-Mart affiliate. While "moderate" and "better" consumers, to use the industry's classifications, will not start buying clothes at a discounter, they very well may join "budget" and "bargain" customers buying picnic coolers and antifreeze there.
Talk to almost any business person hereabouts and tales of thrifty or cautious customers come pouring out. Take, for example, Mike Zdunowski, who owns both a sizable tire dealership and a local beer distributor and who sees "no inkling" of economic recovery.
"This is the most discouraging June we've had in 10 years," he said in his gritty garage on South Ninth Street, with sales 20 percent below those of June 1991, a comparison far worse than May's. Mr. Zdunowski, who is fixing more flats and selling more used tires these days, manages a wry smile when reminded that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady spoke in February about tires being a good economic indicator and seeing "robins on the lawn" that he said portended recovery.
 
Getting the Last Mile
 "People are trying to get the last mile" out of their tires, which over the years have become a big-ticket item, Mr. Zdunowski added. "That's how people cope."
As for the beer business, consumers are drinking just as much as ever but are presumably enjoying it less since they have switched to cheaper brands, shunning imports. "People are shopping price with beer,' Mr. Zdunowski says, shaking his head as if he could never have imagined such a situation, which he says is partly because of the Federal tax increase at the beginning of 1991 that forced his prices up $1.75 a case. Profits, he says, have shrunk by half.
Or talk to Daniel L. Schmehl Jr., proprietor of the Iron Horse Hobby House, a downtown fixture since 1938, which traditionally has flourished in recessions but which has suffered a steady decline in its hobby business since February.
"They're just not spending the money on anything," Mr. Schmehl said of his absent customers, adding that the neighboring hairdresser was also hurting and that the art-supply house across the street was conducting the first sale -- up to 70 percent off -- he could remember.
At Gilbert's furniture store on Penn Street, Ronald K. Buckley, the vice president, repeats the theme that "people are buying value," noting that sales these days are by the piece or possibly by the room but rarely for a whole house.
 
Incentive Went Well
 He is somewhat encouraged, however, that customers responded well to a special incentive running from Memorial Day to July 4 under which purchases on credit accrue no interest charges for six months. Those paying cash for their furniture, meanwhile, have received a 5 percent discount.
"People want to be given a reason why they should buy now," Mr. Buckley said.
And Gilbert's itself is a cautious consumer, as shown by its recent decision to reject a financing package from an out-of-town bank that would have allowed the store to move to a new site in the suburbs before it sold its current building. A suburban location would probably attract more shoppers, but Gilbert's is not optimistic that it can sell its present site quickly in the current market. "Just too risky," Mr. Buckley concluded.
The current tightfistedness among consumers is also evident among major manufacturers. A prime example is Carpenter Technology, a specialty steel company with $600 million in annual sales that announced the elimination of 130 white-collar jobs this spring in a restructuring intended to reap the benefits of heavy investment in computerization.
Carpenter, according to Paul R. Roedel, who is retiring as president, is suffering a squeeze on profit margins at a time when its overall business is flat because of soft sales of components for oilfield equipment and for jet engines.
Factories in the area report generally "spotty" business, said Donald Mattern, executive director of the 311-member Manufacturers Association of Berks County. "Most of them are just tightening their belt," he said, except for the East Penn Manufacturing Company, which has added workers to help fulfill a big new battery contract for the Army.
At the Meridian Bank, which as the area's dominant financial institution has probably the best view of local conditions, soberness is tinged with optimism.
"Loan demand is just absolutely flat," said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, the president, but the charge-off of bad loans has peaked and automobile sales have perked up a bit, he added.

HEADLINE: Life in a Trailer Park: On the Edge, but Hoping

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo.

 BODY:
Inside a narrow house trailer, where the heat works sometimes and the telephone never does, a fierce Wyoming wind slams against the aluminum walls, rattling the family pictures and everything else that hangs by a hook.
Rising from a threadbare sofa, Molly Prosinski cradles 2-year-old April in one arm, wipes a smudge from the face of 5-year-old Aaron and debates the merits of homework with Crystal, 12, all the while checking the macaroni on the stove. 
 But the most difficult part comes a moment later. Crystal raises her large brown eyes toward her mother and asks, as she has so many times before: "Mom, why do we have to live in a trailer?"
Mobile homes were the fastest-growing type of dwelling in the 1980's, according to the Census Bureau, as the cost of traditional houses soared beyond the reach of many. Although sales slowed in recent years, nearly 16 million Americans, about 1 in 16, now live in mobile homes.
Nearly half the new mobile homes being sold are the more expensive "double-wide" models, with two sections bolted together to achieve the size and look of a house. The most expensive of these models can cost $100,000.
But far more live in used trailers that cost $10,000 or less. In rural America, where the trailer park is most common, it is still often regarded, if not as a symbol of poverty, then just one rung above it.
Crystal and the other children from the trailer park where she lives make up most of the student body at the new brick elementary school next door. When they graduate to high school, where most of the students live in houses, they sometimes fear hurtful comments about "trailer trash."
Mrs. Prosinski, 28, whose husband, Scott, 27, earns about $12,000 a year from his job as a dishwasher, urged her daughter to be grateful for what they have: a 14-by-70-foot home that rents for $350 a month, part of it paid to the trailer's owner, part "lot rent" paid to the trailer park.
"Remember that last trailer?" Mrs. Prosinski said. "The one with all the mice crawling up the heat vents?"
After her daughter left the room, Mrs. Prosinski gazed out the window toward the harsh, scrub grass plains beyond the trailer court.
"There are times," she said, "when I just want to sit down and cry."
 
Their Little Sliver Of America's Dream
 Since mobile homes flourished in the 1960's, the American trailer park has become a metaphor for struggle at the edges -- the edge of town, the edge of the middle class, the edge of adversity. Half the people who live in mobile homes have incomes of less than $20,000 a year, and more than three-fourths earn less than $30,000 annually.
These are people who grasp at the American dream but who can clutch only a fragment: a tiny yard, but no basement, a parking pad, but no garage.
But for those who own their mobile homes, they have something, however modest -- and certain to depreciate -- on the asset side of the ledger.
For some, the trailer park is a way station, where newlyweds and recent college graduates save for the house they cannot afford at the moment. For others, who barely hang on, the mobile home is simply the cheapest shelter they can find. The average age of a mobile home resident is 50, and nearly 35 percent are 60 or older.
This trailer park of 200 mobile homes, Big Country Estates, lies at the south end of town, where gas stations and fast-food restaurants give way to empty countryside.
The trailers are spaced so closely that people here joke that they can look out the window and see what the neighbors are having for dinner. And arguments must be conducted in low tones, or everyone in the neighborhood will hear it.
The bigger, fancier mobile homes, which are valued about $20,000, sit near the highway, a way of advertisement for the trailer park. The smaller, often weather-beaten trailers, worth $5,000 or less, sit farther back, obscured from the road. Some of the narrow strips of ground between the trailers are bright with grass and flowers; other have gone to dust and weeds.
 
Pride by a Highway: 'We Own That'

Standing in front of an old, yellow trailer, Dale Curl, 31, crouched to pull a fistful of weeds from his yard. "This is going to be beautiful before you know it," he said with a smile.
A loud car, badly in need of a muffler, roared by and muffled his words. But nothing could dampen his joy.
For the first time in their lives, Mr. Curl and his wife, Kim, 25, own a home. Last month they bought trailer No. 5.
"It feels so good to be able to say, 'We own that,' " he said.
Mr. Curl works for a catalogue wholesaler. Mrs. Curl is a bakery shop clerk. They earned $22,000 last year. They and their two children had been renting the trailer next door, No. 4.
The payments for their own trailer, which they took over from the previous owner, will be $265 a month, along with $150 for the lot rent. In five years the 12-by-64-foot trailer will be paid off.
"I feel like having a housewarming party," said Mrs. Curl.
Mobile homes are built on assembly lines in factories around the country and shipped on trucks with "Wide Load" signs. The industry prefers to call them Manufactured Housing rather than mobile homes, since they are rarely moved afterwards.
Most people who live in them call them trailers. Trailers are most commonly found in rural areas of the South and West. Wyoming, the most sparsely populated state, ranks only after South Carolina in the percentage of people who live in mobile homes; in both states about 1 in 6 housing units is a mobile home or trailer.
Zoning codes in some areas discourage the presence of mobile homes. But 22 states have outlawed such codes, saying they are discriminatory.
"There is still a stigma," said Bruce Savage, a spokesman for the Manufactured Housing Institute, a trade group. "Some people still think of them as places for poor, undesirable characters."
In a 1991 report on ways to encourage affordable housing, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, called on states to remove barriers to mobile homes.
While some mobile homes sit on private land, the vast majority are in trailer parks. About 170,000 new mobile homes were sold last year, down from 295,000 in 1983, when the energy boom brought jobs and a surge in demand for housing to the Sun Belt. The bad times that followed there and the national economic slump in the late 1980's dampened demand for mobile homes as well as for other new housing. About 700,000 single family homes were built last year, the lowest number since 1946.
 
 
Widow Adds Color To Neighbors' Lives
 With one hand flashing on the piano keyboard and the other hand on the organ, 69-year-old Winona Barnes delights the children in the trailer park who come around to hear her music.
One recent day she played "I'm Flying High, but I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling."
She and her husband, Lowell, bought their 14-by-72-foot trailer in 1980. They paid $14,000 and hoped to move it to the countryside someday.
"But money was tight," she said, "and it never quite happened."
Mrs. Barnes, now a widow living on Social Security, said she could no longer afford to move. Like most mobile homes, her place has lost value over the years. She thinks it is now worth about $4,500.
Almost every day she drives her 1980 Thunderbird to the nearby Veterans of the Foreign War post, where she rolls the dice. It costs a dollar for a chance to win $300.
Besides gambling and music, she said with a wink, her greatest passion is flowers. Last year, Mrs. Barnes won the award for the most colorful yard in the park. She won $35 and promptly invested her gain in more petunias and geraniums for her tiny plot.
When her husband was alive, he would rest in the easy chair as she played music long into the night. "I'd see him fast asleep," she said. "But when I would quit, he would wake right up and say, 'Why did you quit?' "
After he died, Mrs. Barnes, whose kitchen wall has a plate that says, "Happiness is meant to be shared," did not play her music for a very long time. But the children finally coaxed her back to the keyboard.
 
Costs Can Be High In Fees and Safety
 Though mobile homes offer the semblance of a house, they provide less protection from inflation or the elements. Banks treat them like a car and value them less as they grow older. And because mobile homes without land are financed as personal property, buyers pay interest rates of 13 or 14 percent, rather than about 9 percent for conventional home mortgages.
People sometimes become angry that they cannot get the lower loan rate, said Rob Mossey, a loan officer at the Norwest Bank in Cheyenne.
"We have to tell them, flat out, 'Look, your mobile home is not going to be worth much down the road,' " he said.
Insurance rates, too, are usually 10 to 20 percent higher than for traditional homes, Mr. Mossey said, because mobile homes are more vulnerable to high winds, hailstorm and fire.
Thanks to Federal safety requirements imposed in 1974, mobile homes are less likely to experience a fire than standard homes, said Alan D. Miller, a spokesman for State Farm Insurance. "But when they have a fire, they're much more likely to result in total loss," he said. While the rate of fire fatalities is 7 per thousand in houses, it is 17 per thousand in mobile homes. The extra deadliness is probably because the dense packing on mobile homes give fire quicker and more violent combustion, fire experts say.
 
Plans to Escape Fire And the Trailer Life
 Fire drills are standard practice in the Darlow home, a double-wide trailer that the family of six rents for $425 a month.
"The kids are all assigned windows for escape," said Lany Darlow, whose parents' mobile home in Texas caught fire and burned in about three minutes.
If a tornado threatens, the family plans to rush to the nearby elementary school, because the trailer park has no underground shelter. Strong winds pose a particular danger. No national statistics are kept on trailers and tornadoes, but last year in Kansas a tornado killed 14 people at a mobile home community.
Someday soon, the Darlows hope to move from the trailer. Daniel Darlow, 38, a former Coast Guard gunner, graduated from law school in Laramie last fall. He has been a substitute teacher at an elementary school, where he earns $25 for a half-day, $50 for a full day. He is also studying for his bar exams. On his first try he failed the exam by five points.
Mr. Darlow served in the Coast Guard for 10 years. If he had stayed he would be nearing retirement. As the pressure builds for his next test, he said, he sometimes regrets his decision to leave the military.
If he passes and gets a job, the family will start packing to move "that very day," Mrs. Darlow said.
But with a worried look, Mr. Darlow added: "If I fail, well, we might be here awhile."

HEADLINE: Technology Shift Blurs Future of Japan's New TV System

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
A shift in technology is causing a quiet re-evaluation of Japan's new system for providing the next generation of television. Some experts here wonder whether its high-definition system, once the envy of the world, is now doomed to early obsolescence.
The Japanese do not admit that their system, just starting to reach the market, appears to have been eclipsed by technology developed in the last two years in the United States. 
 Still, the Government and industry are following the United States into computer-like digital transmission, which can offer sharper pictures and has other advantages over the older analog transmission used for Japanese high-definition television. They are also considering a project to develop a super-high-definition system that would leapfrog everything available today.
"It's a very delicate time in Japan," said Shigeo Tsujii, a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology who serves on a Government advisory committee on digital imaging.
 
'Consensus' Is Digital
 That the future belongs to digital television is "the substantial consensus of the world, including Japan," said Hiroshi Fujiwara, senior vice president of GC Technology Corporation, a small maker of computer chips used to transmit video images by telephone. "But officially, nobody can tell you the future is going to digital because we Japanese spent much money to develop analog HDTV."
Indeed, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, which led the development of the country's HDTV system, is sticking with its technology. And Japan's television manufacturers are not breaking ranks with NHK, as the public broadcasting company is known. To overcome the high prices and lack of programming that have dampened interest in HDTV, manufacturers are introducing lower-priced sets and hoping the Barcelona Olympics, which begin July 25, will spur demand.
Even so, they foresee a day when digital technology replaces their analog system, which is known as Muse.
"Japan will give up on Muse, but I don't know when," said Tomofumi Yasunari, a key official on telecommunications policy in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. "I think the lifetime will be 10 years, but sometimes we think it will continue only five years."
Others say it will take far longer for a digital system to supplant Muse.
"For several decades, Muse is the sole candidate for HDTV for broadcasting," said Shinichi Makino, technology executive for high-definition systems at the Toshiba Corporation.
A crucial decision is likely to come in about a year when a committee recommends how to allocate channels on a new broadcast satellite scheduled to begin service in 1997. Several channels on that satellite were to be allocated to HDTV to let programming expand, but the whole question of what to use the satellite for is being re-examined.
 
Earlier Setbak
 Early obsolescence would be the second big blow to Japan's efforts in high-definition television, which provides pictures twice as sharp as conventional TV. A few years ago, Japan was far ahead in developing the technology and hoped to make Muse a world standard. But the European Community, followed by the United States, balked at accepting the system, worried that it would let Japanese electronics companies become too strong. As a result, it appears that the three major economic regions will have separate, incompatible systems, with Muse confined to Japan.
Now Japan is being hit by a change in technology. Digital technology, which transmits images using the zeros and ones of computer code, could allow for clearer, cleaner images, just as digital compact disks offer music free of the hisses and distortions of analog records. Digital technology also makes it easier for video images to be manipulated by computers -- letting a viewer zoom in on part of a picture or store a television image on a computer disk.
To some extent, NHK's choice of analog technology for high-definition television was inescapable because its development efforts began 20 years ago, when digital technology was not available. As recently as three years ago most engineers were saying that digital transmission would not be feasible for at least another decade.
But in the last two years, American companies like General Instrument and Zenith Electronics have demonstrated prototype digital systems, and the Federal Communications Commission is expected to choose one as the United States standard in 1993. Some industry officials say competition in the United States spurred faster development than did the more centralized approach in Japan.
But officials of NHK and some manufacturers contend that the digital systems developed in the United States are still not fully proved and will probably take longer to perfect than the American companies hope.
Mr. Makino of Toshiba said that while digital systems can provide a crisp picture in the face of moderate electromagnetic interference, if the interference becomes too great -- as it might in a big city -- then the digital system fails completely. American companies have not fully demonstrated that they can overcome that problem, he said.
Moreover, in terms of picture resolution, the American systems, those officials say, offer no improvement over the Muse system and there is no reason to change to digital now merely because Americans have done so.
"It will take at least until the end of this century" for digital transmission to be feasible, said Shuichi Morikawa, a managing director at NHK Laboratories. "We cannot stop the service at this moment and say, 'We're going to digital in the 21st century.' If we stop the furnace it will take time to heat it up again."
The unspoken dilemma is that if Japanese industry and programmers think the Muse system will be eclipsed by a digital system in a decade, they might be reluctant to put much effort into developing equipment and programming for Muse now. And consumers might be reluctant to invest in Muse-system television sets and VCR's.
Until recently, high-definition television sets cost about $30,000; the only way ordinary consumers could watch "Hi-Vision" was in a department store or other public viewing place.
Lack of programming is another reason HDTV is struggling to get off the ground. There is only one HDTV channel, with about eight hours of programming a day. Making such programs is about three times as expensive as making a conventional program, an NHK spokesman said.
But NHK and manufacturers hope that the summer Olympics will spur interest in high-definition television, just as the 1964 Tokyo Olympics gave the first big spurt to sales of color televisions here. During the Olympics, all eight hours of high-definition broadcasting will be devoted to Barcelona, and the number of public HDTV viewing places will be increased to 300, from 100.
 
'Affordable' Sets Available
 In addition, several manufacturers, taking advantage of new microchip technology, have come out with high-definition sets that sell for about $10,000 and are thus "affordable," at least in the sense that a car is affordable.
Sony Corporation, for instance, sold only 400 of its more expensive first-generation HDTV sets. But it is installing capacity to make 3,000 of its new $10,000 sets -- introduced at a news conference recently by Sony's president, Norio Ohga -- each month. To combat the dearth of programming, Sony also announced that it planned to produce high-definition programming on video disk.
At the same time, Japanese companies are brushing up on digital television, if only to be able to make television sets and other equipment for the American market.
Sony, Matsushita, Hitachi and Toshiba have all started research laboratories in the United States working on advanced television. Toshiba recently said it would make a digital videocassette recorder compatible with the digital HDTV system developed by General Instrument. Industry executives say that the fact that the United States has developed its own high-definition broadcasting system is no guarantee that American companies will make the television sets and broadcasting equipment.
NHK is also working on several types of digital transmission technology. And the Japanese Government is laying plans for an ambitious digital imaging project.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has set up a digital video technology committee that is expected to make recommendations on what Japan should do in digital television. The committee is expected to recommend that efforts be made to develop a super-high-definition digital system for the next century. Such a system, which some are calling ultra-definition television, would be able to transmit images with 2,000 or even 3,000 lines of resolution, compared with 1,125 for Muse and 525 for conventional television.
Kazuhiko Nishi, a personal computer entrepreneur who heads the ASCII Corporation, a software company, has proposed setting up an organization called Digital Movies Laboratory to develop such technology. Key roles in the proposed seven-year effort would be played by ASCII, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's main phone company, and by a subsidiary of NHK, Mr. Nishi said.

HEADLINE: Malawi Merits Not One Penny From U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Malawi Needs Assistance and Sympathy" (letter, June 6) by N. W. Mwaungulu, Malawi's United Nations representative, is a feeble effort at obfuscation criticizing a May 22 editorial. Malawi has not been denied aid from many quarters because it embraced "a free market path to development." Rather, its outcast status resulted from its being the sole country in Africa to recognize and support the apartheid regime of South Africa. 
 There certainly has not been a "considerable improvement in the quality of life of the people," and Malawi remains the world's seventh poorest country. The assertion about "the nonexistence of enmity between the Roman Catholic Church and the state" is astonishing. On March 8 the church's seven bishops issued a pastoral letter criticizing the "growing gap between rich and poor" in Malawi and noting that "academic freedom is seriously restricted; exposing injustices can be considered a betrayal; monopoly of mass media and censorship prevent the expression of dissenting views."
Possession of the pastoral letter was immediately declared a crime, for which many were arrested. On March 10 all the bishops were arrested by the police and held for eight hours. The country's cabinet reportedly urged that they be executed. The bishop of Mzuzu was subsequently deported. In a speech on the overall situation, President H. Kamazu Banda warned that any dissenters would be "food for crocodiles."
Should American taxpayers subsidize a government that survives by political repression and generalized thuggery to such an extent that it is widely known as the "Albania of Africa"? Many African countries -- such as Malawi's neighbor Zambia -- are genuinely committed to multiparty democracy and a free market system, and merit whatever support the United States can give. Malawi merits no such support, and the aid cutoff that has begun should continue.
Thirty years of President Banda's regime have not solved the country's terrible economic problems, and it is clear that the nonagenarian dictator has no idea how to proceed.
While Malawians have been among Africa's best educated people, for the last 30 years to be educated is a curse. Teachers have been jailed for teaching, poets for writing poetry, journalists for producing journalism. Any thought not approved by President Banda and his clique has been forbidden, and a censorship board does its work assiduously. Foreign journalists are also explicitly forbidden to enter the country.
Not a penny of American aid should be sent to Malawi until freedom of thought, freedom of discussion and freedom of the press are established there.

HEADLINE: Rate Cuts Won't Start Big Spree, Banks Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bankers said yesterday that they expected no spurt in borrowing and spending by businesses or consumers in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move on Thursday to cut interest rates, or their own cut in the prime lending rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent.
"It has got to help a little, but I don't think businesses were holding back their borrowing just because they would have had to pay 6.5 percent or 7 percent instead of 6 percent," said Richard M. Kovacevich, president of the Norwest Corporation, a Minneapolis-based banking company. "What they really want to see is a full order book." 
 Bankers and economists say the key to increased hiring and investment in expansion is business confidence that consumer demand, the bedrock of the economy, is on a stable growth path.
For consumers, the interest rate cut is a mixed bag. Lower rates on bank deposits and other investments hurt savers, but are a boon to those buying a home, or have a mortgage with an adjustable rate.
 
Disappointing to Savers
 "Lower interest rates are disappointing to a large number of people, the savers, but beneficial to a smaller number of borrowers," noted George W. Hamlin, chairman of the Canandaigua National Bank and Trust Company in New York.
But the difference between the rates paid on deposits and the rates earned on loans and investments is the lifeblood of the banking system, and so long as rates are falling on loans and investments, analysts expect banks to be reducing rates paid on deposits. "If you understand that a banker's first duty is to remain in business, then you understand why deposit rates have been falling," Mr. Hamlin said.
Robert Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, North Palm Beach, Fla., estimated that average rates on bank certificates of deposit would fall about two-tenths of a percentage point in a few months. One-year deposits, for example, might fall to a national average of 3.80 percent, from 4.03 percent before the Fed's move, he said, while bank money market accounts may drop to 3.15 percent from 3.34 percent.
 
What Consumers Won't Get
 For some kinds of loans, however, consumers should not expect any change. Interest rates on most credit cards, for example, remain above 18 percent, despite a flurry of announcements by banks in recent months about lower interest rates for their best customers.
Still, about a third of all credit cards carry floating interest rates pegged to the prime rate and will fall in coming months. Similarly, interest rates will be falling on most of the more than $70 billion of home-equity loans at banks because they are linked to the prime.
While consumers and businesses may be slow to return to the spending and borrowing habits of the 1980's, bankers said the Fed's move was in the right direction.
Activity in the housing market, the part of the economy most sensitive to changes in interest rates, will benefit from lower rates. Rates on home mortgages fell Thursday, matching the falling yields on Treasury bonds, which are a benchmark for mortgage rates. Specialists in the mortgage market said they expected rates on long-term, fixed-rate mortgages will soon match the lows set in January of about 8.3 percent. The average rate last week was just under 8.5 percent.
Mr. Kovacevich, who said the Fed's moves had been too little, too late, acknowledged that the cumulative effect of past rate reductions had begun to bear fruit in the last few months. "We are starting to see some increase in lending, not the 5 or 7 percent we would like but still a lot better than the declines of the past few years."
 
No Upturn Perceived Yet
 In other parts of the country where the local economy is not so healthy as in Minnesota, bankers said the decline in business borrowing in the last two years appeared to be ending, but that there was not any strong upturn yet.
Even in New England, where complaints about tough bank examiners causing bankers to cut back on lending were widespread last year, some analysts see improvement. Richard Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, noted last week that the region's economy was picking up, and with it, the health of local banks and their willingness to make new loans.
"It takes people a while to be convinced that the improvement is real, but each time there is another easing in interest rates it is one more affirmation that the environment is improving," said Newton Merrill, executive vice president in charge of business lending at the Bank of Boston.
While large corporate customers are still repaying bank loans with money raised in the stock or bond markets, he said loan demand from other companies has improved enough that loans at the bank are no longer declining as they were in 1990 and 1991. "We certainly have the capacity to lend more, but the customers have to become more confident about the future," Mr. Merrill said.
Because interest rates have fallen so low, some bankers wondered whether they would be able to pass on lower rates to their depositors. "With savings accounts in St. Louis at 3 percent to 3.5 percent, we are already at a level where it is psychologically difficult to go lower," said Phillip E. Peters, executive vice president at Boatmen's Bancshares, a St. Louis-based banking company.
To preserve ties with consumers who are dismayed at the low rates available on deposits, Mr. Peters and many other banks have been training staff and hiring outside companies to sell securities, particularly mutual funds.
One thing bankers say they are not doing is cutting lending standards in order to gain business. The memory of heavy loan losses in the last two years is still recent enough that they are preferring to stick with low-profit investments in Treasury securities rather than take a chance on a risky borrower who would pay a higher interest rate.
 
Somewhat Tougher Standards
 "Standards are a little tougher, but I don't think that has discouraged borrowers as much as the generally weak economic outlook," said Carlos E. Evans, an executive vice president in charge of lending for small and medium-sized companies at Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C. Nationsbank has more invested in government securities than any other bank in the country, and is eager to replace those securities with loans to consumers or medium-sized businesses.
Noting some recent improvement in the economy, Mr. Evans said, "We have a noticeable increase in the number of customers talking with us about loans, though those talks have not yet led to increased lending."

HEADLINE: ...and Worry India in Strike Over Hefty Trucking Tariffs

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 3

 BODY:
Still struggling to invigorate and recast its old socialist economy, India has been hit with a trucking strike that threatens to bring virtually all commerce in this land of 843 million people to a halt.
India's 1.5 million trucks have been parked in truck stops, gas stations, fields and garages as their owners demand an end to arbitrary road taxes, transport fees and police extortion. 
 Already, on the third day of the strike, prices for vegetables, fruit and milk have soared, and the first signs of shortages are beginning to appear in markets in major cities, including here in the nation's capital. Industrial supplies for factories have been disrupted and fuel deliveries to gas stations have stopped. Sporadic panic buying was reported at some food markets in Delhi and in other cities.
 
Two-Thirds by Truck
 Nearly two-thirds of India's goods are transported by the brightly colored Tata brand trucks that hurtle along the country's narrow blacktop roads. A prolonged strike would seriously affect food supplies for India's cities and deal a sharp blow to the country's already fragile manufacturing base. Exports, which have been increasing slightly this year and are desperately needed to enhance the country's foreign exchange reserves, would also be hurt by a lengthy walkout.
After ignoring the work stoppage for the first two days, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao today ordered all state transport ministers to the capital to try to resolve the work stoppage.
Chittranjan Dass, the secretary general of the All India Motor Transport Congress, an association that represents the truck owners, said he was prepared for a long strike.
"In the history of road transport, there has never been an all-India strike," he said as he sat in his chaotic office in Old Delhi. "The response I get from every part of the country is that unless they meet our demands, they will keep their trucks off the road. We have to be prepared for a long, drawn-out strike."
Chief among the truckers' grievances are the levying of tolls, tariffs and transport charges by states and localities. India, unlike the United States, has no ban on the imposition of local fees on interstate trade. Even at the borders of New Delhi, a territory under the authority of the central Government, fees are collected from truckers wishing to enter the city, a fee known as the octroi.
"We are losing on every trip," Mr. Dass said between shouts into his constantly ringing phone.
 At times, the line of trucks at the octroi checkpoints into New Delhi stretch for a half a mile as drivers wait to pay the fees necessary to deliver their goods to the capital. Today, the city's perimeter was sprinkled with thousands of idle trucks, their drivers sitting in small groups playing cards, sleeping, sipping tea.
Sugdev Singh, a burly, bearded man with an unruly plaid turban, lay under his truck reading a thick novel titled "The Goonda in Uniform," a Hindi potboiler about police officers who behave like criminals.
"The police always trouble us," he said. "They are always charging us more than the road tax. Sometimes they charge 50 rupees," about $1.80, "or 100 rupees. Sometimes more."
Another driver, Balwinder Singh, interrupted. "What do you mean?" he asked. "The police take 150 or 200 rupees."
The first Mr. Singh shrugged. "Just to cross into Delhi costs 500 rupees," he went on. "That is for toll tax and checking. The police shouldn't charge us money."
Late this evening, the Prime Minister's office announced that the octroi to enter Delhi was being abolished, an act intended "to give a lead to the states to take similar steps," according to the Press Trust of India.
India is in the middle of a wrenching transition from a centrally controlled socialist economy to one governed by market forces. Aided by substantial lending from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank over the last year, the country has made some progress in reorienting its economy, but it has yet to show significant signs of recovery.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Obtaining Money From 401(k) Plans

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
"HOW can I get at the money in my 401(k) plan?" A surprising number of people well below retirement age have asked that question in recent weeks, according to Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, a New York-based certified public accounting firm.
The first response is a question, he said. "Why do you need the money?" So is the second, "Do you have any other source of funds?" 
 That is because under I.R.S. regulations, withdrawals are limited to specified hardships. A 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored, tax-deferred retirement savings plan, and once money is taken out, income taxes will be due, and generally a 10 percent penalty for people under age 59 1/2. For residents of New York and other high-tax states, that can mean half the money goes to pay Federal and state taxes, and penalties.
It also means that the money will not be there at retirement, when it is likely to be needed. Retirees with more than $20,000 of annual income relied on savings and investments for 39 percent of their income in 1990, according to Treasury figures, compared with 20 percent from Social Security and 15 percent from pensions. Yet, today's average 50-year-old has only $2,300 in financial assets or savings, not including equity in a house, Merrill Lynch reported last month in its fourth annual retirement planning survey.
Still, there are instances where current need justifies dipping into a 401(k) plan, Mr. Neumark said, and regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in August spelled out permissible hardship withdrawals. He cited two examples.
One client in his 30's wants to buy a house. Not only will it be a home for his family, but in today's market with both housing prices and mortgage interest rates well below the levels of recent years, it may be a smart move financially. So he is taking money from his 401(k) plan for the down payment. A home purchase can be a form of retirement savings, if it means the buyer will own a house outright by retirement, thereby eliminating an important expense then.
Another client has an emergency need for thousands of dollars worth of dental care, and is able to borrow the money from her 401(k) plan.
"You want to get the most money for the least tax," Mr. Neumark explained, "so the first alternative is a plan loan, if allowed." That also means she can repay the money so her retirement savings will be intact.
Under I.R.S. regulations, people may borrow up to $50,000 or 50 percent of their vested account balances in their 401(k) plans, whichever is less, but not all plans allow borrowing. Similarly, not all plans allow hardship withdrawals, even though they are permitted by the I.R.S. Therefore, he said, it is important for people to know what is permitted under their employer's plan before putting money in.
"On the one hand, I always encourage my clients to put as much money as they can into a 401(k) plan for retirement savings," Mr. Neumark said. Up to $8,728 may be put in this year, under I.R.S. rules. "On the other hand, if the client says, 'I intend to buy a house in two years,' " it is probably better to save outside the plan, he said.
The hardship withdrawals permitted under the I.R.S. regulations are: medical expenses for an employee or dependent; costs related to the purchase of a principal residence, excluding mortgage payments; payment of tuition and related educational fees for post-secondary education for the employee, spouse, children or other dependents, and payments necessary to prevent the employee's eviction from his or her principal residence or foreclosure on that residence.
A 401(k) plan may also allow for hardship distributions to employees with other immediate and heavy financial needs, provided the plan has nondiscriminatory and objective standards for determining the existence of a hardship, Mr. Neumark said. But that means the judgment of the plan administrator comes into play, so people should not count on using a 401(k) plan as a source of emergency cash.
Ideally, people should put money into conventional savings or investment accounts that they can tap for emergencies, as well as participate in 401(k) plans, especially in cases where the employer matches employee contributions in whole or in part. An employer match makes a 401(k) plan "one of the all-time great no-brainers ever," said John L. Steffens, executive vice president, Merrill Lynch private client.
"If someone at age 40 earning $60,000 a year invested $3,000 after-tax annually, that investment would grow to $200,000 at age 65," Mr. Steffens said. "If he were fortunate enough to have a 401(k) plan, where his company matched 50 percent of the employee's contribution, his pre-tax annual savings would grow to about $550,000 by age 65."
Those numbers show why a decision to take money out of a 401(k) plan is not to be made lightly. Still, in today's recessionary environment, particularly with tuition payments due and work-related relocations, it can be a safety net for some people who had the foresight in better times to put the money into the plan, Mr. Neumark said.

HEADLINE: Lebanon Journal;
When Times Get Tough, Town's Officials Get Boot

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEBANON, Me.

 BODY:
If times are tough in America and taxes are high, the angry residents of this small rural town have their own answer -- shut down the government.
Last year they voted to turn off the 100 street lights to save money. Then they elected to stop financing the town's five-member police department, after which there was a murder and a rash of burglaries. 
 They went a step further in June, voting 563 to 555 not to pay the salaries and expenses for much of Lebanon's town government for the fiscal year that began July 1.
Those dismissed included the town's governing body, the three selectmen; two code-enforcement officers who handle building permits; the registrar of voters; the ballot clerks, and the animal control officer. All are part-time jobs in this town of 4,281 residents, most of them blue-collar workers, spread over 57 square miles in southeast Maine.
The voters also refused to approve money for any road repair work or for a proposed Little League baseball field. The town will continue to pay for its part-time clerk, its volunteer fire department and its schools.
"We're not totally crazy or radical," said Roxanne Bumford, a mail deliverer who is chairman of the town planning board, an unpaid position.
The problem, as Mrs. Bumford sees it, is that with many residents being laid off from their factory jobs or forced to work a four-day week, people are frustrated. That brings out an old strain of Yankee frugality.
"People don't have money to spend, so they are mad about rising taxes," she said.
In fact, from 1985 to 1990, with New England's economy booming and real estate values soaring, property taxes in Maine rose an average of 76 percent, according to state figures. "But now industry is leaving, and it is leaving voids," Mrs. Bumford said.
What made residents more resentful, she said, was that much of the increase in taxes was forced by the state when it imposed a series of mandates on schools. One, for example, required particular ratios of teachers to students; another set minimum salaries for teachers.
Two other small towns in Maine also voted to eliminate their police forces last year as an economy measure, and some tiny communities, with less than 50 people, have voted to disband, or unincorporate. But Lebanon is the first town to vote not to finance its government, said Stephen Gove, a spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, a private service organization for the state's municipalities.
Another problem in Lebanon was that the selectmen lumped many of the budget items into a general fund, not offering a breakdown. The question on the ballot referred simply to "$70,000 for governmental expenses, officers' salaries, etc."
"I looked at this and I said, '$70,000 is not a tremendous amount of money, but what's etc.?' " said Harvey Wallingford, a resident.
Because he wanted a better accounting of how his tax dollars were spent, he voted 'no,' but assuming the majority would vote 'yes,' he said.
Mr. Wallingford runs one of the few businesses here, a mobile-home park and sales agency. There are also three general stores and three used-automobile dealers. Lebanon has no industry or large commercial establishments, so residents bear virtually all the tax burden.
In 1990, as the economy turned sour, Mr. Wallingford opened a repossession lot, selling off property like campers, cars, trucks, boats and snowmobiles that had been reclaimed by local banks. Since then, several of the banks themselves have failed.
Gilbert Zinck, the chairman of the three selectmen, who are continuing their work as volunteers, acknowledged that they "kind of messed up" by not offering a fuller breakdown of spending. So they have tentatively scheduled another budget vote for August to give residents a second chance. This time the ballot will be broken down into several major items. "I really believe people will vote for it when they know what it is for," Mr. Zinck said.
When the new fiscal year began on July 1, much of the town's government stayed on voluntarily. One who did not was the animal control officer, who resigned, but now there is a volunteer in the job, David White.
The selectmen, though, reluctantly decided to lay off their secretary, who had been doing the job for 35 years. They are also having the telephone disconnected in their office at the elementary school. (There is no separate town hall; all other officers work out of their homes.)
If the next vote fails, Mr. Zinck said, he has only one solution: "Send donations."

HEADLINE: When the Carousel Comes Grinding to a Halt

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRISTOL, Conn.

 BODY:
Tranquillity has returned to the Lake Compounce Festival Park. The once nerve-jangling wooden roller coaster is still, the pop guns and barkers are silent in the Victorian arcade and even the paddleboat is gone from the lake, which reflects the forested hillside of nearby Southington Mountain.
The park gates are locked, with only a handful of guards patrolling this 146-year-old institution that had called itself America's longest continuously operating amusement park. And, despite intense efforts to revive it, Lake Compounce will remain closed this holiday weekend and for the foreseeable future. 
 The park, which to many here is a symbol of the quintessential pleasures of American summertime, could be called a fatality of bungee jumping, a victim of the trend that made amusement parks into action parks: high-hype, high-cost amalgams of ever-more-punishing upside-down roller coasters, endless lines, loud rock music and ersatz evocations of Main Street, U.S.A.
Lake Compounce's demise could also be seen as a result of trying to keep up with that trend, of failing to be true to its small-town traditions. In recent years, it added admission fees and heavy metal concerts to attractions like the carousel, with its bucolic New England scenes of autumn leaves and winter snowfalls, and the Showboat, which plied the lake on cool summer evenings.
Gerard Miclette, a Coventry, Conn., electric violinist, lamented last week that this would be the first summer since 1954 that his Cowboy Caravan Band would not perform at Lake Compounce. "It was a beautiful place to work," said Mr. Miclette. "We feel quite bad about it."
The victim of a tangle of management and financial problems, Lake Compounce has meant far more to area residents than just a day's diversion or a lift for the local economy.
"It's very sad that something like this has to go," said John Gorry of Newington, Conn. "I made a lot of friends there over the years and had a lot of enjoyable Sundays. It was a family-type park, not commercial like other amusement parks."
"From the very beginning, when the Norton family started it in the 1840's, Lake Compounce was a place that families would come for picnics and band concerts," said John J. Leone, Bristol's former mayor, who now heads the chamber of commerce of this central Connecticut community. "In the 20th century, they added carousels and rides, and in recent summers, they drew more than half a million people, making it the state's No. 2 draw after Mystic Seaport."
 
Big, Big, Big
 But in 1985, under financial pressure, the descendants of Lake Compounce's founder, Gad Norton, sold it to a gaggle of investors and promoters with visions of a big expansion, big concerts and big profits.
"The park was my heart and soul and body, but it was a decision we were forced to make," said J. Harwood Norton Jr., the great-grandson of the park's founder. The selling price was "over $1 million," Mr. Norton said.
"Small family parks' days are limited," said Mr. Norton, "and I didn't want it to go down the tubes."
The buyers, a consortium of local businessmen called Compounce Associates Limited Partnership, "turned around and brought the Hershey Corporation in to manage it, but Hershey liked what they saw so much that they bought a 70 percent stake," Mr. Harwood said.
The park's policy of charging no admission, allowing families to bring picnics and offering free country-music concerts was replaced with a $12.95 entrance fee and a ban on picnics, intended to pump up business for food concessions. The Ferris wheel and Showboat were replaced by a water flume and a pirate ship.
In 1988, Hershey sold its share to the Joseph Entertainment Group, a Wisconsin company owned by Joseph Balestrieri of Milwaukee.
The new owner built a 20,000-person-capacity outdoor amphitheater as a venue for performers ranging from Liza Minnelli to hard-rock groups like Megadeth, Slayer and Alice in Chains. Suddenly, the once-placid amusement park became the source of noise, traffic and a chorus of complaints from residents of Bristol and Southington, across the lake.
"The new owners ran the park in such a way that our patrons couldn't afford to come," Mr. Miclette said.
The park's fortunes and finances began to unravel last summer when Guns 'n' Roses canceled its performance after the check to pay the group bounced, said Gloria W. Schaffer, Connecticut's Commissioner of Consumer Protection. Mr. Balestrieri has yet to pay some $300,000 in refunds to ticket-holders, she added.
 
Trying to Salvage No. 147
 Mr. Balestrieri, whose company filed in court for protection from creditors last winter, owes more than $900,000 in 1991 state and local taxes, with "a new year's worth of taxes" that were due this week, said William T. Stortz, Bristol's Mayor. Because of the back taxes, the state has suspended Compounce Associates, which technically owns the park, from operating it, said A. J. Janschewitz, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services.
Mr. Norton said that Mr. Balestrieri canceled 15 concerts last summer and owes ticket-buyers $1.5 million. An audit by Arthur Anderson & Company, the accounting firm, showed that Mr. Balestrieri's businesses lost $1.9 million, principally at Lake Compounce.
A last-ditch effort to open the park this summer -- engineered by a Vermont financial-consulting team -- failed last month, when a deal with the Nederlander Organization, the entertainment producers, fell through, and the last 12 full-time employees were dismissed, said Gary Klemyk, a guard. But state and town officials, as well as Mr. Norton, are trying to reopen the park for at least a weekend by Labor Day to be able to claim a 147th year of continuous operation.
"We're working hard to try to bring the parties together, and we are very slightly optimistic that we'll get the park open to maintain its record," said Joseph M. Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Economic Development.

HEADLINE: Deadlock In Albany;
Sour Finish Taints Productive Session

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 3

 BODY:
The enduring legacy of the 1992 session of the New York State Legislature may be that lawmakers, for the first time in eight years, did what they are legally required to do.
They passed a budget on time, or at least almost on time. It was approved on April 2, one day late, which by Albany standards is considered "close enough for government work," in the words of the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea . 
 There was hope that the timely passage of the $56 billion budget would free a newly cooperative Legislature to address the state's most serious problems for three months. But that hope dissolved in the final days of the session when more deals fell apart than came together.
For the last 17 years, when the Republicans have ruled the Senate and the Democrats have controlled the Assembly, the Legislature has often been paralyzed by institutional inertia. But the burden of bipartisan power-sharing was reinforced this year by a confluence of destructive and distracting forces.
It is not, after all, just any election year. Voters are surly enough to terrify even a Legislature with a 98 percent re-election rate. And redistricting, in addition to preoccupying lawmakers from the start of the session to its finish, left legislators nervous about how every vote would be received by new constituents.
"All of those things brought a new sense of caution," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "Particularly on fiscal issues, there was a heightened sensitivity."
 
Intraparty Challenges
 That explains to some degree the failure of the Senate to embrace Mr. Cuomo's proposals to put an $800 million bond act before the voters, to give the Thruway Authority new power to oversee construction projects,to bail out the deficit-laden governments of Nassau and Suffolk counties and to have the state assume local Medicaid costs. The Democratic Assembly backed Mr. Cuomo on each of those initiatives, as it usually does.
It is also significant that 8 of the 35 Republican senators already have opponents in their Sept. 15 primaries, an unusually high number. Some of the challengers are Republican assemblymen who were hurt by redistricting. Others are conservatives recruited by Change-N.Y., a new interest group that hopes to move the state Republican Party toward the right.
The intraparty challenges made many incumbent Republicans reluctant to give new power to a quasi-public authority, saddle the state with open-ended Medicaid costs, or vote for the bond act, which would have increased the state's indebtedness.
"The dominant issues of the 1992 session," observed Julian S. Palmer, the executive director of New York State Common Cause, "were redistricting and incumbent self-preservation."
Even the achievements of the session seemed a result more of political calculation than of noble purpose.
The budget was passed on time because legislators finally perceived that voters would no longer tolerate needless delays that encouraged Wall Street to downgrade the state's bond rating and that forced local governments to borrow money.
Even the most significant bill of the session -- a set of sweeping changes in the state's health insurance laws -- was passed only grudgingly by the Senate and largely because of an effective threat from Mr. Cuomo.
The Governor warned that the state Insurance Department would have to impose a large Blue Cross/ Blue Shield rate increase shortly before Election Day if the insurance changes were not approved.
Ultimately, the prospect of 2.5 million angry Blue Cross subscribers proved more intimidating to the Senate Republicans than the heavy lobbying against the bill by commercial insurance companies.
Mr. Cuomo's threat to raise insurance premiums was a rare instance in which the Governor could wield a club that actually scared the Senate Republicans.
He had suggested that he would veto the Legislature's redistricting plan if he did not get the election law changes he wanted, but did not follow through on the threat. His warning that he would campaign against the Republicans for rejecting his Medicaid proposal was met with ambivalence.
 
Governor No Threat
 Indeed, it has been years since Republican legislators have worried about the political influence of the Governor, whose approval ratings have fallen with the economy. Many boast in their campaign literature of the votes they have taken to oppose him.
Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, has shown increasing frustration with Mr. Marino's passive leadership style. The Long Island Senator has deliberately delegated power to his subordinates, creating a decentralized Senate that often undermined Albany's strong leadership system and left negotiations deadlocked.
"If Marino was tougher, we would have had the agenda," Mr. Cuomo said today. "He's not able to go into his conference, take heads, knock them together and make a deal."
Mr. Marino, in turn, faulted the Governor and Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin for holding the Long Island bailout bill as a legislative hostage. As soon as the Legislature recessed, he reverted to the kind of regional appeal that has served the Republicans well over the years.
"It had been my hope that the Democrats would abandon their assault on Long Island," he said. "This is pure political blackmail."
As so often in Albany, it seemed that Legislative inertia was completely compatible with political expediency.

HEADLINE: Bailout Hopes Dashed In Nassau and Suffolk

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 3

 BODY:
Leaders of Nassau and Suffolk counties huddled in separate emergency meetings today, each faced with bankruptcy, huge layoffs and property tax increases after this morning's adjournment of the State Legislature without approval of deficit borrowing plans critical to the finances of both.
The Republican-controlled Senate voted to approve the multimillion-dollar bailout plans, but the Democratic-controlled Assembly, with backing from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, rejected the borrowing measures. The Democrats demanded that both counties agree to have financial control boards oversee their finances, which have been crippled by lower sales tax revenues and rising social welfare costs with the recession. 
 Leaders in the Senate and Assembly said today that a compromise could still be worked out, possibly by the end of next week, even though the Legislature officially adjourned for the summer. County officials said the legislators could be called back to Albany for a special session to reconsider the deficit borrowing measures along with Governor Cuomo's $800 million job-creation bond act, which the Republicans opposed.
The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, said this afternoon that he had talked with Governor Cuomo for more than a half hour today, and also talked with leaders of the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Gulotta said he was "confident that when cooler heads prevail, our differences can be worked out."
 
A Call for Sanity
 "It's very clear that at the end of the legislative session, tempers flared on both sides and a number of major issues were not addressed," Mr. Gulotta said. "When calmer minds and reason prevail, we'll be able to resolve these matters."
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert Gaffney, a Republican, met for several hours today with top aides at his offices in Hauppauge, and said he, too, was "confident that state leaders would resolve this issue."
He said that action by the state was critical for the resolution of Suffolk's "significant cumulative deficit." Unlike Mr. Gulotta, Mr. Gaffney has said that he would accept some state oversight of county finances. Mr. Gulotta indicated today that he was also softening his position, saying that "it was an area that could be negotiated."
Both counties say that by October if not sooner, they will not have enough money to meet payroll and other expenses. Without relief, property owners in both counties face tax increases between 25 percent and 30 percent and a sharp reduction in police, road maintenance and other services.
 
'Drop Dead, Long Island'
 Nassau is seeking Albany's approval to borrow $100 million, which would be paid back with a one-percentage point increase in the county's mortgage recording tax. The borrowed money would help close an estimated $159 million deficit in the county's $1.8 billion budget.
Suffolk wants to borrow up to $91 million, to be paid back, in part, with a half-cent increase in the county sales tax, to 8.5 percent. It needs the money to help fill a $100 million gap in its current $1.3 billion budget.
"I'm really very much disturbed by the outcome," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., who jousted loudly this morning during the final hours of the session with the Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat.
Senator Marino described Mr. Weprin's and the Governors' positions as "Drop dead, Long Island."
"I don't understand it," Mr. Marino said, calling the demand for oversight "totally unnecessary."
Governor Cuomo blamed Mr. Marino for the outcome and said he did not know whether a special session would be called.
"Mr. Marino left Albany and said he wasn't coming back," the Governor said.
Mr. Weprin, the Assembly Speaker, said the door was still open if an agreement could be reached.
The Nassau County Comptroller, Peter King, a Republican, said Albany Democrats were playing partisan politics to embarrass Mr. Gulotta and other Nassau Republicans. Mr. Gulotta is up for re-election next year.
Mr. King said that "if necessary, the county would go for some kind of a financial control board."
Benjamin Zwirn, a Democrat and Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, said he hoped the bailout proposal "was good and dead."
"The real issue is cutting government spending." he said. "The threat of a tax increase is just a scare tactic. The Republicans use it all the time to get their way."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Small Gains Are Posted For Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar gained about half a pfennig in a holiday-shortened domestic trading session yesterday as the market, cautious ahead of next week's Group of Seven summit meeting, mostly followed the cue from Europe, dealers said.
The stock and government bond markets in the United States were closed on the eve of the Fourth of July holiday. 
 Foreign exchange dealings in New York essentially ended at the close of the European market, dealers said.
Speculation that the Bank of England might cut interest rates, rumors that the Bank of Italy had suspended its foreign exchange trading and interventions by Italian and Spanish central banks had scant effect on the dollar's modest recovery, they said.
The dollar stood at 1.5180 German marks and 124.75 Japanese yen, up from Thursday's 1.5075 and 124.40 New York close.
With United States securities markets closed, European trading slowed to a crawl ahead of Monday's opening of the summit meeting.
But London shares made solid gains, driven higher by talk of a British interest rate cut.
Gold closed in London at $346 an ounce, 25 cents lower, while the price of crude oil rose 5 cents a barrel, to $20.80 for August delivery of North Sea Brent Blend, an international benchmark grade of oil.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading London shares gained 21 points, to close at 2,497.1, despite statements by British officials quashing rumors of an imminent rate cut.
The Frankfurt market was dominated by news and speculation on the corporate front and saw wild price swings in individual stocks, which steered the market erratically to its highest close in two and a half weeks. The 30-share DAX index ended 8.37 points higher, at 1,776.98.
The Paris bourse was depressed by the French truck drivers' dispute and low activity as the holiday season gets under way. The CAC-40 index closed at 1,883.64, a gain of 10.12, but it still languishes around the lowest levels for several months.

HEADLINE: Artists Amid Urban Change: A Grimly Drawn Appraisal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3

 BODY:
An international gathering of some 200 public officials, artists and arts professionals last week received a bleak and at times apocalyptic view of life in American cities and the challenges facing artists in an often hostile environment.
"The Artist in the Changing City," a two-day conference organized by the London-based British American Arts Organization, was the latest effort in the association's six-year campaign to research, document and stimulate the use of the arts in urban regeneration. 
 Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, opened the conference by calling on delegates and speakers to consider the part artists could play in reshaping cities and societies "in a form that feels comfortable, a form that exists beyond recessions." Artists, he said, contribute not just to the economic regeneration of a city, but "are involved in lifting hearts and minds beyond the day to day."
"They're involved in giving us, and indeed in embodying for us, spiritual and emotional values," he said.
 
Evoking the Los Angeles Riots
 In response, Peter Sellars, the opera and theater director, and Richard Sennett, professor of history and sociology at New York University, delivered impassioned speeches about their respective home towns, Los Angeles and New York.
Mr. Sellars, the iconoclastic director of the Los Angeles Arts Festival, responded to Mr. Serota's call in characteristically dramatic fashion.
"How is the city changing?" he began. "In Los Angeles, we burn it."
Addressing his largely white audience, which included delegates from all over Europe as well as from Australia and North America, Mr. Sellars spoke about the weeks leading up to the Los Angeles riots and the growing disenchantment, as he saw it, of Los Angeles blacks with the justice system.
The crisis, he maintained, is one of a lack of context: "Nobody has a way to talk to anybody." Democracy is a discussion, he said, and that is where artists come in because only they can "put a human face on the statistics."
Artists, Mr. Sellars said, should be at the center of society, keeping "alive a utopian vision," because society will not improve "if the people envisioning a better society are politicians." Important and good art is not about style, but content, he said, adding: "There is a lot of nice art out there that has almost nothing to say" and "a lot of people out there who have a lot to say, and about whom much must be said."
Mr. Sennett, who delivered the conference's keynote address, said that the discussion of the artist in the changing city seemed a particularly "painful subject for any New Yorker" because "in the last 15 to 20 years we have in our city seen a kind of crisis emerge in the place of artists." Mr. Sennett, a noted urban theorist, said that "money for the arts has gone more and more into the distribution of art and marketing of art, while money for artists has decreased." The "trade-off," he said, "has become such that many artists are forced for economic reasons to flee the city."
 
Creativity at Peril
 New Yorkers, he said, "are witnessing an evacuation of the center." And such an evacuation, he asserted, puts at peril the very creativity of artists.
Recalling his days as a student of behavioral psychology under B. F. Skinner, Mr. Sennett said that when studying the behavior of "hundreds of hamsters massed together," he had noticed that the hamsters became "involved in what's called scanning behavior, surveying a crowd to see what's happening."
Artists, he suggested, react in much the same fashion. In a complex environment like a city, they pay attention in a special way. For the artist, and especially for the modern artist, he said, crowding "prompts a sense that somehow disturbance exists in the environment which can only only be rectified by making objects." The "less disturbing, the more unified, the more readable" that environment is, he said, "the less stimulation there is" to make art.
To Joan Jeffri, director of the Research Center for Arts and Culture at Columbia University and another conference speaker, Mr. Sennett's argument was interesting, but not borne out by her 1989 study in which nearly 10,000 artists in two rural regions and eight cities, including New York, responded to questions about their living and working conditions.
According to the results, she said, artists are in fact a more stable population than most people think: 47 percent of those who responded to her survey, she said, had lived in their county of residence for more than 10 years. Two-thirds of the artists in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago had received art-related training in the areas or regions in which they were residing. And in Los Angeles and New York, about a quarter of the respondents were living in artist districts.
 
The Pull of the City
 Still, Ms. Jeffri said, much more could be done to improve the lot of the urban-based artist. Cultural activity and support systems that "in turn foster a network of peers" are, she said, "very compelling reasons for artists to live and work in cities." The availability of arts training, too, she said, "is a very strong magnet."
Buster Simpson, a Seattle artist attending the conference, echoed what seemed to be the prevailing view that artists had more than art to create in their cities.
"There's a lot of healing, socially and environmentally, that needs to go on out there," he said in an interview. "That is our mission. We don't make geegaws to be put into somebody's palace anymore. We don't make icons to be put into churches. We're communicating."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bad Economic News Forces Bush To Refocus Re-election Strategy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Shaken by an ominous jump in the unemployment rate, White House strategists said today that they were reassessing the assumption that an improving economy would revive President Bush's political standing before the November election. Instead, they said, they must focus their campaign more on social problems and character issues.
The change in emphasis had been under serious discussion since late last month, but it was propelled Thursday, when it was reported that the June unemployment rate had surged to 7.8 percent. The shift in strategy portends a tougher and possibly more negative re-election effort by Mr. Bush than he or his advisers had predicted.
 
Short on Confidence and Time
 Mr. Bush's re-election chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said today that the campaign was making only subtle changes in the campaign's overall strategy, which always included messages about social problems, "family values" and Mr. Bush's standing as a world leader. But the decision not to rely on good economic news for an autumn "kick" nevertheless removes an underpinning from the assumptions that Mr. Bush himself has carried into the race. 
 In interviews today, some campaign advisers insisted that they had not abandoned hope that an economic upturn would yet lift Mr. Bush from a record low point in popularity polls and counter a national uneasiness, at historic levels in some polls, that the country is seriously off course.
But the advisers' hope ebbed in recent weeks as declines in some important economic bellwethers, like new factory orders and purchases of new homes and durable goods, offset other signals of recovery.
Moreover, political strategists now realize that if the economy is indeed faltering again, any fiscal measures the Administration could take would not produce results in time to affect Mr. Bush's popularity.
 
Emphasis on Trust
 "Not many economists think anything we do at this stage would do anything by the election," a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity said today. "All it would do is inoculate both us and Congress against the charge that we stood around and did nothing."
The Bush campaign still plans to keep economic concerns at the center of its strategy, Mr. Teeter said today. But with the economy no longer assured of helping the President, the campaign will now devote more money and energy to issues like crime, health care, education and drug abuse than it had previously planned. It will also spend more time portraying Mr. Bush as the most experienced and trustworthy of the three major Presidential candidates, perhaps the one area where he enjoys a sizable lead over Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Ross Perot.
In his 1988 victory, Mr. Bush erased a deficit in summertime polls partly by mounting attacks that caricatured his opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, as a coddler of criminals who was dangerously inexperienced in military and foreign affairs.
The Bush campaign at least temporarily checked Mr. Perot's rising popularity among voters last month by raising questions about his personal stability and his respect for the law. Mr. Clinton has struggled since last winter to overcome voters' doubts about his personal integrity.
 
No More Ace in the Hole
 Polls taken by the Bush campaign, an official said today, indicate that voters believe Mr. Bush has the ability to address economic problems as he has foreign crises but that he is somehow disinterested and unwilling to do so.
Facing that perception, the campaign is likely to step up its efforts to blame Congress for the economic malaise and to stress the President's concern about other domestic problems.
Mr. Teeter has frequently said that economic growth alone would not insure the President's re-election in a year when voters are increasingly worried about the fraying of the nation's social fabric and the rise of economic superpowers like Japan and Germany. But both he and Mr. Bush have clearly regarded the economy as their ace in the hole in what the President now calls a "weird" campaign.
In an interview in March, Mr. Teeter described a re-election race without a visible recovery as a "worst-case scenario."
Mr. Bush has been even more explicit. "I think most people would concede that my problems stem from this sluggish, anemic economy," he said at a news conference on June 4. "Come fall, when we're out there taking our case to the people, with an improved economy behind us, I still feel confident about the outcome of the political election."
But qualms about that strategy have grown almost visibly among Mr. Bush's advisers as bad economic news began to smother the good. They burst open during a senior White House staff meeting on June 22, when the President's conservative economic adviser, Michael Boskin, argued that the recovery was much more frail than top White House officials believed.
Mr. Boskin's chief critic at that meeting was the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner. But Mr. Skinner has now accepted Mr. Boskin's view that the economy will move too slowly to guarantee success in November, Bush advisers said today.
That fear was heightened Wednesday night when, as Mr. Skinner chatted in his West Wing office with Mr. Teeter and other top Bush officials, a bright red folder containing unemployment statistics to be released the next day arrived.
Mr. Skinner fell silent, opened the folder, read it and heaved a deep, audible sigh.
"You could tell it wasn't good news," one official said.

Bush Signs Jobless-Aid Bill

WASHINGTON, July 3 (AP) -- As promised, President Bush today signed a bill giving the unemployed up to a half-year of emergency benefits beyond their basic 26 weeks of coverage and making it easier for them to collect such extended benefits in future recessions.
The legislation, overwhelmingly passed by both houses of Congress on Thursday, was sent to Mr. Bush at the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., where he was spending the holiday.
The provision for current emergency benefits is expected to help at least two million unemployed workers before it expires March 6, although people who have benefited from the two previous extensions enacted during the current recession are not eligible. And by allowing the states a liberalized formula for measuring joblessness, the new law will also make it more likely for the long-term unemployed to qualify for extended benefits in the future.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 5, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the effect of unemployment on Bush campaign strategy described the advance delivery of the latest unemployment figures to the White House incorrectly in some copies. The confidential report was delivered by the Labor Department, not campaign officials.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Battle Over Securities-Fraud Cases

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
Slurping and grunting noises are rising from both piggish parties engaged in a heated debate over securities-fraud class actions.
In one pen, meet the hogs who pull such shenanigans as filing class actions against corporate managements within hours of a stock drop, sometimes on scant evidence that any fraud was committed. This group of lawyers and investors has resorted to paying bounties to stockbrokers who can supply names of investors harmed in such cases. The investors frequently settle for pennies on the dollar, raising the question of whether they were simply holding up management on a meritless case. A good case, some lawyers believe, would be taken farther and demand a higher settlement. 
 In the other pen, meet the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too swine -- an assembly of corporate executives. Pass laws that would help stop the flood of securities-fraud litigation that hurts us, they argue, but don't mess with civil laws that can work on our behalf. Frivolous lawsuits -- when companies file them against each other, for instance -- are a "cost of doing business." But the cost becomes distasteful when investors are the plaintiffs.
A bill that would change the rules governing securities-fraud suits was introduced by Representative Billy Tauzin, Democrat of Louisiana, in January; in recent weeks, a Senate panel heard arguments on the sweeping changes suggested in the bill.
Pushing hard to make the bill popular is the Coalition to Eliminate Abusive Securities Suits, an unlikely combination of 430 members comprising the most upstanding citizens of Corporate America and some of its most notorious rogues. Indeed, the roster of Ceass (as in cease, get it?) arguably is a reflection of the merits of these fraud cases generally: It includes some fine outfits, ultimately exonerated in court, and at least as many who perhaps weren't sued enough.
To hear Ceass advocates tell it in the recent Senate hearings, the whims of ruthless investors and their lawyers are causing business to grind to a halt, as managements devote nearly all their time to addressing lawsuits. Making matters worse is what the lawsuit craze is doing to the capital-raising process, they say. The bill itself asserts that the suits are causing investment bankers to shy away from working with small companies trying to gain access to the public markets -- a curious claim at a time when initial public offerings are at a high.
In addition, the bill says, "such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy and create job losses within the economy." Asked to give an example of a publicly held company forced into bankruptcy in this way, one of Mr. Tauzin's staffers gave an answer that told much of what's wrong with the "abusive suit" debate -- citing Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting firm that went out of business.
That's curious on a couple of counts, not the least of which is that Laventhol wasn't a public company, but a private partnership. What's more, accounting firms are the constituency that's trying to frame the issues in the fraud suit debate. Key among items in HR417 -- the Tauzin bill -- is a radical proposal that would eliminate the legal notion of "joint and several" liability in class action cases that allege securities fraud. Currently, when a company loses a securities fraud case, "joint and several" liability mandates that the damages be absorbed by whatever defendants have not yet acquired a phony passport and absconded to a South Pacific island.
The reality of that is that large professional institutions like accounting firms that expect to be sticking around frequently pay a greater percentage of the damage freight than they may have been responsible for. Hard-liners respond that that's the way the law was deliberately framed, giving priority to the needs of plaintiffs who were wronged. A cost of doing business, as it were.
Accounting firms say the law should be changed so they only pay for the portion of the damages attributed to them. The current system "is not forcing accountability by people who screw up," said Mark Gittenstein, a lawyer who represents Ceass.
But the current debate isn't focusing on the problem, either. Joel Seligman, a law and securities professor at the University of Michigan Law School, called the current proposal a "foolish overkill resolution" that doesn't properly address the real problem: that a "totally innocent corporation can spend a fair amount of time producing documents" in the discovery process.
While the coalition of companies would say that all the bill's proposals in some way cut down on discovery by discouraging "abusive" suits, the "joint and several" issue is getting the most play from accounting industry advocates, who raised $12 million in March for lobbying efforts on the issue.
Mr. Seligman suggested that the problem of frivolous lawsuits can be addressed more aggressively by using existing laws. Indeed, judges already are sanctioning class-action lawyers under two civil rules that address abusive cases. As for the onerous cost of the discovery process, "I don't think it's solely a securities-fraud case issue," Mr. Seligman said. Better to pursue the crippling time and money spent on discovery in all civil cases than to focus on the fraud cases brought by investors, he said.
That proposal doesn't sit well with Mr. Tauzin, who said in an interview last week that this subset of lawsuits is having "a very negative kind of impact" on corporate entities while lawyers and investors exploit the bounty fees and other perks of class actions.
Mr. Tauzin, for one, should know a little about bounties and perks, according to an analysis published June 21 in Accounting Today. Having received $50,000 in political contributions from accounting firms last year, he was the single biggest recipient in Congress of the industry's largesse.

HEADLINE: Finding a Lifeboat in a Flood of Asbestos Litigation

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: GRANVILLE, Ohio

 BODY:
WHEN a company faces tens of thousands of lawsuits, nurturing innovative ways to control legal costs can be as crucial to survival as creating new products. Recognizing that, the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, a defendant in about 85,000 asbestos cases, has become a pacesetter among the many businesses moving to limit legal expenses.
From their base at the company's research and development campus here, some 30 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, Owens-Corning's asbestos litigation managers have pared the number of outside defense firms they use to just 7, from 60 in 1988. That gives the company increased leverage in price negotiations because each firm now has a bigger share of the business and more incentive to do what Owens wants to keep it. 
 The company has also demanded that law firms shift work from expensive partners and associates to paralegals who operate under the firms' names but are trained and managed by Owens-Corning. Most strikingly, it has instituted a work order system that takes out of the hands of its litigators many decisions about when and how to prepare for trials. Instead, the decisions fall to those issuing the work orders, who in routine matters are the paralegals.
The problem with the old way of doing business, according to Owens executives, is that lawyers do too much work on cases that are likely to be settled and often do it so early in the process that files must be reviewed and updated later, adding unnecessary costs.
The new system is "responsive to the needs and desires of the client rather than the instincts of lawyers," said Louis F. (Ted) Rodewig, the former Booz-Allen management consultant Owens-Corning retained in 1990 to study the asbestos issue. Last year, only months after Glen H. Hiner took over as Owens-Corning's chief executive, Mr. Hiner recruited Mr. Rodewig to move here and run the system that Mr. Rodewig helped design.
The new rules of the game often call to mind the rise of managed care plans in medicine that have been chipping away at the professional freedom and income of many doctors. Just as physicians are bristling at the restrictions of managed care, some lawyers say that limits on their freedom can backfire.
Still, given the nationwide drive by business to control legal costs of all sorts, the Owens-Corning program could be adapted by many corporate law departments. While the asbestos quagmire is an extreme case, legal experts say there are plenty of other corners of the law where companies deal repeatedly with complaints that have a great deal in common. For instance, they say, car manufacturers, oil companies and others with large chains of dealers often wind up in court in contractual disputes that follow predictable patterns.
Owens-Corning executives are betting that their litigation management strategy should keep the company from ending up among the scores of asbestos manufacturers that have followed the former Johns-Manville Corporation, the industry leader, into bankruptcy. Owens's litigation costs are currently covered by the company's insurance, which stood at $675 million at the end of last year. Behind that is a $950 million reserve fund the company has set aside from earnings.
A manufacturer of glass-fiber insulation and construction materials, Owens-Corning had net income last year of $73 million on sales of $2.88 billion. Its asbestos problems stem from insulation products it sold from 1953 to 1974.
Owens believes the new system has helped reduce the amount it pays on plaintiffs' claims, which were resolved at an average of under $10,000 last year, down from more than $12,000 in the mid-1980's. But Owens points out that future plaintiffs could benefit from the company's effort to avoid bankruptcy, which will preserve the company's ability to deal with their claims.
Owens added tens of millions of dollars annually to its legal expenses over the past five years to set up the new system. Total spending related to asbestos peaked at $175 million in 1991. This year, with its heavy computer and research investments behind it, Owens has budgeted just $55 million for expenses and expects actual costs to be even lower, said William W. Colville, the company's corporate counsel.
THESE costs do not include payments to plaintiffs whose claims of injury from exposure to the company's asbestos products have been resolved. Owens had resolved more than 101,000 cases by the end of last year and had 85,000 pending. Although cases continue to be filed at an accelerating rate, Owens has been able to dispose of them even faster, reducing the overall caseload.
There is no longer any dispute that asbestos can cause cancer and lung disease. Instead, the suits turn on the questions of whether a particular plaintiff's illness or death was actually caused by asbestos and which company's products the plaintiff was exposed to.
Owens-Corning's take-charge posture stems from its conclusion that a decade of experience with asbestos litigation has left it in a pretty good position to judge which cases are likely to end up in the small group that actually go to trial and how much it is willing to invest in preparing the rest for settlement. When a case is headed for trial, the company strives to make sure that detailed evidence on subjects like the claimant's medical condition is assembled close enough to the trial date that the job is done only once.
MR. COLVILLE said that the innovations are mostly the common sense results of stripping away the shroud of mystery that lawyers tend to wrap around their work and simply analyzing the tasks involved, much the same way that an airline would break down the elements of baggage handling. He likens the result to just-in-time manufacturing.
In the Owens-Corning system, paralegals at seven regional centers are trained to prepare responses to most pretrial motions, which they send to local attorneys for filing. The company's team of trial lawyers may learn only a few days in advance which cases they will be trying the following week and sometimes see the particular files only the day before. Owens-Corning lawyers liken the litigators' role to that of a top heart surgeon who has others do most of the preparations and may not even meet the patient until shortly before the surgery is to begin.
There are risks. Relying on paralegals to screen new filings, for example, may occasionally lead to missing out on a chance to bring a co-defendant into the case or to present an unusual defense, said Jack B. Manning, whose Houston-based firm of Bean & Manning is Owens-Corning's regional coordinator for eight Southwestern states. He recalled one instance in 1991 in which a change in schedule was not noted in the centralized electronic files that all lawyers involved in the cases use. That led to a failure to issue a work order for sending a list of witnesses to a plaintiff by the required date. Barred by the lapse from presenting most of its case, Owens paid a premium to settle.
On balance, though, Mr. Colville has been so pleased with the changes that some of them, like work orders, are being applied to other legal problems Owens faces. "We want to be able to specify what's to be done and who's to do it," he said.
Plenty of other asbestos defendants have also made huge strides in case management. The Center for Claims Resolution, which coordinates the defense efforts in 60,000 cases involving 20 companies, says it has reduced the number of law firms it deals with to 22, from 60, and cut spending 50 percent since 1988. Companies assisted by the center, which is based in Princeton, N.J., range from small contractors to major defendants like the GAF Corporation and Armstrong World Industries.
The Keene Corporation, an asbestos defendant that used to be a member of the center but now operates on its own, says it cut costs by 40 percent from mid-1990 through the end of last year. This year, it says, it is on track to lop off another 30 percent.
"When we looked at it in 1990, 30 to 40 percent of the work took too long or was being done by someone too qualified," said Stuart Rickerson, general counsel for Keene, which is based in New York. "Now, we are under 2 percent in both categories."
These other defendants do not use work orders, nor do they rely as heavily on trained paralegals as Owens-Corning. But the directives they have laid down and the strict, frequently re-evaluated budgets they develop with outside firms have a similar impact.
SIMILAR trends are occurring outside the asbestos field. The General Electric Company, for example, has imposed a strict budgeting process on any outside legal job likely to cost $25,000 or more, requiring agreement on the tasks to be done and how they will be staffed.
"I can't recall a single case in the two years we have been doing it where the company has been hurt by vetoing something a law firm wanted to do," said Sally King, manager of litigation services at G.E. "We almost always end up in complete agreement on what to do after negotiating. There has to be an open line of communication."
In practice, even Owens-Corning's relationships with its lawyers are less regimented than they sound. Attorneys in the field and litigators do make recommendations about what pretrial work should be done, how long it should take and how much it should cost. Once Owens sets policy in weekly review meetings coordinated here or in special conferences, it relies heavily on its regional law firms to execute it. Not surprisingly, firms that have adapted to the system speak highly of it.
"THIS is the wave of the future," said Robert E. Wagner, a partner at the Detroit firm of Kitch, Saubier, Drutchas, Wagner & Kenney. "You can expand your law practice by showing other clients you can do this."
Still, the declining deference to the judgment of outside lawyers is more likely to be grudgingly accepted than enthusiastically embraced by most lawyers. The end of the go-go 1980's left corporate law firms around the nation scrambling for new work.
"Law firms are going along because they have no choice," said Douglas Young, a partner at the Economic Analysis Group Ltd., a Washington-based firm that conducts an annual survey of cost-containment measures employed by corporate legal departments.
Even some leading corporate lawyers are skeptical about the trend. "The very best lawyers are not going to put up with attempts to control their professional service," said Harry Pearce, general counsel for the General Motors Corporation. "We are not going to manage law firms, because we want them to be creative."
G.M. has sought to reduce its costs by paring the number of outside law firms it uses from nearly 800 in the late 1980's to just over 300. It also installed a computer system to monitor how each firm spends its time and money, and it lets each of them know how it stacks up against the competition, without revealing names.
"We tell them that those who get the best results the most efficiently will get the most work," said Mr. Pearce, a former litigator. "I've never found a more powerful motivator and we don't end up spending so much administrative time managing budgets."
Yet even Mr. Pearce concedes that there can be good reasons for companies like Owens-Corning to go to unusual lengths to tailor outside legal work to their business needs.
"There is a tendency for lawyers to be myopic," he said. "God knows there need to be some limits."
 
 
200,000 CASES AND COUNTING
 ASBESTOS is among the most versatile of all minerals, combining insulation value, flame resistance, flexibility and durability. Manufacturers built thousands of products as diverse as brake linings, movie theater curtains, toasters and pipe insulation from it. But tens of thousands of workers who inhaled tiny asbestos fibers, and in some cases those who handled their clothes or were otherwise exposed, have developed cancers and lung diseases.
The health risks were suspected for decades but it was not until the mid-1960's that public scientific studies began to accumulate, in part because asbestos diseases often take decades to develop.
Lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers and installers mushroomed during the 1980's. The cases involved not just personal injuries but also the declining value of buildings containing asbestos and the costs of removal. Few people have been as heavily exposed as World War II shipyard workers, who were the majority of the early claimants. About half of the more than 200,000 claims to date have been resolved. Experts say hundreds of thousands of new claims are likely to be filed in the years to come.
The most dramatic legal development in the asbestos saga was the 1982 bankruptcy filing of the Johns-Manville Company, the industry pioneer and giant. The filing put a stop to new suits involving the company while it was in Chapter 11. (Now that it has emerged, plaintiffs still can't sue the company, now known as the Manville Corporation, but can bring claims against two funds set up during the bankruptcy reorganization.)
The 1982 filing set off a mad rush among plaintiffs' attorneys to find other "deep pocket" defendants.
"It's amazing how many people suddenly remembered that they had worked with Kaylo," said William W. Colville, Owens-Corning's general counsel, referring to his company's branded asbestos product, which it stopped selling in 1974.

HEADLINE: Czechs Gear Up to Resume Weapons Exports

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
REVERSING a policy of Vaclav Havel to end arms exports, the Czech Government has announced that it will reactivate its industry and sell weapons abroad.
Mr. Havel's pledge, made when he became President after the collapse of Communism in 1989, was described by officials here as naive and costly at a time of economic difficulties. "Other countries are trying to fill our former markets and we have factory capacity that is not being fully used," said Pavel Slejskal, director of engineering in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. "Western countries as well as other Central European countries are taking our place in the market." 
 The move comes as several countries in Eastern Europe discover that converting big weapons factories into other kinds of production is prohibitively expensive. This is especially so because financial assistance for conversion that was expected to come from the West has not materialized.
When Mr. Havel made his promise, he was President of Czechoslovakia. In January, the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Much of the heavy weaponry, like the tanks and missiles that are of most concern to Washington, was made in Slovak factories. Those factories have have suffered a far steeper decline than the Czech plants, which also produce some heavy-duty weaponry but are launching a counteroffensive.
The State Department, knowing the Czechs were contemplating reviving their arms industry, sent a delegation here in March to tell the Czechs what countries are on Washington's arms-export-embargo list. When members of the American delegation talked with the Czechs they were satisfied that the Prague Government, unlike others in Eastern Europe, was in reasonable control of decisions on where arms would be exported, American officials said.
They said the Czechs would probably even pass the eligibility requirements for receiving some American military-technology assistance in upgrading their weaponry. In order to receive this help, the Czechs will have to pledge not to export the technology or weapons made from it to countries unfriendly to Washington. So far, the Czechs have not formally applied for the technological assistance, an American official said.
WASHINGTON did not absolutely discourage the Czech plans from reactivating the arms industry, American officials said. This was partly because the Czech Republic wants to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Czech argument that it must make the army's weaponry compatible with NATO's was considered valid, the officials said.
But at the same time, there were concerns, they said, that the Czechs might find it hard to keep their promise not to sell to countries under embargo. The Czechs have already had preliminary contacts with Iran, one American official said. And the arms companies, eager for business, could sell arms to Serbs
Mr. Havel, whose political profile has been overshadowed by that of his Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, has made no public statements on the change in policy.
American officials said the decision to reverse the policy was made by the cabinet. They pointed out that since the split of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Havel has become a figurehead statesman, with no power to make policy.
More than a dozen Czech weapons producers announced on June 11 that they would form a consortium, the RDP Group, to design, produce and market Czech military-industry products. The head of the group, which is expected to grow to 30 companies, is Lubomir Soudek, general director of Skoda Pilsen, one of the republic's biggest arms manufacturers.
"President Havel is a man of high moral principles," he said. "But the world is not moral. If it were moral, there would be neither arming nor re-arming."
THE Minister of Trade and Industry, Vladimir Dlouhy, was quoted here last month as saying that Mr. Havel's arms policies were "naive" and that they had been pushed upon the country by hypocritical Western powers. "They preached to us to drink water while they themselves were drinking wine," Mr. Dlouhy said. "Armaments are a commodity and Czech weapons have a good reputation worldwide."
The first focus of the new consortium will be improvements for the Soviet-designed T-72 tank, which in its current pre-1989 version is obsolete, Czech officials said. The new consortium will fit the tanks now in stock with a modernized engine, transmission and night-vision capability, making the machine more competitive on the international market.
The industry minister said he was drafting a new law regulating Czech arms exports to be presented to Parliament before the end of the year. It stipulates that the Industry Ministry will be in charge of licensing arms for export and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Defense would have a right of veto, he said.
Mr. Dlouhy said he wanted a senior Government official to sit on the board of the new arms consortium. The new regulations, he added, would make it easier for the companies to sell weapons legitimately.

THE ECONOMY
 
One Swallow Can Be Ignored; a Flock of Them Can't 

Yes, month-to-month figures mean little -- any number of odd events can jostle them. Yes, it's the long term that counts. But when the arrows head relentlessly downward, they just can't be ignored. And last week it was down, down and down again. Here's just a sampling: even with bargain-basement mortgage rates, new-home sales took their biggest plunge in 13 years, erasing a big April gain. And if the ever-fickle consumer can be believed, there's worse to come, as consumer confidence, which soared in the post-election months, dropped perilously close to its feeble October level. What's to blame? Uncertainty has to be a factor. Tax increases and health care reform are on everyone's lips, but no one knows how the script will play out after the folks in Washington finish their horse-trading. When people feel uneasy, they snap their wallets shut. And the economy stalls.

No Comfort in the Job Numbers
 
Last week's job data provided no exception to the gloomy economic news, as June unemployment climbed right back to 7 percent after a brief visit at 6.9. And the underlying figures were discouraging -- a loss of 53,000 manufacturing jobs and a scant 13,000 rise in payroll jobs. Bob Dole, as usual, couldn't wait to make political hay from this scorched field, saying that with tax increases looming, "employers are scared to death, so they're simply not hiring." But the White House, in the person of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, economic adviser, countered that the job-stimulus bill the Republicans hacked to death would have been felt by now. And in any case, she said, nearly a million new jobs have been created this year.
 
Tim-ber! Watch for Falling Jobs!
 
What's most important -- jobs, trees or owls? The answer isn't easy. Typically, Bill Clinton is trying to serve all three masters, and he has everyone angry. Environmentalists want to protect ancient forests in the Northwest, and the northern spotted owls that live there, while loggers warn that if trees aren't being lopped off, their livelihoods will be. So last week Mr. Clinton proposed a compromise, with limits on logging balanced by $1.2 billion for economic development and helping displaced loggers. But the timber industry said the cuts were too deep -- they do represent a drastic change in the way public forests are managed -- while environmentalists said loopholes would allow too much cutting. At press time, the owls had yet to comment.
 
'Violent Content'? Bring It On
 
"Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised." What do those eight little words say to a 10-year-old grazing across the channels? Simple. They say, Drop your Nintendo, forget your homework, get your buddies, and watch this! A watchful parent should switch off the set? Right. Mom's stuck at the office, Dad's doing the laundry, the coast is clear. But that warning is what the four commercial broadcast networks came up with last week to try to head off criticism of the increasing violence on television. Some critics want more -- curbs on the violence, ratings, perhaps a way to block out some shows. Not likely; lobbyists are out in force. "We cannot allow broadcast television to become barren of dramatic excitement," the networks said. Farewell, subtlety. There used to be drama in a raised eyebrow, a piercing look. Now, it seems, it can be found only in a raised knife, a piercing bullet.
 
He Caressed the Modem . . .
 
Humans have eight years left: In 2001, computers complete their takeover, rendering us obsolete. Don't believe it? Listen to this. Last week, a steamy novel came out that was written partly by a computer named Hal -- surely a cousin of the "2001" star. It seems that Scott French, Hal's "co-author," delved into Jacqueline Susann's masterworks, broke the digital code that dictates exactly when hearts leap and pants drop, and programmed Hal to churn out a hot romance. It took eight years, but he and Hal did it, calling the book "Just This Once." And the Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly (yes, there is such a publication) decreed that it had just the right mix: "money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." Surely, by 2001, Hal can perfect his (her? its?) craft, and discard the mortal co-author, stripping humans of one of the last things they can do better than machines. Time to pack it in.

Germany Meets Critics Halfway
 
Germany tried to keep interest rates high to ward off demon inflation, but outsiders were impatient. Typical were remarks by President Clinton, who called for lower rates "so that all of us together can expand this economy." But Germany has been giving in -- gradually, giving out crumbs of rate cuts every month or so. Last week, perhaps to head off criticism at this week's meeting of leading nations, it dropped rates again, to 6.75 percent for its discount rate and 8.25 percent for the Lombard rate -- a move one German economist called "more of a middle policy."
 
Setback for the Trade Pact
 
When the United States, Canada and Mexico came up with their North American Free Trade Agreement, environmentalists said: Wait a second! What about air and water pollution in border areas if industry flocks to Mexico? What about pesticides in imported food? Unsatisfied with the answers, three environmental groups took this lament to court, and last week a Federal judge said they had a point. The judge ordered the Government to prepare an environmental impact statement -- which could take six months -- probably delaying and maybe even killing the pact. This setback for the Administration may have a silver lining, though, because Congressional support for the pact was shaky anyway, and President Clinton may thus avoid another nasty battle.
 
Learning the Rules in Japan
 
In the board room, east isn't meeting west quite yet. American pension funds, feeling their oats after pushing some directors around back home, tried their stuff in Japan. But the Japanese do things their way: they have their annual meetings all at once, making it impossible for a troublemaker to attend more than one, and they brook little dissent. It's a clubby affair, with a lot of reciprocal back-scratching. Enter Calpers, the mighty California retirement system, which has about $5 billion worth of Japanese stock. Wanting to have a say, Calpers cast a number of "nay" votes last week, but when the votes were counted, management resolutions somehow passed unanimously.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Where's the Bottom at Empire?
 
At some point things have to hit bottom at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, where, amazingly, each wave of news is worse than the last. Last week would be hard to top, though: at a Senate hearing, the insurer's chief auditor testified that she couldn't get straight answers from the chief financial officer about discrepancies in the books -- even as the ousted chairman, Albert Cardone, testified that there never were two sets of books. But there was a ray of hope, when Empire picked a new chairman and chief, Philip Briggs, formerly of Metropolitan Life. Mr. Briggs brought understatement to new heights by describing Empire as "a little disorganized," but, for a change, he has experience at a for-profit insurer. That can't hurt.
 
A Kinder Refrigerator
 
Here's one way to get companies to make things that are kinder to the planet: drop the stick, try something more edible. In a contest referred to as "the golden carrot," a group of utilities offered $30 million for the best refrigerator design that saves both energy and the ozone layer. This is no small matter, for refrigerators account for fully 20 percent of household electric bills, and their CFC's eat away at the ozone. The carrot worked, for Whirlpool came up with a model that uses 25 percent less energy and has no CFC's, and last week it took the prize. And because the prize money will offset some startup costs, the new refrigerators, due early next year, will cost about the same as current models.
 
Benefits for Gays at HBO
 
Gay workers edged closer to the mainstream last week when HBO, joining a growing list of companies, offered health benefits to same-sex partners. But it's not true equality; the I.R.S. doesn't recognize such couples, so part of what HBO gives, the taxperson takes away.
 
Outsider to Run Westinghouse
 
Again, the corporate ladder is not as orderly as it used to be, as newly bold directors cast their net far and wide to pick a boss. After Paul Lego resigned at Westinghouse, Gary Clark filled in as acting chief executive, but directors kept searching outside. Only last week, nearly half a year later, did they find their man: Michael H. Jordan, with a long stint at Pepsico on his resume.
 
Now It's Murdoch vs. the Unions
 
The choice was coming down to this: a New York Post owned by Rupert Murdoch, or no New York Post. No one else seemed willing to pour millions into this especially leaky bucket -- at least no one who didn't appall the Post staff (or have you forgotten Abe Hirschfeld?) -- and Mr. Murdoch was about to pull the plug. So last week the F.C.C. granted Mr. Murdoch a waiver to let him own a newspaper and television station in a single market. The F.C.C. insisted it was setting no precedent. It's a one-time-only bow to "the overwhelming body of responsible public opinion," said James H. Quello, the acting chairman. But before he can make the purchase, Mr. Murdoch must still get union opinion on his side -- and that'll be tough. His latest threat: if there's no contract by July 9, no more Post.

HEADLINE: Germany's Push to Expand The Scope of Recycling

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN

DATELINE: LANDSHUT, Germany

 BODY:
IN a warehouse on the outskirts of this tidy Bavarian town, several new BMW sedans are being stripped. Motors, wheels and doors have been removed, windows smashed, seats slashed, dashboards torn out. But what looks like some Teutonic chop-shop actually belongs to BMW itself, a laboratory for finding ways to recycle the raw materials in cars that have traveled their last mile.
If the German Government has its way such "disassembly plants" will become commonplace. In an extremely controversial move, the German parliament is expected to pass by year's end a bill requiring most manufacturers to take back and recycle their products once their service life ends. That revolutionary step -- no other country has even remotely similar legislation -- would cement Germany's status as the world's leading proponent of mandatory recycling. 
 For Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition Government, approval of the bill would be a giant stride toward fulfilling its goal of transforming the nation's economy into almost a closed loop, where waste creation is minimized in favor of maximal re-use of resources. Because Germany is the dominant force in the 12-nation European Community's tightly knit economy, the legislation could become the de facto model for harmonizing its recycling regulations.
Germany began moving toward a "circulatory economy" last year, when it became the first nation to require business and industry to collect and recycle all packaging -- the bottles, cans, cardboard, paper and plastic that contained everything from toothpaste to refrigerators. Those regulations call for an average of 80 percent of packaging materials to be recycled by mid-1995.
The packaging regulations have been imitated by other countries. France and Austria have already adopted slightly modified versions of the German law and the United States and Japan, among others, have shown interest.
But financial, logistical and technical problems have hindered the implementation of the German packaging law -- and cast serious doubts on the timing and economic viability of going a step further to recycle products themselves. Duales System Deutschland, the private company set up to collect, sort and pass packaging on to recyclers, is operating deeply in the red. And because of severely limited recycling capacity the company has been forced to store 70,000 tons of plastic containers. Because of the capacity shortage, Germany has also become Europe's leading trash exporter, shipping plastic and other wastes abroad to be recycled or burned.
Despite the problems, the Kohl administration is forging ahead. The initial draft of the product-recycling legislation was approved by the cabinet last spring. It was deliberately written in general terms to give German industry a chance to respond. The proposed regulations call for companies to collect products and recycle as many components as possible, beginning in 1995. They also require manufacturers to prove a component cannot be re-used before it can be discarded. Manufacturers from the United States and other nations that sell in Germany would be forced to comply as well.
Environment Minister Klaus Topfer sees product recycling as an ecological breakthrough and his ministry is negotiating the specifics of the bill with representatives of German industry in an effort to make it as palatable as possible. Sticking points remain, like the Government's insistence that auto makers take back their cars free. But both sides think the parliament will vote on the law this fall, and approval is widely expected.
Whether Germany's recycling initiative represents the most effective and economical way to manage the world's increasing glut of household and industrial waste is a subject of heated debate at home and abroad.
THE Bonn Government claims the packaging- and product-recycling laws force industry to rethink the way it manufactures products, prompting companies to avoid nonvital components and materials that cannot be recycled. German officials say a product-recycling law is needed now because the nation is facing a trash crisis. With a population of 81 million, Germany is Europe's largest waste producer, and its large landfills will be filled within 10 years, said Clemens Stroetmann, the State Secretary in the Environment Ministry.
"We know a circulatory economy is not 100 percent possible; we have not discovered a perpetual motion machine," Mr. Stroetmann said. "But it is indisputable that this is a sensible idea. Germany has no more room for landfills and almost no natural resources left, so we need the increasingly precious resources we have."
Critics, including the powerful German Industry Federation, the umbrella group for the nation's companies, have described the law's intent as "recycling at all costs." They challenge its logic and argue that with Germany's economy in its most severe recession since the end of World War II, the move is ill timed. The notion of a circulatory economy is dismissed as a utopian dream that will expand Germany's already formidable bureaucracy and prove phenomenally costly, pushing small companies with slim profit margins out of business.
MOST companies will probably try to pass their recycling costs on to the consumer, which could erode Germany's competitiveness by raising its already high product prices. The German Government is also being attacked for taking too narrow a view of waste management in emphasizing recycling rather than a broader mix of solutions, including incineration.
"We would like to see them allow more incineration," said Horst-Henning Wolf, the head of the vehicle recycling project at Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., the maker of BMW cars and motorcycles. He is also one of two chief negotiatiors for the German auto industry. "Things like composite materials and some plastics cannot be recycled because of technical problems or prohibitive costs. But we could burn them safely, generating energy and heat."
Germany does appear to be shifting away from its rules forbidding incineration of many kinds of wastes both domestic and industrial. The Environment Ministry says it will soon introduce legislation that would soften the impact of the product-recycling law by allowing incineration of such wastes if recycling proves too expensive.
Mr. Wolf concedes that the stakes are high for the car makers and suppliers that account for one in seven German jobs. The car makers' costs are already among the highest in the world. If German manufacturers are forced to take back old vehicles free of charge, as the Government insists, "we will factor that into the price of the car," Mr. Wolf said. "There is no such thing as free of charge. Someone always pays."
Like companies across Germany, BMW has begun learning how best to take apart and recycle its products and how to build them to make their dismantling easier.
The disassembly plant here can dismantle 25 cars a day. Currently about four-fifths of the parts in the cars of BMW's low-end "3 series" can be reutilized in some form. Two-person teams dismantle each car, beginning by draining all fluids and oils. Glass from the windows is removed and sold to glass companies, which use it to make bottles. Engines, rear-axle differentials, transmission housings and alternators are reconditioned and sold as high-quality spare parts under warranty from BMW. The plastic bumpers are melted and turned into interior wall panels on new BMW's. Catalytic converters are reconditioned and re-used. Recovered seat covers and polyurethane foam are used as a sound-deadening material for the floor in the 3 series.
Munich-based BMW moved quickly to begin setting up recycling centers here and in other cities across Germany, and expects to complete the network by 1995. It also oversees three such plants in the United States -- in the Bronx (Hunts Point Auto Parts at 1480 Sheridan Expressway), Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla. BMW owners can exchange their cars for a $500 voucher toward purchase of a new or dealer-certified used BMW.
"There is no point in trying to fight the product recycling law," Mr. Wolf said. "There is strong public support for recycling and we knew this law was coming."
But, he added, "the key is that it be economically feasible, that it be attuned to the free market. If it is not, then it is going to limit our competitiveness, and that will not help anyone."
 
A COSTLY MODEL FOR AMERICANS?
 AMERICAN critics of Germany's bold push into recycling could scarcely contain their glee when Duales System Deutschland, the private company set up to collect and recycle packaging, announced recently that it was operating at an annual loss of up to $300 million.
Opponents of the German recycling program quickly branded it a failure and suggested that Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, may want to revise his plan to introduce packaging-recycling legislation based on Germany's law.
That may be premature. The Duales System, which serves 96 percent of German households, finances itself by charging producers a fee on each type of packaging material; paying the fee allows them to put a symbol known as the Green Dot on the package indicating their participation in the program. The fees have not been sufficient to cover costs. But beginning in October, the company will charge more for collecting and separating packaging materials -- from 4.5 cents per pound of glass to 74 cents for plastics.
Ines Siegler, a spokeswoman for Duales System, said it hoped to take in about $2.5 billion in 1994 and is instituting severe cost-cutting in a bid to become profitable. "Part of the problem is that the volume of materials collected has far exceeded our expectations, so the cost of transporting and handling that much material was far higher than we had originally estimated," she said. "We expected 105,000 tons of plastic packaging in 1992 and took in 409,000 tons. Storing that added to our costs. But the situation should stabilize."
Despite the changes, many critics contend that Germany's system remains too costly and too dependent on recycling (as opposed to landfills and incineration) to be a model for the United States.

A New Music Retailing Technology Says, 'Listen Here'

BYLINE: By MATT ROTHMAN; Matt Rothman covers technology and finance for Variety in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
IT is one of life's little frustrations. You walk into a record store and cannot find the music you want. You may know the tune, but not the artist. Worse, you like one song but have no idea whether the entire album is appealing. At $16 for a compact disk, a snap decision could disappoint.
To make music shopping easier, the record industry is using computer technology to update the old-fashioned listening booth, where customers could take their 78's or 45's for a spin before putting down their money. One of the most sophisticated approaches, just hitting the markets in New York and other cities, is an interactive kiosk that lets record store customers listen to samples from 30,000 albums with the help of a touch-screen computer menu. 
 The kiosk, called the I-station, was test-marketed last winter in New York, St. Louis and San Diego. Several went into full use last week at the largest music store in the United States, the HMV shop on Lexington Avenue at East 86th Street in Manhattan. The roll-out will continue through the summer and will include a handful of Wherehouse record stores in the West.
Josh Kaplan, founder of the Intouch Group, the San Francisco company that makes the machine, said the goal was to ease the anxiety a music buyer faced with the enormous selection in most stores.
"Someone walks into a store that has 40,000 choices and you have selection stress," Mr. Kaplan said. "You should never walk out without a purchase."
Futuristic technologies have been proposed, like the plan announced in the spring by I.B.M. and the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for a system that would make customers' own compact disks in the stores. But the I-station is here now, and is meant to enhance the marketing of the products already in the stores.
If successful, the I-station and other systems like it could provide a much-needed stimulus to the music industry, which was hit hard by the recession. It is still struggling with slim profit margins and the fragmentation that comes with a welter of competing genres as diverse as world beat, hip-hop and Christian rock. After sliding 7.5 percent in 1991, sales of recorded music in the United States rebounded 11.8 percent to $9 billion last year, according to the Record Industry Association of America.
The industry is also seeing its core audience grow older, in part because of the general aging of the population and the ascendancy of the more expensive CD format. Compared with 1987, when virtually half the money spent on records was spent by customers age 24 and younger, less than 43 cents of each dollar comes from these younger listeners today, the industry association said. Record merchants must contend with an older, more discriminating audience that is less willing to ride each new wave in music. That means buyers are more cautious.
"Any information you can get in the hands of consumers reduces the risk of the purchase," said Deborah English, a vice president at Wherehouse Records, which is based in Torrance, Calif. "You can't open a book like in a bookstore and read a few lines. Any information we can give them helps reduce that risk. That's the key. Make it easier for them to buy."
Intouch, founded two years ago, is one of several efforts bent on educating consumers. Also competing for attention is an information kiosk introduced three years ago by Muze Inc., a Brooklyn company controlled by Metromedia, the East Rutherford, N.J., company whose chairman is John W. Kluge.
Though it does not provide any audio, Muze offers a touch-screen kiosk that lets users find an album title by searching an electronic directory for the artist or song. Consumers can even enter a piece of a lyric into the directory of the computer, which will find the record. The Muze kiosks are in 300 stores nationwide, including Tower Records.
Tower, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., has also tested the Intouch system but opted to go with its own listening system. This summer, Tower, one of the largest chains in the country, is installing listening posts that each contain 12 albums on CD. A customer can sample tunes -- or listen to the whole recording. Chris Hopson, the senior vice president of marketing for Tower, said the aim is to help customers learn about new artists, not to let listeners sample every title in the store.
INTOUCH has a much more ambitious strategy, Mr. Kaplan contended. It intends to offer a user-friendly teacher and provide retailers and record studios with a wealth of consumer data.
After answering a demographic questionnaire, I-station customers are issued a free I-card by a store clerk. The card, which is stamped with its own bar code, can be scanned by a laser reader at the I-station, which logs the customer onto the computer system.
If a CD has already been selected from the store shelves, the bar code on the label can be scanned by the laser, which will call up a menu of the album's songs on a touch-screen monitor. With a touch, a 30-second sample of the song will be played and a movie camera icon will appear if there is a music video to watch while listening.
An on-screen keyboard lets customers locate albums by typing in song titles, or find a best-seller by summoning a list of the top 50 records on the Billboard magazine chart. If the songs are appealing, another touch of the screen will produce a list of other albums by the performer or similar music by related musicians. After listening, the customers are asked to rate the albums from poor to excellent by touching one of five on-screen windows.
Every session on a kiosk produces valuable information for the record companies. Through computer networks, Intouch intends to collect the data from each machine every night and compile the information into weekly and monthly reports that will be sold to the record companies for $10 apiece for each metropolitan market. Such consumer polling could enable record companies to release an album in certain markets, testing reaction on a weekly basis.
"I love all this information," said Larry Stessel, the senior vice president and general manager of Mercury Records, a unit of Polygram N.V., which has arranged with Intouch to place its recordings on the I-stations. "If we're dealing with Bon Jovi, we can get an idea of how that audience has grown," he said. "Is it just the demographics that purchased their albums 10 years ago, or are they building a new audience? It's very useful. They really thought this through."
The machine can also be a marketing tool. Coupons, special sales and promotions can be programmed into each I-station. The I-card holders, though, may be the real draw of the Intouch system for retailers who can put together lists of customers rich in information about their tastes in music.
In the six weeks that Tower operated five test machines in New York last winter, the experiment generated customer profiles of 25,000 I-card holders. Intouch, which expects to have 1,000 kiosks in operation throughout the United States by the end of 1994, said it hoped to have two million I-card holders by then.
COLLECTING all the data is an Apple IIci inside the I-station. It also controls access to what the listeners can hear: 150,000 songs sampled from 30,000 albums. That amount can easily be doubled, said Steve Katz, a vice president of Intouch.
About 60 graduates of the San Francisco Music Conservatory are working for Intouch to enter the album titles and performers into a database designed by Mr. Katz. Representative 30-second samples of music from five selections are picked by the graduates and the passages and titles are put into a Macintosh program. Later, the song samples are plucked from a rack of 150 CD's, compressed, and transferred to digital audio tape and then to the I-station CD in the stores.
Mr. Kaplan, a former investment banker with Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, said he had been nurturing the I-station idea since 1987, when the notion struck him during a visit to a record store in Geneva that had an old-fashioned listening booth. He recalled asking himself: Why not digitize the operation?
Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, he quit Robertson, Stephens in 1990 and invested $143,000 in his own prototype. He raised $600,000 from his former colleagues and the executives of a company he helped take public, the Rasterops Corporation, which also provides computer video chips for the kiosks. He has since put together $12 million in capital from investors who include the Getty oil family, David Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, and Ray Noorda, the chairman of the computer network software company Novell Inc.
Mr. Kaplan's business plan calls for Intouch, which has spent $7 million on start-up costs, to be in the black by 1995, with pretax earnings of $11 million on revenues of $26.8 million.
But plenty of work lies ahead. So far among the biggest recording labels, only Polygram has signed on. Negotiations are under way with the others, Mr. Kaplan said. He said he has had to cut the fee that a studio pays for an album's inclusion in the I-station; the current asking price is $4 apiece for popular categories and down to $2.50 for classical titles. On top of that, the record company is expected to pay 30 cents for each sample chosen by a customer.
Meanwhile, the biggest retailers are just coming around to the idea of paying monthly rental fees of $300 on average for each kiosk.
AND though Intouch appears to have a technical lead, Tower, for one, rejected the approach. "People want to listen to more than 30 seconds, or a snippet of the song, and want a flavor of the album," said Mr. Hopson of Tower, explaining the decision by the retailer to pursue its own 12-CD listening posts.
But Wherehouse, a chain with 315 stores, likes what it has seen so far with its I-station tests. "Of the machines available to retailers, theirs is the best," Ms. English, of Wherehouse, said. "If the customers listen to the CD, they'll be more apt to buy it, rather than just interact with the screen and search for it later."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
First-Half Buoyancy From Japan

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The hottest sector in mutual funds so far this year may be gold -- up 63.1 percent after a decade in which the group lost money -- but funds that invest in Japanese stocks have shown new life, rising to second place in performance in the first six months of 1993.
As the first half came to a close last week, the six Japanese funds were up 39.1 percent, despite a recent drop of 3 percentage points in the week after the nation's Prime Minister received a no-confidence vote in Parliament. In third place was a group of funds that invest in the Pacific Rim that rose 25.6 percent. That group, including the Japan funds and others with interests in the Japanese market, obviously got a boost from the Tokyo gains. 
 Overall in the latest quarter, United States stock funds rose 3.4 percent, on average, as the stock market kept chugging along. For the first six months, the gain was 4.8 percent.
Indeed, almost all of the Nasdaq-listed stock fund categories traced by Morningstar Inc. produced positive returns in the first half. According to the mutual fund researchers in Chicago, the only exception was a group funds that invest in health-and-biotechnology issues, which dropped 8.1 percent.
The funds that invest in Japanese equities have long been due for a comeback. They lost 4.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended June 1993, compared with an 11.9 percent annual gain for domestic stock funds. Going back five years, the Japan group rose just 2.6 percent a year, compared with 12.9 percent for domestic funds.
What happened? The Japanese Government, which keeps a firm hand on its economy, stopped the huge liquidity-driven bull market of the mid-1980's by raising interest rates at the end of 1989, after the benchmark Nikkei index reached nearly 40,000. That burst the huge bubble in asset prices.
The Nikkei began a decline that touched bottom last August at 14,300. Then, in April, Tokyo's 13.2 trillion-yen fiscal stimulus package gave a lift to the Tokyo stock market, said Rika Yoshida, managing editor of the Morningstar Japan newsletter.
This year's Japan fund gains were augmented by the rise of the yen, a climb that managers do not expect to continue. Even so, most say that Japanese issues are cheaper on a valuation basis than comparable United States stocks, "so it makes sense to invest some money in Japan, probably with not as high expectations in the second half of the year as in the first half," said John R. Hickling, who manages the $200 million Fidelity Japan Fund, which was started in September 1992. Its cyclical plays include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is heavily involved in capital spending, and Toyota Motor.
Chris D. Alderson, who co-manages the $95 million T. Rowe Price Japan Fund, says he is cautiously optimistic. "We're now at the point where economic levels must catch up with valuations, which will happen slowly over the next 12 months," he said. He likes companies that may benefit from an economic recovery, especially Nippon Kompo, a transportation and trucking company, and Toshiba Tungaloy, an industrial tool maker.
The combination of a strong yen and political uncertainty caused the market to fall back once the Nikkei index reached a technical ceiling of nearly 22,000 in the spring, said Elizabeth J. Allan, manager of the $535 million Japan Fund. The market will have to digest these factors, but that process should be complete in six months to a year, she said. In addition, "the economy is at a cyclical bottom and the recovery is all in front of us," she said.
Among the fund's biggest holdings are the Nichiei Company, which makes loans to small businesses; the Secom Company, Japan's largest producer of electronic security systems, and the Kyocera Corporation, an electronics manufacturer.
Christian Wignall, chief investment officer of G.T. Capital Management in San Francisco and the original manager of the $111 million G.T. Japan Growth Fund, is the group's biggest bear. "We're quite cautious about the Japanese stock market, even though it's rallied. We don't think the rise is justified by the fundamentals," he said.
The fund is positioned defensively, with nearly one-quarter stashed in bonds. Among stocks, it likes Takeda Chemical Industries, a large chemical and pharmaceutical company, and Daiichi Seiyaku, a medium-sized pharmaceutical company. Another favorite: the Seven-Eleven Japan Company, which owns a chain of 7-Eleven stores.
The other two Japan funds are more limited. The DFA Japanese Small Company Fund, in Santa Monica, Calif., is available only to institutional investors and clients of investment advisers. Capstone Nikko Japan is a $2.2 million fund based in Houston and available only in 25 states. (It is also the only one of the six Japan funds that is not listed by Nasdaq, which means it does not appear in newspaper listings.)
Another route to Japan is through the funds that invest in the Pacific Rim countries. Among the biggest plays are Merrill Lynch Pacific, which is three-quarters invested in Japan, and Nomura Pacific Basin, nearly two-thirds invested there. An even larger Japanese investment, 85 percent, is found in the Vanguard International Equity Index Fund: Pacific Portfolio. It was a high scorer among Pacific Basin funds so far this year, up 37.3 percent.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Me-First Scramble To Find Screen Gems

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

 BODY:
A cadre of young, globe-trotting movie executives charged with knowing every nonstudio film being made around the world is transforming the way these movies are bought for distribution.
No longer are these executives waiting for Cannes or Berlin or Toronto or other major film festivals to screen the best of international cinema at the same time as all the other independent distributors, then making their offers in their own time. In today's cutthroat global film economy, where financing dollars are scarce and releasing costs astronomical -- and where only a handful of independent releases succeed in North America each year -- getting to the right movie first has become the key to survival. 
 "By the time I got to Cannes, I'd already seen 25 movies," said Mark Ordesky, vice president of acquisition and co-production at New Line Cinema ("Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"). And by the time he got to Cannes in May, his company had already acquired the Taviani brothers' "Fiorile" in Rome. Fine Line Features, a New Line division, announced the acquisition at Cannes even as more cautious competitors were still waiting to see how it would fare with critics.
New Line's toughest competitor right now is Miramax Films, which not only released "The Crying Game," with an American box-office gross of more than $62 million to date, but also the recent art-house hits "Enchanted April" and "Like Water for Chocolate." The co-chairmen of Miramax, the brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, are paying higher prices for more screen gems than any of their rivals.
Before Cannes this year, Miramax, which was purchased by Disney in the spring, had already landed both eventual winners of the coveted Palme D'Or: "The Piano," a New Zealand period drama starring Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel, and the lush Chinese epic "Farewell to My Concubine."
To get "The Piano," Harvey Weinstein used his connections to arrange a screening in Paris in the winter. Miramax promptly bought the film for more than $3 million.
"Everyone went ballistic" at being shut out of the process, said Bingham Ray, a partner at October Films ("Un Coeur en Hiver"). "That's what you deal with. Everyone tries to jockey for position. Good relationships can pay off with an early screening ahead of the competition."
Marcie Bloom, co-president at Sony Classics ("Howards End," "Orlando"), agreed: "The business is all about relationships. You have to stay alert and attentive to anything that might be helpful in any way. You have to be open to possibilities when films are emerging from literally anywhere on the globe."
And, said Bobby Rock, senior vice president of acquisitions for Triton Pictures ("American Heart"), "You have to have a good back and a good pair of arms to carry your bags, and be able to watch a movie on six hours of sleep."
Like most of his colleagues, Mr. Rock screens 7 to 10 movies or videotapes a week and attends seven or eight film festivals a year, during which he sees three to five movies a day. But it's getting riskier for the smaller companies like Triton that lack lavish travel budgets to wait to see a movie at a huge festival like Cannes: The film may not be available by the time they get there.
"More films are bought earlier, so there is less completed product available," said Betsy Stanbock, director of acquisitions for the Samuel Goldwyn Company. "We have to hustle that much harder."
Still, "Cannes is the triple triathlon for acquisitions executives," said Zanne Devine, vice president of Universal Pictures, who seeks films for the studio as well as for the new independent distributor Gramercy Pictures, which is owned by Universal and Polygram. "I'm looking for lightning in a bottle: a movie that will light my hair on fire."
Staying alive in this pack isn't easy. After seeing "Tous les Matins du Monde," starring Gerard Depardieu, at the Berlin Film Festival last year, Jeff Lipsky of October Films wanted to buy it. So his partner, Mr. Ray, had to screen it right away. He flew to Montreal, where the film was playing without English subtitles, and persuaded a local friend to translate. The next day, the partners made their offer, and "Tous les Matins" has grossed more than $3 million in the United States, a sizable sum for a foreign-language film.
While getting there first is the acquisitions executive's priority, even more important is judging market value. Although Howard Cohen, vice president of acquisitions for Goldwyn, flew to Hong Kong to see "Farewell to My Concubine" before anyone else, Goldwyn ultimately passed in favor of another Asian film, "The Wedding Banquet," which it bought after the Berlin Film Festival.
It remains to be seen whether he or Miramax made the right call.
Many potential hits are not obvious. While sex has usually been an easy sell, many distributors have overlooked the strong appeal of food in films. "Tampopo," "Babette's Feast," "My Dinner with Andre" and "Eating" have been joined by "Like Water for Chocolate," which created very little heat at Cannes last year but is now a hit.
Everyone saw "Like Water for Chocolate" in the same screening room, says Trea Hoving, senior vice president of acquisitions of Miramax. But Miramax saw in it some of the same elements as in its Oscar-winning Italian hit "Cinema Paradiso," the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the last decade. And Miramax was willing to work with the director, Alfonso Arau, to recut the film for the American market, shortening it by 10 minutes. The movie has grossed more than $10 million in the United States.
"You're always trying to stay a jump ahead of the taste of the public," Ms. Stanbock of Goldwyn said. "You just have to listen to your heart."

Try Foreign Insurance, Not Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By HOWARD HILLS; Howard Hills, of counsel to the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, served as general counsel of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation from 1989 to 1993.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON is still scratching its head over how to respond to the decline of Communism. Emerging capitalist states need aid, and they represent vast new markets for America -- and for its competitors. How, Washington wonders, can the United States help these new nations and help itself?
The answer is not easy. None of the usual tools seem appropriate. Foreign aid can help, but in these days of deficit reduction it is politically impossible to get enough of it to make a real difference. And, anyway, the government-to-government approach of the Agency for International Development, which administers all foreign aid, is a relic of the cold war. It seems obsolete in this era of the ascendant private sector. 
 One tool is tailor-made for the new economic order, however. It is the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a tiny Federal agency that sells insurance to companies that invest abroad and to lenders who finance such investments. For reasonable premiums, the agency protects policyholders for 20 years against the "triple threat" to investment abroad: political violence, expropriation and inconvertibility of currency.
The agency's economic importance is hard to overstate. While some private insurers do sell such "political risk" insurance, they cannot match the agency's low premiums and long-term coverage. By law, the agency is required to help private insurers develop such products but, in the meantime, the agency is invaluable if American businesses are to invest confidently overseas.
HERE'S one of many examples. In 1989, General Electric wanted to invest $150 million in the privatization of Tungsram, a Hungarian lighting products company. But G.E. was unwilling to proceed without insurance, and unable to buy it privately. So G.E. got the Federal insurance instead -- and the project became a reality.
Created by statute in 1971, the agency operates in more than 130 countries. Hundreds of American companies -- including American Express, Caterpillar, Citibank and McDonald's, as well as G.E. -- use the agency's services. All told, the agency participates in $7.2 billion in private foreign investment each year, primarily through insurance but also through foreign-investment loans to small businesses and loan guaranties. And it does so efficiently. Its staff of under 150 operates out of a single office in Washington, and its administrative budget is less than $20 million.
Congress must expand this tiny but productive insurer. The demand is certainly there. Last year, American companies asked the agency for $12 billion in insurance and loans for projects in the former Soviet Union alone. That sum substantially exceeded the agency's total yearly insurance and lending authority.
A larger agency makes sense in other ways too. For one, it's economical. Agency income from premiums, loan interest and its own investments more than cover its cost to taxpayers; indeed, since its inception the agency has returned to the Treasury Department a net profit of $1.5 billion -- even counting the hundreds of millions of dollars paid in claims to insured businesses.
Moreover, as a market-driven program, the agency is in tune with the times. Businesses pay their own premiums and it is their own capital that is at risk overseas -- not the taxpayers'. If the ventures fail, the private parties will feel pain along with the agency. This approach avoids the inefficiencies of loan guarantees, with which taxpayers subsidize failure, and of foreign aid, which just gives taxpayer money away..
As Washington puzzles over the big question of economic change around the globe, it should know that part of the answer can be found right in town, in a very small agency on New York Avenue, just a few blocks from the White House.

HEADLINE: HAITIAN MILITARY AND ARISTIDE SIGN PACT TO END CRISIS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
Ending a week of uncertainty and bitter recriminations, Haiti's exiled President and the army commander who ousted him signed an accord yesterday providing for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to power and for democracy to be restored to the country by Oct. 30.
After Father Aristide signed the accord last night on Governors Island in New York Harbor, he made a brief statement, saying: "To all of the international community, peace and love. Peace and love to the Haitian people." 
 The United Nations mediator, Dante Caputo, speaking later, thanked President Aristide for his flexibility. Mr. Caputo also said there were "no side letters and no hidden agenda."
The separate signings by Father Aristide and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras came on a day of high tension in which it sometimes appeared that the deposed President would reject the agreement. Father Aristide was angered that the settlement did not provide for the quick retirement of the army high command, aides said.
Diplomats said he yielded after repeated assurances that the international community would see to it that the accords would be respected. Even then, an adviser to Father Aristide said, the Haitian President was "not at all comfortable," but diplomats said little pressure was required.
 
21 Months After Army Coup
 Father Aristide finally signed the accord shortly before 11 P.M. yesterday, roughly 21 months after the military coup that plunged Haiti into crippling economic isolation and led to a frantic boat exodus of tens of thousands.
At 10:40 P.M., Father Aristide and several aides entered the room where General Cedras had earlier signed the agreement. The exiled President then exchanged signatures and broad grins with United Nations mediators amid applause.
Father Aristide's representative in Washington, Jean Casimir, in a brief statement after the signing, said that the "coup leaders' departure, and the President's immediate return, have been the most sensitive concerns of the negotiations," but that the results were "a great day in the history of the entire hemisphere and of Haiti."
The accord, which General Cedras had signed about 11:30 in the morning, opens the way for a political conference this week in which President Aristide's aides and Haitian political parties will begin work on forming a Government and preparing for his return.
 
A Week of Uncertainty
 A leftist Roman Catholic priest, Father Aristide was elected with an overwhelming mandate in Haiti's first democratic presidential elections in December 1990. He has been in exile since he was overthrown in a military coup on Sept. 30, 1991.
The delay in Father Aristide's signing was in keeping with the uncertainty, frustration and sudden reversals that characterized the six days of negotiations on Governors Island. Late yesterday morning, shortly before General Cedras entered the brick Officers' Club to sign the pact, diplomats said grimly that they expected Father Aristide to reject the settlement.
On Friday, his objections to the settlement centered mainly on the timetable for his return to power. After 21 months of exile, he chafed at the prospect of waiting almost four more months to be restored to office.
 
Issue of Officers' Fate
 But the major sticking point to the agreement yesterday was disappointment on the President's team that members of the Haitian high command would not necessarily be removed from the armed forces for their role in the coup, but could be simply reassigned by a new commander who is to be chosen by Father Aristide shortly before his return in October.
"That was a shock to us," said one member of Father Aristide's delegation, who expressed anger that General Cedras could not be asked to delay his departure for more negotiations on this point. The commander left New York on a flight for Haiti after signing the agreement yesterday morning.
Father Aristide was worried that the commander and other senior officers who took part in the September 1991 coup could resort to violence or intimidation to frustrate his return, diplomats and aides said. Human rights experts estimate that anywhere from 500 to 3,000 people have been killed by the military since the 1991 coup.
 
Mediator's Exasperation
 This morning General Cedras was ushered out of the signing room at one point while Mr. Caputo, the United Nations mediator and a former Argentine Foreign Minister, held a series of last-minute telephone conversations with one of Father Aristide's top advisers, Michael D. Barnes.
 
Caputo 'Fed Up'
 Minutes earlier, alluding to Father Aristide's objections, Mr. Caputo whispered to a reporter: "He will have to answer to history. I am fed up."
Throughout months of negotiations, diplomats have said, Father Aristide has often changed tack, shifting from a mood of patient deliberation to adamant rejection of concessions.
By holding out until the last minute, Father Aristide grated on the nerves of many diplomats. But the delay helped the exiled President to obtain assurances that his most bitter enemies among army leaders would "either resign or leave the country," as one person involved in the negotiations said.
"The way we have left it is that they have conveyed to Caputo and Caputo conveyed to us that they will leave the high command or they will leave the country," a senior adviser to Father Aristide said of the military leadership.
The transition outlined in the settlement also called for Father Aristide to propose a new Prime Minister who would require the approval of Haiti's parliament before forming a new Government. Once the choice of prime minister is ratified by parliament, diplomats said, international aid will resume and countries will suspend sanctions against Haiti, including an oil embargo imposed last month by the United Nations.
 
Sanctions Hinge on Transition
 If Father Aristide is not restored by Oct. 30, diplomats said, the sanctions will automatically be reimposed. If the transition is successful, the penalties will be revoked by the Secretary General of the United Nations.
After Father Aristide has chosen a new prime minister, a selection that could come as early as this week, and his choice is ratified, a "$1 billion plus" aid program to Haiti will begin almost immediately, diplomats said.
Diplomats said the aid program for the desperately impoverished country would be vast, encompassing virtually all areas of society, from the separation of the police from the army and reforms in both institutions to technical help in building a new and professional civil service. Almost immediately, officials planning the aid said, officials will focus on creating thousands of new jobs to help revive an economy near collapse.
Lawrence E. Pezzullo, President Clinton's special adviser for Haitian affairs, said the package, to be provided by the United States and several other international donors, represented "a big commitment of money into a society to make it viable."
 
'A Long Journey'
 "It's been a long journey," Mr. Pezzullo said as he left the Officers' Club. "I feel good."
First, however, the Haitian political parties meeting with representatives of Father Aristide are to decide on a plan to purge the current Parliament of lawmakers who were elected last January in a vote that the United Nations and many others have denounced as illegitimate.
To do so, the parties represented in Parliament would be required to agree on what to do with the empty seats. Immediately afterward, diplomats said, attention will turn to ratifying the President's choice of a new prime minister, who is expected to be a independent political figure.
Asked what would happen if the Haitians could not agree among themselves, as has often been the case in the recent past, one diplomat said, "If they dicker away their time, that is their responsibility." Meanwhile, sanctions will remain in effect.
"This is, as far as I know, certainly the first time in the Western Hemisphere, that a sitting President who has been expelled has then been restored to power through international pressure," said Robert White, a senior member of Father Aristide's negotiating team.
"It is a tremendous success for all of the parties, Haiti, Caputo, the United States, certainly. Aristide showed that he has flexibility and that he is able to take decisions even when people in his movement are concerned."
A Haitian member of Father Aristide's delegation, Jean Dominique, expressing satisfaction with the accord, said: "No one can despair for the future of democracy in Haiti because for 21 months of dictatorship we have had a people that has never hung its head. That's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: 7 Rich Nations Expecting Little At Tokyo Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 3

 BODY:
Struggling with slow economic growth, high unemployment and bitter trade disputes, the leaders of the world's seven wealthiest nations will gather here for their annual summit meeting next week amid widespread doubts that they will make much progress in setting the global economy on a more prosperous course.
Negotiations on resolving the remaining differences among the so-called Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- are continuing and may yet produce modest agreements on liberalizing the world trading system, pumping new life into the industrial economies and providing financial assistance to Russia. 
 But some economists and government officials say there may be a deeper message in the contentious discussions leading up to this year's gathering, which opens Wednesday in the lavish Akasaka Palace.
 
Group's Unity Is Weakened
 The ambitious form that these annual economic conferences have taken, they say, may have been better suited to the more prosperous and confident 1980's than the current era of economic insecurity. The group's unity of purpose has been frayed by tough domestic problems in each country and politically weakened leaders.
"The tone, the atmosphere, the ideas that are discussed may be far more important than anything specific that comes out of the communique," President Clinton told a group of reporters on Friday, in an apparent attempt to lower expectations. "It is what direction are we going to take the world."
Horst Kohler, a senior German Finance Ministry official involved in preparing the conference, said, "The outlook is sobering."
 
Clinton to Be Scrutinized
 President Clinton's performance will be watched closely, in part because this will be his first summit meeting and in part because he had campaigned on a promise that he would focus more on domestic issues.
His hand will be strengthened by his recent success in advancing his budget deficit-reduction program in Congress, since that is what the other countries have been demanding of the United States for several years. But the tough issues here will present Mr. Clinton with a difficult test in his first overseas trip as President.
Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary during the four summit meetings under President George Bush, said some past conferences received more credit than they deserved. The gatherings, he said, can help prevent looming disasters and provide a good forum for an exchange of ideas. But they usually cannot do more than give added impetus to developments that are already taking place, like exchange-rate movements.
"If the stars are already lined up, you can push things ahead in a direction they were already pointed. But if you aren't that lucky, there is a limit to what you can do," Mr. Brady said.
Those limits have been accentuated this year by domestic concerns in each of the seven countries. The industrialized world's economies will expand by just 1.2 percent this year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the third year of sub-par growth.
 
Strained Relations
 Unemployment remains at a stubbornly high 8.5 percent for the 24 countries that are members of the organization, and it is expected to rise to 8.6 percent next year, a total of 36 million people out of work.
Relations between the countries have also been strained. Japan and the United States have been engaged in bitter negotiations, not over substantive trade problems, but simply over the framework for future trade talks. The European Community is finding its vision of unity tested by the economic problems of its members.
Germany, Europe's economic locomotive, is expected to see its economy contract by 2 percent this year, and is facing continuing violence against immigrants. Indeed, tight national budgets and unemployment are creating social problems in many Group of Seven countries.
In addition, President Clinton and Prime Minister John Major of Britain are struggling against low approval ratings at home that have limited their ability to fashion compromises. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, who lost a no-confidence motion in Parliament last month, and appears likely to be forced from office after elections in two weeks. As chairman of the summit meeting, he is thus likely to have even less ability than usual to force the parties to reach agreements.
"There are seven ships out at sea, and usually the head of each state remains on the bridge setting their course," said Makoto Utsumi, an economics professor and former top Japanese Finance Ministry official who has been involved in several summit meetings. "But at the moment the captains are all down in the engine rooms."
 
Some Meetings Make History
 The Presidents and Prime Ministers of the leading industrial countries have met each year since 1974 to share ideas, set the global agenda and tackle world economic problems. Some meetings have made history, like the one on July 18, 1991, when Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then President of the Soviet Union, joined the group's leaders in London and asked for financial assistance. Others, like the Paris conference of 1989, which focused on stemming trade in narcotics and the laundering of illegal drug profits, made less of an impact.
This year, the leaders need to conclude negotiations on the long-stalled guidelines for a more open world trading system, to stimulate their faltering economies and to help finance Russia's transformation into a market economy. There is also likely to be some agreement on a plan to reduce the debt of the world's poorest developing nations, officials said.
There will also be discussion of critical political issues. The conference will try to achieve a common position on halting the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on whether to condemn Iran over accusations that it supporting terrorism, commits human rights abuses and is trying to build arsenals of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
But the signs of discord on the economic issues have been conspicuous. For instance, France has said it will refuse to free its agriculture markets as long as the United States threatens to increase duties on steel imports. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur called last-ditch attempts to work out a trade deal "rather stupid," and added, "There will be no accord on market access in Tokyo."
 
GATT Talks Threatened
 This attitude threatens completion of what is called the Uruguay Round of negotiations to rejuvenate the trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Each of the past three summit meetings promised that the talks would be concluded by the end of the years in which they were held.
Japan has rebuffed calls that it cut taxes and increase Government spending to stimulate its anemic economy, which is expected to grow only about 1 percent in 1993. A stronger economy would reduce Japan's huge trade surplus -- expected to reach $160 billion this year -- and lift other economies.
Japanese officials have refused to take such steps, saying the two stimulus packages they have announced in the last year are enough.

HEADLINE: Boom in Boating Crowds the Summer Sea

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POINT PLEASANT, N.J., July 3

 BODY:
It was high noon last Saturday and weekend drivers who only hours before had jammed the New Jersey Turnpike or Garden State Parkway were hopping out of cars and into boats.
"They operate their vessels the way they drive their cars, only with less knowledge and skill," said Michael Yannuzzi, the New Jersey Marine Police officer at the helm of a 40-foot patrol boat cutting slowly along the Manasquan River near Point Pleasant. 
 Ahead loomed an armada of pleasure craft. Fat ocean-going cabin cruisers plowed up a huge wake, leaving crabbers in 12-foot boats fighting to keep from capsizing. Two high-performance craft with bows like knives engaged in the waterborne equivalent of a drag race as sailboat skippers -- with terror and anger on their faces -- angled out of their paths.
 
Many Potential Dangers
 All the while Jet Skis, Waverunners and other high-powered personal watercraft darted about.
"The wonder of it all is why more people aren't killed," muttered Sgt. Erich Herkloz, a state trooper who commands a Marine Police station. It is a comment shared across the region and the nation as America's 20 million pleasure craft take to waters that are increasingly congested.
But despite the potential dangers, pleasure boating is largely an unregulated pastime that invites freedom from the cares of landlocked lives. No states require licenses for adults to operate boats and only some states require children to have boating safety certificates. In many states, law enforcement is fragmented between several agencies with only a handful of marine officers assigned to patrol long stretches of water.
Prosperity in the 1980's helped increase the number of powerful boats once considered too costly for most Americans. Summer weekends bring the boats out in undisciplined swarms along the Jersey Shore, Long Island Sound and other waterways, raising concerns about safety and noise.
In New Jersey, as in most states, no boat speed limits are imposed unless posted to reduce wakes at marinas or in very narrow channels. High-powered racing boats thunder across shallow rivers and bays at speeds not tolerated for automobiles on land.
"There are very few quiet places near the water," said Nelson Potter, director of the marine and recreational vehicle department of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
But safety is the main issue that worries Mr. Potter and other experts who say that most of the region's recreational boaters have had no formal training in boat operation and many do not possess even rudimentary information on safety rules.
 
Number of Deaths Is Low
 Yet despite the growing congestion, the number of deaths from pleasure boating is low, compared to the number of highway deaths. In fact boating deaths have declined steadily for a quarter-century, dropping from 1,418 in 1970 to 1,360 in 1980 and 816 in 1992, a period in which the Coast Guard estimates that the number of pleasure boats jumped from 7.4 million to 20 million. But the drop is mostly in the category of drownings after falls off boats or sinkings.
A category that has climbed is the number of deaths and serious injuries from vessel collisions, according to the Coast Guard. In 1970 boats ramming one another caused 55 deaths and 232 injuries requiring hospitalization; by last year the figures were 79 and 1,369.
Connecticut just became the first state in the nation to pass a law requiring a certain level of boating proficiency. Under the law, by 1997 all operators of motor boats must demonstrate knowledge of boat operation by taking a safety course or a test. Delaware, Maryland and Vermont recently passed similar laws, but they are not as far reaching.
 
Public Support for Licensing
 Some states, like New Jersey and New York, require minors to be certified to operate power boats, but Mr. Potter and other safety experts said lobbyists for boat manufacturers have blocked bills seeking to make adult education mandatory.
And although studies have shown that the public supports licensing of recreational boaters it faces resistance nearly everywhere, said William Gossard, program manager for recreational boating safety in the National Transportation and Safety Board.
"We see licensing coming but it is being fought by 30 percent of the boaters who want no rules at all and the groups that are owned by the boating industry," Mr. Gossard said.
"Licensing is a nasty word to many people," said Capt. William Gronikowsky, supervisor of New Jersey's Marine Police. "There is an outcry for us to take more action against reckless individuals who say no one can tell them how to run their own boats. But it's very frustrating that we don't have the enforcement tools, like the threat of suspending an operating license."
 
Personal Craft Popular
 But even responsible boat owners resist further regulation.
"We strongly support programs to phase in mandatory boating education for all owners and operators," said Michael Sciulla, vice president of governmental affairs for BOAT/U.S., an association of 450,000 boat owners. "But we do not believe that paying the state for a license is going to significantly improve a rather remarkable safety record."
Drownings in bathtubs and pools claimed nearly as many lives last year as boating accidents did, Mr. Sciulla said.
One category that causes particular concern among boating safety experts is personal watercraft, like Jet Skis, which represented 25 percent of all power boat sales in 1992 and now number more than 350,000.
"They're a lot of fun, like motorcycles, but out on the water if you wipe out you don't get hurt," said Thomas Riley, 25, a truck driver from Philadelphia who rented a Jet Ski for three hours at Seaside Heights.
Not all landings are soft. While personal watercraft represent only 1 of every 60 power craft in America, they are involved in one-third of all collisions that result in serious injury.
Another concern of boating experts is the fragmented responsibility for law enforcement. New Jersey is the only state in the region that has a State Police bureau responsible for boat safety and enforcement. In New York the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation regulates policy through the Department of Environmental Protection, with conservation officers sharing enforcement with local authorities like the Harbor Patrol of the New York City Police Department, the Marine Bureau of the Nassau County Police Department and the police in towns on Long Island.
 
A Push for Boating Standards
 This spring, the National Transportation Safety Board urged the states to enact uniform pleasure-boating standards to reduce the number and severity of accidents. It recommended the mandatory use of life jackets or similar equipment for children, tougher laws on alcohol consumption while operating a boat and adult boat safety education.
The extent of alcohol use in recreational boating "cannot be adequately documented," the safety board said, because states vary on the compilation of information. In a study of fatalities the board estimated that "at least 37 percent" of boat operators involved in fatal accidents have some alcohol in their systems.
The issue attracted widespread attention three months ago when two Cleveland Indians pitchers, Steve Olin and Tim Crews, were killed when their 18-foot boat hit a dock on a lake near Orlando, Fla. Investigators later determined that Mr. Crews, the driver, was legally intoxicated.
New Jersey and Connecticut have no requirements about life jackets for children; New York requires children under 12 to wear them on boats less than 26 feet long. New York recently joined New Jersey in adopting a requirement that boat operators consent to alcohol impairment tests or face loss of boating privileges. Connecticut has no such requirement.
But no matter what laws are in place, officials say that resources for enforcement are so small that violations usually go unnoticed. The Coast Guard, whose chief mission is search and rescue, works closely with the states within the three-mile continental limits and tidal areas, and Federal money augments state patrol expenditures in lean economic times.
In New Jersey, budget constraints have cut the Marine Police to 150 officers, who patrol the state's lakes and waterways, including 127 miles of Atlantic coastline and 1,750 miles of interior tidal shoreline. The officers are also responsible for pollution control and anti-narcotics policing. "We just don't have the manpower to cover our beat," said Sergeant Herkloz.
 
Few Patrols
 Federal money earmarked for overtime pay will help beef up patrols this summer, said Captain Gronikowsky, the Marine Police supervisor in Trenton. But last weekend, on a beautiful day that produced heavy boat traffic, only one 20-foot patrol boat with two officers was on duty between Shark River in Monmouth County and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County.
The same goes for some areas of New York State, Mr. Potter said. "Whole stretches of the Hudson River are not covered," he said.

HEADLINE: Muted Reaction in District That Court Opposed

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. July 2

 BODY:
From its vantage point, the Supreme Court defined the racial politics of North Carolina's 12th District, redrawn to elect a black member of Congress, in dire terms, likening it to "political apartheid." But those who live and work in the long and skinny district in the Carolina Piedmont view the issue in far more muted terms.
From the pungent-smelling tobacco warehouses to the rusty textile mills, people of both races joke about their amoeba-shaped district, which follows Interstate 85 linking predominantly black neighborhoods of Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Greensboro and Durham. What is termed "racial gerrymandering" in Washington, they call "the ketchup spill" here. 
 "Times have changed," said Renee Jarrett, a freshman at Johnson C. Smith University, a black college in Charlotte. "Whites are more likely to vote for blacks now, although the new district makes it less likely minorities will sit on their butts and not vote."
In an unscientific series of interviews with more than 30 citizens around the district, the fault lines seemed fluid or ambivalent. Some blacks broke with civil rights advocates by expressing discomfort with the concept of drawing political boundaries along racial lines.
 
Some Urban Unity
 And many whites, who make up more than 40 percent of the district, said they felt well served by their representative, Melvin Watt, a 47-year-old Democrat who is the first black to represent the region in Congress in this century. A few said that Mr. Watt actually reflected their views better than their former white representatives, who were attuned to rural areas.
Autrey Van Pelt, a 61-year-old clerk in the Gastonia city hall, who voted against Mr. Watt last November, said she was distressed by the notion of rezoning to favor blacks. Nevertheless, she said, "I don't feel like I'm less represented." Saying she had come to see the freshman Congressman in a new light, she added, "I can still vote and voice the way I feel."
But such reactions here may not be typical of those in more than a dozen other districts around the country, where minority representatives potentially face similar challenges from white voters claiming discrimination.
The textile centers of the North Carolina Piedmont have long been an oasis of relative racial harmony. Settled by Scottish and Irish farmers, the Piedmont was a Republican area that opposed secession during the Civil War. Many neighborhoods are integrated, and Charlotte twice elected a black mayor in the 1980's even though a majority of its population is white.
 
No Pressing Concern
 Though the High Court's ruling promises to be in court for months, there has yet to be any audible protest.
"It's not a matter of life and death," said Herbert L. White, managing editor of The Charlotte Post, an influential black newspaper. "There has been no discernible increase in racial tension."
The Post, a weekly, postponed for a week an article on the legal issues of the case, preferring to devote the immediate issue to opportunities for black businessmen if Charlotte attracts a professional football franchise.
Mr. White's editorial decision reflects a widely expressed attitude that seems to place a higher priority on economic issues than on racial considerations in the district.
To be sure, many blacks say they are proud of Mr. Watt, 47, who grew up in a tin-roofed shack without electricity. A few said they were more likely to turn to a black than a white Congressman for help. Still, some blacks say they still need an advantage at the ballot box to assure the election of representatives who share their concerns.
Linda Ramsey, a 41-year-old nurse's assistant, said, "I'm not a racist but I personally relate better to blacks." Visiting Mr. Watt's Charlotte office in appreciation for his help in seeking a Navy transfer closer to home for her son, she added, "We do need a black man to represent us because he knows where we're coming from."
 
Some Voice Complaints
 Some whites expressed misgivings that their choice at the ballot box now appears to be narrowed to only black candidates.
At the Carolina Steel Plant in Greensboro, where groups of blacks and whites sit at separate tables in the sweltering cinderblock mess hall, Gene Hurley called the reapportioned district "a lot of bunk."
The 55-year-old crane operator, munching potato chips on his dinner break, added: "It's violating the white voters' rights. That's democracy: you do it to them before they do it to you."
While getting a shave at the Spindle Center barber shop in Gastonia early Thursday morning, Charles Henderson, a 63-year-old retired telephone installer who is white, said: "There's a Dad Jim drunk that laid out the district because of the way it's shaped and what they tried to accomplish. As an old country boy, I say we had a pretty good system before this."
Virtually all residents of both races appear aware of the Supreme Court decision, which requires a lower court to reassess the complaints of five white litigants who claim the district's linking of otherwise distinct communities constitutes a racial quota system.
 
Contrast of Tones
 But few expressions of concern here, even by the harshest critics of the district's odd appearance or the Supreme Court's decision, echoed the sharp words in the Court's 5-to-4 decision.
In her majority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor thundered against "political apartheid," and suggested that "the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past."
In response, Mr. Watt called the decision "intellectually dishonest." He added, "The notion that a black Representative can't represent white folks is ridiculous."
The 12th district was created in 1991 because North Carolina had not had a black Representative since 1900. After the North Carolina Legislature created one minority district, the Justice Department ordered that a second be created to offer blacks representation in proportion to their 22 percent of the state population.
The case now goes to a special panel at Federal District Court in Raleigh. The state is expected to argue that there is a "compelling state interest" underlying the strange shape of the district: that urban dwellers as well as blacks deserve representation of their own in predominantly rural North Carolina.
Whatever the lower court's decision, the matter is likely to go back to the Supreme Court.
But more often than not, blacks and whites in this overwhelmingly Democratic district expressed their opinions about Mr. Watt and redistricting in economic, not racial terms.
If Mr. Watt's district is redrawn and he suddenly faces a serious challenge at the polls, he should think about taking up smoking. He is roundly unpopular at the sprawling R. J. Reynolds cigarette plant dotted with little plaques that say, "Thank you for smoking."
Inside the factory, speaking over the din of forklifts transporting freshly packed Winstons, Steven Floyd, a 39-year-old black machinist, said Mr. Watt would have to join other North Carolina representatives in fighting proposals to increase cigarette taxes to gain his support in the next election.
"I can live with the new district," he added, "but I wish they didn't have to create a district to have a black representative."

HEADLINE: Vermont Debates Value of Saving a Rural Image

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHREWSBURY, Vt.

 BODY:
Marjorie Pierce sat on the porch of her 158-year-old general store, gazing upon her garden of blue lupines, the lush meadow and the Green Mountains against the evening sky.
"It doesn't look endangered from here," said Miss Pierce, a former high school French teacher who celebrated her 90th birthday in May at the Town Hall with several hundred neighbors, including Senator James M. Jeffords. 
 But the view from Miss Pierce's hilltop store in Shrewsbury (population 1,800) is not the only window into Vermont. In June, the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated the state as one of America's 11 most "endangered historic places," the first time an entire state made the list.
The distinction -- although a symbolic one with no legal weight -- has fueled the debate over a fundamental question here: should Vermont be quaint forever? Or should it open the way to unpredictable development?
Can Vermont allow Wal-Mart to cross its borders and still be the mythic Vermont of small towns and gentle mountains? For now, Vermont, Hawaii and Alaska are the only states without a branch of the discount chain from Bentonville, Ark.
 
State With Identity Crisis
 To meander from the Vermont Book Shop in Middlebury to the old red brick City Hall in Rutland to the W. E. Pierce Country Store in Shrewsbury is to see a state with an identity crisis. To many people here, Vermont has been under siege for years, and these days, more cows can be found on T-shirts than in the pastures.
Miss Pierce sees the changes every time she gets into her 1966 Volkswagen and drives to Rutland (population 18,000), 10 miles away, to buy groceries at the Price Chopper. "They're talking about putting a mall just outside Rutland," she said. "I'm worried that there's too much development coming in, and that will bring a change in our life style."
That mall, along with Wal-Mart's plans to build two huge stores in Vermont, had much to do with the preservation group's decision to put this state on its list.
 
Change of Character
 "It clearly could change the nature and character of Vermont if they succeed in putting in these malls," said Richard Moe, the president of the nonprofit trust, adding that he had fallen in love with Vermont as a student at Williams College, just across the border in Massachusetts.
But character has not been paying the bills in Rutland. Mayor Jeffrey Wennberg says he appreciates the small-town charm of Vermont as much as any out-of-towner, or flatlander as they are called here. "I got married in Woodstock because the backgrounds are great," he said. "Woodstock is Hollywood's image of Vermont."
And it sells. Woodstock has a manicured village green, a covered bridge, antiques stores and $100-a-night bed and breakfasts where New Yorkers dream on four-poster beds with Laura Ashley sheets. Tourism is the state's third-largest revenue producer, after manufacturing and services.
Still, Woodstock is not Rutland.
Rutland is the shuttered stores of a once-vibrant downtown, and the General Electric jet-engine-parts plant, which has cut 500 of its 1,600 jobs since 1991. Rutland is people who buy Wilcox ice cream because it is cheaper than the Ben & Jerry's made in Waterbury by two millionaires from New York, and it is people who have to drive 55 miles to Glen Falls, N.Y., to buy a washing machine at Sears.
After a six-year battle with environmentalists, Mayor Wennberg hopes ground will be broken this summer on a $40 million shopping mall in Rutland that will include Sears, Kmart, J. C. Penney's and perhaps a Gap. "Even Vermonters need to shop," said the Mayor, a Republican who was recently elected to his fourth term.
More important, he said, the mall will mean 800 jobs, though they will be mostly part-time and will not pay anywhere near the $15 an hour General Electric pays.
 
Environmental Vanguard
 A lot of people were surprised that one of the country's most environmentally progressive states -- it was the first to ban billboards and the second to enact a bottle-deposit law -- ended up on the trust's 1993 list.
With a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Wennberg one day in June unrolled a 50-foot-long computer printout across the lawn of City Hall. It detailed the maze of state environmental regulations that the developer had to negotiate to win approval for its mall.
"Our regulations are beyond Byzantine," he said. Although he acknowledged that those regulations have helped keep Vermont relatively unspoiled, he and others say economic growth has been severely inhibited.
Miss Pierce, for one, misses the money she and her 79-year-old brother, Gordon, used to make pumping gas. The red pump their father put in at the general store around 1923 became a museum piece three years ago when state inspectors ruled that the gas tank had to be replaced by an environmentally correct, double-lined model. "We estimated it would have cost more than $15,000," she said. "And neither of us is going to live long enough to make that back."
Coincidental to the preservation group's ominous report, a poll made public in June by the Becker Institute of Massachusetts, a market-research organization in Sudbury, Mass., showed a drastic shift in Vermonters' attitudes toward the environment, with 54 percent of those surveyed ranking economic development as their top priority, while 40 percent put the environment first. Several years ago, the poll found that 58 percent of Vermonters listed strict environmental protection as their top priority, with only 35 percent listing economic development as a "very high" priority.
 
Preservation Too Costly
 "We can't afford to turn this into a social game preserve for the elite," Mayor Wennberg said, talking of the competition for economic development with states like New Hampshire.
But New Hampshire, with its condominium explosion, is just what many people here do not want Vermont to become. Noel Perrin, a writer who commutes by electric car from his home in Thetford Center, Vt., to his job as a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., remarked, "New Hampshire is not on the endangered list because New Hampshire's already gone."
Still, Vermont is not a museum. Things change. Dike Blair plans to sell the legendary 45-year-old Vermont Book Shop in Middlebury, which Mr. Blair's friend, Robert Frost, patronized. The buyer, Mr. Blair said, is a lawyer from New Jersey "who has decided he wants to live in Vermont."
And in Woodstock, 88-year-old Larry Angwin was auctioning off the contents of his three-bedroom house: the beds, the china plates with painted roses -- and the Aug. 19, 1950 cover of the Saturday Evening Post, a Norman Rockwell illustration of a man in bed smoking a cigar and playing solitaire.
It was a picture of Larry Angwin 43 years ago. "I posed for him," said Mr. Angwin. "He paid me $5 by check. I never should have cashed it." This time around, the auctioneer bought the cover for $5.
The image of Vermont has a way of swallowing the reality. Across the brook from Mr. Angwin's house is a Victorian inn where a harpist plays during cocktails. And in May, when Mr. Angwin moved to a senior-citizen residence in Woodstock, the urban refugees who own the inn bought his house.

HEADLINE: China's Peasantry Takes Measure of Its Prosperity

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PAN SHI, China

 BODY:
Ignoring a light drizzle, the women emerged from their houses carrying small plates of potatoes, goose livers and pickled cucumbers, and placed them on tables clustered outside a shiny white three-story house.
The focus of attention was a tiny boy bundled up like a bushy red ball and cradled in the arms of his new mother. He had just turned one month old, a magic age in the hardscrabble Chinese countryside, traditionally signifying that a baby is likely to survive, and nearly a hundred peasants had come with gifts of little red packets bulging with money. 
 "He's the first son," said Mai Shunjing, the scrawny grandfather, as he let out a smile filled with broken teeth and big aspirations. "This is an important day for our family."
Half a dozen years ago, there would have been a similar celebration, but without the food, the money or the wine. Life has overwhelmingly improved over the last six years, even the last six months, for the 440 people in Pan Shi, a village in a land of rich, rolling rice paddies in southern China's Guangdong Province.
 
Well Off and Typical
 Pan Shi (pronounced pahn sher) is a bit wealthier than the average Chinese village, but customs and conditions here are still fairly indicative of how China's 900 million peasants -- three-quarters of the nation's population and nearly 17 percent of the world's -- go through life.
The great issues that absorb residents of Beijing, and through them catch the attention of the West, are of subdued interest here. The peasants seem little interested in challenging the Government on freedom of expression, for instance, preferring to put their energies into defying Government limits on having children.
They do not seem intrigued by macroeconomic questions, like whether China's economy now trails only that of the United States and Japan, but rather by such mundane matters as whether they will be able to afford running water instead of having to fetch water from a well.
Yet even here, the peasants feel vulnerable to what happens 1,000 miles away in the capital. The Communist Party's policies may change tomorrow. Or some official may arbitrarily decide to ruin one family or another.
"Our life is so much better now than before, but in China, you never can tell what the Government will do," said a young entrepreneur who runs a factory in another village. "I don't know how long this economic policy will last. So whenever I get the chance, I'm going abroad. Life is stable in America."
 
Knowing When to Clam Up
 While they may not know much about politics, the peasants here in Pan Shi know enough to clam up when the topic comes up. As the festivities for his grandson continued over a 10-dish banquet by the porch, Mr. Mai turned sheepish when asked what he thought about the growing gaps between the rich and the poor.
He managed a faint smile before mumbling something about there being no gaps at all. Immediately, however, his son came to his rescue, and Mr. Mai slipped away.
"We don't talk politics in this house," said Jinsheng, his 29-year-old elder son. "My father has suffered too much in his life, from the Cultural Revolution, from this and that movement.
"He is old and afraid. I don't want anything to happen to him again because of politics. I have to protect my father. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here today."
 
Politics Is Passive
 For most villagers, politics is not an interactive process but a passive one. A new political movement means that they must change the slogans on the village walls, or -- worse yet -- attend silly meetings instead of working the fields.
To be sure, the Government now holds elections for village chief, but only one person runs. That is partly because villagers cannot quite imagine a political race, and partly because it is no longer a very attractive position.
"Most people don't want to do that kind of work," said Chen Qiumei, a 33-year-old woman with two children, both boys. "The Government wants you to do a lot of work that offends other people."
A few others echoed her view. In a place where much of life is lived outside, there are few secrets. The village leaders often have take sides with one villager over another.
 
Spying for Family Planning
 The worst part is reporting on mothers who get pregnant for a second, third or fourth time. The village chief risks being regarded as a traitor for turning in his friends.
Mai Ruiqian, a 46-year-old sturdy fellow with a rounding stomach, became the new Mayor this year. He is a member of the Mai clan that dominates the village: nearly all men are named Mai, and only their wives, who came from other villages, have other surnames. It is common in China for a village to be made up of a single clan, and many villages are known only by the surname of the people who live there: the Mai Village, the Wu Village, and so on.
One sign that the job is not as enviable as it was in the past is that the last chief declined to run for a second term. Still, Mayor Mai says he has found a way around the difficulty of picking on his neighbors: He leaves the troublesome tasks to his superiors in the township government a few miles away.
"The township sends its family planning people here," Mr. Mai said, expressing relief that he does not have to worry much about it. "They have the family planning rosters."
 
A Phone but No One to Call
 Mr. Mai enjoys a few perks, like lunching in the township with officials nearly every day. But there are problems: arranging for water for crops and for more electricity to meet the growing demands of modernization. In a small triumph, the village also got a public phone recently; the only problem is that since few peasants have a phone, there is no one to call.
The phone, however, is a sign that the peasants are pretty well off in Pan Shi. Indeed, in addition to the public phone, two families have their own phones -- not including the Mayor.
Being moderately well off, in Pan Shi's case, means that peasants here earn an average of about $175 per person per year, instead of the national average for peasants of about $125. The figure may be a bit misleading because the peasants grow most of their food themselves and have few expenses.
Another reason they are doing well is that people throughout this region called Taishan have many relatives in Hong Kong, the United States and Canada. Taishanese is still a common dialect in Chinatowns in the United States, although in the last few decades it has been partly eclipsed by Cantonese and, more recently, Mandarin.
The gates to Pan Shi itself are a reminder of the overseas connection, having been built with money sent home from migrants abroad and carrying a tablet with the names of dozens of contributors.
 
Plastic for the Crops
 Still, it was only when someone here introduced a new farming technique -- protecting the vegetable crops with plastic covers -- that life for everyone seemed to get better. The plastic serves to keep moisture in the soil and protect the vegetables from freezing, and the practice has since become widespread throughout China.
Mai Caidong, 26, is among the new entrepreneurs who are branching in new directions. Not content simply to spend her days wading in the rice paddies or bending over the cabbages, she is taking advantage of opportunities to go into business.
Up at 3:30 A.M., she and her husband roar off on their motorcycle to the Taishan city center every day to sell fruit and vegetables, a business that brings them about $2,600 a year. Last year, they saved $1,700 of that in the bank, although Ms. Mai recently diversified her assets by investing some of that in a gold necklace from Hong Kong and other jewelry.
"They let us go into private enterprise, and most people don't feel bad if they stay behind in the village," said Ms. Mai, sitting in her clean, spacious living room. "Of course, my husband wants to go to Guangzhou and set up a rice shop."

HEADLINE: 3 More Victims of Serial Killer Are Identified

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGDALE, L.I., July 3

 BODY:
Two women who have been missing since 1991 and a third whose body was found on Monday were identified today by state police here as victims of a serial killer who the police say confessed to slaying 17 women.
The women came from varied backgrounds, with police saying that one was a methadone user who frequented Allen Street in Manhattan, a common haunt for prostitutes, while another was an unemployed accountant who lived at home with her family in Suffolk County. 
 But all of them, the police believe, were strangled over the last two years by Joel Rifkin, 34, an unemployed landscaper who appears to be the most prolific serial killer in New York history.
Mr. Rifkin, of East Meadow, was arrested on Monday morning after New York State Police discovered a woman's body in the back of his truck. Later that day, the police said he confessed to killing 17 women and dumping their bodies throughout the region, from Putnam County to the eastern tip of Long Island. Since then, law-enforcement officials have been trying to check his claims.
 
Link to 13 Killings
 This evening, the police said, they had identified the woman whose body was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's truck as Tiffany Bresciani, 22, of Manhattan. She apparently was last seen on Allen Street around June 24. Several women there earlier in the week said she was a fixture on the street and was well-liked by the other women there.
The bodies of the other women, Lorraine Orvieto, 29, of Stony Brook, L.I., and Mary Ellen DeLuca, 22, of Valley Stream, L.I., were discovered more than a year ago in Brooklyn and Orange County, respectively. But they remained unidentified until this week. With today's announcement, troopers here in the State Police Barracks L said they had linked Mr. Rifkin to 13 killings and identified seven victims.
Both Ms. Orvieto's and Ms. DeLuca's families had reported to police that their daughters were missing almost two years ago.
"Why did it take this long to find out?" asked Florence Orvieto, Lorraine's mother, in a telephone interview this afternoon, choking back tears. For the last two years, she said, she had been saving Christmas presents for her daughter, who disappeared in December 1991. "I was waiting for her to come home," she said.
On Friday, the police called Mrs. Orvieto and told her that her daughter's body was found last July 11 in a 55-gallon oil drum in Coney Island Creek near Cropsey Avenue in Brooklyn. A cause of death has yet to be determined, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner.
Also on Friday, the police notified the DeLuca family that their daughter's body had been found in Cornwall, in Orange County, in October 1991, one month after she had been reported missing. The cause of death was not available today.
According to the police, the identities of both women were confirmed through dental records.
The police said that Lorraine Orvieto was petite, like many of the other victims, just under 5 feet tall and about 100 pounds. And as with the others whom Mr. Rifkin is accused of killing, a memento found in his room -- in this case, a driver's license -- helped police to discover the apparent connection to Ms. Ovierto's death.

HEADLINE: Base Closings Less Painful Than Feared

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
It was a disaster waiting to happen. For a region already mired deep in recession, the Government's plan to aggressively shut down military bases seemed certain to shower more economic distress on New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
But by Friday, when President Clinton said he would support the recommendations of a Presidential commission to close 35 major bases across the nation, and sharply scale back others, some of the gloom in the New York region had begun to lift. 
 Compared with several states -- particularly California, Florida and Virginia -- job losses from the base closings in the New York region would be modest. And where the region's military installations are to close, on Staten Island and near New York's border with Canada, experts say there are promising alternatives in private development and business activity.
To be sure, the political storm has yet to subside. In a region whose three states routinely engage in fierce competition for jobs, New York has emerged a clear loser.
In New York City, Mayor David N. Dinkins condemned the base closing recommendations as an example of "homestate favoritism." He charged that New York State bases were unfairly targeted in favor of those in New Jersey because of the influence of James A. Courter, the former New Jersey congressman who presided over the panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
Others in New York may feel the heat of political embarrassment. One is Representative Susan Molinari, the Congresswoman from Staten Island, which is losing one of the Navy's most modern installations. Another is Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who angered many last week by blaming the state's losses on bickering between local officials in Plattsburgh and Rome, where Air Force bases are to close or to be scaled back.
But amid the exchange of recriminations, many people say the region fared better than they expected.
"The mood here has been awfully bad for a long time, but maybe now things are turning around," said Mark Wolman, a building contractor in Waterford, Conn., one of the thousands of business people across the region whose prosperity is closely tied to the military.
His company is situated near one of the biggest, and most unexpected winners -- the Navy submarine base at New London. The plan backed by President Clinton not only reverses the Pentagon's recommendation to close the base, it expands base operations with additional training facilities and $100 million in construction by civilian contractors.
 
Mix of Gains and Losses
 Elsewhere in the region, there is a mix of gains and losses. McGuire Air Force Base in central New Jersey had been among the Pentagon's targets for closing; instead, under the President's plan, it would be expanded.
Some of the bad news was as much of a surprise as the good. In northern New York State, Plattsburgh Air Force Base, recommended as a survivor by the Pentagon, is to close under the commission plan, eliminating 2,850 jobs. Operations at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome are to be sharply cut back.
But experts say that, in contrast to many bases elsewhere -- isolated outposts in deserts and remote rural areas -- those in the New York region have long been considered attractive locations for nonmilitary development. And some business people and economists maintain that "defense conversion" may as well get started now instead of later in the decade.
"We have a realistic opportunity to come out bigger and better and stronger," said Mark Barie, a business consultant and president of the Chamber of Commerce in Plattsburgh. The reason: Plattsurgh is close to the Canadian border, and might, like other cities nearby, attract several Canadian companies to the offices, distribution facilities and real estate to be vacated by the Air Force.
 
'Plenty of Negotiating Room'
 In Rome, officials say they might try to lure European aircraft manufacturers to the vacated areas of Griffiss Air Force Base.
"We are left with a tremendous amount of industrial capacity, and plenty of negotiating room," said Fred Tillman, a stockbroker in Rome, where the Griffiss work force, now 6,400 people, is to be reduced to 1,500.
The base closure commission's plan calls for the B-52 bombers now stationed at Griffiss to be sent elsewhere. All that would remain of the base is the Rome Laboratories, an intelligence research center.
Mr. Tillman, a retired Air Force colonel and former commander of the base, said the plan leaves ample opportunity for converting the vast B-52 hangars on the base, its maintenance shops and other facilities to civilian use.
"We can market these facilities around the world," he said, adding that potential buyers include commercial aircraft manufacturers in Europe who are seeking a United States base of operations.
 
Moving the Coast Guard
 In New York City, where the Navy's Staten Island Homeport is to close, the economic advisors to Mayor Dinkins say they might try to persuade the Coast Guard to move to the abandoned installation from Governors Island, freeing that strikingly scenic piece of New York Harbor real estate for a park, new housing or other development.
The idea was raised at a news conference last week by Representative Molinari, the Staten Island Republican, who said that a group would try to meet with the Transportation Secretary, Federico F. Pena, later this month. The Coast Guard is part of the Transportation Department, and the plan would involve moving nine cutters and 2,800 Coast Guard and civilian employees.
Another suggestion, from Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes Governors Island, would make the Homeport part of a larger container shipping port on Staten Island and in Brooklyn.
 
Connecticut Benefits Most
 It is Connecticut that stands to benefit most, not only by the commission's recommendation to retain and expand the New London submarine facility, but by other welcome reversals in its huge aerospace and military industries in recent weeks.
"We know that defense is a declining industry, and it will continue to decline," said William A. McEachern, an economist at the University of Connecticut. "But it is refreshing to have some good news to talk about."
Federal studies show that 6.5 percent of Connecticut's civilian work force depends on defense contracts for its livelihood. By that measure, the state follows only Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia in its economic ties to the military.
In late June, the state was spared huge cuts by one of its largest aerospace concerns, Pratt & Whitney, which is shifting the focus of its jet engine manufacturing from the military to commercial aircraft.
With a promise of huge tax incentives from the state, Pratt & Whitney on June 23 won deep wage and work rule concessions from its biggest union and agreed not to shut down its biggest jet engine plant, in East Hartford. The agreement averted the loss of 2,000 jobs, which the company had said it would move to other plants in Maine and Georgia.
 
Good News in Groton
 Another corporate centerpiece in Connecticut, still reliant on military spending, is the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics Corporation, which manufactures submarines for the Navy in Groton. The company has cut its work force deeply over the last five years.
But over the last month, strong evidence has surfaced in Washington that the company's submarine yards in Groton will not be abandoned by the Navy. Electric Boat officials said last week that they had been informed by the Pentagon that their company was the leading contender for a contract to assemble the only new submarine the Navy plans to acquire in the next five years.
If the contract is won by General Dynamics, it would mean that the company would be well positioned to bid on a future generation of Navy submarines, which the Pentagon plans to begin ordering in 1998.
Even amid the good news for Connecticut, analysts cautioned that the state's reliance on military contracts will continue to make it vulnerable to economic setbacks, because further reductions in defense spending are expected for a decade or more. Indeed, Congress will required to review the nation's inventory of bases again in 1995 and make more cuts.
The recommendations endorsed by the President "are a plus" for the region, said Gary L. Ciminero, chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group, a bank holding company with operations in New York and Connecticut.
"But we are swimming upstream," he added. "The question remains how long it will take for the basic minuses of our dependence on the military to catch up with us, and we see more shrinkage."

To the Editor:
The article contributed (perhaps unwittingly) to the feelings of hostility and resentment on the part of white males against African-Americans, women and other groups whose economic opportunities have been historically limited because of racism, sexism and other isms that seek to legitimize hatred and bigotry. 
 The article states in part: "Efforts by companies to hire more minorities and women, often at the expense of white males . . . " (emphasis added). This characterization of societal attempts at ensuring equal opportunities is in itself a perpetuation of damaging stereotypes. It presupposes that whatever job or career opportunities exist are the province of white males and that anyone else who is placed in these jobs is encroaching on a property right of white males.

HEADLINE: Quayle's Moment

BYLINE: By Andrew Rosenthal; Andrew Rosenthal is a White House correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
A smile of triumph flickers around the mouth of Dan Quayle. Playfully tugging at the cord of his high-security telephone, the Vice President looks relaxed and not a little pleased with himself as he sits in shirt sleeves in his stateroom aboard Air Force Two, flying home after a momentous trip to California.
The day before, Quayle had burst into the national political spotlight with an attack on the television heroine Murphy Brown's unwed motherhood. The immediate aftermath had been tense -- with the White House waffling embarrassingly, running for cover in alarm over Quayle's salvos against a program with 38 million viewers. But Quayle, after checking in with President Bush himself, seems confident that he is, for the moment, off the hook. He cheerfully reports that the Commander in Chief has ordered him to go full speed ahead with his campaign for "family values." 
 Which is exactly what Quayle has done. Over the next six weeks, in a series of high-profile speeches that vaulted him onto the front page and the evening news, the Vice President declared war on what he calls the "cultural elites." Like Vice Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew before him, Quayle had rediscovered the power of negative thinking. By attacking, among other things, Hollywood, the news media, academics, abortion rights activists, East Coast liberals, gay couples, New York City and Mario M. Cuomo, the Vice President had got not only what he so badly craves -- press attention as something more than Mr. Malaprop -- but had polarized the 1992 election into an "us versus them" battle. The strategy is clear: by dividing the country, he and his Republican advisers hope to conquer it.
For the newly self-confident Quayle, this period has marked a remarkable transformation from, as the writer Larry Gelbart put it, "lap dog" to "attack dog." It has been almost four years since Presidential candidate Bush plucked Quayle, then Indiana's junior Senator, from relative obscurity and made him his running mate. Quayle was supposed to lend the ticket youth, rock-ribbed, Midwestern conservatism and looks that would appeal to women. Instead, Quayle's many gaffes and inexperience under fire forced G.O.P. strategists eventually to confine his campaign stops to elementary-school classrooms. Throughout his term as Vice President, Quayle has continued to be haunted by verbal miscues that have made him America's leading symbol of blooper and blunder. But after years of struggling on many painful occasions to play the good sport when the late-night comedians made mincemeat out of his latest stumble, Quayle is no longer content to stay in the background -- as good Vice Presidents are supposed to do and as Bush himself did when he was on the job.
At a time when the Bush White House and campaign team seem ideologically and strategically adrift, Quayle has sharply defined himself and his vision for the G.O.P. A self-styled defender of traditional American values, he has adopted a time-honored Republican campaign strategy, pitting himself and his party against those he says scorn the institutions of family, religion and patriotism. Some in his party, especially on the right, have applauded Quayle's new aggressiveness and efforts to shore up the President's sagging conservative support. But others contend that his ear-catching rhetoric is making the cautious George Bush look even weaker. "It's a shame that Bush has to be compared to Quayle, but that's his fault," says Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Somebody has to take the lead."
TO MANY IN WASHINGTON, IT IS AS THOUGH Charlie McCarthy had suddenly bounded off Edgar Bergen's lap and started to speak his own lines. Quayle had strong motives for his act of self-liberation. If conservatives are important to Bush's political base, they are all the 45-year-old Quayle has if he is ever to win the Republican Presidential nomination he so clearly wants. And if the President's staff, and perhaps even the President himself, get somewhat bruised in the process, that does not seem to matter so much any more to Quayle and his ambitious and increasingly restless aides, who share the Vice President's appetite for conservative policies and big-splash news coverage.
As he wades into his new role as ideological point man, Quayle finds himself on a tightrope. He must continue to be aggressive if he wants to put the past behind him. But at the same time, if he comes on too strong or frolics in the limelight too much, he could run afoul of carefully nurtured contacts in his own party by upstaging the President. And that is one person Quayle cannot afford to alienate. For a long time, after all, Dan Quayle had a constituency of one: George Bush. "It's good for the President that Quayle's in a position to help him with the conservative base," says Steven Merksamer, a lawyer in Sacramento, Calif., and conservative G.O.P. operative. "It is not good for the President to be compared unfavorably with the Vice President, and that is something Dan Quayle does not want."
If anything has pushed Quayle to activism, it has been the emergence of Ross Perot. The Vice President and his staff know that Bush's re-election, which for now has been placed in jeopardy by Perot's strong challenge, is essential to his own hopes of a White House run in 1996. "Quayle's chances depend 90 percent on Bush winning and on him doing well in this campaign," says a senior Republican strategist with close ties to Quayle. "This is do or die for Dan Quayle."
And yet Perot's presence in the race also provides Quayle with an unforeseen opportunity. A Perot candidacy greatly increases the importance of the Vice President's role in the 1992 campaign. In a three-way race, plurality, not majority, rules. This puts the vote-getting emphasis of the campaign on core constituencies, which Quayle's highly charged conservative rhetoric is designed to galvanize. "It's a Quayle moment in the evolution of the Republican Party when you're aiming at 39 percent and not 53 percent," says Kevin Phillips, the political analyst.
But Phillips is quick to point out that a strong ideological campaign by Quayle could spell trouble for Bush in the fall, as well as for the party in the future. Not only would Bush once again open himself up to criticism for abandoning his centrism in the heat of a campaign (which he might be less likely to get away with than four years ago when he visited a flag factory and raised the specter of Willie Horton), but the G.O.P. might end up too far to the right.
"What we have seen in recent weeks is the rise of Quayle as a force in setting domestic policy, and possibly to the detriment of Bush in the medium term and the Republican Party in the long term," Phillips says. "Quayle has an interest in becoming an agent of the definition of the Republican Party in a way that would reinforce his 1996 prospects. He's finding his stride in the narrowing horizons of the Republican Party."
This may help explain Quayle's continuing decline in the national polls. Quayle's advisers contend that he's had a hot hand since the Murphy Brown blitzkrieg, but the numbers do not bear them out. In fact, the Vice President's favorability ratings have slid from 33 percent last March to 20 percent in a New York Times/ CBS News sampling in late June. Part of this may be due to Bush's own plunge in the approval ratings, but part may reflect strong negative reaction to the very polarizing effect Quayle has been trying to create. And for all his new pugnaciousness, Quayle is still more than capable of pulling a stunning boner. His recent mispelling of the word "potato" at a Trenton junior high school spelling bee prompted Jay Leno to remark: "Maybe the Vice President should stop watching 'Murphy Brown' and start watching 'Sesame Street.' " To add insult to injury, Quayle's defense was that he'd been led astray by an errant cue card.
Such setbacks aside, Quayle seems not at all discouraged about his bid to be be taken seriously. Asked as he flew home from California how he felt about all the attention, about being out on the front lines, Quayle squares his shoulders and adjusts his Vice Presidential cuff links. "Good," he says.
CURTIS CRAWFORD, AN 18-YEAR-OLD IN t-shirt, baggy shorts and high tops, stands in the parking lot of a bowling alley called Palm Springs Lanes, talking on a pay phone. It is 5:30 on a spring afternoon, when a black limousine led by a growling motorcycle escort pulls up. In the brick-oven heat of the California desert, a man in white shirt sleeves, tie and black business shoes jumps out and sticks out his hand. "Dan Quayle," the Vice President of the United States says to Curtis Crawford.
Quayle says he likes to go to bowling alleys almost as much as he likes to play golf. Bowling alleys, he explains, are where he finds his constituents. But before going inside, the Vice President stops for a minute at the phone booth. He discovers that Crawford is talking to his 15-year-old girlfriend, Amber. Quayle grabs the phone.
"Hi, this is Dan Quayle," he says.
A pause. "It doesn't sound like my voice?"
Quayle covers the mouthpiece. "Should I ask her out for you?"
Crawford looks at all the television cameras, then at all the Secret Service agents, then at the Vice President. He shrugs.
"Would you like to come out to dinner?" Quayle says into the phone. "No, you're not coming out with me. With him."
This is a side of Dan Quayle that few people get to see. Much as he desires to be treated with respect, there is still an insecure boyishness in him that makes him want to impress a teen-ager outside a Palm Springs bowling alley. And he remains far more at ease in these relatively private settings than when he has to appear in public.
The Vice President still has trouble delivering speeches, even before friendly audiences, even when his words are defiant. "Talk about right and wrong, and they'll try to mock us in newsrooms, sitcom studios and faculty lounges across America," he told the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis last month. "But in the heart of America, in the homes and workplaces and churches, the message is heard." At the urging of his advisers, he has learned to give the camera his profile instead of his startled, faded-denim eyes. But even when he is hitting his favorite targets, like homosexual parents or the failures of liberalism, his face looks set in stone.
Quayle is clearly trying to recapture the symbols of the Reagan era -- family, religion, the flag, law and order -- but he has not yet mastered Ronald Reagan's clarion-call delivery. His cadences and inflections are off, like a movie in which the soundtrack and the pictures are not in sync. He sounds as if he is basing his rhythms on punctuation, not the sense of the words. Moments like these revive an old question: Does Quayle really have as strong a hand in writing his speeches as he and his staff contend? Or does his obvious discomfort suggest that he is just a mouthpiece for someone else's words?
Quayle's carefully drawn image also starts to blur as he moves out of the right-to-life conventions and other sanctuaries of conservative Republican politics. Five days after returning to Washington from the Murphy Brown trip, he was at Arlington National Cemetery, delivering a Memorial Day address that he tried to link to his new crusade for "moral values."
"As others flee responsibility, our military seeks it," he said. "As we walk these paths, there is still a question that follows us. How? How did they find the courage? How did men and women who valued life as much as we do so bravely take their place in the long mysterious exodus of death?"
The Vice President's strong words only served to remind his listeners of the unending questions about his own military record as a National Guardsman during the Vietnam War. It is moments like these that make some of Quayle's friends cringe. "It seems to me that the Quayle group is addicted to publicity for its own sake," says one Republican strategist. "When they put him in a situation where the audience is reminded of how he did poorly in school or didn't go to Vietnam, things get pretty dicey. I wouldn't avoid them entirely, because you can't, but I sure would low-key it."
THE QUAYLE STAFF IS anything but low-key. In fact, it is one of the leanest and meanest operations in Washington. Led by the chief of staff, William Kristol, a staunch conservative who relishes being described as "the kind of guy who likes to throw Molotov cocktails," the key players on Quayle's team are as zealous about staking out strong conservative positions as they are about promoting their man's political fortunes. Whether they are pressing issues like space exploration, legal reform, school choice or environmental deregulation, they seem to take delight in administering a sharp dig to the ribs of their far more passive, compromise-minded counterparts at the White House.
Some Republican strategists even suggest, by implication at least, that the White House would do well to emulate the perpetually energized Quayle team. "Quayle has an agenda," says Torie Clarke, the Bush-Quayle campaign's press secretary. "He has a crack staff. They decide, here's what we want to accomplish, and do it. They have objectives, they have strategies and they go out and execute them."
Kristol, the son of the well-known conservative commentator Irving Kristol, is the leader of the Quayle pack. A fixture at White House staff meetings, he is a tireless advocate of conservative causes, constantly trying to push the Administration to the right. Some observers see Kristol's distinctive hand in the emergence of the "family values" campaign, as they had in Quayle's attacks on the legal profession and his militant support of Israel. The 39-year-old Kristol is a charter member of what one Washington conservative calls "the little conspiracies of the right." This refers to Kristol's habit of staying up into the wee hours taking phone calls from Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the conservative firebrand and House Republican whip. Not surprisingly, Gingrich's ideas -- on subjects like how the G.O.P. can defeat the Democratic Congress this fall -- often find their way into Quayle's speeches.
Another key player on the Quayle team is his press secretary, David C. Beckwith. A former White House correspondent for Time, Beckwith has made the rehabilitation of Quayle such a personal crusade that he appears to be unceasingly at war with members of the Washington press corps. He regularly fires off critiques of reporters' stories that are longer than the stories themselves, and once accused the writer of an unflattering Quayle profile of drinking on the job.
With the exception of Beckwith, who was hired on Bush's personal recommendation, the Vice President can take credit for assembling his team himself. Jeffrey Nesbit, the 34-year-old communications director, was brought in to join Quayle's Senate staff in 1987. A former consumer advocate who worked for Ralph Nader, Nesbit became a conservative convert after a solitary 25-day bicycle trip across the country.
One key to Quayle's emergence as a force on domestic policy issues has been his leadership of the White House Council on Competitiveness. Although the three-year-old council has no statutory power, Quayle and his staff have turned it into a genuine sphere of influence by focusing on conservatism's heartthrob issue -- the excesses of Government regulation. While the White House hems and haws over environmental concerns -- torn between Bush's vow to be the "Environmental President" and his desire to please private industry -- environmental groups charge that Quayle's team has used the council to rewrite the 1990 Clean Air Act.
The council's executive director, 34-year-old David M. McIntosh, cut his teeth on the deregulation drives of the Reagan era and is now leading the charge to make fundamental changes in 30 years of regulatory policy. It was McIntosh who put together the Bush Administration's privatization initiative, which would allow cities to sell assets that were built with Federal money (like airports and bridges) to the private sector. And it was McIntosh who redrafted the regulations of the Clean Air Act to allow companies to increase pollution emissions without notifying the public. In the absence of a strong domestic policy operation in the White House and of a cooperative spirit between the Administration and Congress, Quayle's council has delighted conservatives champing at the bit for a continuation of the Reagan policies. But it has infuriated others. Democratic lawmakers are challenging the council's actions in court, and 10 days ago the House Appropriations Committee voted 30-18 to eliminate its financing entirely.
The talents, energies and strong personas that dominate Quayle's entourage keep alive a question that has dogged the Vice President since 1988: To what extent is he the product of his staff? It is widely recognized in Washington that Kristol and the others exert a strong influence on Quayle. His detractors will tell you it is the aides, not Quayle, who are responsible for whatever visibility has been forged out of the largely invisible office of the Vice Presidency. His supporters, however, argue that Quayle should be given credit for hiring good people. They point out that, like many Washington politicians, the Vice President sets the overall tone and lets staffers deal with the details.
"He's a bit like Reagan in the sense that here's a man who does not claim to be the great intellectual of the Administration," says Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation. "He's comfortable with people around him who are smart."
Michael Sanera, a Reagan Administration official who now teaches political science at Northern Arizona University, says: "I know Bill Kristol pretty well and I tend to think a lot of what Quayle does is based on Bill's advice and counsel. But Quayle is someone who has knowledge of conservative philosophy, more than Bush ever did, and his record in the Congress was pretty good. Is Bill Kristol supporting Quayle and making him look good? Or was Quayle smart enough in the first place to pick Kristol to help him out? No leader can exist on his own."
ON MAY 8, 10 DAYS before he delivered his Murphy Brown speech to the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco, Quayle summoned his two main speechwriters to lunch. He told John McConnell, a Yale law school graduate, and the newly hired Lisa Schiffren, a former reporter for The Detroit News, that he wanted a speech on urban problems to give in California. Quayle had been hearing a lot from Republicans around the country about how weak the Administration had looked in its response to the Los Angeles riots. The speech seemed like the perfect time to put the conservative spin on the turmoil.
"The Vice President wanted to give a serious speech about the urban problem and to focus on the poverty of values," Kristol says. "In our mind, it had a policy purpose -- to advance the case for conservative solutions."
After the riots, Quayle's staff arranged meetings for him with two of the leading lights of the neoconservative law-and-order movement: James. Q. Wilson, the sociologist and criminologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has written that a breakdown in values is the central cause of urban civil unrest, and Charles Murray, the author of "Losing Ground," the anti-welfare manifesto that had been required reading in the Reagan White House. Quayle had also been reading Shelby Steele's "The Content of Our Character," which argues that affirmative action programs create self-doubt and self-loathing among blacks.
At lunch, Quayle told his speech writers he was "very struck" by the connection Murray and Wilson had drawn between South-Central Los Angeles and the breakdown of family structure. One conclusion that came out of the lunch, according to an aide who was there: "The upper middle-class can go through all this cultural turmoil and emerge more or less O.K. The problem with the poor is that this is not the case."
For months, Quayle and his staff had been on the verge of panic about the Bush decline. From their perspective, the White House, despite major staff changes since the beginning of the year, had let slip a series of opportunities to win back the affection of American voters: the State of the Union Message in January, the March 20 ultimatum to Congress to enact the Administration's economic reforms and the Los Angeles riots. "For a while, it looked like the President was going to get aggressive, but then all that fizzled too," one adviser says.
Quayle, according to Republican strategists, decided to take action on his own. "There's things Vice Presidents can say and do that Presidents should not say and do," Quayle explained during one of our interviews.
As Quayle met with McConnell and Schiffren, he mentioned that he wanted to pin the blame for the decline of values on Hollywood. It was a tried-and-true conservative tactic: when in doubt, attack the liberals. Exactly who came up with the Murphy Brown reference is in dispute. Some say it was Lisa Schiffren, who eventually wrote the speech. Quayle later claimed he had thought up the idea on his own, though he conceded he had never seen the show. Several Republican advisers said the idea had actually come from Marilyn Quayle, who was said to have been upset about the appearance of real-life anchorwomen at Murphy's baby shower.
Whatever its genesis, Quayle was insistent that the Murphy Brown reference stay in his speech. His aides were well aware that they were straying into dangerous political territory, but no one expected the firestorm Quayle set off. Once again, the barbs were brutal: "Quayle also says there should be more honesty on television," Johnny Carson said. "He said there's no way a coyote could live after swallowing all that dynamite."
The Vice President and his aides clearly had not thought through all the political implications of his speech. During one of Quayle's first post-Murphy interviews, Rollin Post, a political analyst for KRON-TV in San Francisco, suggested that the Vice President's condemnation of childbearing out of wedlock was strange coming from such a staunchly anti-abortion politician. Afterward, Quayle seemed perplexed. "That's the first time I've heard that," he said. "It's far-fetched."
But on the airplane out of San Francisco, Quayle and his staff huddled over the unanticipated abortion issue and worked out a response. When Quayle landed in Los Angeles, he went over to a group of waiting reporters to deliver it: "Hollywood doesn't get it. Abortion is not the reason why we have a poverty of values gripping our inner cities."
EVEN SOME OF QUAYLE'S most vocal critics concede that the disintegration of the American family is an issue worth talking about. What bothers them is less the sermon than the minister. "It isn't moral values that people laugh at, of course -- it's Mr. Quayle himself, and it isn't the elite who do the laughing," the humorist Garrison Keillor wrote on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. "For four years, Dan Quayle jokes have served to unite Americans of all walks of life and all religious faiths." Others point out that as an heir to a newspaper publishing chain, Quayle is hardly in a position to attack America's "media elites."
But none of this seems to faze the Vice President, who continues to fly around the country, giving tough, ideological speeches, expanding his target base beyond Murphy Brown and Hollywood to the evils of sex education and New York City and Ross Perot ("a temperamental tycoon who has contempt for the Constitution of the United States"). Meanwhile, the White House and Bush campaign team hang back, as though waiting to see the results of Quayle's "market research"; then, once public reaction has been weighed, they selectively take the Vice President's positions as their own. The same day that Quayle knocked New York as a symbol of what is wrong with the country, Bush aides visibly winced. They figure that New York State, with 33 electoral votes, is going to be tough enough to win as it is.
The larger Quayle goal, of course, is to look Presidential. Quayle aides think he's been flying high since The Washington Post's voluminous and respectful seven-part series by David S. Broder and Bob Woodward earlier this year. ("Only in Washington is Quayle considered a heavyweight," Keillor contends.) Although it is widely assumed that Quayle is setting himself up for the 1996 election, he will not yet brook any conversations on the subject. "I don't want to talk about it, and I obviously won't, except in general terms, except to say that, look, I've got to get through the 1992 election and we'll see where things stand after that," he says.
But one question hovers over Quayle as he faces two key tests in the coming campaign -- his speech before the Republican National Convention in August and the Vice Presidential debates this fall. Can the Vice President continue to serve two masters? Can he maintain his loyalties to the conservative constituency he has so assiduously cultivated over the last four years, and at the same time remain true to a President who is widely mistrusted by that constituency?
"I think I really work hard to be loyal, perhaps even to a fault, to this President and his policies," Quayle tells me in his office in the Old Executive Office Building. He pauses. "Yeah, you can be, I suppose, loyal to a fault."
Loyalty, he says, has been the hallmark of his Vice Presidency. Leaning back on a sofa, displaying the "J.D.Q." monogram on his heavy gold cuff links, he repeats himself, slowly and with emphasis: "Loyal to a fault."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
It's a Small Show, but It Sends a Signal

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
A 10-MINUTE DELAY AT THE Midtown Tunnel. Bumper-to-bumper past the airport. Construction tie-ups on the Long Island Expressway. That's not just the morning traffic report on the radio. It's also architectural criticism, a daily dispatch from the urban infrastructure. And the radio station does more than report on the infrastructure. It's an integral part of it. The station's broadcast beams are invisible links in an architecture of communications, a sprawling mega structure of steel transmission towers and airwaves that stretches across Long Island, creating new patterns of urban space.
Those patterns are the subject of "Transmission Towers on the Long Island Expressway," a show on view at the Urban Center in Manhattan through July 10. It's a modest exhibition, made up of drawings and small, jewel-like scale models, lodged on a stairway landing on the Urban Center's second floor. But there's nothing modest about the show's sweeping megalopolitan vision. And the contrast between its large vision and its small physical scale is a clue to its purpose. Michele Bertomen, the New York architect responsible for the show, has issued a call for architects to think bigger. 
 Probably millions of Long Island commuters have appreciated the taut, airy beauty of transmission towers, which relay signals for television, radio and telephone. Ms. Bertomen is a connoisseur of them. A commuter to her job in Central Islip, where she teaches architecture at the New York Institute of Technology, she can discuss dish, disk and horn antennas with the enthusiasm classicists reserve for Doric, Ionic and Tuscan columns. She delights in cellular phone calls as others thrill to Gothic spires.
In 1985, Ms. Bertomen gathered together a group of her architecture students to pursue her enthusiasm in a more scholarly way. Each student was asked to "adopt" a tower, document it with drawings, and study how the towers function within the larger network of communications. The team's work became the basis of a book with the same title as the show (Princeton Architectural Press), which is a best seller at the Urban Center's bookstore. Response to the book prompted Nicolas Rojas, of the bookstore's staff, to invite Ms. Bertomen to organize the show now on view. Evidently, a good many young architects are on Ms. Bertomen's wavelength.
While the show addresses contemporary urban issues, it pulls together strands of thinking that other architects have pursued in the past. Ms. Bertomen acknowledges the pioneering research of Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi on the architecture of the American highway, but her interests take a different route. She is not drawn to the pop repertoire of golden arches and kitschy billboards. Whereas Mr. Venturi defined architecture as a "decorated shed" whose skin matters more than its bones, Ms. Bertomen has reverted to the modern idea that there's something virtuous about peeling away the skin to expose the structure underneath.
She is fascinated by the high-tech, engineering esthetic of transmission towers: their delicate steel tracery, the prefabricated parts that can be combined to create different forms. But she is also concerned with the spatial structure of the suburban developments that the broadcast media have helped to shape. This focus harks back to Broadacre City, Frank Lloyd Wright's 1935 Utopian scheme for a decentralized urban America. Wright recognized back then that the car and the radio would bring about a new kind of city. Ms. Bertomen wants us to recognize that this new city has generated new kinds of public space: realms of movement and communication that have gone far toward supplanting the eroded public sphere of our beleaguered older cities.
But is there a place in this environment for architecture? Unlike Wright, Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown, Ms. Bertomen doesn't tackle this question. Instead, she and her students have staked an esthetic claim on objects already built. They've gone clambering over transmission towers along the Long Island Expressway, taking measurements, tracing forms, even giving them names like Lioness, Triplets and Upstart. The drawings and models in the show are beautiful, and perhaps it's unfair to ask for more. They are intended as aids to vision. There are Eiffel Towers in your backyard, Ms. Bertomen is saying: Just open your eyes.
When it comes to interpreting what we see, however, Ms. Bertomen is not a wholly reliable guide. That is partly because her infatuation with current academic theory is stronger than her grasp of history. For instance, she sets great store on the value of transmission towers as vernacular objects, which she regards as a departure from the star system of Masterpiece buildings by Master form-makers. In fact, vernacularism is an old and somewhat stale ideal in architecture. It's the flip side of Romanticism's cult of the inspired genius, and no less sappy in its worship of the collective.
Ms. Bertomen also holds the naive hope that electronic communications can overturn the lopsided power hierarchy traditionally associated with towers. Like Frank Lloyd Wright, she imagines that urban decentralization should logically disperse power from the few to the many. Actually, suburban development has been accompanied by an intense concentration of power in the hands of corporate giants. That's one reason to be skeptical about the claim that highways and radio waves add up to acceptable substitutes for parks, streets, squares and other traditional forms of public space. As was made evident in the Los Angeles riots, our suburban highway utopias leave a large segment of the public by the side of the road.
True, transmission towers are physically dispersed throughout the landscape, but every TV advertiser knows how well they still transmit the old tower message: senders above, receivers below. Indeed, that message is probably what drew Ms. Bertomen to this project. With radar precision, she has honed in on these towers as symbols of power in the information society. Her drawings, models and maps resemble fetishes, magical objects designed to tap into the power structure of global communications.
More power to her. Ms. Bertomen speaks for a generation of young architects who want to enlarge the role of their profession. They are looking for something more out of architecture than decorating the skins of 60-story skyscrapers. They want to respond to the larger forces shaping the urban environment: communications, transportation, systems of energy and water. They don't want to design A.T.&T. buildings. They want to get their hands on A.T.&T.
How this ambition can be translated into practical terms remains to be seen. It's admirable that Ms. Bertomen wants to cut through the barriers that separate art from industry, architecture from engineering, the ivory tower from the corporate penthouse. But for now those barriers remain firmly in place. Architects are not entrusted with the design of entire infrastructures. They're given small pieces of land and asked to create livable places on them. That's not an ignoble calling, and the city stands to lose if architects turn a deaf ear to it. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
A Revitalizer of Russian Opera

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia

 BODY:
New York has been a battlefield in the Russian operatic wars over the last year, with competing companies struggling to establish themselves as American favorites. Unfortunately for the Kirov Opera, which makes its American debut tomorrow evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, the feebler cannons were fired first. After the visits of the Bolshoi Opera of Moscow last summer at the Met and of the St. Petersburg National Opera earlier this year at the New York State Theater, New Yorkers may not realize that the Kirov Opera operates on an altogether higher level.
The Kirov, which shares its 175-member orchestra and the Maryinsky Theater with the Kirov Ballet, is currently the best Russia has to offer in terms of big, bold productions deftly blending old and new dramatic values, with stirring singing and thrilling choral and orchestral work. Or so it seemed on a recent visit to St. Petersburg, during which the company's artistic director, Valery Gergiev, conducted performances of Mussorg sky's "Khovanshchina" and Tchaikov sky's "Queen of Spades." And so it seems on the recordings Mr. Gergiev and company have released on Philips. "Queen of Spades" will be given in New York over the next two weeks, along with Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" and Prokofiev's "Fiery Angel." 
 The Bolshoi's disappointing season last summer was widely seen as a product of a company caught in awkward transition between a stodgy past and an as yet uncomprehended international future. The St. Petersburg National Opera, known until recently as the Maly Opera Theater, struck most observers as penny-pinching and provincial.
While these companies struggle to find their footing in the perilous economic and social conditions of the new Russia, the Kirov is already leading the way to a new kind of economic base and artistic policy. It is doing so because the 38-year-old Mr. Gergiev (pronounced gur-GHEE-ev), who took over artistic direction of the company in 1988, has asserted himself in almost every area of its operations. Old-fashioned conductors were tyrants, not democrats, and the soft-spoken Mr. Gergiev seems to be proving that the best results in a fledgling democracy like Russia's can be obtained with the fervor of a benign dictator.
"I have to be strong to protect the artistic line in this theater," the conductor said in his excellent English at a coffee shop in the Astoria Hotel, a few blocks from the Maryinsky. "I have to be autocratic, which is not a favorite word in the arts.
"The Kirov is part of Russia, but it doesn't have to be as chaotic and disorganized as the rest of the country. Somebody -- in this case, it's me -- has to be strong. The company has to be constantly pushed and watched and double-checked. I make things easier and shorter for myself if I step in and help solve a problem or simply do it myself. Otherwise, two or three months later, we have a double problem, because now it's already late."
What Mr. Gergiev has accomplished in his four years as head of the Kirov Opera has all of musical Russia talking -- and critics in Western Europe as well. Anatoly Malkov, the chief administrator of the Maryinsky Theater, happily brandishes a 1991 Russian critics' poll in which the Kirov topped every category -- best new production, best revival, best musical performance and others -- and usually also took the second and third spots.
In the declining years of the Soviet system, the Kirov and the Bolshoi normally each presented one big new production a season -- "maybe a second one," Mr. Gergiev said, "but usually something lighter, like a ballet or 'Don Pasquale.' " When he took over, he announced that he would do five new productions a season, including many operas never before performed at the theater or ignored in decades of repression. Traditionalists dismissed the notion as impossible chutzpah.
He started with a Mussorgsky Festival in 1989, presenting all five of the composer's operas, along with symphonic and chamber programs. A Prokofiev Festival followed in 1991-92, featuring four new productions ("The Fiery Angel," "War and Peace," "The Love for Three Oranges" and "The Gambler") within eight days. The Mussorgsky series was done in modified form at the Edinburgh Festival; the Prokofiev is planned for the Bastille Opera in Paris in 1994, and there is to be a Rimsky-Korsakov Festival in St. Petersburg in the same year.
For Mr. Gergiev, the restoration of so many Prokofiev operas, long in official disfavor, was an important step. "For the Kirov," he said, "Prokofiev was a new language, a new force, new ideas. We are learning new feelings, a new tempo in our work. The music started to give energy to the people."
Mr. Gergiev is no fanatic avant-garde firebrand, determined to uproot time-honored traditions. Opera in St. Petersburg dates to 1736, only 33 years after the founding of the city, by Peter the Great. The first theater was built in 1783, and the current building came in 1860. Between then and World War I, the Maryinsky company counted as one of the most important in the world. It was renamed in 1934 for Sergei Kirov, an assassinated friend of Lenin's, and today neither the opera nor the ballet wants to give up the brand name.
Mr. Gergiev has been willing to invite flashy Western directors into his temple of Russian tradition, as David Freeman's production of "The Fiery Angel," with its writhing naked and near-naked bodies, proves. But he is also eager to retain classic set designs, some dating back before the Russian revolution.
The "Khovanshchina" seen recently, and preserved on video for future release, dates from 1953, when so much of Russian cultural life was suddenly liberalized after Stalin's death. Some Western visitors have found it archaic theatrically, but Mr. Gergiev, who has introduced new staging ideas and substituted Shostakovich's performing edition for Rimsky-Korsakov's, loves it for just that reason.
"It's not just old-fashioned," he said. "I wanted to document it because it's good to fix on video things we have in our repertory that are beautiful and that one day may be lost or die."
Mr. Gergiev was born in Moscow in 1953 of parents from Ossetia, a non-Russian ethnic region in the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia. He was trained in Ossetia and moved on to the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was then called. As a student, he won the Soviet Union's most prestigious conducting contest, the All-Union Competition in Moscow, and the Herbert von Karajan Conductors' Competition in West Berlin.
Instead of plunging directly into the international concert scene, Mr. Gergiev signed on in 1978 as an assistant conductor at the Kirov Opera under Yuri Temirkanov. Though he graduated the next year to permanent conductor, a hard apprenticeship lay ahead. "It was not a star track," he said. "But it was the only way to learn this very, very complex business of opera."
In the early 80's, his career blossomed. He became chief conductor of the Armenian State Orchestra in 1981 and regularly led new productions at the Kirov. A Wagner "Lohengrin" in 1982, he said, won him recognition both inside and outside the company.
By 1987, his international career was gaining momentum, with a particularly strong base in Holland (thus his relationship with the Dutch Philips label). But in 1988, Yevgeny Mravinsky died. Russia's most famous conductor, Mravinsky had headed the Leningrad Philharmonic for 50 years. Mr. Temirkanov took over the Philharmonic, and Mr. Gergiev was elected artistic director of the Kirov Opera by the members of the company.
"For this country," he said, "it was a shocking combination of an old, famous tradition and a young man." But he moved ahead decisively on all fronts. He rebuilt the orchestra and chorus and fought to retain the loyalty of his singers at a time when tempting offers were pouring in from the West.
His success with the chorus and orchestra is there for all to hear: wonderfully rousing singing, ideal for the big, sweeping choruses that enliven Russian operas, and an instrumental sonority that raises national and local traditions (pungent winds, lush and exact strings) to an international level of excellence. Mr. Gergiev is especially proud of the improvement in the brass playing.
"Technically, there are many brilliant orchestras in the world," he said. "There are very few that provide a style, a sound. I have no need to conduct the St. Petersburg Philharmonic now, because I don't hear a difference."
Eastern European singers are flocking to the West, with its hard currency and its opportunities for diverse repertory and international fame. But a healthy number of the Kirov's stars have remained loyal to the company, partly because they are attracted by Mr. Gergiev's vitality and the opportunities his association with Philips provides for audio and video immortality.
The company includes many singers from countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union but have severed their ties to Russia. "There's no problem in keeping non-Russians," Mr. Gergiev said. "I'm not Russian myself. And in 1988, I was one of the first who could have left."
Mr. Malkov explained that singers sign contracts that allow them to spend time in the West but return for new productions or special events. By devoting part of their hard-currency earnings to the benefit of the Maryinsky Theater, he said, they keep their pension and medical benefits.
Even some Western stars have chosen to appear in St. Petersburg, notably Placido Domingo, who sang Otello there in February. Mr. Gergiev is fostering Western, especially Italian, repertory along with the Russian classics.
All this costs money. And state support has been cut, and further riddled by inflation. Mr. Malkov said precise figures are nearly impossible to give in the current fluid economic situation.
Yet the Kirov, partly through its tradition and partly through the new attention being paid Mr. Gergiev, has been able to obtain support from the West and even from newly privatized companies in Russia. Mr. Gergiev has had great success in attracting co-producers, particularly the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in London, and media giants like Philips, the BBC, NHK in Japan, ZDF in Germany and RAI in Italy. Covent Garden staged a gala in April to benefit the Maryinsky Theater as well as itself.
In addition to the Kirov Opera's frequent tours, its orchestra travels independently; it will undertake a two-week North American tour in the fall, ending with two concerts at Avery Fisher Hall in November. Mr. Gergiev often takes Kirov singers with him for guest engagements with other companies; he had 10 of his own singers in a recent "War and Peace" at the San Francisco Opera. He still manages, he said, to spend 40 percent of his time in St. Petersburg, and performances continue at home when the bulk of the orchestra is on the road.
The touring enhances the company's international reputation and increases its marketability, thus insuring its future. "With me or without me," Mr. Gergiev said, "the Kirov will survive. It's too beautiful, too important. Too many eyes are watching."
In addition to sustaining the standard of living of company members and the loyalty of flighty stars, Mr. Gergiev would like to generate enough income to permit long-needed renovations in the Maryinsky. The theater is gorgeous to look at and has superb acoustics, but it is hemmed in by a canal and a public square. And while its elegant interior has been maintained, its exterior and backstage equipment are antiquated.
Still, Mr. Gergiev said, "the reason I am trying so hard to convince the best singers and players not to leave is that this is the best place in the world to do Russian opera."
 
 
 
GERGIEV ON CD, WITH THE KIROV IN TOW
 Before Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Opera signed their exclusive agreement with Philips, Mr. Gergiev made several recordings in the West:
* Rachmaninoff, Piano Concerto No. 2, with Yevgeny Kissin and the London Symphony. RCA 7982-2RC (also on cassette).
* Mussorgsky-Ravel, "Pictures at an Exhibition," and Tchaikovsky, "Francesca da Rimini," with the London Philharmonic. Philips 426 437-2.
* Verdi and Tchaikovsky, Arias, with Dmitri Khvorostovsky and the Rotterdam Philharmonic. Philips 426 740-2 (also on cassette).
* Borodin, Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2, with the Rotterdam Philharmonic. Philips 422 996-2.
Mr. Gergiev and the Kirov have released one ballet and one opera on Philips:
* Prokofiev, "Romeo and Juliet." 432 166-2; two CD's. Against stiff competition from Western orchestras, this recording impresses with inherently Russian sound colors.
* Mussorgsky, "Khovanshchina." 432 147-2; three CD's. The opera's best recording, this version offers idiomatic elan and singers equal to or better than Claudio Abbado's on Deutsche Grammophon.
For the future, Philips is planning audio and video recordings of opera, ballet and orchestral works with Mr. Gergiev and the Kirov, including:
* Prokofiev, "War and Peace," "The Fiery Angel," "The Love for Three Oranges."
* Tchaikovsky, "Queen of Spades," "The Sleeping Beauty."
* Glinka, "Ruslan and Ludmila."
* Rimsky-Korsakov, "The Czar's Bride."
* Borodin, "Prince Igor."

HEADLINE: SUNDAY VIEW;
Pacino's Star Turn Reflects the Glories of Rep

BYLINE: By David Richards

 BODY:
I CERTAINLY RELISHED AL Pacino's performance in "Salome," just as I relished his performance in "Chinese Coffee." But what I found most satisfying was watching him in "Salome" and "Chinese Coffee."
Mr. Pacino is currently appearing in both plays at Circle in the Square on Broadway. One night, he wraps himself in gold jewelry and luxurious fabrics, as King Herod, a potentate of some renown. A few nights later, he's Harry Levine, a Greenwich Village novelist of no reputation whatsoever, and he's wearing a threadbare black raincoat and a shapeless Mexican sweater. 
 The double bill has been conceived as a fund-raiser for Circle in the Square, which, like most not-for-profit theater companies, has some bailing out to do at the end of the season. Although tickets are a flat $50, Mr. Pacino is proving a big draw. By the time the run is over on July 23, Circle in the Square estimates that an accumulated debt of $1.2 million will have been reduced by about $200,000.
So you can say the primary mission has been accomplished.
It strikes me, however, that the enterprise is helpful in another way -- less immediately pragmatic, perhaps, but equally important in the long haul. It serves as a vivid reminder that there is no better measure of an actor's gifts than repertory theater. If you want to know just what a performer can do, let him play Hamlet on Tuesday and Biff Loman on Thursday. Or, in Mr. Pacino's case, a king, then a pauper. Back-to-back characterizations will expose any tricks and mannerisms in a flash. But they also reveal the stretch and breadth of an actor's talent in no equivocal terms. Theatergoers are given the increasingly uncommon opportunity to measure a performer against himself, not against fuzzy memories from prior seasons.
I won't pretend that either "Salome" or "Chinese Coffee" amounts to more than a pretext for Mr. Pacino to dazzle and mesmerize, although the former work is not without historical interest. Written originally in French, it is Oscar Wilde's ornate and overheated elaboration of the fairly straightforward biblical story. Rebuffed by the prophet Jokanaan (John the Baptist), Salome promises to dance her famous dance for Herod if afterward he will grant her whatever she wishes. He agrees. She sheds her veils, then demands -- and receives -- Jokanaan's head on a silver shield. Sarah Bernhardt was said to be impressed enough to think of putting on the play in London, which prompted Wilde to envision huge braziers of perfume on stage feeding heady scents into the auditorium in lieu of orchestral accompaniment. That should give you an idea. What Aubrey Beardsley is to the art of illustration, "Salome" is to the art of drama.
Ira Lewis's "Chinese Coffee," on the other hand, is a lean, contemporary two-character comedy, set in a dumpy photography studio belonging to one Jacob Manheim (Charles Cioffi). Manheim used to take pictures of soused nightclub patrons for a living and now shoots theatrical portraits. He's had exactly four customers in six months and business is slowing down. Looking like something the cat wouldn't drag in, Mr. Pacino shows up in the wee hours as the would-be writer Harry Levine. Ostensibly, he's come to claim the $473 Manheim owes him, but he really wants to hear what the photographer thinks of his new novel, a thinly veiled account of their friendship. Not a great deal, it turns out. By the night's end, the relationship has been irreparably damaged. Mr. Lewis's point would seem to be that failure, not success, goes to a person's head.
If you tried hard, I suppose you could make a case that the two roles are somehow related, that Mr. Pacino is showing us power and powerlessness in action. Or that a deep-
seated neuroticism governs the conduct of both Herod and Harry Levine. But it wouldn't be a very persuasive case. The actor himself is the only common denominator here. As directed, respectively, by Robert Allan Ackerman and Arvin Brown, his performances constitute a virtual about-face.
Early in the evening, Salome refers pointedly to Herod's "mole's eyes under his shaking eyelids," but it is Mr. Pacino's lips that are likely to draw your attention, when he drifts out of the banquet hall and onto the moonlit terrace where Wilde's play takes place. They're smeared with red, as if stained by gluttony or a drunken makeup man. Smacking his swollen chops and chewing constantly on his saliva, as old people sometimes do, Mr. Pacino suggests that years of self-indulgence have left a bad taste in his mouth and it won't go away.
He has untempered scorn for his servants and subjects -- not unlike that of the interior decorator for cheap home furnishings. They offend his sensibility, even as they confirm his own sense of superiority. When told that someone calling himself the Son of Man has been raising the dead, he seems to object on grounds of taste alone. Changing water to wine is one thing. "But no man shall raise the dead," he insists, laying a spidery hand to his breast and turning up his nose in squeamishness. "It would be terrible if the dead came back."
The voice, although pitched sharp and high, is weary, as if it had barked entirely too many commands for one lifetime. The body, by contrast, is soft and effeminate. During the frenzied dance of Salome (Sheryl Lee), Mr. Pacino lets himself slump so far down on the throne that it could be a bed. The posture says he couldn't be more bored, but you'll notice his eyes don't leave her for a second. If petulance makes this king highly comic, it never makes him ineffectual. Under the running mascara and poses of dissipated grandeur lurks a despot who's biding his time before giving the order that brings the play to a chilling conclusion.
In "Chinese Coffee," Mr. Pacino is pretty much on edge all night long. If he's not running a nervous hand through his hair or grinding his teeth to chalk or trying to quiet the muscle spasm in his right leg, he's feeling the equivalent of red-hot nails in his intestines and persuading himself it's a heart attack. Let him sit at the beat-up kitchen table and bury his head disconsolately in his hands -- his foot continues to dance a jittery little jig on its own.
Here is a man who can't fall asleep at night (Herod can't stay awake), whose thoughts are a muddle (Herod knows just what he thinks, even if he's not telling), who has accepted the indifference of others as his lot (Herod invites toadying). In short, a pasty-faced nobody, past his prime at 44, abandoned by his lover, with only the manuscript of a mediocre novel to pin his hopes on. And his best friend is telling him snidely, "Your idea of success seems to be to make it all the way up to the national poverty level."
By rights, Harry Levine should crumble there and then. But way down inside, where Herod's meanness slumbers, the writer has a nugget of self-respect. His novel may be lousy, but still he wrote it, got it off his chest, and that's more than the bitter photographer can boast. Just before he's thrown out of the studio for keeps, a crooked smile breaks over Mr. Pacino's face: he has suddenly realized that he's not shaking anymore. As dramatic revelations go, this is not a big one. "Chinese Coffee" doesn't ask a whole lot of its characters, other than that they get on each other's nerves.
Well, Mr. Pacino's tics are undeniably amusing, but the fascination of the performance lies elsewhere. While you're certain he's got a snapping point, you're never sure when or how he's going to erupt. The verbal uppercut causes no visible reaction, and he suffers the insulting right to the jaw without flinching. It's only later, in the middle of a seemingly innocuous reply, that the anger breaks through to the surface, dragging a lot of surprised words along with it. The actor can go from 0 to 60 mph -- from the paralysis of depression to table-pounding fury -- in under six seconds.
Did I say Mr. Pacino's two performances have nothing in common? I take it back. In both roles, the actor demonstrates an uncanny ability to communicate the gathering tension in characters who, to behold them, appear merely discombobulated or spent. (Even as Herod is sinking into a kind of heavy-lidded indolence, his patience is growing dangerously short.) The outburst of emotion -- whatever it may be -- comes as a delayed reaction, and catches you completely off guard. That's why it's so hard to take your eyes off the actor. He's a master of the sneak attack, and you don't want to be looking elsewhere when he strikes.
Maybe this would be just as obvious if he were performing in a single play, not two. But I doubt it. Plays and players really are better off in clusters. Put them side by side, they'll talk to one another. Interactions occur, connections get made. And everybody's vision is sharpened by the process.
As a rule, our theater doesn't make comparisons easy. If actors don't belong to an established company -- and most don't -- we see them all too infrequently in the flesh to indulge in fruitful discussions of their craft. When they become successful, they head to where the more lucrative work is -- television or the movies. If they come back to the boards, it is usually for a limited engagement. They may not have lost their feel for the stage in the interim, but we tend to lose our feel for them on a stage. No sooner have we all begun to renew acquaintance than they're packing their bags.
I don't know when Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss or Glenn Close will be back on Broadway again. While their performances in "Death and the Maiden" are still fresh in my mind, though, I'd be eager to see them assume other guises, undertake other confrontations. Jessica Lange was not critically well received in "A Streetcar Named Desire," but I hope that doesn't mean an end to her theatrical career. I, for one, still have questions. How much of her portrayal of Blanche DuBois was instinctive behavior? How much the result of deliberate and conscious choices? There will be no hard answers until we are permitted another look at her in different theatrical surroundings.
To my mind, one of the most exciting performances last season was Jane Alexander's as Claire Zachanassian, the world's richest woman, in "The Visit." The actress was virtually unrecognizable in the part. I can say that confidently because Ms. Alexander has been better than most about showing her face regularly on the stage over the years.
The time, however, when Broadway had its stable of faithful stars, who returned each season in a new play, belongs to history. Continuity of any kind is rare these days. That's why Mr. Pacino's double-header at Circle in the Square is such a welcome reminder. One of the reasons we go to the theater, after all, is to watch actors act. The play doesn't always have to be the thing. If it did, the Lunts wouldn't have had a whole lot to show for themselves and the decades of barnstorming.
Unfortunately, there is a serious hitch to repertory theater. It is enormously costly to keep whole casts and sets at the ready so they can be changed every few nights. While that is the practice at all the great theaters of the world -- from the Comedie Francaise to the Royal National Theater of Britain -- it is one we have never been able to implement for long in this country before the money runs out. Without healthy subsidies, it's no go, and we're all aware of the state of governmental largesse these days.
The ultimate irony is that in order to relieve the economic pinch, Circle in the Square has resorted, however briefly, to repertory theater. You have to applaud the company for the gesture. Just because we can't afford a theatrical ideal, doesn't mean we should forget it altogether.

 BODY:

Tax Refund for Co-op
 
Question: I live in a co-op apartment. The board recently won from the local town a real estate tax reimbursement of about $400,000. This money was put into a reserve fund. I filed a claim for my share -- $1,800 -- and was denied it.
Can the board do this? . . . Donald Forester, Scarborough Manor, N.Y.
 
Answer: Probably. According to Marc Luxemberg, a lawyer who is also a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, in most co-ops the board has no legal obligation to return an excess in taxes or in maintenance payments made by shareholders.
"In the bylaws of most co-ops," said Mr. Luxemberg, "there can be no collecting maintenance retroactively. By the same token, shareholders are not entitled to rebates when there is a surplus."
The exception would be, he said, if your co-op grants shareholders some kind of a year-end rebate. Although you will not get this in cash, you will benefit from the tax ruling because the effect will be to lower the amount that you and other owners will pay in the future.
 
Switching Apartments
 
Question: My aunt and uncle live in a rent-controlled apartment in a building that has been converted to a co-op. They have been offered a larger, vacant, rent-stabilized unit in the same building.
Would there be any risks in their moving out of their rent-controlled apartment and into the larger apartment? . . . Ellen Stern, Manhattan
 
Answer: There could be.
Under normal circumstances, when a rent-regulated apartment is vacated in a building that has been converted to a co-op, it is no longer governed by the rules of rent regulation. The sponsor or other owner has the right to sell or rent the apartment at market rates.
However, according to Joseph D'Agosta, an acting deputy commissioner for rent regulation for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, a sponsor or other owner could relinquish those rights. The owner's motivation might be that there was a buyer for the apartment that the rent-regulated tenants occupied.
In any case, your relatives must be sure that the apartment they accept will be recognized as a rent-stabilized unit by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
For further information on how to proceed, contact the state division rent administration office at 718-639-6400.
 
Deducting Workspace
 
Question: My husband and I live in a one-bedroom co-op. We both work in the apartment about 50 to 75 percent of the year. Our accountant advised us a while ago against writing off part of the apartment on our income taxes because there could be a complication when we decide to sell.
However, we have converted our bedroom entirely into workspace. It is easily one-quarter to one-third of the apartment's space.
Can we write off a portion of the mortgage against taxes? . . . Kim Hanneman, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. According to Neil O'Keeffe, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, if you use part of your home regularly and exclusively for business purposes, you may be able to deduct a part of the operating expenses on your home like mortgage, utilities, and insurance payments.
But expenses are deductible only if the space is in your principal place of business. And if you take a business deduction for anything that is also used for personal or family household purposes, such as a computer, then you must limit the deduction to that portion of the expense that is attributable only to its business use.
The complication to which your accountant referred probably had to do with depreciation rules. If you depreciate the part of your residence used for the business, it would affect your ability to postpone paying the tax on any profit when you sell.
For additional information, consult I.R.S. publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, which can be ordered by telephoning 800-829-3676.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: On the Move in Manhattan;
In a Weak Market, Alluring Lease Deals Abound

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AS millions watched the parade of tall ships up the Hudson yesterday, employees and partners at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae were busily consolidating the operations of their diversified law firm at 125 West 55th Street.
The firm, which moved from two locations in Manhattan, is occupying 203,000 square feet on eight contiguous floors, plus a portion of the main floor and basement level. The space is about 40 percent larger than the firm's total leasing commitments in the past. 
 "Even so, our costs will actually be less," said Alan Berman, a member of the firm's administrative committee, as he extolled the virtues of making a move in a weakened marketplace.
Thus, he said, although the lease at LeBoeuf's former primary location at 520 Madison Avenue still had two years to run the opportunity was too tempting to let go. The new landlord, he said, was even willing to buy out the old lease.
Similar reasons have been cited by other commercial tenants that signed leases in Manhattan over the last 18 months, with law firms among the most active.
Leasing Trends, an annual report by Cushman & Wakefield that measures industry trends for leases in excess of 10,000 square feet, shows that in midtown almost 90 percent of the 1991 transactions involved law firms. And they have continued to dominate midtown activity in the first half of 1992, with twice as many deals as any other sector.
The survey also showed a 30 percent decline in the amount of Manhattan space leased -- 16.8 million square feet in 1991 against 21 million square feet in 1990.
Yet by mid-1992, leasing volume had picked up and was 40 percent above 1991 levels, according to a mid-year report from Edward S. Gordon Company, a commercial brokerage. So had asking rents in midtown and downtown, although rents continued their decline in Midtown South. The averages were $33.70 in midtown, $16 in Midtown South and $28.85 downtown, about 30 percent below the market peak in the late 80's.
Frederick Kane Marek, a senior vice president at Julian J. Studley, who specializes in law firms, attributes the high activity in the law sector to an opportunity to grab space in prestigious buildings at a time of increased vacancies and lowered rents. He further maintains that the frantic merry-go-round among law firms is also the result of the recent rash of mergers.
"I've seen more law firms merge in the last year or so than I've seen in the past 24," he said. When this happens, he explained, space needs change radically. And landlords have been tempting many of the new entities to stay on by offering to terminate an old lease without penalty if they are willing to take space with the same owner, even if it's in another building.
But some of the law firms, like LeBoeuf, that developed an expertise in growth areas such as bankruptcy and international commerce, have chosen to move because they have also been expanding.
Indeed, the companies that predominate in the Cushman & Wakefield report include many that have prospered during the recession.
"WHAT you are seeing is larger companies taking advantage of situations that may not come again for another 10 or 15 years," said Percy Pyne, principal in the Pyne Companies Ltd., commercial consultants and brokers. "For the really big users with offices all over town its also been a chance to set their houses in order."
The Cushman & Wakefield survey also showed high leasing activity among insurance, advertising and financial services firms. The insurance industry, for example, rose to first place in 1991 with 12.4 percent of the total leases. The year before it had been in sixth place.
Part of this had to do with the rapid expansion of health maintenance organizations. One of the major leases signed in the insurance industry, for instance, involved the move of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP) into 211,000 square feet of space at 7 West 34th Street. It moved from three sites with a total of only 130,000 square feet, according to Steven Cohen, its chief operating officer.
Once again, growth was the motivating factor, together with an opportunity for consolidation at a time that the company considered "perfect" for a major space reorganization, said Mr. Cohen. "We took advantage of an ideal market to position ourselves for the future as well as for our present needs," he said.
A similar tale of expansion coupled with an opportunity for consolidation is told by Leslie C. Quick 3d, president of the Quick & Reilly Group. The company is a fast-growing firm of discount retail brokers and financial services that has benefited by shifts of money lately by an increasing number of people out of low-yielding certificates of deposit and into the financial markets.
QUICK & REILLY moved in May into 62,000 square feet at 26 Broadway and has already taken a further 5,000 square feet in the same building, said Mr. Quick. The total is about 25 percent higher than the company had previously occupied around the city, he noted, and all "for about the same cost as before."
"We particularly wanted a presence in this building and it was a wonderful chance to get in," he said, mentioning also how pleasant it was to be able to see the Statue of Liberty from his 11th floor window.
Eric Ossorio, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield who frequently works with companies that need less than 10,000 square feet of space -- companies not included in the Leasing Trends survey -- said the profile of the smaller users mirrored the larger ones. Smaller users normally account for about half of total space leased in Manhattan.
The advertising sector, he said, included newly-created spin-off partnerships of senior personnel at the larger agencies who had lost their jobs as advertising languished in the doldrums and had decided to start their own concerns. Many smaller companies in law and advertising were also on a "flight to quality" now that the costs in quality buildings were down.
Some of these smaller spaces offered particularly appealing quarters because "landlords had been stuck when a company had suddenly gone out of business," he said. He mentioned, by way of example, 6,500 square feet of what he called "drop dead" space at 135 East 57th Street with paneling, marble floors and a top-of-the-line kitchen. Once the New York headquarters of Alan Bond, the failed Australian financier, it was now on the market.
A concurrent chance to get out high-priced space was also a strong motivation to make a deal, he said, "because when you're only a small partnership your rent becomes a particularly crucial part of your overhead."

HEADLINE: A $234.6 Million Mixed-Use Tower For the West Side

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
AS backhoes clawed the earth last week near Lincoln Center, a development partnership led by Christopher M. Jeffries announced that it had raised the $234.6 million financing needed to build one of the most mixed mixed-use structures that New York City is ever likely to see.
The project, called Lincoln Square, is to have 38 floors of rental and condominium apartments. Its commercial base, which is already leased or sold, would hold 10 movie theaters, including a 900-seat house and a giant-screen Imax auditorium; a sports center; a post office and book, music, clothing and athletic apparel stores. 
 Neighbors are looking warily, even angrily, at the prospect of an 800,000-square-foot building that would rise 545 feet and fill the block from Broadway to Columbus Avenue, 67th to 68th Streets. Lincoln Square would add hundreds of residents and thousands of moviegoers, shoppers and athletes to an area that now seems close to bursting at times -- especially near curtain time.
But the developers maintain that the project can be built as a matter of right under zoning rules. The city's Buildings Department has agreed with them, approving the overall plan and granting a construction permit for the east half of the site, where work has begun.
What may be most striking about Lincoln Square is that a project of such magnitude is under way at all.
"We felt that the only way of succeeding was to surround ourselves with people who were much bigger, whose stamp of approval meant something to the other participants," said Mr. Jeffries, a partner in the development group, Millennium Partners, and general partner in Lincoln Metrocenter Partners, which owns the project.
Lincoln Metrocenter also has an option to purchase the block immediately south of the project site from Capital Cities/ABC, which owned the Lincoln Square block.
MICHAEL BAILEY, a vice president at J. P. Morgan, which is serving as financial adviser, said: "We worked to structure a transaction that was pre-bought and preleased, so investors and lenders could look at something that was quantifiable and creditworthy and removed some of the cynicism and doubt we all have in this real-estate market."
Rather than build first and market later, the developers sold or leased the entire commercial base and many of the apartments. Tenants and owners include Barnes & Noble; the Gap; Goldman, Sachs; Loews Theater Management Corporation, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment; Morgan; Reebok International; Sumitomo Real Estate Sales; Trans World Music; the United States Postal Service and the Zeckendorf Company.
A $142.5 million construction loan has come from the Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank of Munich and the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Stuttgart. And the developers secured a completion guarantee from the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company of London. This diversified international company is the parent of Lehrer McGovern Bovis, the construction manager at Lincoln Square.
The mix needed to make Lincoln Square economically possible will insure its long-range success, the developers believe. "That's the most exciting feature -- the integration of so many high-quality individuals in a single structure," said Philip E. Aarons, a partner in Millennium, who was also allied with Mr. Jeffries in the General Atlantic Realty concern. The third partner in Millennium is Philip Lovett.
Charles Lowrey, a vice president in Morgan's real estate group, said, "We tried to find a series of institutions that would be compatible partners or neighbors and that, for fundamental strategic corporate reasons, needed to be on this site."
To lure these companies, the developers offered a 55,500-square-foot, full-block site where tenants could create spaces to suit their needs, rather than squeeze into narrow confines. "It's as though Loews and Sony went to the suburbs, bought a piece of land and said, 'Here's how I'd design my business,' " Mr. Jeffries noted.
But with one critical difference -- the location. "We see this as a Lincoln Center site," Mr. Aarons said. "In our minds, it is very much an extension of Lincoln Center."
Crowded and cosmopolitan, the area mixes cultural institutions, high-rise apartment towers, restaurants and cinemas. Many who live there believe that enough has been built already and that too much is in store, when Lincoln Square is added to the Riverside South and Manhattan West projects nearby.
Lincoln Square would clearly have a profound impact. Atop an 8-story commercial base, a 38-story apartment tower would rise in mid-block. There would be 47 floors in all, including one for mechanical equipment, but at 545 feet, it would be equivalent to a 54-story apartment tower. The architects are Kohn Pedersen Fox and Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron, both of Manhattan.
On Broadway would be the entrance to the 110,000-square-foot Loews Lincoln Plaza Metroplex, including the third largest movie house in Manhattan, a 900-seat theater where Hollywood-style premieres would be staged.
"One of the reasons for the paucity of old-fashioned premieres in New York is the absence of an appropriate venue," said A. Alan Friedberg, chairman of Loews. "A venue across from Lincoln Center is more conducive for the kinds of audiences that turn out for a motion-picture premiere."
Another auditorium would have an 85-by-125-foot Imax screen. While Imax science and nature films are familiar to museum-goers, Mr. Friedberg said this 600-seat house would be the first to show commercial movies in this format. There would be four theaters with 370 seats each and four with 215 seats each, some showing art and specialty films.
Next door would be a 22,000-square-foot Barnes & Noble "superstore," which would stock up to 100,000 book titles and 1,400 periodicals, about four times more than the average Barnes & Noble store. South of that would be Gap and Gap Kids clothing stores and a 22,000-square-foot Coconuts music store, a division of Trans World Music.
The Ansonia Post Office, now on Broadway, would be moved to Columbus Avenue, where it would own and occupy 40,000 square feet. Next door would be a 12,000-square-foot Reebok store, selling athletic apparel.
TOGETHER with the manager of Sports Club/LA in Los Angeles, Reebok would run a 135,000-square-foot sports center that has been proposed. It would have a 25-meter swimming pool; basketball, volleyball and squash courts; an outdoor running track on the eighth-floor setback; weight-lifting and exercise areas and dining rooms.
"We view it as an entire laboratory," said John Frascotti, Reebok's director of licensing, "where we can talk to our customers and experiment" with new equipment.
The residential tower, entered through lobbies on 67th Street, would have four strata.
The first 6 floors, with 79 apartments, would be owned by Morgan and used to house corporate trainees and traveling executives.
The next 13 floors, with 91 apartments, would be rented by Lincoln Metrocenter.
Above that would be 56 units on 8 floors, owned by a group that the developers will identify only as Middle Eastern. These are to be used by business travelers who stay in the New York for months at a time.
At the top of the building would be 88 condomium apartments over 11 floors that are to be sold by a group whose partners are the Zeckendorf Company, Sumitomo Real Estate Sales New York and Goldman, Sachs.
That adds up to a critical mass that comforts investors but infuriates neighbors.
"The community is outraged," said Hope L. Mason, chairwoman of Community Board 7, adding that it was also frustrating because "when something is as-of-right, we don't have any say." She said the board had complained about the traffic jams, vehicular and pedestrian, that the theaters would create.
The president of the Landmark West preservation group, Arlene Simon, said that Lincoln Square would not only congest sidewalks and nearby subway stations but add to what is already "some of the worst pollution" in the city. "We are crazed by the fact that it is so insensitive," she said.
She charged that the application was "wrought with fraud," as the developers secured approval with plans that did not show the post office loading berths on 68th Street. Had they been shown, Ms. Simon said, the project would have had to go through a special-permit procedure involving community review and environmental analysis.
Mr. Aarons said that the plans did not show loading berths because "this is an issue for the city and the post office to deal with." In any event, he said, there would be "fewer loading docks than they currently have in exactly the location they're currently in."
As for traffic, Mr. Aarons said: "There are 10,000 theater seats at Lincoln Center. This is an entertainment environment. The building has been designed with extensive interior waiting areas and ticket areas, so there will not be large numbers of people on the streets. This will fit into the environment."
Zoning at the site permits a building 10 times the lot size, or 555,000 square feet. The developers also get a 20 percent "inclusionary housing" bonus, or 111,000 square feet, for having built low-income apartments at 123 West 104th Street and 171 West 107th Street. Another 111,000 square feet is below grade and not counted for zoning purposes. The remainder is mechanical space.
The 107th Street building, developed by General Atlantic, has 15 stories and 25 apartments. It generated 169,000 square feet of bonus space, 21,000 of which are applied to Lincoln Square. The 104th Street building, which Mr. Jeffries and Daniel Brodsky developed, has 11 stories and 56 apartments. It generated a 90,000-square-foot bonus.
THE developers of Lincoln Square also hope to take advantage of two types of tax benefits, both the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program and the Section 421-a program for residential construction.
They need authorization from the State Legislature to do so, because mixed-use projects were not eligible for tax deferrals under the commercial program as of December, when the developers applied. And no benefits are to be given for new commercial construction in Manhattan after December, under legislation proposed by city officials.

HEADLINE: Talking: Contractors;
Avoiding Pitfalls On Loans

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
WHEN Patricia Grimes, a home health aide, decided two years ago to put a porch on her Victorian home in Newark she was overjoyed to learn about a remodeling company that would also provide financing. "I don't earn very much," she said, "so I knew I would have had difficulty getting a loan on my own."
But Miss Grimes has found herself locked into monthly installments of $520 for the next 18 years (a total of $112,320), a much heavier and longer-term debt than she had originally been told was needed to repay the $35,000 she was borrowing. Moreover, she now fears it could cost her the house if she falls behind. 
 Miss Grimes is one of about 100,000 homeowners in 20 states that the Massachusetts Attorney General's office estimates are trapped in this latest contractor fraud -- unscrupulous financing. Massachusetts has had a severe outbreak.
Anyone considering allowing a contractor to finance as well as carry out a job should should check the company's reputation with regulatory authorities before making a commitment, officials say. And a more sophisticated outsider, preferably a lawyer, should look at any papers before they are signed. Even a seemingly innocent-looking application should be examined carefully because many defrauded homeowners have reported that they were led to believe they were signing only a loan application or work order.
"They rush you into signing before you know what's happening," Miss Grimes said.
Some homeowners say they were never even told the loan would put a lien on their homes or the terms would be different from what they had been led to expect. This was done, officials later discovered, by leaving some blank spaces and filling these in after the forms had been signed.
"If you know you can't get the kind of money you need on your own, it should be a warning to you to take a closer look at what you are being offered," said Bob Lippmann, president of the Long Island chapter of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry and the owner of HIS Inc., a remodeling company in Melville, L.I.
Normally, homeowners do best by getting their own financing, which lets them control disbursement of funds and make sure the work is satisfactory before releasing any. The most popular way is an equity loan, because the interest payments are deductible from taxable income, but some bankers have been tightening their requirements for such loans as recession makes incomes fall and property values sag.
"With money tight, many people can't afford to fix up their homes," said Emma Byrne, New Jersey's Director of Consumer Affairs. "These companies know this and deliberately set out to lure them into contracts that promise home repairs for easy credit."
Others say the growth of these schemes is equally symptomatic of an increase in non-English-speaking homeowners who may not be knowledgeable or alert to such practices.
In one pending Connecticut case, Luis and Dalila Montes, a couple from Puerto Rico, were offered a loan to help pay for vinyl siding on their home in New Haven. Folded into the offer was cash to pay off other loans.
In Miss Grimes's case, she conceded that an extra $14,000 the company was willing to lend her -- seemingly irrespective of her ability to make the payments -- became an added inducement. "I didn't even get any other estimates," she said.
Officials also believe the rise of these frauds may reflect growing competition among remodelers, a result of the decline of new residential construction that has left many builders and carpenters in need of alternative work.
THE contractor in Miss Grimes's case, Maywood Builders of Bogota, N.J., was charged in January with inducing homeowners to sign blank contracts, failing to disclose the total amount involved, understating the monthly installments and falsifying the true cost of the job along with the value of the home to get the necessary extended credit. Maywood has denied all this.
If the state wins, the contracts signed by Miss Grimes and others will be rescinded and they may be allowed to halt payments.
Contractors have been charged with similar schemes in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Michigan, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, according to the Boston tally.
"It's become a national problem," said Elizabeth Bradford, assistant attorney general in charge of the Nassau regional office in Mineola, L.I.
Ms. Bradford has been working on an alleged scam involving The Dartmouth Plan of Garden City, L.I., which, she maintained, acted as a sort of clearing house, setting up financing schemes for many contractors in the area. Dartmouth, which has also denied all charges, also operated throughout Connecticut.
Anyone who has signed for contractor-related financing in the last few years and is still making payments should find out if the company, or any lender to which payments are currently being made, has since been indicted or named in a suit. This can be done by calling the local office of the state's department of Consumer Affairs or Attorney General's office (found in the Blue Pages of the telephone book).
Citibank, for example, which eventually became the purchaser and servicing company for some of the loans initiated through Dartmouth (but was never directly involved in the scam) has agreed to assist its defrauded homeowners by lifting the liens on their homes and providing a cash payment towards the outstanding debt, said Ms. Bradford.
The 235 or so eligible homeowners holding Citibank loans will be notified this summer. In Massachusetts, Fleet/Norstar, Baybank and Shawmut are offering similar concessions.
Ms. Bradford recommended that anyone paying off contractor financing check with the local land records' office to see if a lien has been placed on the property -- even if a lien was not supposed to be part of the deal. She also recommended consulting a lawyer. The liens could have been fraudulently obtained or there could be other technical errors in the loan agreement, she said, which might make the agreements eligible for cancellation.
If so, she said, the homeowner would owe only the outstanding principal balance and be entitled to a refund of any interest paid to date. A homeowner has three years from the date the loan agreement was signed to apply to the courts for a recision, she said.

HEADLINE: Housing Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on April 5 headed "New York Slashing an Array of Programs" paints a distressing scenario for one of the most impressive government-led efforts since the New Deal. 
 New York City's 10-Year Housing Plan represents perhaps the most sensible, well-conceived government program now under way in our country, a plan -- unusually enough -- that has been delivering far beyond its original promises.
Responding to a critical housing shortage, the city since 1986 has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the production and preservation of thousands of units of decent, affordable housing for renters and homeowners alike. Encouraged by the city's commitment, other important players have entered the fray: national nonprofits like the Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Low Income Housing Fund; financial institutions such as Bankers Trust, Chemical Banking Corporation and the Community Preservation Corporation; even corporations traditionally not involved in financing housing, like Pfizer, American Express and the Continental Corporation.
These segments of the business and philanthropic community have joined in direct partnership with the myriad not-for-profit community development corporations that have proliferated in our city's neighborhoods.
New homes are springing up, fed by millions of dollars from public, private and philanthropic sources. Construction workers grateful for the opportunity to work in these hard times pour their best into their labors. Area suppliers revel in the purchased materials going into the newly constructed and rehabilitated homes. Homeless families move into new permanent homes while longtime renters feel the joy as first-time home buyers.
Commercial strips are revitalized in pursuit of new residents needing local goods and services. And neighborhoods taste the gifts of stabilization and renewed private investment. These are the ingredients of a vibrant economy, the foundation for a growing tax base, the antitoxin for a depressed economy.
If our nation offers a better example of a workable recession fighter than the city's 10-Year Housing Plan, I have yet to see it. Hard budgetary realities are upon us, to be sure. But in terms of its multiplier effect, economic and social, and its sheer success in fulfilling its objectives, this is one effort that should be zealously guarded.

HEADLINE: Rent-Loan Fund Expanding to Manhattan

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
A NEW, privately financed program that pays the back rents of Westchester County tenants facing imminent eviction is planning to expand to New York City this fall.
The 18-month-old program, the Bridge Fund, hopes to raise $150,000 for a nine-month trial period in a Manhattan neighborhood, which has not yet been selected. Fund-raising efforts are to begin this summer. 
 "What we are trying to do is set up a private financial safety net for the working poor," said Oscar S. Pollack, an investment adviser with Ingalls & Snyder in Manhattan and co-founder of the Bridge Fund.
The fund works by giving renters grants or no-interest loans with flexible repayment arrangements if they are in danger of becoming homeless. The money from the loans or grants is sent directly to third parties, such as landlords or public utilities.
To get a grant or loan for back or current rent -- or for a security deposit -- a family must be referred by a social service organization or religious institution; no walk-ins or telephone inquiries by tenants are accepted. The fund also helps a limited number of families and individuals move out of public shelters into permanent housing. There is no dollar limit on loans or grants, though most are under $2,000.
"What we are facing is, in many cases, a small difference between success and failure," Mr. Pollack said. "These are the working poor, and they just can't scrape up $800 or $1,000, and they have no access to credit."
He said that a director for the New York City program, Anna Fisch, was appointed last month. She is a co-founder of the Children's Hope Foundation, a pediatric AIDS volunteer organization.
He added that although the program has been successful in Westchester County, the demand for loans and grants in New York could easily overwhelm the tiny fund. That is why -- in the beginning, at least -- it will be limited to one neighborhood, as yet undetermined.
"We may also only take referrals from one or two community organizations at first," Mr. Pollack said.
The Bridge Fund was designed in May 1990 by the Rev. Peter R. Larom, rector of Grace Church in White Plains, in response to growing concerns about suburban homelessness and the strain the problem was placing on local taxpayers.
The fund raised money through churches, synagogues, corporations, foundations and private contributions. It began operation in January 1991, and in its first year raised $192,909 and disbursed $96,463 in loans and grants to 108 families and individuals in Westchester County. The balance was carried over into 1992; fund expenses for 1991 totaled about $45,000.
Of the 108 disbursements in 1991, 92 were made to prevent evictions or foreclosures, four were made to relocate people into less expensive housing and 12 were made to move families out of public shelters into permanent housing.
So far this year, the fund has made $49,700 in loans and grants to 66 families in the county. "Our projection is that we will go to $120,000 this year," said Stanley Schear, the director of the fund.
There is no means test for recipients except that they have nowhere else to turn for financial assistance and are in danger of becoming homeless. Many of the recipients are renters with low incomes and small children. Several others, however, have been small-business people who own their homes and were in danger of being foreclosed on.
"This is the first recession that has really hit the white-collar worker," Mr. Pollack said. "And as soon as they are hit with a crisis, they are in a position where they might fall over the cliff immediately."
The fund often requires clients to undergo financial counseling that includes bringing in their pay checks and making out their checks for rent and utilities in the presence of a counselor.
THERE are numerous other organizations in the New York region that offer assistance to renters who are about to be evicted. They include the Homeless Prevention Program in Passaic County, N.J., the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. They all differ from the Bridge Fund, however, in that they either receive Federal, state or local funds, make grants rather than loans, or they do not operate solely to prevent evictions.
"They don't do what we do, but they sometimes do something that is similar," Mr. Schear said. "For a lot of them, though, it is just a sideline, something that comes out of petty cash. They don't do things like offering financial counseling."
"Eighty percent of the people who come in here mismanage their money," he added.
Mara Perez is a typical recipient of a Bridge Fund loan. She lives in Yonkers and is a mother of a 10-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter. She arrived at the Bridge Fund offices on Aug. 15 with an eviction notice in hand, having been made aware of the program by a local social services counselor.
Fund officials analyzed her finances and determined that she was not managing her limited income properly; she receives Federal disability checks for herself and one of her children that total about $1,000 a month. They noted that her cable television bill and monthly rental fees for a VCR, stereo and a television exceeded her rent.
She received intensive counseling and agreed to allow fund officials to restructure her budget, getting rid of the rented equipment and buying minimal amounts of lower- priced items. She was also encouraged to supplement her disability and child-support income by starting a day-care business, taking care of working women's infants in her home.
When she agreed, the fund bought her a new crib and a playpen so she could qualify for network referrals, and last fall she opened for business, taking care of one child five days a week. The job also enables her to stay at home with her children and maintain a more stable household.
"It's a great program," Miss Perez said. "They didn't say anything about paying it back."
Clients are encouraged to pay back loans, if and when they can. In 1991, loans totaling $18,835 were paid back to the fund.
"It is an indication to us that people are trying to be responsible," Mr. Pollack said. "This is not a welfare program."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Employment: Not Great, but Not Horrible

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
More people were working in America in June than in any month since the end of 1990.
If that's not what you thought you read in the papers last week, don't worry. It isn't. The report that employment plunged in June, with nonfarm payrolls declining by 117,000, helped to persuade the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates yet again and spurred more talk about a "triple-dip" recession. 
 In reality, however, there were 457,000 more people employed in June than in May.
The difference between those two figures -- aside from the obvious political implications -- is seasonal adjustment. The Government figures that employment levels should increase sharply in June, with school out for the summer and a new crop of graduates available to work. And it figures the numbers should drop in the fall and again in the winter, because school resumes and some seasonal jobs end with the cold weather. So it adjusts the numbers to take into effect those seasonal factors, and the adjusted numbers are the ones that get the publicity.
It is hardly surprising that businesses are hiring fewer summer workers this year or that graduates are having a tougher time finding employment than their older siblings did a few years back. But the seasonal adjustments assume that this year is no different from any other.
In sum, the economy is neither doing as well as some statistics earlier this year seemed to indicate nor as badly as June's have scared people into believing. This is a stuttering recovery, far weaker than normal, with a decided deflationary tinge, and the Fed is following rates down, not leading them in that direction. "I don't think the Fed did anything more than confirm what the money markets were saying," said Chuck Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief equity strategist.
History and most economists argue that lower rates will eventually get the economy moving. But there are differences in this economy from previous ones. Weaponry used to be a reliable and stable industry; now there are huge layoffs of well-paid workers at Hughes Aircraft. State and local governments are slashing payrolls and forcing current workers to accept smaller paychecks. Politicians fear that tax increases will destroy their re-election chances, and many companies are finding that price increases are no easier to impose.
Last December, lower interest rates sparked a stock-buying panic among individual investors, and it could happen again, especially considering the large cash positions that have built up in mutual funds. But bonds look like a far safer investment. Mr. Clough has a point when he says it is hard to envision the kind of credit demand that will drive rates up.
The real message of the economic statistics last week is that this recovery is not going to be a great one, at least not anytime soon. But the numbers do not mean that the sky is falling or that a new recession is about to begin.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Rain in Spain, and Elsewhere

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
It was an unhappy time in world stock markets as the first half of the year ended.
Markets in Spain, Italy and Norway were at 1992 lows. In Japan, the Nikkei index was hovering around its lowest level in six years. The British rally that came after the election of Prime Minister John Major had lost its footing; the Financial Times index was 7.9 percent off its 1992 peak and at its lowest level since the election. Germany and France had retreated from recent highs. And the Mexican stock market miracle had, at least temporarily, unraveled. 
 There is new worry abroad about the economic outlook. It does not look as if the German Bundesbank will ease interest rates soon. The economic recovery in Britain, like the one in the United States, is showing disturbing signs of weakness. In the United States the surprising drop in nonfarm jobs in June helped to persuade the Federal Reserve to cut the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point on Thursday.
The only recent good news for investors is that the Hong Kong stock market, the top performer of the year, continues to chug along to all-time highs. It is up 46.5 percent for the first half of the year.
In addition, the fall of the dollar, which is down sharply against most major currencies since mid-April, has meant that Americans who sold foreign stocks received a nice boost when their proceeds were converted back into dollars. The Financial Times index of world markets registered a decline of 2.8 percent in the second quarter, but this was equal to an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in terms of the United States dollar.
In this summer slump, Henry B. W. de Vismes, the head of international investments at Citibank Global Asset Management North America, is resting a little easier than some other money managers.
He is a stock picker, focusing on companies that he expects to show strong growth in the next two to three years. The ups and downs of markets and the economic outlooks for the countries they are in concern him less than the prospects of individual companies. He believes he can find good bets in any cycle. And the retreat of markets now provides Mr. de Vismes with the opportunity to pick up some of his favorites like Mexico's telephone company, Telmex, for a little less. "You can always find value, even in an uncertain macroeconomic climate," he said.
Mr. de Vismes starts by looking for companies whose growth in earnings per share is projected to outperform the average for their home stock markets for the next two or three years. But he won't buy a stock -- even when its growth potential is rosy -- if its ratio of earnings per share to the stock price is more than 10 percent above the market average.
This gives him a portfolio of about 70 stocks that on average have a projected 1992 earnings growth rate of 19.5 percent, compared with a local market average of 1.5 percent. The portfolio's price-earnings ratio is 14.6, compared with an average of 26.6 for the markets over all.
The Landmark International Equity Fund, a small mutual fund he manages that reflects the investment decisions he makes for many of Citibank's private clients, is up 4.5 percent through June 30. Because he picks individual stocks instead of national markets, he has 18 percent of his money in Japan. This is actually a rather high percentage compared with many other managers who have given up on Japan for the time being. He has 52 percent in Europe, 11 percent in Latin America and the rest in Asia.
Mr. de Vismes's strategy requires discipline on several counts. He has to be willing to hold a stock for some time to get the expected gains. At the same time, Mr. de Vismes does not want to risk being too greedy. So he sets a threshold for reviewing his holdings. When a stock's price-earnings ratio gets to 10 percent above the market average, it is reviewed. Unless there is a special factor accounting for this rise -- like a takeover bid or new and higher earnings -- it is sold.
Living with this long-term strategy is still not easy, partly because projected earnings growth may not show up in the stock price very quickly. Still, while some stocks in the Citibank portfolio are not living up to expectations, they have done better than the average performance for the markets in which they are traded.
For example, Aoyama Trading, a discount retail outlet in Japan that Mr. de Vismes began buying in March, closed at 7,500 yen on Friday. That is down 5.7 percent for the year, but it is far better than the performance of the blue-chip Nikkei index, which is off 27.3 percent, or the broader Topix index, which is off 24.6 percent. But, at the same time, the stock is down 17 percent from its 1992 high of 9,050 yen in February.
Albert Fisher, a British food retailer, has yet to show its promise. Mr. de Vismes began buying the stock in the middle of last year and kept buying through March. The stock was at around 115 pence a share last July but has fallen since then, hitting a 1992 low of 58 pence in February. It struggled back to 83 pence in May, but closed on Friday at 68 pence.
"I am not a market timer," he said, explaining why he does not worry about missing what might be temporary highs.
One of the very successful bets has been the News Corporation, headed by Rupert Murdoch, which trades in Australia and has an American Depository Receipt on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the recent retreat in the Australian and American markets, the News Corporation is up 38 percent, closing in New York on Thursday at $31.875, far outperforming both markets.

HEADLINE: America, Land of the Long-Term Financing for Foreigners

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Showing that a pullback in 1990 was only a pause, foreign corporations have resumed their rush to the United States to sell tens of billions of dollars worth of stock and bonds to American investors.
The issuers include British biotechnology companies; Spanish and Portuguese banks; Argentine, Mexican and British phone companies; Venezuelan paper, petrochemical and metal concerns; French oil companies; Indian textile, metals and petrochemical companies, and Japanese and South Korean electronics giants. 
 The renewed interest in the United States is part of a larger trend: companies, governments and supranational organizations like the World Bank are increasingly peddling big blocks of securities around the world. They are aiming in the equity markets for the highest possible prices, and in the bond markets for the lowest-possible interest rate on the longest-possible maturity.
"You want to turn over as many rocks as you can to make sure you achieve the maximum possible demand," said Robert K. Steel, a managing director at Goldman Sachs International Ltd., the American investment bank's London-based arm.
This is happening as competition for capital intensifies while banks remain stubbornly hesitant to lend. Demand for capital is growing among everyone from Eastern Europeans, who need to rebuild their economies, to Western European, Latin American and Asian governments selling state-owned companies.
In scrambling to expand their sources of supply, all naturally look to the United States, the world's largest and most sophisticated market.
Analysts blame the 1990 decline in foreign securities sales in the United States on the uncertainty generated by the Persian Gulf War and a pause in sales of state-owned companies. But in 1991, the sale of foreign shares in public and private deals doubled, to a record $9.78 billion, according to the London-based IFR Securities Data Company. Bond deals rose 48 percent, to $55.33 billion.
Based on results so far this year, investment bankers think the 1992 totals will at least match and probably exceed last year's.
What makes the United States markets so attractive? Largely, an easing of disclosure rules, low interest rates and increasingly adventuresome American investors.
"U.S. institutional and retail investors have over the past 18 months become very avid buyers of foreign equities and bonds," said Julian Summer, a managing director at London-based Merrill Lynch International Ltd. "This is a major sea change."
Merrill Lynch expects the value of foreign securities held by Americans to increase to $875 billion in the year 2000; that would be up from $275 billion in 1991 and just $120 billion in 1985. One reason is the increase in mutual funds in the United States that invest in foreign securities. As of May, the assets of stock funds that invest largely outside the United States stood at $41.8 billion, more than twice the level at the end of 1988, and assets of global bond funds have soared to $28.5 billion from just $3 billion in 1988.
The regulatory atmosphere in the United States has become more friendly with the easing of disclosure rules under Rule 144A, which the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced in 1990. Foreigners can now sell securities to big institutional investors, disclosing only the data required in their home markets.
For American investors, who have long been more receptive to a wider range of stocks and bonds than their foreign counterparts, the rush of foreign offerings has meant new opportunities to increase their returns -- something many have been seeking as falling interest rates have reduced their bond returns.
Investment bankers point to some interesting plays among recent foreign issues, particularly European and Latin American telephone companies, French oil companies like Total and Elf-Aquitaine and a German software company named SAP.
There has been an especially noticeable rise in the number of European companies and banks issuing debt and preferred shares, including Sweden's SKF and Electrolux, France's Banque Paribas and Britain's British Petroleum, Grand Metropolitan and British Aerospace. Many now have big United States operations and prefer to borrow for them in dollars.
Even foreign companies without American operations are being drawn to the United States. These borrowers, especially those without top credit ratings, have found that the cost of selling dollar-denominated debt in the United States -- that is, the interest-rate level -- is lower than in the Euromarket, which remains unreceptive to corporate issues rated below single-A.
Borrowers can also obtain maturities of up to 30 years in the United States compared with an effective maximum of 10 years in the Euromarket. This has become increasingly important to companies like Grand Metropolitan that are worried about the long-term availability of capital.
Grand Met, the British food, drinks and restaurant giant that owns Pillsbury and Burger King, raised $900 million in the United States last year by selling equal amounts of 5-, 10- and 20-year bonds. It used the proceeds to replace short-term borrowings.
"We wouldn't have been able to achieve that in the Eurobond market," said Simon D. A. Martin, Grand Met's assistant group treasurer. "We may go back to the U.S."
By giving foreign companies more flexibility, the burgeoning world of interest-rate and currency swaps has also encouraged foreign companies to exploit the advantages that borrowing in dollars in the United States might have over another market at a given time. A company can issue fixed-rate dollar-denominated bonds, then through swaps, choose alternative payment patterns -- ending up, for example, paying floating interest rates in Japanese yen, and the principal in British pounds.
Companies have also discovered it can pay to look abroad for capital because different types of securities may be more highly valued in one country than another. This helps explain why two British biotech companies, British Bio-technology Group and Cantab Pharmaceuticals, are interested in the United States.
In the United States, plenty of investors are willing to buy shares of biotechnology companies that not only have never made any money but have yet to bring a product to market. Although the London Stock Exchange is considering making an exception for biotechnology companies, companies generally cannot obtain an exchange listing until they have a five-year profit record.
Barring a sudden collapse, the overall value of deals in the international equities market seems set to pass the $19.4 billion worth of shares sold in public offerings in 1991. So far this year, companies have sold $14 billion worth outside their home markets, according to Securities Data. That is already more than the $12 billion sold in all of 1990.
Getting into the global market themselves, American companies have sold $5.7 billion worth of common and preferred shares in public offerings outside the United States this year, meaning the 1992 total is certain to exceed the $6 billion in 1991.
However, although investment bankers are confident of strong long-term growth, there are some signs that the international market may be losing a bit of steam. They include the recent withdrawal of an $800 million to $1.06 billion initial public offering by GPA Group P.L.C., an Ireland-based aircraft lessor, after institutional investors in Europe, the United States and Japan expressed little interest. American companies that have postponed deals include Payless Cashways, Gulfstream Aerospace, Franklin Mint and Trident NGL.
GPA's withdrawal may have been an anomaly. Some apparent reasons were concerns about its high debt level, the fragile health of its airline customers throughout the world and the lack of a big home market to serve as a base for the offering.
Investment bankers blame the general pullback on the recent weakening of American and European stock markets and the continuing slide in the Tokyo market, reflecting investor nervousness about those economies. A slide in the Mexican stock market has also deflated what had been one of the hottest international sectors: Mexican stocks.
The bankers, pointing to some post-GPA successes as proof, are confident that planned sales of relatively high-quality shares will go ahead. Delta Air Lines raised $1.15 billion through an international sale of 23 million convertible preferred shares, 10 percent of which was sold abroad. And the French Government's offer of 22.9 million shares in Total, for about $1 billion, was oversubscribed.
Wellcome Trust, a charitable trust that owns 73.5 percent of Wellcome P.L.C., the British drug company, seems confident about international demand for shares it plans to sell in late July. It says its investment bankers believe they can smarket 330 million to 380 million shares, worth $5.42 billion to $6.24 billion at current market prices. Some 80 million shares are earmarked for the United States.
Even if some sellers have to accept lower prices, many investment bankers are confident the international equity market will pick up steam within a few months. "It's a comma and not a full stop," Charles G. T. Stonehill, a managing director of Morgan Stanley & Company, said of the current slowdown.
Indeed, bankers say plenty of the forces that have been behind the rise in international securities deals in general and foreign sales in the United States in particular are still there.
Sellers often have no choice now but to try more than one market. The size of many issues dwarfs their home market's capacity.
A large number of foreign offerings also have involved governments selling all or part of their shares in state-owned companies. The pioneer in such privatizations in the 1980's, Britain, was also the pioneer in international stock offerings. Many proved to be very lucrative for buyers.
But the market really began to soar in the last few years when Latin Americans, led by Mexico, began to do the same. The deal widely seen as having kicked off a flood of international sales was the $2.17 billion sale of shares in the Mexican phone company, Telefonos de Mexico, last year. Goldman Sachs oversaw it.
Investment bankers point out that the privatization boom shows no signs of abating in Europe, Asia or Latin America.
It is also expected that American companies will continue to spin off foreign units in international offers to exploit the higher value investors sometimes place on their individual parts than on their whole. One example was the April sale of Waste Management Inc.'s European unit, orchestrated by Merrill Lynch.
In addition, many American and some British companies that loaded up with debt in the 1980's or early 1990's are now trying to reduce it, or replace it with cheaper debt. These include companies that went private via leveraged buyouts and have recently gone public with international equity offerings, like America's Duracell, Burlington and RJR Nabisco. A planned public offering by Revlon is expected to be international, too.
There is also no sign that banks around the world will open up the lending spigots anytime soon. Indeed, many banks are trying to raise capital themselves to shore up their own balance sheets.
And Japanese companies must soon begin to refinance billions of dollars worth of bonds that were sold with equity warrants attached. Because of the plunging Japanese market, many warrants have been worthless when they expired. That has left these companies in need of equity to strengthen their balance sheets. It also has deflated the market for such bonds, generating speculation that Japanese companies could turn to international equity and bond issues.
"As the Japanese market moves down to a level of valuation comparable to other markets, Japanese stocks will become increasingly attractive to international investors," Mr. Stonehill said.
The importance of the United States to foreigners seeking capital helps to explain why American investment banks dominate the international stock and bond business. These firms -- including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers -- have vastly expanded their foreign presence in the last five years or so.
Paying homage to this dominance, British firms like Warburg, Robert Fleming and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, have been recruiting talent from them. "Our aim is to join the club," said Ian Hannam, a Fleming director who had been at Salomon.

THE ECONOMY
 
The Fed's Short-Term Medicine for the Economy's Long-Term Ills 

 It was a tough couple of weeks to be Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Bush Administration's heaviest hitters -- including the President -- took turns trying to persuade Mr. Greenspan to bring down interest rates. The Fed finally caved in last week, trimming the discount rate to 3 percent from 3.5 percent, after a sharp rise in unemployment and a bevy of lackluster economic statistics revealed that the economy was going nowhere, at best. But not every economist agrees the Fed's prescription will rid the economy of its problems. "What is inhibiting the economy is not the level of interest rates," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "The economy is being held back by structural impediments," including lots of corporate and consumer debt. Finessing interest rates is more suited, he said, to smoothing the ups and downs of the business cyclethan fixing long-term ills.
 
Unemployment's K.O. Punch
 
When the Labor Department said unemployment shot up to 7.8 percent in June from 7.5 percent in May, it set the economy trembling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.81 points, to 3,330.29, on the news, and bond prices shot up. Economists were stunned to find that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, 117,000 people had been trimmed from the nation's June payrolls. Their consensus forecast was that unemployment would fall. "It was a real one-two punch," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. "I was just working on my mid-year review with a prognosis of positive, slow growth. These numbers are so shocking, now I don't know if I'll stay with that."
 
Half a Jobless Program?
 
With 10 million Americans out of work -- and the jobless-benefits bill about to expire -- House and Senate negotiators met last week to hammer out a compromise to extend jobless benefits. The measure, which passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate, extends worker benefits for up to 26 weeks. President Bush said he will sign the $5.5 billion measure as soon as it reaches his desk. But he chastised Congress for not passing his economic stimulus package. "The president's program is dead in the water," said Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "At some point, Congress will move to a substantial infrastructure and jobs program, but it can't happen until after the election."

Confidence Refuses to Budge
 
After showing steady improvement for three straight months, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index remained virtually unchanged at 71.7 in June. It was 71.9 in May. In 1985, the index, which measures how upbeat consumers feel about the economy and their job prospects for the future, was 100. The index is considered a reliable forecasting tool of future economic behavior. "We've had this before in recessions -- good gains for a couple of months then it flattens out," said Fabian Linden, director of the survey. "I'm not terribly pessimistic. But if we get another report like this one in July, I'd be concerned the recovery is petering out."
 
The Prime Falls in Line
 
The Fed led the way last week when it whacked half a point from the discount rate. That move was quickly followed by the nation's largest commercial banks, which trimmed the prime rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent. Since the spread between the rate at which the banks borrow and lend will remain the same, the drop in the prime is not expected to affect the banks' bottom lines.

Forecast: More of the Same
 
If the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators is any guage at all, the economy will remain a 98-pound weakling for some time to come. The index, which forecasts economic activity six to nine months in the future, expanded by six-tenths of a percent last month, the fifth increase in a row but a wimpish one at that. Such lackluster growth has economists worried. "The recovery still looks rather fragile," said Norman Robertson at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Jump-Starting Japan's Economy
 
When Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Washington for talks with President Bush, he was all smiles. To put some snap in Japan's sagging economy, Mr. Miyazawa said he would use "every possible means." Then he outlined to Mr. Bush details of a $48 billion to $55 billion supplemental budget intended to move Japan from near-zero growth to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Faster growth will shrink Japan's huge trade surpluses, he said, by increasing domestic demand. Tokyo's surpluses are certain to be a topic at this week's economic summit in Munich. But while Mr. Bush said he was "encouraged," economists here and in Japan were skeptical about the plan. The spending "package is so vague that we can't see how it could stimulate domestic demand," said Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute in Tokyo.

McDonnell's Two China Policy
 
While the McDonnell Douglas Corporation was busy trying to sell a stake in itself to an investor group from Taiwan that includes the Government, the company's commercial airplane manufacturing group was equally busy stitching together a deal to assemble planes in China -- Taiwan's historic rival. Last week, McDonnell said its China program had paid off. It will supply China with 40 mid-range jetliners in a deal worth more than $1 billion, with the possibility of selling the country 130 additional planes by mid-decade. The planes -- twin-engine MD-80's and MD-90's -- will be assembled in China with components from the United States and Canada. The Boeing Company also competed for the the deal.

Norway Abandons Whaling Ban
 
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway used to be known as the environmental prime minister; she was chairwoman of a United Nations commission on that topic. But last week she jumped to the other side when she said Norway, along with 15 other nations, would no longer abide by the moratorium on hunting minke whales. Though environmentalists dispute it, Norway contends minke whales are no longer endangered.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Saving the Endangered Osprey
 
Though they call the V-22 the "Osprey," for months it appeared that this awkward-looking, tilt-wing whirlybird would never get off the ground. The Osprey, which is made by Bell Helicopter Textron in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters in Delaware County, Pa., has been the subject of a tug-of-war between Congress and the Pentagon. Congress wanted to build 500 Ospreys, which take off like helicopters but fly like airplanes, for $30 billion. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the aircraft was too costly and too heavy; he wanted to kill it. But high-tech weapons built in states with large electoral votes are difficult to cut outin an election year. Last week, Mr. Cheney agreed to a compromise: $1.5 billion would be set aside to develop the Osprey.

Chrysler's New Gamble
 
Much of the redesign work at the Chrysler Corporation has been internal -- layoffs and a massive realignment of its development, engineering, manufacturing and purchasing operations. But while management was doing its thing, the designers were doing theirs. Last week the first bright-red fruits of the engineers' labors rolled off the line: the Eagle Vision, one of Chrysler's new LH models. Analysts were impressed with the car. "If they're a dud, every one of us who's ever seen this car, driven it, wrote about it or touched it is going to be wrong," said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.

Mr. Perot Takes on a Bank
 
When still-undeclared presidential candidate Ross Perot went on TV last week to answer questions, he noted that the biggest American bank was only the 21st largest in the world. He didn't name the bank but the nation's biggest is Citibank. Then he said: "If you ever take the third world loans that'll never be paid out, it's insolvent." That was refuted by the Comptroller of the Currency, a bank regulator. Not unusually, Mr. Perot had put his money where his mouth was. His most recent financial disclosure statement showed he had sold short about $1 million of Citibank stock, meaning he stands to gain from a fall in its price.

A New Face at The New Yorker
 
Last week, when S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Advance Publications, named Tina Brown as The New Yorker's new editor, it unsettled the literary community. Ms. Brown, a powerhouse in publishing, is editor of Vanity Fair. But while The New Yorker is witty, literary and wise -- some also say stodgy -- Vanity Fair is racy and hot. The New Yorker, once a mailbox-stuffer with 4,300 ad pages in 1981, had only 2,001 ad pages last year. Ms. Brown made Vanity Fair a hit, but what will she do to The New Yorker? "She'll treat the magazine's heritage tenderly," said Martin S. Walker, president of Periodical Studies Service, a magazine consulting firm. "But you'll see more younger writers, and she'll make it appeal to a younger audience, which is where its subscription growth has to come from."
 
The White House Stops a Sale
 
When a Federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan approved the sale last spring of the missile division of the bankrupt LTV Corporation to Thomson-CSF for $300 million, the losing bidders, the Lockheed Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation mounted a campaign to stop the deal. Thomson-CSF, which is French, is partly owned by the Government. The losing bidders warned that American missile technology could pass into foreign hands. Last week a Bush Administration panel recommended blocking the sale, saying there was no way to protect the technology.
 
Hughes' Woes Give G.M. a Loss
 
When the General Motors Corporation bought the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5.2 billion in 1986, it did so to diversify into a business that was a little less cyclical than automobiles. Trouble is, Hughes' main customer, the Pentagon, has been cutting its budget ever since the Soviet Union collapsed. Hughes said it will lay off 9,000 employees and take after-tax charges of $789.4 million in the second quarter. The charges mean G.M. is "looking toward a net loss of $250 million," said Harvey Heinback, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
 
Last week Braniff International Airlines shut down, the first victim of the airfare wars.

HEADLINE: Stop Ticketing Nudists In East Hampton

 BODY:
The use of "undercover" police officers to arrest nude sunbathers on the village beaches in East Hampton ["All Nudes Off the Beach," "Long Island Journal," May 31] is a misguided effort to enforce an archaic law. Nude recreation is becoming increasingly popular nationwide. The vast majority of those who enjoy nude beaches have shown consistent respect for the rights of non-nudist beachgoers. On Long Island, this is most apparent at Fire Island National Seashore, where nudists actively cooperate with National Park Service officials to preserve clothing-optional use of the Lighthouse Beach area.
The Naturist Society, a national nudist organization, has begun efforts to amend the New York State "exposure of a person" law, a poorly drafted statute that prohibits all public nudity. The proposed change would allow nude recreational activity where appropriate while continuing to ban lewd and disorderly conduct. 
 Police Chief Glen Stonemetz should take his cue from these developments. Instead of harassing nude sunbathers, help establish a rapport among nudist and non-nudist beachgoers and local residents. Instead of inciting beachfront confrontation, use communication and cooperation to address the complaints and concerns of all parties. Focus enforcement upon those who abuse the right to nude recreation, not upon those who seek only to enjoy it.
Such a policy would yield significant fringe benefit. Rather than take their business elsewhere, nude beach visitors would continue their contribution to the village economy. And rather than endure their ludicrous assignment on the sands, Chief Stonemetz's bathing-suit-clad officers would don their uniforms and resume their proper role of protecting and serving the people of East Hampton Village, clothed and unclothed alike.

HEADLINE: The Dangers In Privatization

 BODY:
The article "A Rush to Privatize Government Services" (May 31) issue is rather frightening.
It seems to me that whenever there is privatization of services in a governmental agency, the lower echelons like the bus drivers, custodians and kitchen workers in public schools lose jobs and benefits. Needless to say, there rarely is any attempt to cut down on higher echelons, even where called for in light of economic conditions. 
 Schools that have done this also are trying to extend this to teachers by hiring them for less than a full teaching load. Perhaps the ultimate folly will be the school staffed by daily teaching substitutes who certainly will never achieve tenure nor receive benefits. Watch the further decline of public education!
Private business has been steadily eroding the concept of the permanent worker through the use of "temps" for some years now.
Our society faces a very frightening future if this trend continues, for no one but a few will have any future.

HEADLINE: The Death Penalty: Questions to Weigh

 BODY:
Re: "Death-Penalty Law Tightened," May 17:
Lest we be led down New Jersey's path to mindless acceptance of execution of the first in line on death row, I urge New Jerseyans to find the time and courage now to think about capital punishment. 
 During the last 10 years since the death penalty statute was enacted in New Jersey, we've enjoyed a stay of conscience and consciousness concerning this decidedly disagreeable subject. Our time may be running out, especially in the wake of the recent rash of executions throughout the United States.
Of the many questions surrounding the concept of capital punishment, the following, I believe, demand careful consideration:
Are there life-or-death arguments to be voiced more loudly than the oft-heard ones that the death penalty may be a deterrent to violent crime, that execution may be more economical than life imprisonment, and that death may be the sole sure punishment? Is, perhaps, the more muted fourth rationale, that execution offers the victim's family and friends -- and all of us? -- the opportunity for revenge, the most undeniable rationale?
Yet, before we accept this "eye for an eye" justification, are we certain that we aren't actually trying to vicariously put to death a potential for wrongdoing that may lie within us all?
By "treating" symptoms rather than trying to cure root causes, is death by lethal injection anything more than a "quick fix" for violent crime? Can you be sure that you would develop "normally" if, as do so many criminals, you grew up in an inner-city ghetto or on a United States Indian reservation where seeds of criminality are nurtured by extreme poverty, lack of parental (or other wholesome) guidance, rampant drug and alcohol abuse, despair and hopelessness? Or, might you develop enough hate, rage and lack of control to commit heinous crimes?
Are you sure that the potential to murder (let alone for recidivism in general) is not also bred in a prison system that offers inmates little or no rehabilitation, yet whose conditions and attitudes provide breeding grounds for dehumanizing activity, rancor and wrath?
Do you really think that death, rather than a lifetime behind bars with no possibility of parole, is sure punishment for someone who has come to believe that life -- including his or her own -- is cheap and meaningless?
If we don't attempt to fully and humanely examine the issue of capital punishment, perhaps one paramount question remains: Who truly are the "uncivilized animals" in our society -- those who execute violent crimes or those who favor their premeditated execution?

Bidding the Wage Wars Goodbye

SERIES: One in an occasional series on coping with career dissatisfaction.

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
When Ron Moore went to New York last spring to appear on a television show, he was immune to the enticements of that holy city of conspicuous consumption. Not for Mr. Moore, an avowed skinflint, designer celery at triple-digit prices in the latest Manhattan chic-ery. Mr. Moore and his wife, Melodie, run Skinflint News, a monthly journal of frugality and practical advice, out of their Palm Harbor, Fla., home. Mr. Moore is no mere sunshine skinflint.
Because he knew the television appearance would give him a $50 food allowance , he packed a brown bag at home. "I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a fried bologna sandwich with mustard, a huge bag of popcorn and an orange from a neighbor's tree," Mr. Moore recounted in the May issue of Skinflint News. He ate doughnuts at the noon-time taping, during which he suggested such money-saving strategies as collecting the final slivers of bar soap and grinding them in a food processor into laundry powder. He saved his real appetite for the airline lunch on the flight back to Tampa-St. Petersberg and arrived home with the $50 intact. "It went into the general fund," he said. 
 Strictly speaking, Mr. and Mrs. Moore no longer need to be as frugal as they are. In the last five years, they have turned what used to be a drain on the income they made at two unsatisfying jobs -- Mr. Moore worked as an electrician, Mrs. Moore as a certified public accountant in Florida's depressed wage economy -- into a full-time venture that yields what they describe as a comfortable living. And though they might seem merely to be shrewd exploiters of the counterprodigal Zeitgeist of the 1990's, the Moores believe they used a philosophy that came to them quite naturally to take control of their lives.
"People think it's trendy," Mrs. Moore said. "But our newsletter is not a 90's thing. It's a way of life any time, recession or not."
Mr. Moore, who is 36 years old and grew up in southern Indiana, espouses a genetic theory of skinflintery. "I am a fourth-generation skinflint. My great-grandmother raised seven children, including two sets of twins, by herself on a seamstress's salary," he said. He remembers large family gatherings where relatives would produce lists of things they wanted to get rid of: "They would barter and trade. Once my dad swapped the roofing on our house. I don't know what he swapped it for."
Mrs. Moore, 31, grew up near Atlanta, in a similarly thrifty household, with three older brothers: "My mother did anything and everything she could to stretch the food dollar."
The Moores used to share with friends some of the money-saving tips handed down from their families. What came to them by birthright intrigued their friends. "We'd say, 'You're kidding -- you never made your own soap powder? Well, here's how,' " Mr. Moore said. They decided to start a newsletter to spread the gospel locally.
It was more than two years before what they thought of as a hobby began to pay off. Mr. Moore's original vision was to make an extra $100 or so every month. "That's what we needed to make it," he said.
Now Skinflint News has 30,000 subscribers who pay $12 a year for its blend of full-length features, on, say, buying a car or building up a savings account, and low-cost recipes and other frugality esoterica like how to dye pickled eggs with beet juice. Each issue contains suggestions from subscribers, most of which the Moores try to test before they print them. "Someone wrote in that you could make liquid soap by putting bar soap in the microwave," Mr. Moore said. "We never could make that work."
The Moores say they hear from many people who are skinflints out of necessity. "A lot of elderly people," said Mrs. Moore, "a lot of single mothers and newly married young people." Some economize to dig themselves out of the debt they took on during the 80's. "They realize they're just as happy as they were, so they keep up the skinflint lifestyle," Mrs. Moore said. But many readers, like the Moores, just think the discipline is good for the soul. "People with tons of money are still skinflints," Mrs. Moore said. "We will always be skinflints, no matter what."
The Moores are writing a book of tips and say they have turned down several acquisition offers from investors. They worry not at all about a Maine-based competitor, the Tightwad Gazette, because they feel it does not represent an authentic skinflint sensibility. Mr. Moore acknowledges that he seeks out the skinflint's high, when his endorphins get roused over a good deal at, say, an estate sale. He goes the day before a sale opens and often manages, with a little Florida blarney and a judicious flash of cash, to get a beat on other foragers: "By Saturday," he said, "all the fools are there paying retail."
 
 
 
 
THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SKINFLINT
 A sampling of advice from recent issues of Skinflint News (1460 Noell Blvd., Palm Harbor, Fla. 34683-5639; 813-785-7759).
* Never go grocery shopping hungry. You'll buy more than you need.
* Put the package of garbage bags in the bottom of your waste basket. Then when you throw out the full bag, you have an empty bag ready to go.
* When recycling aluminum cans, take them to your local scrap yard instead of the can crusher in the grocery store parking lot. The scrap yard will pay quite a bit more per pound than the can crusher.
* To get more juice when squeezing a lemon, drop it into hot water for a few minutes or put in the microwave at high for 20 seconds.
* Pour the juice from tuna fish over your cat's food. He will love the added flavor.
* Make empty plastic milk jugs into kitty-litter scoops by cutting off the bottom at an angle and punching holes in it.

HEADLINE: The Mild West;
Tourists Ride Into Town, Cowboys Ride Into the Sunset

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
BIG Sky. Open Space. A man's got to do what a man's got to do. These sentiments are selling better than ever, in Ralph Lauren-styled clothing and furniture, vacations built around cowboy themes, and range country sliced into 20-acre "ranchettes" tailored for the urban refugee.
At high noon it's easier to get espresso in Bozeman, Montana, than it is to find an available spittoon. But many of those people sipping their iced caffe lattes have come to Bozeman, not far from where Ted Turner is raising buffalo on his vast ranch, precisely because tobacco-spitting is part of the mythic landscape. 
 The West as a home for dust-chewing cowboys, lonely ranchers and strong-willed miners and loggers has all but disappeared. But the West as a theme park built around its legends is stronger than ever.
Nearly a hundred years after the American frontier was pronounced dead by historians like Frederick Jackson Turner, a new generation of faux ranchers, urban cowboys and high-country artists are getting rich helping to develop a new economy out of the enduring icons of the old West.
In the high plateaus and remote valleys of the West, where once only the most leathery-faced homesteader or stubborn sheepherder would try to hold on, new communities of urban exiles who live by fax machines or as tour operators have sprung up. They make their living not from tearing apart the scenery or wrestling with the elements, but from selling an image that Americans refuse to let go of.
"We're losing our heritage in this country, the old image of the pioneer, but people are desperate to hold onto it, so they come to me," said Arnold (Smoke) Elfer, who runs a horse- and mule-packing outfit in Missoula, Mont. For $160 a day a visitor can sleep on a bedroll in the Bob Marshall
Wilderness and smell real horse manure as a guest of Smoke and his boys.
"I think the average, fast-paced American really wants to settle down and live at 3 miles an hour, which is exactly the average speed of a horse," said Mr. Elfer. Business for horse-pack outfitters and ranchers who arrange for city slickers to go on cattle drives has never been better.
And it is not just in Montana. In 1902, Owen Wister, a well-bred Easterner, drew on the Methow Valley, a meander of aspens and larch trees on the east slope of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State, to write "The Virginian," the first Western novel.
Ninety years later, the real-life cowboys, ranchers and desperadoes of the Methow Valley are long gone, as are most of its loggers and miners. But the area has been able to stay out of the register of ghost towns by putting on late 19th-century Western costume to become economically revitalized. The town of Winthrop, where Wister stayed, has gone Western, complete with swinging saloon doors, wood-planked sidewalks and easy-living dude ranches. Booking a room in Winthrop in mid-summer is harder than squeezing gold dust from a boulder.
In southern Arizona, near Tucson, the high peaks of the Santa Catalina mountains hide natural and historic secrets as authentic as sunsets in the Monument Valley. But far more visitors prefer the man-made charms of Old Tucson, a fake Western town that was constructed in 1940 as a set for the film "Arizona." A sort of Western Disneyland, Old Tucson features staged gunfights and frontier train rides. Old Tucson may represent the apex of myth-making, American West style: from its humble beginnings as a movie set constructed to look like Hollywood's stereotype of the West, it now passes for a bona fide imitation of the real thing.
For those who still consider themselves real cowboys or ranchers, the transition's ultimate threat is that there will be no place for them. They fear they will become props.
Montana, the rangeland destination for all those 19th-century Texas longhorn drives, has about 14,000 cattle ranchers, down from 17,000 10 years ago. Between soul-numbing winters and finicky consumers, raising red meat on the open range is harder than ever.
"Ranching is not an easy life -- never has been," said Allen Nelson, a fourth-generation rancher who lives just south of Livingston, Mont., in the Paradise Valley. "Now you got all these people coming into the state who don't understand what it's all about."
Mr. Nelson has opted to sell part of his ranch as a conservation easement -- he is paid to let elk roam free -- rather than sell to realtors who would carve out ranchettes.
Ironically, few people who buy ranchettes end up living on them. People may say they move to the West for elbow room, but when they get here they prefer to live in cities. Nearly 80 percent of all people in the Rocky Mountain West now live in urban areas -- a higher percentage than on the East Coast, except for the mid-Atlantic states.
 
The Lure of 'City Slickers'
 Virtually all the job growth in the West over the last decade has come from areas outside of ranching, mining and logging. In the three-state area around Yellowstone National Park, 96 percent of the nearly 70,000 new jobs were tied to tourism, recreation, light manufacturing and services. Tourism and recreation have boomed, growing by up to 10 percent a year in many areas.
When "City Slickers," the movie about three men who go on a cattle drive as an antidote to their frayed lives in the city, came out last year, it became a huge draw for the theme economy. Now, as "City Slickers" goes on sale in video stores in Europe, the Montana state tourism bureau is running an advertisment with the video on how Europeans can visit the Big Sky state and play cowboy. The initial response has been overwhelming, state officials said, notably from the English.
The West's original inhabitants, the Indians, have largely missed out on the theme economy bonanza. Some tribes in the Southwest do report a surge in jewelry sales, and Blackfoot and Salish Indians in Montana have added more "trading posts." In a nod to political correctness, staged Indian gunfights with white settlers are seldom a staple of Old West Days. Instead, the white gunslingers shoot each other, a la Clint Eastwood and the unshaven bad guys.
About 6 million people visited Montana last year, a record. Many of them came for the chance to do what Westerners have long done -- drink thick coffee under the stars, swat carnivorous deerflies, and experience the many moods of a horse in the summer heat.
The West has always had a strong hold on people because of its landscape. But now, at some of the West's best-known scenic areas, plans are afoot to promote the scenery to visitors who may never actually have to see it.
At the entrance to Zion National Park in southern Utah, a California company is ready to start construction of a vast indoor theater, hotel complex and parking lot. Without ever entering the national park, visitors will be able to simulate the park experience by watching film of the salmon-colored canyon country on a huge IMAX movie screen. The company, World Odyssey, is studying a plan for a similiar operation near Yellowstone, America's first national park.
Perhaps the ultimate extension of the Western myth is the proposal by two Rutgers University professors, Frank and Deborah Popper, who advocate creating a Buffalo Commons, a vast open space in the high prairie east of the Continental Divide where bison herds would roam. The area is losing population, and its economy has continued to slide, the Poppers argue. Why not return the bison to the land, as Ted Turner, the broadcasting executive, has done to his 130,000-acre ranch south of Bozeman?
To many ranchers, the Buffalo Commons idea is absurd, a sort of gigantic zoo. They feel they would be reduced to observers on the land they have known intimately all their lives. As William Kittredge, one of the most eloquent of Western writers wrote in a recent essay, "This is nightmare talk to longtime inhabitants of the shortgrass plains."

HEADLINE: TRIPLE THREAT;
In 3-Way Races The Old Rules Can Trip You

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER a month of high panic and strange omens as the two major parties struggled to adjust to Ross Perot and a three-way race for the Presidency, a few rough lessons are clear.
First and foremost, Mr. Perot's rivals learned that the Dallas billionaire would bleed just like any other pol. In May and early June, his surge in the polls had crossed most of the lines of ideology, demographics, party and region, a strange new phenomenon from talk-show land that seemed immune to the normal rules of politics. After a month in the arena, however, getting frisked by the news media and worked over by Republican surrogates for President Bush, Mr. Perot looked much more vulnerable to both parties. 
 Second, all sides got a lesson in how attack politics can have unintended consequences in a three-way race. The Bush forces went after Mr. Perot last month, making a strategic decision to try to cap his movement early on. And two polls released last week showed that Mr. Perot was indeed acquiring an increasingly negative image in the minds of many voters. But the candidate who was gaining was not Mr. Bush, but Gov. Bill Clinton, who carefully stayed outside the fight and concentrated on rebuilding his own image.
Veterans of three-way statewide primaries already knew this lesson: Supporters peeled away from one candidate do not automatically go to his attacker. Democrats say this dynamic is particularly problematic for Mr. Bush. "He was able to beat Michael Dukakis by constantly battering him into the ground, and since voters had no place else to go, he survived and won without a mandate," said Stan Greenberg, a pollster for Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton's allies say that strategy is harder in a three-way race, where voters always have someplace else to go.
In a race this long and this intense, Mr. Bush could also pay a cumulative price for being chronically on the attack; voters, after all, have repeatedly shown their distaste for politics and politicians this year. At the moment, that appears to be a risk the Republicans are willing to take, although they are trying to insulate the President himself from the attacking being done on his behalf.
This leads to a third major development in June: The President's continued malaise. After a month when the Bush forces tried negative politics and positive appeals, took their own forays into the new talk-show campaign, and pulled off a successful summit with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia -- tried, in other words, just about everything -- Mr. Bush remained stuck, frustrated, unable to connect. Polls showed the President with about a third of the voters in a closely packed race, an embarrassing place for an incumbent President to be.
"What we're still grappling with is the means with which to portray positively President Bush's substantial accomplishments so they are greater appreciated by the American people," said Rich Bond, chairman of the Republican National Committee. "We've figured out how to move the other guys. We just haven't figured out how to move ourselves."
The President's dilemma was only deepened by the week's economic news. The unemployment rate reached 7.8 percent, an eight-year high, just as the Republicans were trying to make their case against Mr. Clinton's new economic package.
Some Republican strategists say they fully expect Mr. Clinton to emerge from this month's Democratic National Convention, which begins July 13, as the clear front-runner in the polls. "He's going to consolidate his base and surge and be in first place for a while around his convention," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign. "But then he's going to have a hell of a challenge to keep it."
In fact, one of the cautionary notes of the last month is how quickly the poll numbers can change in this strange and quirky race. Some experts argue that the Perot support
was always exaggerated in the polls, a reflection of a brutish primary season that left many voters discontented, and thus easily swayed by the first wave of news coverage of Mr. Perot, which was largely positive. "He was being propped up mainly by media enthusiasm, in my opinion," said Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. "I think there will come a point where this will become a two-party race again, the way one would normally expect."
Not everyone shares that view. But people engaged in this campaign do expect some wild swings over the coming months, with one of the candidates ending up "cratering," as Mr. Bond puts it. Mr. Greenberg, the Clinton pollster, argues that voters are doing a lot of "parking" at this stage of the race: aligning, for the moment, with candidates to whom they feel only faint allegiance.
For the three candidates, this makes for a white-knuckle election that puts a premium on discipline and the ability, on occasion, to simply ignore the polls. Mr. Clinton, for example, spent most of the last month as a distant third in the polls, and was under substantial pressure from numerous savants to mix it up with Mr. Perot. He did not, deciding that the way to re-introduce himself to the American public after a savage primary season was not as the attacker of Ross Perot.
Instead, Mr. Clinton made the pilgrimage from one television program to another, trying to present himself as a bright young man with a plan and a set of deeply held beliefs about the course of the country. (As opposed to the deeply political, ambitious image he acquired in the primaries, when he was fending off allegations of infidelity and avoiding the draft while slashing his way through the opposition.)
This points to another trend peculiar to 1992: the remarkable role of untraditional television venues, from "Larry King Live" to the "Today" show. Ross Perot demonstrated its power early on, Mr. Clinton took to the circuit with gusto, and even Mr. Bush finally brought the cameras into the Rose Garden last week. How long will it last? "If these appearances keep delivering money to the networks and voters to us, they're going to have us there and we're going to be there," said James Carville, a strategist for Mr. Clinton.
Perhaps the traditional politics will reassert itself. The two-party structure may be so embedded that Mr. Perot is destined to fade, come fall. The candidates may pull back from the television lights and the happily inquisitive voters, each playing Phil for a day, and revert to a tarmac-to-tarmac, event-to-event campaign, with the questioners safely back beyond a rope line. For now, though, this race looks very different and very new: three men feeling their way through a wild year.
Mr. Clinton, glib and trying not to be, crammed with policy positions and proud of it, but keenly aware in his head that his campaign needs to come from his heart. Mr. Perot, discovering that even a billionaire from Dallas riding a grassroots uprising in an angry year can get roughed up by the Beltway crowd. And Mr. Bush, who looks almost haunted these days, with the anger of any incumbent who sees two-thirds of his constituents turning away.

HEADLINE: 50 Different Economies;
Workers Who Follow the Jobs Are the Keys to Economic Health

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
IT'S morning in the Midwest and middle South, where the numbers crunchers at the Federal Reserve recently identified satisfying upticks in industrial production. But the rays have yet to penetrate the recessionary gloom in New England and New York City. And the night is still a pup in southern California, where cutbacks in defense are just beginning to hit home.
Who changed the rules? What has happened to transform one economy indivisible into a regional free-for-all? 
 Nothing at all, argue scholars who have rediscovered the field of regional economics; it has always been thus. "Think of America as 50 small, open economies with a single currency," suggested Prof. Lawrence Katz of Harvard -- economies that rise and fall with the fortunes of regional industries.
What apparently has changed is the perception that Americans are all passengers on the same economic boat. And that change has given analysts an excuse to take a fresh look at the way economic regions interact -- and, in particular, at the remarkable degree to which this country has come to depend on the movement of workers, rather than on jobs or wages, to right regional imbalances.
The reexamination seems particularly timely. For if the Maastricht Treaty is ratified, the European Community will be transformed from a loose confederation into an American-style economic system, one that will hem in the ways regions can adjust to lean times.
In the postwar decades the lion's share of new American business and jobs has gone to the Sunbelt. But layered on top of this trend are sharp fluctuations in the fortunes of regions tied to major industries. Happily, adjustment has generally been rapid.
In an analysis to be published by the Brookings Institution, Mr. Katz and Olivier Blanchard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conclude that unemployment in individual states has rarely exceeded the national average for long. And no region seems to have been favored: the average jobless rate in the high-growth Sunbelt was neither better nor worse than in low-growth states. Contrast that with England, say, where the Thatcher-era boom seems to have permanently widened the unemployment gap between the prosperous south and the chronically depressed north.
 
Educated Guessing
 But the means of adjustment may matter almost as much as the speed. And in the end, there are only two possible routes. Excess economic capacity can drive down business costs, attracting new companies and making the products of established ones more competitive. Or, unemployment can fall as workers migrate.
In practice, costs rarely decline much and few businesses expand to fill the job vacuum. The burden is thus borne by workers, who must move to where the jobs are.
Economists offer some educated guesses on why the adjustment is so skewed toward the movement of people. Daniel Hamermesh of Michigan State University notes that unemployed American workers do not have the luxury of waiting for something to turn up: jobless benefits are pitiful by northern European standards.
And although there is plenty to push the unemployed to move, there isn't much to pull employers from healthy regions to those in trauma. Wages don't respond quickly to a fall in demand, perhaps because the majority who remain employed resist pressure to make do with less. Or perhaps, as research by Robert Barro of Harvard and Xavier Sala-i-Martin of Yale suggests, because wages by occupation are increasingly tied to national pay scales rather than local market conditions.
Mr. Katz notes, moreover, that regional economic distress can actually raise the cost of doing business. Certainly recession-battered cities and states go out of their way to keep employers happy, providing tax breaks and custom-tailored infrastructure improvements. But they must compete in a national market at precisely the time when they can least afford to erode their tax bases. And one way or another, places like Detroit must pare publicly provided amenities or collect sufficient revenue to cover the escalating social overhead.
How one views this dependence on the movement of workers depends on how one see the alternatives. Labor mobility has been celebrated as a uniquely American strength in a world of rapid change. Indeed, the periods in American history with the fastest growth have been periods of pell-mell interregional migration.
 
Social Costs
 There are, however, social costs to the survival-of-the-fittest tilt toward regional adjustment. Other things equal, it is safe to say that Americans would like the assurance of stable incomes, tax rates and Government services. But Mr. Sala-i-Martin and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard estimate that the Federal Government absorbs only 40 cents of every dollar in income lost to regional economic fluctuation, leaving 60 percent of the adjustment burden to be carried locally. Also, the loss to families separated from friends and community may far exceed the dollar loss in income.
In Mr. Katz's view, these "externalities" justify greater Government intervention, perhaps through increased Federal support of local governments. Rebecca Blank of Northwestern University would go a step further, shifting some of financial burden to companies that close plants.
In any event, economists argue, it might well be possible to maintain high levels of labor mobility while still reducing the imperative to move. "Americans think it is up to the individual to find a job," pointed out Janet Norwood, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics who is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington research group. As a result there is no Government-supported national labor exchange, no allowance to cover the cost of moving and precious little help in retraining.
These ideas are not likely to strike an election-year chord. Among the candidates, only Bill Clinton seems inclined to favor policies that reduce the adjustment burden on individual workers. But he is also eager to distance himself from anything that smacks of traditional liberalism. And as Mr. Hamermesh notes, virtually all the pressure for adjustment assistance comes from groups defending entrenched interests -- specific industries or specific union jobs.
But the new regional economics may resonate in Europe where, months after their governments declared their support for a common currency, voters are beginning to contemplate the consequences.
 
Obvious Payoffs
 Today, a European country hit by an economic shock has the option of creating jobs by printing more money or devaluing its currency. But under the deal tentatively struck at Maastricht in December, Italy will have no more power over its money than Florida. Moreover, Floridians are free to move to Arizona in search of jobs; custom and language will severely limit mobility within the European Community.
That, points out Mr. Katz, will put great pressure on the European Community to buffer regional economic shocks with cash. It will also focus attention on the notorious reluctance of businesses to lower prices and for unions to make wage concessions during recessions. And while Europe will no doubt adapt, the restrictions imposed by a common currency will probably lengthen the time it takes regions to recover from downturns.
Economic integration obviously has its payoffs: few economists, after all, think America would be better off as five or 50 independent economies able to print their own greenbacks. But the example of America shows that integration has costs, too -- costs that hardly anyone wishes to recognize.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The New Era Still Demands Bold Strokes Of Leadership

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
SO the end of the cold war was not the end of history, after all. The multinational organizations that were supposed to take over from the superpowers to run a more peaceful, stable world have been faltering under the economic, political and ethnic problems that arose after the collapse of Communism.
President Bush and the other world leaders at the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Munich and the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit in Helsinki this week have a full agenda. But what they really need to do is to demonstrate clear leadership, which is still something best provided by leaders of powerful nation-states. 
 The lesson of the Persian Gulf war a year ago, and of the current war in what used to be Yugoslavia, is that it takes a bold course of action by a powerful, confident national leader to forge an effective international coalition against a renegade state like Iraq or Serbia.
In the Persian Gulf it was President Bush, acting under the aegis of the United Nations, who took the initiative, and other countries that followed. In Yugoslavia, it was once again the threat of American action to show up European ineffectiveness that prompted President Francois Mitterrand of France to take a bold step himself, in a courageous solo mission to Sarajevo that showed his fellow Europeans, and the rest of the world, that talk and inaction do not constitute the only possible response to the crisis in the Balkans.
By flying into the Sarajevo airport and visiting the city while it was under fire, Mr. Mitterrand broke the logjam and spearheaded the delivery of humanitarian aid to the city's besieged population. By his courage, he cowed, at least for the moment, the Serbian militia leaders who had bullied Sarajevo's citizens for weeks and he emboldened the United Nations Security Council into sending in peacekeepers to keep the airport open.
Mr. Mitterrand, like Mr. Bush, is a politician fighting for his political life, and part of his motivation was resentment at months of carping by the United States at the inability of European leaders to stop the disastrous civil war on their eastern doorstep. If Mr. Mitterrand wanted to get France out ahead of the United States at the United Nations Security Council, he succeeded. At the time, it was Mr. Bush who was sounding equivocal about whether the lives of American airmen or sailors could be used to protect the United Nations peacekeepers.
Rival nations have always found ways to resolve their rivalries -- either violently, through war, or peacefully, through cooperation or deterrence. Deterrence prevented nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union for nearly 40 years. But it vanished with the old order. The challenge before the leaders of the industrialized democracies is how to help build a new structure of security that can help prevent disasters like the one in the Balkans.
A year ago, there was hope that this could emerge from American-Soviet cooperation, but the Soviet Union is gone, too. President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia will be welcomed by the participants in the Munich summit, but not, yet, as one of them, ready to play a role in a new Concert of Europe. His main purpose will be to plead for more money to prop up his staggering economy and help him continue with change that will stave off even worse ethnic conflicts there in the future.
Mr. Mitterrand reminded the world that international organizations can be galvanized into effective action against renegade states only by strong leadership from individual member nation-states. The fire of nationalism, to some extent, has to be fought with fire, not with the watered-down collective will that emerges from international consensus. The great powers of Europe knew this when Sarajevo last flashed into the news, nearly 80 years ago, but they were at odds with each other then and used the Balkans as surrogates of their rivalry, leading to the disaster of World War I. Today, two years after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, local ethnic and national rivalries are once again flourishing in a leadership vacuum.
The small United Nations peacekeeping force in Sarajevo has only the mission of opening the airport to an airlift of humanitarian aid, food and medicines to relieve the city's beleaguered, mainly Muslim Bosnian population of its torment at the hands of the Serbs. The war itself goes on, and neither Europe nor the United States has yet found an effective way of stopping it.
 
Mitterrand's Choice
 The 12-nation European Community wrangled long and hard in Lisbon at the end of last month before finally timidly agreeing that it would "not exclude" support for the use of military means by the United Nations to achieve humanitarian objectives in Sarajevo.
Mr. Mitterrand, backing Italy, had argued for "bold action" by the community's member states, but they were divided. Germany wanted to do something but pleaded that its own troops could not take part, given what the Nazis had done to the Balkans in World War II. Britain wanted to help, but it did not want to get stuck in another endless local conflict like Cyprus, or Northern Ireland. This is the trouble with "Europe" as a foreign policy maker: The member nations do not see all international problems the same way.
Until the treaty on European union that was signed in Maastricht, the Netherlands, last December is ratified and put into effect, Mr. Mitterrand concluded, the Europeans could not act in concert. But nothing would be done about the fighting in Yugoslavia unless some country took bold action unilaterally, and Mr. Mitterrand did not want that country to be the United States.
 
A Role for NATO?
 What will happen to European union, and to the Maastricht treaty, is unclear since Danish voters rejected it in a referendum last month. But even if all 12 states do eventually ratify it, "Europe," unless it becomes something more than a loose confederation of sovereign states, will never have the political and military clout that some of its members have individually -- France and Britain, for example, as permanent members of the Security Council.
The NATO alliance, searching for a new role after the collapse of its Warsaw Pact adversaries, has also been struggling to find a fitting way of bringing its power to bear in the Balkans, and agreed in Oslo early in June to the principle that it could carry out peacekeeping missions assigned by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Conflicts there are aplenty, not only in the Balkans but in Moldova, in Georgia and between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But getting a consensus in a group of 52 people, let alone nations, is often elusive. Mr. Bush and most of his colleagues from Munich will travel to Helsinki later this week to try to lead this organization to its next phase, but whether it is really an effective means of keeping stability and order in the new Europe remains to be seen.
Bold leadership has to come from confident leaders, and neither Mr. Bush, Mr. Mitterrand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan nor any of the other leaders of the major democracies, which are in the grip of recession and domestic political discontent, can be said to be supremely confident these days -- not even Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who won a national election in April, but with only a 21-seat majority. If Munich produces broad visions and brave actions, it will be a welcome surprise.

HEADLINE: On Welfare in Sumer;
No Society Rejoices At Helping Its Poor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IF some members of the Bush Administration had been around 4,000 years ago, they might have denounced Sumer in Mesopotamia as the epitome of the welfare city-state. Work was a duty, but social security was an entitlement. It was personified by the Goddess Nanshe, the first real welfare queen immortalized in hymn as a benefactor who "brings the refugee to her lap, finds shelter for the weak."
Later, the New Testament presciently declared: "The poor always ye have with you." But during periodic introspections, society has been ambivalent about the causes of poverty and the possible cures and about who is responsible for both. That historic vacillation between its role as protector or punisher reverberates with remarkable consistency in 1992 politics. 
 Individual states, resources sapped by the recession and resolve weakened by well-intentioned but largely unsuccessful prescriptions, are cutting basic welfare grants. New Jersey is denying additional benefits to mothers on welfare if they have more children. The Supreme Court recently upheld a ban on begging at New York-area airports. Wisconsin's highest court just upheld a 60-day residency requirement for welfare applicants. And the Bush Administration singled out New York as emblematic of the failed welfare state and then adjudged the Los Angeles riots the "grim harvest" of Great Society programs and the ethos that welfare was an entitlement without responsibility.
 
Giving Charity Selectively
 Richard P. Nathan, a social historian at the State University of New York at Albany, says the United States has not altogether relegated its poor to Dickensian damnation. "The idea of poverty in America is a far cry from what it would have been a hundred years ago or what it is in other countries," said Mr. Nathan. "We ratchet up our ideas about what poverty standards should be and, in an ironic way, that reflects progress."
But the debate over whether public support for the poor is too much or too little has not advanced much. Relatively enlightened societies provided for the poor selectively. Charity, as a biblical precept, was left to individuals or to the abundant resources of organized religion. Four hundred years ago, Elizabethan poor laws transformed social welfare into secular obligation. The laws entitled the poor to assistance from taxation and distinguished the helpless from those who chose to help themselves to other people's money.
But the laws also imposed demands on the poor so that welfare would not be dispensed indiscriminately. Vagrancy, like begging, was circumscribed to contain the growth of criminal gangs. (To discourage panhandling, the city of Lyon created an authority in 1534 to serve as a funnel for all public philanthropy.) In the 17th century, English localities evicted people who had migrated to take advantage of more generous benefits.
The American view of poverty was founded on a profoundly different premise than the European view: as a detour in the nation's manifest destiny rather than as an inevitable consequence of a divine hand that doomed some people to deprivation.
Still, even Benjamin Franklin maintained that the way of doing good to the poor "is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it."
American welfare reform began about a century ago. The settlement-house model, which is just being rediscovered, was widely copied to cope with immigration. Jacob Riis and his contemporaries, who crusaded against the slums, envisioned Government's role as that of a regulator -- leaving the execution to philanthropy and the profit motive. By appealing to conscience and self-interest, they surmounted Social Darwinism and Malthusian fears of welfare -- that era's version of benign neglect. Helping the poor also meant protecting public health, curbing criminality and insuring social stability. Any hopes that poverty had been eradicated were dashed by the Depression, which spawned a Government-sponsored welfare state: New Deal job programs and aid for widows and the elderly.
In the 1970's, Michael Harrington awakened society to "The Other America." Welfare-rights groups, eschewing the intrusiveness of social workers, insisted that relief was an inalienable right. Even the lexicon was revised: the poor became the underprivileged; welfare, public assistance.
But in the 1980's, as the homeless population grew and poverty became more visible, welfare became seen by some as a palliative at best. Some advocates for the poor responded by pursuing a single-minded agenda: housing, without the vital social services that many of the homeless required. The White House response to the Los Angeles riots this year has been similarly one-dimensional, focusing, in part, on jobs for people, many of whom are unprepared to keep them.
"We have a welfare system that nobody likes," said Michael B. Katz, a University of Pennsylvania history professor who has written extensively about the system. "And we have the conjunction of stale rhetoric with an unprecedented situation in American cities."
Poverty among blacks has been typically taken for granted. But the growth of a dependent class of teen-age mothers defies precedent and solution. During the recession, it has also defied the public's indulgence. The concern is less about money -- which the public is more accustomed to spending on the dole than on day care and job training -- than about the burden of an "undeserving" underclass and the plight of the deserving, if seemingly permanent, poor.
"We are loath to punish severely for fear of doing injustice," an ambivalent official of New York's private welfare organizations said 85 years ago, "but we hesitate to offer much aid, for fear of being duped."
Today, progress isn't likely unless the public agenda melds morality and self-interest. In renegotiating the social contract, Government's obligation is to find the middle ground that has eluded society since Nanshe, the Mesopotamian goddess, was hailed by some bards of Sumer for her compassion and, undoubtedly, denounced by others as a dupe.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Majesty Sails the Hudson With Tall Ships

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Majestic in a gray morning mist, the world's largest gathering of tall ships in this century sailed out of the past and up the great amphitheater of New York Harbor yesterday in a stately salute to Independence Day and the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage of discovery to the New World.
Canvas set, pennants fluttering, a breeze singing in the rigging, the 11-mile procession of 34 windjammers and other craft -- 270 ships from 37 nations -- moved across the whitecap-flecked harbor and up the Hudson in an awesome and graceful five-hour parade, reviewed by a flotilla of smaller boats, one million people on shore and a national television audience. 
 It was a sight to behold: barks and barkentines, brigs, full-rigged ships and schooners from yesteryear, sailors lining rails and yardarms like rows of magpies, steepled shrouds straining at mastheads, gaff-rigged spankers and jibs set, rakish bowsprits and dolphin-strikers churning froths of wind and wave, a ballet whose beauty seemed all the greater in the leaden fog.
 
'Big and Beautiful and Quiet'
 "Watching these ships takesG d Vanderbilt Jr., a great-great-great grandson of Commodox@ilt and one of the organizers of Operation Sail, 1992. "They're big and beautiful and quiet. They come from another age, and it's like magic to see them again."
It began as a drizzly, fog-banked Fourth of July in the metropolitan area, with temperatures in the 60's and low clouds that wrapped the ships in mystery and caught the day's soft celebratory mood. On the rim of the harbor, sea mists drifted up like a flower's fragrance and spectators in summer whites, stippled like figures in a Seurat, strained to make out the regatta.
But later in the day, the fog lifted, temperatures rose into the 70's and the sun peeked through oyster clouds upon a wondrous tableau -- tall ships in the distance; fireboats shooting plumes of red, white and blue water; tugboats hooting, and crowds watching from reviewing stands on Governor's Island and from rooftops, piers, windows, decks and shoreline parks.
 
In Streets and Parks
A Day to Play, A Day to Protest
 Away from the nautical maneuvers, people across the New York region and the nation marked the holiday with concerts, street festivals, picnics and quiet family gatherings, with outings to beaches, ballgames and more serene retreats. There was an old-fashioned parade of marching bands and veterans groups in River Edge, N.J., and thousands jammed the Connecticut River front in Hartford for a music festival.
Hundreds of New Yorkers, many of them immigrants, flocked to Bear Mountain State Park for a picnic that reflected the nation's diversity and a bit of its good life for hardworking people. But in some of the poorer neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the mood was downcast, the holiday all but forgotten and the American dream seemed elusive.
In Battery Park City in lower Manhattan, the police arrested 17 demonstrators on charges of disorderly conduct. They were protesting the celebration of Columbus and calling for Puerto Rican independence from the United States.
For many Americans, it was just a day to stroll in a park or down a road, far from the maddening crowds, or to relax with a good book, perhaps to reread the Gettysburg Address or reflect on the day's meanings.
The nation this Independence Day was besieged with problems: a sagging economy, grinding unemployment and poverty, racial strife, conflicts over abortion and profound concerns over crime, educational failures, soaring health costs and dismal choices in a Presidential election year.
But it was also a nation at peace, with the apocalyptic threat of nuclear war receding and promising new ties to old foes in the works, and there remained a strong underpinning of faith in a diverse, democratic people who had somehow weathered wars, depression and other crises and would do so again, if need be.
The venerable tall ships seemed to capture that spirit. They evoked a sense of America's immigrant experience, of commerce and the dangers of life at sea, of skills and ideas in a new land. And in their rugged seaworthiness, they offered something quietly authentic in a world crowded with noisy artifice.
In the gloomy overcast, the turnout for OpSail '92 was a disappointment for organizers, who had gathered three-quarters of the world's tall ships for the day and had hoped for up to eight million spectators for their five-day extravaganza of events, four million for the sail parade. The drizzly weather also kept crowds low at beaches on the Jersey Shore and on Long Island.
But late in the day, the clouds gave way to patches of blue. And as the last light retreated, the night sky over the Hudson exploded in a 30-minute blaze of fireworks. Rising on rockets from barges off Lower Manhattan, 11,000 pyrotechnic shells created a barrage of color -- swizzles, whorls, bursts of cascading red, white, blue, gold and silver -- that echoed and flashed off skyscraper facades, overpowered the lights of New York and dazzled crowds of spectators.
After the fireworks, waves of people poured out of Battery Park and other riverside vantage points, clogging streets and subways. Their exit, though orderly, was punctuated by loud and steady explosions from firecrackers and more powerful explosives.
But the parade of sail was at the heart of the lavish day. Nearly 18 months in the planning, its $10 million cost borne by the city, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and corporate sponsors, OpSail '92 was staged by the group that brought tall ships to New York for the World's Fair in 1964, the nation's Bicentennial in 1976 and the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986.
Weighing anchor off Sandy Hook, N.J., the tall ships, led by America's 295-foot, three-masted bark, Eagle -- built in Hamburg in 1936 and acquired by the United States as a war reparation -- glided under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge shortly after 9 A.M. The winds were insufficient to drive the ships, which purred ahead on engine power, but sails were set for show and occasionally they puffed out in 10-to-15-mile-an-hour gusts.
"Oh, that's beautiful," exclaimed Marie Brzezinsky, gazing at a Spanish ship through binoculars from the esplanade at Battery Park City. "It's right there now. Wow! It looks gorgeous!"
 
At Governor's Island
 Symbols of Hope And Persecution
 At Governor's Island, replicas of Columbus's caravels -- Santa Maria, Nina and Pinta -- rode at anchor, and 3,000 invited guests watched from reviewing stands as Mayor David N. Dinkins spoke of those who had come to America in ships, some to escape persecution, some in the holds of slavers, some seeking new opportunity.
Flanked by smaller escort ships and followed by a host of ketches, yawls, sloops and other vessels, the tall ships crossed a harbor sprinkled with small spectator craft. The Coast Guard had estimated that up to 40,000 craft would be on hand, but only a few thousand boats bobbed in the 2- to 4-foot swells, and it was clear that many fair-weather sailors had stayed home.
They were missing something, for there was a subtle beauty in the rough day: its frail light lay on the harbor like polished metal, the astonishingly human cry of seagulls carried great distances, and the panorama of ships, the golden torch of the Statue of Liberty against the fog, was like poetry.
As dawn broke over Sandy Hook yesterday -- that is, as the sky turned a paler shade of gray -- Marcel Gubala, 22, looked into the light drizzle and saw that it would be useless to swab the immense, gently rolling decks of the Polish square-rigger Dar Mlodziezy (pronounced dahr M'LUHD-shee).
"It's very nice work, as you see," he said, leaning on a long-handled scrub brush and surveying the fleet of tall ships anchored in the slate-gray sea, bows into the breeze. "Sometimes you can brush," he added, slapping at the pine deck.
Below, in the aft cabin, Richard D. Seeth, a 43-year-old harbor pilot from Yardville, N.J., was grouching about weather forecasters. "They said, 'Oh, there'll be a break in the weather,' " he grumped, peering through a porthole at the great gray continuum. "There's not going to be any break."
In a manual provided by OpSail organizers, he found a new target for his ire. "See, this was done by someone sitting at a desk," he said. "The first thing I can tell you is, forget the time schedule. These are sailing vessels." But he was wrong.
Promptly at 7:30 A.M., the Eagle weighed anchor and, riding an incoming tide and a following breeze, assumed her spot as the lead ship. One by one, the tall ships fell into line behind her. By 8:50, when the Dar Mlodziezy raised anchor, the Eagle had long since faded into the thickening fog.
The Dar Mlodziezy's crew of 180 cadets from the Polish Merchant Marine Academy in Gdynia had been at sea for three months and faced the prospect of liberty in New York with a mixture of fear and excitement. "It is true the city is very dangerous for us -- everybody told us," said Wojtake Hajdamowicz, 21. But, he added, "It is necessary to meet any women."
Like most of the tall ships, the Dar Mlodziezy has the profile of a salty antique, but her equipment is modern (including a fax machine) and it serves its purpose: teaching cadets about wind, tides and seamanship. Teamwork was on display yesterday as cadets scrambled into the rigging to set sail, then raced over the deck to seat halyards. But moments later, in keeping with the bizarre Rime-of-the-Ancient-Mariner quality of their voyage, they dropped sails again.
"We are in an extremely dangerous situation," said the captain, Tadeusz Olechnowicz. Waving at a wall of gray where Brooklyn was supposed to be, he said sails were "for fun, for decoration -- but there are no viewers."
Abruptly, there was another reversal: The ship passed under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and emerged from the fog. There lay the distant, vibrant city. Up went the sails, cadets gathered at the rails to gaze at Manhattan's towers and the ship moved into the harbor like a ghost out of the mist.
 
At Bear Mountain
After the Rain, A Go at the Trout
 Undeterred by light rain, a shroud of fog and soggy playing fields and picnic grounds, thousands of holiday celebrants descended on Bear Mountain State Park. The crowds were thin because of the weather, but by afternoon the barbecues were sizzling, radios were blaring and grocery bags full of chicken, hot dogs, chips and beer were being unloaded for a day of feasting.
Eddie Ramos, who immigrated with his family from El Salvador seven years ago, was among 300 people bused from Jamaica, Queens, and Hempstead, L.I., by the New York-based El Salvador Human Rights Commission. "We'd planned this for months, so I'm here to have a good time," he said. "But I really want to celebrate the 500 years since Columbus came, and I want to see the ships in New York tomorrow."
More affluent New Yorkers relaxed in the Hamptons or Berkshires, but Bear Mountain has been a popular day-trip destination for those of more modest means since the park was established in 1908 by a gift to the state of 10,000 acres from the Harriman family. In recent years, it has become an upstate version of a city park, a mecca for Hispanic and black families, many of them immigrants, seeking a patch of lawn to enjoy seemingly bottomless food coolers.
Picnicking was the No. 1 priority for most, but some also hiked on the Appalachian Trail, fished for trout on Hessian Lake or the Hudson River, rented paddleboats or swam in the park's oversized pool. At the stone-and-wood Bear Mountain Inn, all 60 rooms were booked and the souvenir shop did a brisk business in patriotic paraphernalia.
 
On Franklin Avenue
'There's No Work And No Money'

From Empire Street to Park Place along Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn, only one symbol of Independence Day was evident yesterday: an American flag, edges stained with coffee, hung in the window of Franklin Laundry Center. There was none of the jubilation that usually surrounds the Fourth of July along the commercial thoroughfare that runs through the ethnically diverse neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Flatbush.
"It's not like before when things were going smoothly," said Jint John, a 34-year-old laundry worker. "Everyone used to have a good time on the Fourth. A lot of the problem is financial. There's less of everything."
Robert Paris, 31, working at Los Amigos Grocery in Crown Heights, agreed that the area's economic depression had a dampening effect. "We really don't have the enthusiasm like we used to," he said. "Normally, there's more parties, barbecues and music. It just doesn't have that feeling any more."
Morale was even lower for Haitians in the community, with their lovely, terrifying homeland in turmoil. One symbol of patriotism in the office of Wilson Desir, a prominent local Haitian emigre, was not colored in red, white and blue, but in black and white -- a poster of the deposed Haitian president, Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
"No one feels the Fourth means anything," said Urbain Richard, a 24-year-old student at Brooklyn College. "It's just a holiday to stay in bed and relax. The Independence Day for Haitians is yet to come."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Perot Told U.S. To Soften Policy On Vietnamese

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
As a way to win the repatriation of any American servicemen still held in Southeast Asia, Ross Perot unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Reagan White House to begin limited economic relations with Vietnam and to expand diplomatic contacts.
At the time, Washington was taking a harder diplomatic line with Hanoi to achieve the same end. 
 In a report to Ronald Reagan written April 8, 1987, after Mr. Perot returned from Hanoi, the Texas businessman promoted several ideas, including the establishment of a Vietnamese "economic representative" in the Swiss or Swedish embassy, and a reciprocal American business office in Hanoi, a former Reagan aide said. Mr. Perot also offered to pay for a Vietnamese delegation to the United States to study American industries.
 
'A Small Price to Pay'
 In a list of recommended future actions that accompanied his report, Mr. Perot said he would finance an American tour for Vietnam's primary war hero, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, as part of an overall plan of "good faith" gestures to Hanoi. Mr. Perot said in his letter that the moves would be a "small price to pay" if they led to the release of long-missing American prisoners of war. [Excerpts, Page 14.]
The recommendations were rejected by Mr. Reagan after Administration officials argued that United States policy toward Hanoi should stay on course, requiring Vietnam to meet its pledges to withdraw from Cambodia and clear up issues relating to missing American servicemen from the Vietnam War era before the United States considered diplomatic recognition and lifting the longstanding trade embargo.
 
Fear of Manipulation
 To a number of Reagan Administration officials, Mr. Perot's proposals raised questions about his approach to foreign policy. Members of a committee supervising policy toward Vietnam under the National Security Council criticized the proposals because they granted "concessions without performance," several of them said in recent interviews.
These officials were concerned that Mr. Perot's eagerness to make progress on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue was being manipulated by Hanoi's leaders, who were seeking to use it as leverage to bring an end to their diplomatic and economic isolation.
Commenting today on Mr. Perot's actions then, a senior spokesman in his undeclared campaign for President said in Dallas, "The Administration had no effective game plan" on Americans who were missing or were still held prisoner in Southeast Asia.
He added that "Ross Perot was asked to develop one and he did so and delivered it to the Administration," which he said was too preoccupied with the Iran-contra scandal "to follow through and implement the plan."
The letter from Mr. Perot to Mr. Reagan is the most illuminating document that has emerged so far from Mr. Perot's short-tenured service to the Reagan White House as an unofficial reviewer of the Administration's P.O.W.-M.I.A. policies.
The document shows that Mr. Perot was seeking to place himself in the role of broker of a new economic relationship between the United States and Hanoi as part of his strategy to win the release of Americans he believed were still being held.
"They are interested in direct assistance from the private sector, feeling that the private sector knows more about business than the government," he wrote to Mr. Reagan, adding parenthetically, "I believe this is their primary interest in me." A few paragraphs later, he noted, "The Vietnamese have studied me in detail."
At the same time, Mr. Perot said that he had explained to Vietnam's Vice Premier and Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, "that it would not be possible for our two countries to work together until the P.O.W./M.I.A. problem was resolved."
"He accepts this," Mr. Perot added, "but needs shows of good faith on our part."
Reagan Administration officials observed that Mr. Thach, the most pro-Western member of Hanoi's politburo, appeared to be using his relationship with Mr. Perot and the promise of economic development through such a relationship in an internal power struggle with hardliners. Mr. Thach was forced to retire a year ago.
Richard Childress, a former National Security Council official who was supervising P.O.W.-M.I.A. policy at the time, said in a recent interview that Mr. Perot's actions were "directly undermining" negotiations. His approach "represents naive acceptance of a strategy of responding to the laundry list of well-known Vietnamese objectives as if it would automatically bring cooperation."
Mr. Childress said United States negotiators who went to Hanoi three months later faced hostility from the disappointed Vietnamese.
 
Action Based On Deep Belief
 Mr. Perot's letter to President Reagan reflect's Mr. Perot's blend of sharp criticism of Government competence and his enthusiasm for action and Government activism, if necessary, in support of a good cause.
In sparse and staccato sentences, Mr. Perot punched out his recommendations and observations, leaving plenty of white space to accentuate his declarative statements.
Mr. Perot, unlike Government officials, founded his recommendations on a deep conviction that Americans had been left in Southeast Asia.
"We knew we were leaving men behind," he asserted. In Laos, he said "there are 343 M.I.A.s."
Reagan Administration officials said Mr. Perot's assertions did not take into account the fact that at the end of the war some of those prisoners were transferred to Hanoi for repatriation as part of a 1973 prisoner exchange, and most others were under Vietnamese control.
Mr. Perot takes credit in his letter for having insinuated himself into the confidence of Vietnam's leadership with a suggestion that Hanoi would not be held responsible for long-missing P.O.W.s.
"I carefully postured the conversations so that the M.I.A.'s would be found in Laos and returned by the Laotian government," he wrote to Mr. Reagan.
One member of the negotiating team was critical of this strategy. "There he is inventing a strategy," he said, "without consultation with us, which is destructive, because it narrows you to only one option. Asking the Vietnamese to sell out Laos, a neighbor and a friend, is impossible. They are not going to sell a neighboring country down the toilet."
 
In Sharp Contrast To Official Stance

Mr. Perot's proposals, had Mr. Reagan followed them, would have marked an abrupt change in strategy. Washington's view was that Vietnam needed to make the show of "good faith" by cooperating with American efforts to complete a final accounting of Vietnam war dead.
"History has shown that concessions prior to performance is death," said Mr. Childress.
"They'll take and take and take," he added. "We've learned that over 25 years."
Richard Armitage, who was in charge of the Pentagon's P.O.W.-M.I.A. efforts and now serves with ambassador rank as director for aid programs to the former Soviet Union, said, "Had we changed strategy and policy in the face of non-performance of Vietnam, they would have felt that they had, yet again, cracked the resolve of both the Administration and the American public. In effect, they would have been rewarded for non-performance."
Mr. Perot had criticized Mr. Armitage's role at the time and had undertaken an investigation of his private life.
Mr. Childress and Mr. Armitage agreed to comment on the letter only if it was made clear that they did not provide the document and that they believe their criticisms of Mr. Perot's approach were representative of the views of a broad array of policy professionals in the Government.
A copy of Mr. Perot's letter and a memorandum of his discussion with a senior Vietnamese official were provided to The New York Times by an official who is not involved in any of this year's Presidential campaigns, but who believes Mr. Perot should more fully disclose his dealings with Hanoi. In earlier interviews, Mr. Perot has referred to the letter numerous times, but declined to make it public.
"If I release the letter, hell, there's no telling what will be the next step," he said in a June 3 interview.
The course of United States policy, that Mr. Perot sought, particularly the proposal to set up what would have been economic interest sections, was strongly opposed by a special group under National Security Council supervision. The group was pushing to elevate the P.O.W.-M.I.A. question to a higher priority than it had had in the Nixon, Ford and Carter years.
This push followed the defection of a Vietnamese mortician who testified that Hanoi had stored hundreds of sets of remains from American servicemen to use as possible negotiating leverage.
Referring to Mr. Perot's offer to finance a visit to the United States by General Giap, Mr. Childress said, "The fact that you would take an official at that level -- he was still a member of the politburo -- and take him on a tour around the country, is implicit recognition and sends all kinds of signals to Vietnam and the world that we are recognizing them while they are occupying Cambodia and not cooperating on the humanitarian front."
 
Talks Continued In Private Channels
 The New York Times reported last month that Mr. Perot continued his dialogue with Hanoi through private channels after his 1987 visit to Vietnam and after he broke with the White House. In June 1990, Hanoi issued a letter designating Mr. Perot and his company as official business agents to attract Western capital and investment upon the lifting of the international trade embargo.
Mr. Perot said in an interview last month that he never wanted to do business with Vietnam, and only discussed economic matters in a "philosophical" manner in pursuit of his overall goal of winning the release of American servicemen.
"I could do business anywhere in the world," he said on an ABC News program with Peter Jennings last week. "The last place in the world I would want to do business is Vietnam."
When asked on the ABC News program what his associate, Harry McKillop, was doing during a number of private missions to Hanoi between 1987 and 1991, Mr. Perot replied, "He would respond to their request to come back in, listen, and come home, and, I'm sad to report, nothing ever happened."
A senior Vietnamese official who participated in lengthy discussions with Mr. Perot and Mr. McKillop over several years characterized Mr. Perot's goal as one of becoming an intermediary between Hanoi and United States corporations seeking to do business in Vietnam after the lifting of the embargo.
 
Perot's Clashes In Washington
 Mr. Perot secretly visited Vietnam's mission at the United Nations in the winter of 1986-87 without notifying the White House, Reagan aides said, securing an invitation to go to Hanoi, which he then told Reagan officials had appeared "out of the blue."
Arriving in Washington in 1986 as a strong ally of the Reagan White House, Mr. Perot promised a lavish $2.5 million gift to Mr. Reagan's Presidential library fund and promoted himself to head a Presidential commission on P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs. The commission, as he envisioned it, should be armed with subpoena power and an open-ended charter to "get all the way to the bottom" of the emotional national debate.
Within the space of a year, he was bypassed for the job. In the course of his White House-sponsored investigations, he clashed with a wide range of officials in the Pentagon, White House, Central Intelligence Agency and Congress over the management of P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs.
A senior foreign diplomat in Washington said that in a recent conversation with President Bush, Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Perot's anger over not winning appointment as the P.O.W.-M.I.A. policy chief could be a factor in his drive for the White House this year.
Mr. Perot's estrangement from Ronald Reagan, including his withdrawal of the $2.5 million pledge to the Reagan library, and his bitterness toward Mr. Bush, then Vice President, has radiated into the current Presidential campaign.
 
Raised Expectations Back in Hanoi
 At the time of Mr. Perot's proposals for "good faith" gestures to Vietnam, Hanoi's aging rulers wanted to end the trade embargo and restore ties to Washington.
United States negotiators were holding on to their leverage until Hanoi made progress on a step-by-step "roadmap" to improved relations, through cooperation on P.O.W.-M.I.A. investigations.
Referring to his discussions with Mr. Thach, Mr. Perot said, "Thach stressed that we are always asking the Vietnamese to do things for the U.S., and that we are unwilling to do anything for them."
At several points in his report to Mr. Reagan, Mr. Perot emphasized Vietnamese frustrations. "Several times they commented, 'We won the war and yet you do not treat us with respect.' They feel that we are rude and arrogant in our dealings with them."
The official United States negotiating team that traveled to Hanoi three months after Mr. Perot's March 1987 trip encounterd a hostile and deeply disappointed Vietnamese delegation after Mr. Perot had raised expectations, several members said.
The United States group, which included Mr. Childress, representatives from the Pentagon and State Department and Ann Mills Griffiths, the director of the largest organization of P.O.W.-M.I.A. family members, was sent by the White House to prepare the way for the first visit of John W. Vessey Jr., a retired general whom Mr. Reagan chose in January 1987 to be his Presidential emissary to Hanoi for P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs.
The White House had not been willing to announce General Vessey's appointment publicly until Hanoi agreed to an agenda dealing strictly with P.O.W.-M.I.A. issues. But Mr. Perot had prematurely disclosed General Vessey's appointment to the Vietnamese, Reagan aides said.
Mr. Perot said he had been given permission by Howard H. Baker, the White House chief of staff, but Mr. Baker said he did not recall giving it.
By the time the United States negotiating team got to Hanoi, one member said the atmosphere had been seriously muddled.
"When you lined up the things we were offering against the visit by Perot, who was talking about setting up economic-interest sections in both capitals, all that stuff we came up with must have looked penny ante to the Vietnamese," one of the team members said. "That was our worst meeting in four years."
Ms. Griffiths said that given Mr. Perot's actions, "I am not surprised that Vietnam continued to manipulate P.O.W.-M.I.A. responsiveness and hold out for a better deal."

HEADLINE: New Politics of Welfare Focuses on Its Flaws

SERIES: Rethinking Welfare/First of six articles.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
The platform that George S. McGovern carried away from the Democratic convention in 1972 enshrined "The Rights of Poor People" right after "The Rights of Youth" and before "The Rights of American Indians."
It assailed "the coercion of forced work requirements" for welfare recipients. It happily predicted that "the handout system of present welfare" would no longer be necessary once the Democrats embarked on an immense new program to create millions of "decent jobs."
 
Wiser or Meaner?
 The platform that Gov. Bill Clinton will carry to the Democratic National Convention in New York next week reflects a sadder but wiser era -- or, in the view of some of its critics, a poorer and meaner one. It declares that welfare should be "a second chance, not a way of life." It talks of the responsibilities of the poor. It is a snapshot of the new politics of welfare. 
 This is the era of "mutual obligations" and "the new paternalism," of increasing alarm over the persistence of welfare dependency, of new attempts to change the behavior of the poor with carrots and with sticks. "Forced work requirements" have support across the political spectrum these days. Even traditional champions of social welfare programs are now quick to acknowledge their flaws.
Many of the statistics aired in this debate simply stun, and indicate a legacy of poverty that has fallen disproportionately upon blacks. Three decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his "war on poverty," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan cites a study by the University of Michigan that estimated 22 percent of all children born in the late 1960's spent at least a year in a family on welfare by the time they were 18. It estimated that 72 percent of the black children had.
Around the country, there is a growing sense in academic and political circles that the nation needs to rethink a welfare strategy that can reward dependency more than personal initiative. At the same time, working people buffeted by recession are ever more sensitive to the notion of "handouts" to chronic welfare recipients, many analysts say. Adding to this volatile brew is the extraordinary strain on state budgets these days.
 
Bigger Role in Campaign
 As a result, welfare, an issue that is with you always, has taken on a renewed prominence in this election year. Mr. Clinton, seeking to project a new, tough-minded Democratic approach to poverty programs, suggests an automatic two-year limit for many welfare recipients. "I want to erase the stigma of welfare for good by restoring a simple, dignified principle: No one who can work can stay on welfare forever," he declares.
President Bush, whose party has prospered by casting itself as the guardian of the middle-class taxpayer, rails against "deadbeat dads" and vows to "break this cycle of dependency that destroys dignity and passes down poverty from one generation to the next." Out in the states, where the welfare system is largely run, Governors from Tommy G. Thompson in Wisconsin to Jim Florio in New Jersey are pushing proposals that use financial incentives and penalities intended, they say, to encourage work and education among the poor.
California, as befits its image, is considering one of the more sweeping measures: This November, its residents will vote on a ballot initiative (felicitously named the Taxpayer Protection Act) that would, among other things, cut welfare benefits by 10 percent, along with an additional 15 percent for families with "an able-bodied adult" that have been on the rolls for six months. "We consider this an attempt to cut back on dependency," said George Gorton, who is managing the campaign for the initiative, put forward by Governor Pete Wilson.
 
Penalizing the Powerless
 Not everyone sees such tender motives at work. Advocates for the poor argue that much of the talk about encouraging work and personal responsibility is simply political cover for budget cuts, a rough new recessionary politics that penalizes the least powerful: one in seven American children is on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic welfare program. Robert Greenstein, head of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, asserts, "Incomes are stagnant, budgets are tight, and there's a very high degree of frustration right now. When that happens, people on the bottom who are not working are targets for resentments."
Welfare recipients have hardly been living the good life. Over the last 20 years, a time when more popular benefits like Social Security were regularly adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of welfare and food stamp benefits for single mothers declined by an average of 27 percent, according to data from the House Ways and Means Committee.
Levels of generosity vary markedly: as of January, a needy single mother with two children in Texas received combined benefits of only $476 a month, just below Louisiana's but above Alabama's and Mississippi's, the House panel found. Among the better paying states are New York, at $806, and California at $850. In 1991, 31 states froze A.F.D.C. benefits and nine states actually cut them, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Other welfare benefits suffered too: in Michigan, already meager assistance for childless adults was eliminated altogether.
Some advocates for the poor assert that the welfare issue, in some instances, is being used as racial code. Marian Wright Edelman, head of the Children's Defense Fund, declared in a recent speech: "While it is no longer acceptable in most polite circles to race-bait explicitly, bashing welfare has become the next best resort for politicians." She described it as "a fourth generation code phrase, perhaps more powerful than busing, quotas or Willie Horton."
 
Fundamental Unease
 All of these currents are, in fact, swirling through the current debate -- money, resentment, race, the many myths of welfare. "It's the domestic equivalent of Middle East politics, just wrapped in prejudice and attitudes," said Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat who has spent much of his legislative career on the issue.
But the debate also reflects a fundamental unease with the present system, a recognition in both parties that something is wrong with the nation's approach to poverty and that a simple cash assistance program will not put it right. Some politicians and analysts ask whether Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic welfare program begun under the Social Security Act of 1935, has come, in fact, to discourage marriage, support a rising illegitimate birth rate and perpetuate dependence.
Representative Mike Espy, a Democrat whose district encompasses the Mississippi Delta, and who is pushing measures aimed at encouraging savings and small businesses, argues: "Democrats have to get ahead of the curve. Let's admit that the present system does foster dependence, and let's move to a new system that fosters independence." Jim Pinkerton, a leading strategist in the Bush campaign, mentions the recent film about race and poverty in Los Angeles and says, "People have the 'Grand Canyon' feeling that there are tears in the social fabric that are getting worse, not better."
And Senator Moynihan, who has found much of his earlier writings vindicated by the new focus on dependency and the breakdown of families that is most acute among black Americans, says, "Suddenly we're back to our old friend, the urban crisis."
 
Voters Criticize
Yes to the Poor, No to the Idle

The public's discontent with the welfare system is captured by one remarkable statistic. The New York Times/CBS News Poll asked a question in May about the level of spending for "assistance to the poor," and two-thirds of the public said it was "too little."
That question was immediately re-asked, with one small change: the word "welfare" was substituted for "assistance to the poor." Only 23 percent said the nation was spending "too little" on welfare.
 
Perception Versus Reality
 A Times poll, conducted later that month, found that 74 percent agreed with the proposition that most welfare recipients are so dependent on the system that they will never leave it. Majorities also said that the welfare system encourages people to have larger families than they would have otherwise, and that it discourages pregnant women from marrying. In each of these cases, a public perception that may be true for some welfare recipients is inaccurate for the majority, who get off welfare within a few years, most often through marriage, and who on average have small families.
All of this co-exists with strong support for helping those who might have been called, in earlier times, the "deserving poor." Lawrence M. Mead, a conservative and author of "The New Politics of Poverty: the Nonworking Poor in America" (Basic Books, 1992), argues that many Americans consider the willingness to work to be the dividing line between the two.
"What the public wants to do is not spend more or spend less, but to cause the behavior of the recipients to change," he says. "What's at issue in the current social politics is: Shall we enforce values upon which everyone is agreed?"
Stan Greenberg, the poll-taker for Mr. Clinton, argues that the welfare system "symbolizes a lot of things that are wrong" to the middle class. "People don't understand why, particularly in tough economic times, with many full-time workers living near poverty, we have programs that appear to be based on the wrong values," Mr. Greenberg said. Honoring the "work ethic" and shaping welfare policies that reflect the importance of work, he argues, are critical to rebuilding support for poverty programs.
 
Trying to Reward Work
 Such views emerge in polling and in interviews around the nation.
Bryan Bauer, 35 years old, who owns a small construction company Houston, says flatly: "The system only works if everyone works within the system. You work, you get laid off and you have a family to support, you need it." But he added, "It's for temporary help until you're back on your feet."
Such an attitude has driven the policy debate over welfare in recent years; much of the energy has focused on easing, encouraging and rewarding the transition to work. The heart of the Family Support Act of 1988, a significant revision in the welfare law that was written by Mr. Moynihan, was the "welfare to work" provisions that required states to expand their job training and placement programs.
But there is a Catch-22 to "welfare reform" aimed at reducing dependency: It costs money, at least in the early stages. And the Moynihan law arrived just as many states were encountering their worst fiscal situations in years. As a result, states were using only about 60 percent of the Federal money available to those who could match it Mr. Moynihan estimated.
"We had a real consensus in 1988," said Mr. Moynihan, "and there's no reason to believe it disappeared. The money's disappeared."
 
The Role of Marriage
 Aside from work, the other value at the heart of this debate is marriage -- or at least, parental responsibility. The image of unwed mothers producing baby after baby, while the fathers disappear and the welfare check takes their place, is a powerful one. (Actually, almost three-fourths of the families on A.F.D.C. have one or two children, the American Public Welfare Association says.)
This image pops up in politics in various ways, sometimes with racial overtones, as when David Duke railed against a "rising welfare underclass." It was at the heart of the recent debate over Murphy Brown, prompted by Mr. Quayle's attack on the television character as an unsuitable role model. And it is part of the cultural subtext for measures like one in New Jersey that would deny additional payments to women who have more children while on A.F.D.C.
Many politicians worry that the children themselves get overlooked in all of this. "Paternalism, in general, doesn't bother me as a principle if it means you're going to provide guidance and help and goads to these people," said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. "The basic dilemma I have is this: What do you do when you have parents, usually mothers, who resist and resist and resist? At bottom, I am opposed to visiting the sins of the parent on the child."
There is, however, a strong bipartisan support for increased child support enforcement, which is evident on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail.
 
Candidates Respond
 Promising Change In the System

Republicans have long used the Great Society and its supposed "giveaway" programs as symbols of a Democratic Party out of touch with "mainstream America." Vice President Dan Quayle, with his attacks on "cultural elites" and his appeals for "family values" is continuing in this tradition. The Clinton campaign, for its part, tries to use welfare to show its commitment to a new Democratic approach to government and poverty, which encourages the values of personal responsibility, work and family.
All of these issues were already swirling through the 1992 campaign, but the riots in Los Angeles guaranteed that the nation's attitudes toward the poor would be at the heart of the fall debate.
Before the riots, Mr. Bush was accused of practicing sound bite politics on poverty because of his commercial in the primaries promising to get the "able-bodied" off welfare and his declaration in his State of the Union Address, "Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle." In that address he said that welfare recipients had responsibilities to work, "get their lives in order, hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock."
Critics asserted that he had proposed little in the way of policy to foster independence, and was simply using the issue to galvanize an economically anxious middle class.
 
A Changed Tone
 Since the riots in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush has changed his tone, speaking more sympathetically about the plight of families on welfare. But his proposals on Capitol Hill remain modest, like a measure that would seek to encourage savings by the poor by raising the assets limit for families on A.F.D.C, many analyst says.
Mr. Clinton campaigns extensively on the need to revise welfare to encourage work. After two years, he says, he would have every welfare recipient capable of working either in a private sector job or working off their grant in a community service job.
His deputy campaign manager for policy, Bruce Reed, says, "I think that there's a growing consensus among Democrats that we have an obligation to end welfare dependency and reform the welfare system, to move beyond the rhetoric of the right and the mistakes of the left."
Analysts are still waiting for Ross Perot to present detailed positions on the welfare system and numerous other issues, although in recent appearances, he has talked about his concern about poverty and drug use. He is expected to emphasize job creation in poor areas, as well as early intervention for children through better health care and schools.
In the end, the Presidential campaign, and the debates roaring through states like California, could help forge a new consensus on poverty issues, connecting the ideas that have emerged in policy circles over the past decade with the attitudes that have been building in the middle class.
Still, almost no other issue carries so great a temptation to scapegoat and frighten. This is one part of the new welfare politics that has not changed.

HEADLINE: Companies Working Out of the Recession With No Added Jobs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
After two years of being battered by recession, the Timken Company, a producer of bearings and high-quality steel in Canton, Ohio, is beginning to stir.
In its cavernous plant in a quiet city an hour south of Cleveland, forklifts whiz back and forth, and men and women in bright yellow hard hats scurry to fill the growing level of new orders. 
 But as the plant begins to churn out more and more steel products, its work force will not grow. "We've seen modest increases in demand so far this year," said Joseph F. Toot Jr., the company's chairman. "We expect demand to increase even more next year. But, if we're successful at making gains in productivity, we wouldn't add people next year either."
As manufacturers work their way out of a recession that trimmed their profits and work forces, Timken is the rule, not the exception. Executives in industries from chemicals and machine tools to steel and paper say they have no plans to recall workers, even if demand for their products becomes more robust in a year or so.
Their corporate policies are reflected in the spurt in the nation's unemployment rate by three-tenths of a percentage point in June to 7.8 percent that the Labor Department reported on Friday, leading the Federal Reserve almost immediately to cut the interest rate it charges on loans to banks a half point to 3 percent in yet-another effort to stimulate the economy.
The White House has been counting on an economic recovery to help President Bush's re-election campaign, and across the country laid-off workers have been counting on a recovery to restore their jobs. In some ways the signs of recovery are abundant, although the pace appears to be gradual. From the Government's Index of Leading Indicators to the economic index of the nation's manufacturing purchasing managers, there are persistent messages proclaiming an economic upturn. Still, gains have not appeared in hiring practices of the nation's heavy manufacturers.
Unemployment is a stubborn, perhaps even intractable problem. The latest data included a shorter work week, lengthening spells of unemployment and more layoffs as the ranks of the unemployed rose 470,000 to a total just under 10 million people.
 
Job Reductions Continuing
 "We're seeing an attempt to improve productivity in manufacturing without making additions to the work force," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve and president of Brimmer & Company, a Washington-based economic consulting firm. "And so while the economy is expanding now, many companies are still reducing their work forces. It's not unique to manufacturing. You can see it in commerce and services as well as factory production."
Mr. Brimmer noted that employers were avoiding hiring to escape paying for benefits like health insurance and vacations. "Even as output has picked up in some industries, the chief response has been to increase hours, even paying overtime if necessary," he said.
One reason companies are able to produce more with fewer people, executives and economists say, is that the nation's heavy industries have so modernized their plants in the last decade, using computers and automated production lines, that many jobs have been made redundant.
At the Reynolds Metals Company, for example, nearly 5,000 jobs have been cut in a decade, many during the recent recession. "We will be able to manufacture more product with fewer people," said John R. McGill, the company's vice president of human resources. "Even if we see a sizable jump in demand, I don't see that it would affect the size of our work force."
 
Workers Won't Be Recalled
 Indeed, a monthly survey of the nation's manufacturers by Cahners Economics indicated that 59 percent of manufacturing companies surveyed said many jobs eliminated during the recession would not return because operations had become more productive.
Moreover, there is a worldwide overcapacity for many products as diverse as truck tires, polyethylene, aluminum and office paper that has led to intense price competition, lower profits and a reluctance to hire.
That means thousands of workers laid off during the recession will not return to highly coveted jobs. In Canton, as in many communities across America, manufacturing jobs were long thought to offer security and relative prosperity for people with little more than high school educations.
"It has been many people's lives because manufacturing jobs tend to be high-paying jobs in communities like ours," said Charles T. Edwins, a manager in the Canton office of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services. "Many people hold out hope that improvement in the economy will make their jobs available to them again, but I don't know how realistic that is coming out of this recession. In economic times like we're in now, there are more people in the labor market than there are jobs."
 
Recovery in Fits and Starts
 Part of the reluctance to add workers, economists and executives say, reflects the expectation that the economic recovery will be slow and characterized by fits and starts. But part simply reflects new corporate efficiencies.
At the Ferrow Corporation, a maker of coatings, specialty chemicals and plastics, demand for the company's products has risen. Production at the Cleveland-based company's plants is now 12 percent higher than a year ago. But Hector R. Ortino, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said there were no plans to add to the work force. "With our present structure, we can easily handle a far greater increase in demand with our current work force," he said.
Similarly, PPG Industries, a Pittsburgh-based maker of glass and paints, reported growth in orders and production, but no plans to add workers in the coming year.
 
'We're Holding the Line'
 "We're holding the line on hiring and working hard at being as productive as possible with the work force we have," said John S. Ruch, a spokesman for the company. Even if the prediction of continued economic growth comes true, he said, "it's unlikely that our work force will grow."
Of course, many companies do expect some hiring in the next year, saying that their operations have been staffed too leanly during the recession to handle increases in demand.
"We have already seen an increase in demand, and we've brought back or hired 969 people to the tire side of the business," said Hoyt M. Wells, president and chief operating officer of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Mr. Wells said the company had added equipment to a plant in Alabama, increasing the work schedule to six days from five. "That has necessitated that we increase the number of crews of people from three to four," he added.
 
But Some Are Hiring
 Some smaller companies are also increasing their work forces. There are also plans by companies to increase inventories, marketing outlays and spending on new plants and equipment. But mass production no longer means mass employment.
In the chemical industry, for example, employment peaked at 1.1 million workers in 1981. But that had fallen to 1.09 million in 1991 and has stayed around that figure. "Companies in our industry don't want to hire more people because people cost money," said Allen J. Lenz, chief economist with the Chemical Manufacturers Association.
Mr. Lenz estimated that employment in the chemical industry was unlikely to change for years. "It's hard to determine if this is going to be good for the industry in the long run," he said. "But when you're dealing with day-to-day problems, you have to go for the short-terms results."
In the machine tool industry, employment fell to 56,000 in the early part of this year from 59,500 in 1991, according the Association for Manufacturing Technology.
 
Demand for Machine Tools
 William G. Copeland, president of the Copeland Economics Group, an economics consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., predicted that demand for new machine tools would increase by about 30 percent in a year. "Detroit canceled a lot of machine-tool orders in the last year, and we think those orders will be replaced in the early part of next year," he said.
Nonetheless, he said he expected employment to rise to only 59,000 workers, below last year's level and far fewer than the 64,300 the machine tool industry employed in 1990.
Even the steel industry, which has endured tough economic weather in the last few years, is seeing improvements in shipments this year, running about 9 percent higher than in the first six months of last year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Demand is picking up because of increased demand from automobile and appliance makers. Still, Milton Deaner, president of the association, said he expected employment to remain around the current level of 143,000 workers. "Analysts have predicted that shipments for this year will increase to 83 million tons, from 72 million tons last year," he said. "But we think employment will remain where it is."
If there is a slender hope for laid-off workers, it is that some economists question whether companies will be able to step up their production, if the economy's rebound is strong, without adding workers.
Referring to the goal of increased productivity, Kermit Baker, the chief economist at Cahners Economics, said, "That's always the goal of a manufacturing operation but whether they can achieve that remains to be seen."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC POWERS FACING THEIR LIMITS AT MUNICH SUMMIT

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 4

 BODY:
At the summit meeting of leaders of the world's seven most powerful industrial democracies beginning Monday in Munich, the dominant problems will be global economic stagnation and the danger of violent ethnic conflict in the former Communist countries.
Since the same problems preoccupied the last summit meeting here a year ago, there will be an air of pessimism at the gathering, which many of the leaders had hoped would be a post-cold-war celebration of the triumph over Communism. 
 Pre-summit briefings and news conferences by President Bush, by other leaders and by their aides left little impression that this, the 18th in a series of meetings originally designed as informal "fireside chats" of world leaders, would lead to a breakthrough.
 
Gorbachev Just a Memory
 The aura of hope that surrounded last year's talks in London, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was welcomed by most of these same leaders almost as one of them, is gone this year. So is his country, the Soviet Union, which collapsed in the wake of a hard-line coup attempt about a month after the London meeting.
Still with them are many of the problems that the heads of the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, plus the president of the European Commission, discussed but failed to resolve at their last two meetings. These include a continuing impasse in negotiations for a new agreement to govern more than $1 trillion in world trade, weak economies in all seven countries, and problems of ethnic strife.
Over the next three days, the summit leaders are expected to promise to keep trying to achieve a new global trade agreement by the end of the year, and to grant President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia a $1 billion down payment on an International Monetary Fund plan to pay for badly needed imports and modernize the economy.
 
Yeltsin, Guest and Lobbyist
 They may agree to a limited moratorium on Russian debt repayment if Mr. Yeltsin provides assurances when he appears before them on Wednesday afternoon that he intends to keep moving toward a market economy. In Moscow today, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would ask the summit leaders for a two-year moratorium on repayments of principal and interest on the former Soviet debt. [Page 6.]
Beyond the $24 billion already pledged by I.M.F. member nations to aid the transition of the former Soviet economies to the private market, the Munich meeting appears unlikely to offer much. "We can't finance the transition in its entirety," said Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry. "That's not feasible."
President Bush, who visits Poland on Sunday before going to Munich on Sunday night, and the other leaders are also expected to agree on a package worth $600 million to $700 million to finance safety improvements to Soviet-built nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe.
This measure is planned out of fear that if nothing is done, Europeans could face more nuclear accidents like the near-meltdown at Chernobyl in 1986. It is not clear whether all seven of the nations at Munich will take part.
 
Avoiding Yugoslav Quagmire
 The summit leaders are expected to deplore the Yugoslav violence, as they did last year, and indicate greater support for the United Nations peacekeeping force that is trying to control it. Mr. Bush made it clear last week that American ground combat forces would not become involved, and most European countries are eager, as well, to stay out of the fighting.
Most of the summit participants will move to Helsinki on Thursday for a two-day meeting of 52 European and North American leaders to continue the search for a new security structure and agree on country-by-country ceilings on armed forces in Europe. Beyond this, expectations are limited.
"There's a sense of institutional hollowness, a staleness, as people go to Munich," a senior American official said. "After the euphoria of the end of the cold war, a kind of Monday morning feeling has set in."
Most of the leaders coming to Munich face mounting political problems at home, problems that limit their room to maneuver. Mr. Bush is in the political fight of his life for re-election. The Socialist Party of President Francois Mitterrand has hit near-record lows in French opinion polls, one reason for his extraordinary visit to Sarajevo last weekend.
 
Diplomacy in a Beer Hall
 The Japanese Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also faces a difficult election campaign, and the Germany of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after the political euphoria of unification, is suffering from an economic hangover. Possibly this is why the first event he scheduled is an informal lunch on Monday in a typical, if slightly up-market Munich beer hall, the Spatenhaus.
"The global economy will intentionally be the main point," Mr. Kohler said. "Currently growth is weak and recovery is under way, but it is of uncertain strength and dimension."
There, too, the leaders are not considered likely to take bold steps. The United States, with chronic budget deficits and unemployment at an eight-year high, is hardly in a position to lead the way to world recovery, even though the Federal Reserve Board lowered its key interest rate on Thursday to 3 percent, from 3 1/2 percent.
Germany's equivalent rate is 8 percent, and Bonn is keeping its interest rates high because of inflation brought about by its unprecedented deficit spending to reunify the country economically as well as politically. German officials say they do not expect their central bank to soon follow the American action.
Officials in Japan have also been saying in effect, "We've already done all we can." Mr. Miyazawa told Mr. Bush on Wednesday that he planned to spend $47 billion to $55 billion on a package to stimulate his country's economy and possibly spur demand for American and other Western imports. Japan has a ballooning trade surplus, one that again worries American and other Western leaders.
 
Discord Over Farm Subsidies
 Crucially, the leaders will be confronted in Munich with their failure to make good on pledges to conclude a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an accord that could go a long way toward bringing about economic recovery.
The talks have been deadlocked by disagreement between the United States and the 12-nation European Community on agricultural subsidies. American officials say that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was willing to come to Europe this weekend to try to achieve a breakthrough before the meeting, but that the Europeans were unwilling to make the concessions on reducing export subsidies Washington considered necessary for an accord.
The leaders are not expected to resolve this issue in Munich, German and British officials say, but they will probably issue another commitment, their third, to see to it that there is a new GATT accord by the end of the year.
"I think the United States must also find maneuvering room," Mr. Kohler said in briefing reporters in Bonn on preparations for the meeting.
American officials believe that Mr. Mitterrand, President of the biggest agricultural power in Europe, is the central figure among the Europeans, and hope that Mr. Kohl will push him to make greater concessions. But with French farmers angry about the cuts in price supports recently decided upon by European Community agriculture ministers, he may not be willing to.
"The best thing we can do for all these countries, from the third world or from the Soviet Union, is to open our markets, and that's very much bound up with GATT," said Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London.

French Farm Protest Goes On
 PARIS, July 4 (Reuters) -- Protesting French farmers blocked rail lines in the southeast today, aggravating transportation problems caused by a six-day protest by truck drivers.
The farmers blocked parts of a line in the area of Avignon, cutting the route from Lyons to Nice. Elsewhere, trains near Bordeaux were halted.

HEADLINE: Indian-White Rape Case Splits Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 28

 BODY:
With his yellow parrot headdress, Paulinho Paiakan has emerged in recent years as a worldwide symbol of Brazilian Indians' defense of their Amazon homelands.
"A new Gandhi," proclaimed Anita Roddick, who purchases Brazil nut oil from the Kaiapo Indian chief for her international cosmetics chain, the Body Shop. 
 "A man who would save the world," the American magazine Parade trumpeted last April in a cover profile of the powerfully built Kaiapo with shoulder-length hair and piercing black eyes.
International awards, television appearances in the United States and a heroic role in a children's cartoon series were all to culminate this fall with the filming of a $40 million Hollywood version of Mr. Paiakan's life, directed by Ridley Scott.
 
Accused on June 2
 Then, a bruised and battered 18-year-old woman appeared June 2 at a police station in Redencao, 1,000 miles northwest of here. She accused the 37-year-old chief of raping her in the back seat of his Chevette, a charge the chief denies.
"Explosion of savage instinct," said the headline in Brazil's largest selling news weekly, Veja, which broke the story on its June 10 cover. "The chief symbol of ecological purity tortures and rapes a white high school girl."
The ensuing uproar has bared Brazilian attitudes toward rape, race and Indian rights. Today, feminists are fighting anthropologists, who in turn are fighting Brazilian press barons for supposedly inciting an anti-Indian backlash.
The young woman, a Portuguese language tutor for the chief's three children, charged that after a long day of drinking at a barbecue he attacked her and forced her to have sex with him, causing her to lose her virginity.
 
Granted Numerous Interviews
 The woman, Silvia Leticia Ferreira, has been widely identified by Brazilian news organizations and has granted numerous television and press interviews about the case; she has also allowed photographs of the bruises she said were inflicted in the attack.
In initial press interviews, Mr. Paiakan admitted, then denied, having sex with the woman. Formally charged with rape, the Indian leader in a police deposition June 19 again denied that he ever had sex with the woman. Instead, he said that his wife, Irekran, grew jealous of the younger woman and raped her with her fingers.
[On Tuesday, a presiding judge received a police report that affirmed that Ms. Ferreira's underwear was stained with her blood and with Mr. Paiakan's sperm.]
The chief awaits trial while under house arrest in his native village, A-Ukre. A cause celebre in Brazil, the chief's defense has been taken up by a legal team led by Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, a human rights lawyer who is Deputy Mayor of Sao Paulo.
 
Legally a Ward of the State
 Feminists assert that the Kaiapo chief is hiding behind his wife, knowing that she cannot be indicted. Because she does not speak Portuguese and is only vaguely familiar with Western ways, she is legally considered a ward of the state and cannot be tried in Brazilian courts.
The chief, on the other hand, attended missionary school, speaks Portuguese reasonably well, has a bank account, owns an airplane and a city house, drives his own pickup truck, and has traveled overseas, mostly recently to London last April.
Many anthropologists fear that the rape charge against the Kaiapo chief is being used to discredit Brazil's Indian rights movement and their foreign backers.
 
Group Founded by Rock Star
 "We are all worried that the Paiakan affair is being used by people who have designs on the wealth of the Indian territories," said Olympio Serra, an anthropologist who is president of the Brazilian Rain Forest Foundation, a Kayapo support group founded by Sting, the British rock star.
Anthropologists say rape is rare among the Kaiapo. Traditionally, rape was restricted to warfare against outside groups.
"If a rape occurred, it was a reflection of his living among white people," said Darcy Ribeiro, a Rio anthropologist.
Mr. Paiakan and other Kaiapo chiefs are caught between both worlds. Often touted as "Brazil's wealthiest Indians," the 5,000 Kaiapo earn millions of dollars a year in royalties from gold and mahogany extracted from an archipelago of reserves stretching over 42,500 miles in central Brazil. Responsible for nearly half the economic activity in Redencao, the chiefs have second households and often indulge in sexual liaisons with local women.
 
A Rarely Punished Crime
 Traditionally in Brazil, rape is an underreported and rarely punished crime. For example, in nearby Ceara state, 930 rapes against girls under 18 were reported in 1990. Of these cases, only six led to arrests.
Mr. Paiakan also said he is being persecuted. "Why aren't gold miners who rape and murder Yanomami women punished?" he demanded of reporters, referring to northern Amazon tribe whose lands are frequently invaded by gold seekers. "Is this law only for me?"
Marcos Terena, an Indian spokesman, said, "When a white man rapes an Indian woman, there is never any scandal."
In a growing backlash against the Indians, more and more Brazilians say the Government is bottling up vast amounts of timber and minerals by recognizing huge reserves to shelter Brazil's 225,000 indigenous people -- about 1.5 percent of this impoverished nation's population. Under Brazilian law, logging and mining in Indian reserves can occur only with tribal permission and by paying royalties.
Although daunting legislative hurdles remain before the reserve could be abolished, the vote reflects regional dissatisfaction over setting aside a mineral-rich area larger than Portugal for 10,000 Indians.
In another action last week, 2,000 settler families invaded a 650-square-mile ranch in a frontier town near Redencao. During the Earth Summit, an Italian oil company, under pressure from Italian and Brazilian human rights groups, gave up its 25-year-old title to the land and announced the return of the ranch to its traditional inhabitants, the Xavante tribe.
Racial tensions are also high in Redencao, where Paulinho Paiakan maintains a townhouse and a small farm. "An Indian's place is in his village, a rapist's place is in jail," read a banner carried by protesters through streets of Redencao, in early June.
In reprisal, Kaiapo Indians sacked a store, blocked the airstrip to A-Ukre, and temporarily trapped 3,000 loggers and gold miners on Indian lands. Recalling that Kaiapo Indians killed 22 white squatters in 1981 and rioted at Redencao's hospital in 1990, residents of the Amazon town panicked at rumors that Indians would invade and burn the courthouse.
To defuse tensions, Redencao's Mayor banned liquor sales to Indians, banned sound trucks by protesters, and arranged the Kaiapo's trial to be shifted to more neutral territory, Maraba, a town 210 miles to the north.

Listen to June Johnston, 84 years old, of Salt Lake City, or to Lois Hair, 79, of Gainesville, Fla., or Homer Weaver, 85, of Houston, and you hear the anxiety and anger of those who see themselves as the economy's other losers.
They are not the unemployed, who need work, or the young families who cannot afford to buy homes. Their goal is security of another kind: a safe place for their savings and a predictable income. They invested in savings accounts and certificates of deposit, only to watch their income be drastically reduced as the Federal Reserve sliced its discount rate from 6.5 percent in January of 1991 to 3 percent last week. 
 The rates on C.D.'s, which banks typically offer for terms from three months to five years, are set by banks but tend to hover near the discount rate, the lowest rates at which banks can borrow from the government.
"I depend on it," Mrs. Hair, a retired secretary, said of her monthly interest income, now down to $300 from about $600 just 18 months ago. "But I can't afford to gamble on anything else. I want to stay safe, but I'm only getting half of what I used to get." Her only other income is about $600 a month in Social Security payments.
 
Leery of Stock Market
 In a time of low inflation and low interest rates, many investment advisers recommend stocks, bonds and other investments that return much higher rates than savings accounts and certificates of deposit. But experts say that older people with limited assets tend to be leery of the stock market and its risks.
"They have been schooled to stay away from equities," said Lester I. Kaplan, executive director of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington in Rockville, Md., which provides services for more than 5,000 elderly people. "They have relatively little choice about what they put their money into. They cannot risk putting it into stocks for fear the principal will decrease. Adults tend to stay with C.D.'s because they are not only economically but psychologically attached to principal.
"The great fear of senior adults is what will happen if they become frail. The fear is that they will become dependent. A senior adult views independence as some people view life itself. One of the great securities is having money in the bank."
Erna and Melton Wallace of Houston, both 78, took early retirement 16 years ago. The last two years have slowly eroded the interest income they had come to count on.
"Every time they drop it, it drops our money farther down," Mrs. Wallace said, "and now it's practically to bottom,. We've just quit eating out altogether. We seldom ever eat out, maybe once every six weeks to two months, we'll have a little binge. We don't go to movies any more. I quit bowling because I couldn't afford the fees."
 
Dipping Into Savings
 In Salt Lake City, Mrs. Johnston, a former assistant librarian, said she was dipping into savings because she could not get by on interest and Social Security alone. "Every time the interest rates drop, it makes me sad," she said. "It's just one more drop in the living scale."
Or as Mr. Weaver, a retired contractor, said: "It just means we have less money to live on. I don't have a pension. The only retirement fund we have is the one we created ourselves."
But one economist, Tim Smeeding, a professor of economics at Syracuse University, argues that the decline in interest rates is part of cyclical economic fluctuation, and can be weathered by those who have a mixture of different kinds of investments. Putting money into certificates of deposit, he said, "was betting on high interest and high inflation."
He added: "The only kind of people who could be in trouble are those who have Social Security, no private pension and a small amount of savings they count on for private income." An outside estimate of their numbers, he guessed, would be one-fifth of the total elderly population, or a maximum of about 6 million people of the 31 million people 65 years old or older. But, he said, these totals may be exaggerated.
"I just can't see this as being all that terrible a problem," he said. "The idea is, if you've got enough money for the rate drop to make a difference, you should be diversified. Some who have problems ought to consider their portfolios and get some advice as to how to invest it. They might have to take a little risk."
Etta Keevil, an 88-year-old retired librarian from Seattle, is not willing to do that. Her C.D.'s now earn about 4 percent, down from 9 percent a year ago, so her income from them is reduced from $18,000 a year to about half of that. But, like others her age, Mrs. Keevil remembers the lessons of the Depression, a time of frugality. Housebound and physically restricted, she said she is too old to take risks. Rather than change her investments, "I could go into savings," she said.
 
'No-Win Investment'
 Ursula Constantini, of Ocala, Fla., did pull out of C.D.'s after her interest rates went from 6 percent to 2.5 percent. "It's a no-win investment," she said.
Others will not abandon the safety of federally insured C.D.'s. "You think about getting into stocks," said William Langley, 75, a resident of a retirement community in Silver Spring, Md. "But I don't want to take the risk."
Many of the retired interviewed in Silver Spring and Rockville, Md., who live in one of the nation's richest counties, indicated the interest rate drop had little effect on their spending habits. "I'm lucky enough that I don't have to cut out too much," said Lilli Isner, 76, a volunteer at the Jewish community Center in Rockville. "But yesterday I went to the bank; I had some certificates coming due. They were paying 3.2 percent, down from 6.8 percent a year or so ago. And I remember when I got 13 or 14 percent."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
Luck and Voter Scrutiny Forge a Rare Harmony

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Congress left town for the most patriotic of holidays after its most bipartisan votes of the year on Thursday, with Republicans and Democrats both supporting urban aid in the House and Russian aid in the Senate, and, in both chambers, changing unemployment law for both the long and the short term.
Rare combinations of political necessity and lucky timing helped forge agreement on those measures, after months in which the most frequent item of agreement was on the impossibility of breaking the legislative gridlock. In coming weeks, conflicting party interests and philosophies seem sure to bring renewed conflicts on issues from abortion to hunger and taxes. 
 Still, Thursday's unity is worth examining for its ingredients. They illustrate what was there that day and what is usually absent from the working of the 102d Congress.
Nothing caught Thursday's unusual mood better than the sight of Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, the Republicans' chief deputy whip in the House, urgently persuading colleagues to support procedures to bar amendments to the urban-aid bill so it could sail through safely. Most afternoons, Mr. Walker sees prohibitions on amendments as tyranny.
But the urban-aid bill contains an enterprise-zone proposal whose terms satisfy Republican orthodoxy. Even more important, this is a measure that Republicans have helped build from the ground floor in the relatively swift two months of lawmaking since the Los Angeles riots. For the enterprise zones, Republicans in Congress and the Administration accepted Democratic demands for greater social-service programs in exchange for tax breaks for investors.
 
Unusual Harmony
 "Everybody gave a lot and got," trying the best of each other's ideas, said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader. One thing each side got was temporary relief from the public perception that Congress is engaged only in debate "contrived because of politics," he said.
That sense of shared purpose united Republicans and Democrats against amendments to the urban-aid bill so they could squelch an expensive increase in Social Security payments to the "notch babies." Those people, born between 1917 and 1926, complain that a technicality in the law has cheated them because people born earlier or later than that get higher benefits.
In the Senate, the eventual unity behind aid for the former Soviet Union was, as they used to say in Moscow about far more dubious propositions, a matter of historical inevitability. After piling senatorial distraction on distraction during the debate, with diversions to everything from the balanced-budget amendment to a dialogue on President Truman, the aid bill passed.
All along, the only question had been when that would happen. The argument against helping Russians or Uzbeks or Ukrainians while Americans were in need was heard from time to time, but not often, and the Senate's sense of history left it no alternative but passage. In the more parochial House, in contrast, strategists were talking this weekend about what they would try to get from the Bush Administration as a bribe for passing the aid bill.
 
Economic News Prods G.O.P.
 The near unanimity on the unemployment bill was locked in by the morning's news that the national unemployment rate had jumped to 7.8 percent in June. President Bush had talked in the morning about vetoing the bill. But lawmakers in both parties rolled their eyes at that idea, although House Republican leaders were prepared to support him, if necessary.
It would have been simple if the bill had provided just another emergency extension of benefits for workers who had exhausted their state payments. But the Democrats had grown more and more insistent that the need to keep voting for stopgap aid showed that the fundamental benefits law was too tightfisted and needed to be amended to protect more workers.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, kept pressing more senior Democrats to stand and fight on this issue. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, decided this spring that permanent changes were needed to make extra benefits easier to get in a recession. His conservative approach left him in a position to deal with the Administration and to bring along another canny Senator, the minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas.
Mr. Bentsen's ability to deal with the Administration made the House Ways and Means Committee accept a bill that avoided the most obvious way to pay for the changes: by raising the base on which taxes to pay for emergency benefits are calculated.
The limit is now $56 per worker per year, whether the worker earns $7,000 or $200,000, though unemployment benefits themselves are higher for workers whose paychecks are bigger. With Republicans dead set against increasing the wage base because that would be a new tax, other ways to pay for the change were found, including revised rules for taxing lump-sum pension payments that everyone agreed not to call a new tax.
 
Agreement on College Loans
 There was one other mark of bipartisanship in the week's events, an agreement between the Administration and Congress on a new higher education bill. Congressional Republicans talked the Administration out of a veto of a plan to provide student loans without using banks as intermediaries because voting against college grants and loans is perhaps even less popular in an election year than voting against the unemployed.
Similarly, Democrats may succeed this week in prying House Republicans away from their loyalties to Mr. Bush and into bipartisan harmony born of electoral necessity on a trade bill. The measure would direct the Administration to identify the nation's most difficult trading partners and take action to remove their barriers. It is counter to Republican theory, but lawmakers are likely to judge the issue far more in terms of their constituents than in terms of political philosophy.
But once Congress returns July 21 from the Democratic National Convention, the prospect is for bitter party fights. Three issues stand out.
First, Democrats plan to pursue abortion-rights legislation so as to cause maximum conflict among Republicans and embarrassment for Mr. Bush. They expect a veto but intend to argue that the rejection will be just one more reason not to re-elect him.
Second, attention will turn to another Downey bill, a five-year plan to provide $3.5 billion to help keep children within troubled families by providing social workers on call and to provide $3.5 billion to increase food-stamp allotments for families with children. It would be paid for by a 10 percent surtax on incomes of more than $1 million per year.
The bill got only one Republican vote in committee, that of Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, and its tax feature would invite a veto. But Democratic leaders are increasingly thinking of it as both good policy and good politics, serving two sympathetic constituencies by taxing the rich.
And there will be more arguments over health care. Democrats are seeking common ground on ways to cut costs and increase access to health care, while Republicans are stressing a different agenda that relies on cutting paperwork costs, curbing malpractice suits and creating a new tax plan called a Medisave account, which they think would motivate patients to keep medical costs down.
That is gridlock.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Clinton Camp Finds the Time Is Ripe

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 4

 BODY:
Taking advantage of the fruits of discipline, circumstance and political serendipity, Gov. Bill Clinton is poised to enter the Democratic Party's nominating convention in the best strategic position he has enjoyed since his checkered Presidential campaign began.
Mr. Clinton is using an extended holiday weekend to mull over his Vice Presidential selection and to formulate a general election campaign that presents him as the most substantive and change-oriented candidate in a three-way race. 
 Recently, the campaign has had a modicum of success. Mr. Clinton and his aides are convinced that they succeeded in luring the White House onto their turf last week when poor employment statistics forced President Bush to defend his handling of the economy. The day before, the President had taken the unusual step of submitting to random questions on a live morning talk show, an approach used to advantage by both Mr. Clinton and Ross Perot.
"The mood of the electorate is very different today than in 1988," said Paul Begala, a Clinton strategist. "That's the whole thing George Bush doesn't get."
 
Leaning on Specifics
 Their goal is to keep the debate centered on the economy and on an agenda of debatable specifics on topics like education and health care that will put the Bush-Quayle campaign on the defensive and contrast Mr. Clinton's details with Mr. Perot's generalities.
If this approach succeeds, it will allow Mr. Clinton to campaign for President on the terms he has long sought. Instead of answering questions about his character and his personal behavior, he will be debating the issues he is convinced voters want to hear more about.
"The one thing that's been clear throughout the 1992 campaign has been that people want real answers, not political ones," said Bruce Reed, the deputy campaign manager for policy. "And what most frustrates them about politics these days is that politicians say or do whatever it takes to get ahead instead of telling them honestly what they plan to do when they're President."
Mr. Clinton and his campaign staff are now reaping the benefits of the strategy they settled on at the close of the primary season. They decided not to attack Mr. Perot, who was then surging in popularity polls, predicting that such a battle would make them look worse instead of better.
"We swore almost a blood oath that we would spend June talking about Bill Clinton and that we would not join in any political fight with either George Bush or Ross Perot," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker. "We now have an audience."
The campaign's spokeswoman, DeeDee Myers, added: "It's like in baseball: Good teams make their breaks."
This newly attentive audience, the campaign strategists hope, has now tuned in as Mr. Clinton uses his return to the spotlight to choose a running mate, deliver a carefully composed acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention and begin a hectic cross-country campaign immediately after leaving New York.
In the past, the two months between the convention and Labor Day were largely devoted to the political equivalent of killing time, waiting for the fall campaign to officially begin. But this year, his advisers acknowledge, they will be a crucial period for Mr. Clinton.
"These breaks don't last too long," observed James Carville, a senior strategist.
President Bush has already telegraphed some of the punches he plans to take when he gets into what he describes as "campaign mode," saying that Americans will be voting on experience and temperament. Presumably, the President is referring to Mr. Clinton's lack of experience on the national and international stage and to Mr. Perot's reputation for having a short fuse.
The Clinton forces say they are prepared for the White House to take aim at Mr. Clinton's record as Governor of Arkansas and his lack of foreign policy experience.
"I'll put his plan up against our record any day of the week," said George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director.
But a greater vulnerability for Mr. Clinton may lie in the Republicans' ability to transform a debate about family values into a discussion about Mr. Clinton's moral fitness.
Vice President Dan Quayle, while doggedly refusing to say that his remarks are aimed at Mr. Clinton, has continued to expound on the need for a return to family values. But this message was muted last week when a Little Rock trip that the White House had billed as an effort to embarrass Mr. Clinton in his home state occurred on the same say that the Labor Department announced the startling new rise in unemployment.
His claim that Mr. Clinton's economic plan was a "pipe dream" went virtually nowhere. Meanwhile, the Democrats seized on the bad economic news as evidence that Mr. Bush was not doing enough to help the economy.
The statistics undercut Mr. Bush's assertion that the recession was ending more quickly than he had been given credit for, and they reinforced Mr. Clinton's conviction that he had hit upon the formula that would strike a stronger chord among voters -- their distrust for politics and their unhappiness with the economy.
 
Fewer Talk Shows
 Mr. Clinton, whose campaign in the last month has largely been limited to walking in and out of television studios, is expected to rely less on talk show appearances in coming weeks. One adviser said that approach, which was considered novel only weeks ago, is now an "old formula."
Instead, aides said, he will be appearing before crowds more, often in town meeting formats where audience members are allowed to ask questions. Part of this plan is meant to appease the candidate, who has been unhappy that technology has cut him off from the sort of campaigning he enjoys most -- old-fashioned handshaking.
The Democrats arrive in New York for their orgy of self-congratulation next week knowing it is the last time Mr. Clinton will have the stage to himself this year and keeping in mind at least one the lessons they learned in 1988. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's 17-point post-convention lead in the polls disappeared in large part because the convention itself became, as one adviser put it, "a little too much a celebration of the past" and no one had planned for the months that followed.
Much of the Democrats' post-convention strategy is closely held. But the one clear strategy reflects the lessons they have learned.
"You come out of the convention campaigning hard and never let up," said Mr. Stephanopoulos.

HEADLINE: Demonstrators Are Targeting The Democrats

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
In a year in which the trappings and structure of politics have paled in the glare of voter resentment, the Democratic Party had hoped to seal its Presidential nomination in a celebration marked by unity and calm. Instead, the Democratic National Convention, which begins in New York a week from tomorrow, is expected to play out before a backdrop of protest the likes of which the nation has not seen since the Vietnam War.
With the drama of the streets competing for attention with that on the convention floor, comparisons to the 1960's are inevitable. Yet the scope of the protests and the variety of their demands could be wider, as more groups with more agendas than ever before try to steal their spotlight from the Democrats. 
 "In the 1960's the fight was just for civil rights and against the Vietnam War," said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "Now, there are a lot of wheels moving. Now, it's black, it's brown, it's lavender and yellow and white. My sense is that it's going to be bigger, it will be louder and it will be angrier than anything we've seen for years."
More than 20 groups representing hundreds of local and national organizations have announced plans to hold demonstrations for issues like homelessness, abortion rights, gay rights, civil rights, unemployment benefits, housing, health care and police brutality. A conservative note will be added by Operation Rescue, the national anti-abortion group that has vowed to shut down New York-area abortion clinics while blaming the Democrats for ignoring the rights of the unborn.
As of last Thursday, police officials had issued eight demonstration permits. But at least as many more groups have vowed to join the fray. The job of keeping the peace has fallen to Police Inspector Michael Julian. In a telephone interview last week, he outlined police preparations and said police officials did not fear widespread disorder. "These are all intelligent people with very serious causes," he said. "What they want, and what they will get, is an opportunity to be heard."
The only trouble he really expects is the battling-megaphone syndrome in which two groups may want to shout their pain at once. In that event, the group with the permit will be allowed to keep yelling, but those without will have to relinquish their sound systems.
Logistics could also be a challenge. Mr. Julian said the police can move "hundreds of thousands" of people peacefully through the city. Yet there could be trouble if the groups move beyond police lines. "Ever since L.A.," said Mr. Julian, "people seem to think that violence is a natural part of these things. Look at the Gotti verdict. When did you ever see cars turned over in the street because someone didn't like a verdict?"
 
Impact on Platform Unlikely
 The protesters' impact on the Democratic platform is likely to be slight. Most of the major issues have been decided. But the street-side jeering could steal the convention's thunder and perhaps even some of its television exposure. More troubling to party officials is the prospect that the protests' scope and diversity could make a powerful statement about the level of voter rage in an election year that increasingly holds that very anger as its central theme.
The irony for the Democrats is that the language of outrage was supposed to be part of their message, one for them to send, not receive.
Protests are also expected in Houston, though on a much smaller scale. Operation Rescue has announced it will be holding "rescues" during the Republican Convention, and liberal groups may gather as well. However, the location of the Houston Astrodome and police preparations for the event should keep demonstrations small and far from the delegates.
In New York, the Democrats will have to fight the grass-roots coalitions outside their doors to get their message across. And rather than the spontaneous demonstrations in the 1960's, party officials will have to deal with demonstrators well versed in media manipulation and armed with organizational sophistication that often includes the presence of marshals whose sole job is to keep the protests peaceful, orderly and legal.
"There will be 75 television trucks parked outside the convention hall," said Mr. Siegel. "Activists know that New York is the theater capital of the world and they are going to do their theater."
Most of the groups will arrive with speakers, posters and the standard paraphernalia of politics. But like any great political campaign, there will be surprises, too, and on the streets, a wacky side that transcends the standard whistle and beanie indulgences of the convention floor.
 
Variety of Tactics
 Lifting tactics from Act Up, the AIDS advocacy and protest group, and even some refined by the Chinese during the Tiananmen Square upheaval of 1989, protesters will press their cause with an array of approaches from the simplest sound bite and slogan, to "fax zaps" and "phone zaps," intended to tie up convention phone lines with an avalanche of incoming ire. Citywide "wheatpastings" should leave almost every light pole, newspaper box, subway entrance and public space with a message -- and an attitude. And candles will flicker quieter judgments at prayer meetings of the homeless and those opposed to abortion rights.
The more radical of the groups intend to invade the convention hall itself. One group leader who insisted on anonymity said her organization had obtained 25 floor passes from a friend within the Democratic Party, giving them open access to the Garden. "We'll be doing something inside," she said. "But I can't say what, because then the guards would know what to look for."
Act Up is almost certain to take a lead in aggressive tactics. "We are going to be zapping the candidates," said Amy Bauer, an Act Up member. "There will probably be confrontations in public, and also in private functions. We want them to know that Act Up is watching, that we are paying attention."
 
'This Is Deadly Serious'
 How will Act Up members gain access to the convention hall? Ms. Bauer said the group's members would have no trouble getting in, and would dispense with some of the wilder garb that has marked some of their protests in the past. "This is deadly serious," she said. "The more attacks we can get in against George Bush and the total lack of action on AIDS the better off we'll be."
The Women's Action Coalition, a new and rapidly expanding feminist group, has scheduled a "W.A.C. Convention" on July 14, the night the city's museums are opened to the Democratic delegates. Protesters will carry a banner putting the Democrats on notice that there are "10 million more women who vote than men," and march down Fifth Avenue distributing leaflets with information on women's issues and a list of demands covering economic equity, health care, child care, violence against women and discrimination.
"We are going to have professional politicians getting these materials and we wanted to really show them that we are out here, and we're angry and we're informed, and we're going to pressure them," said Lindsay Walt, a member of W.A.C.'s convention committee.
 
Surprising Success
 B. C. Craig, a member of Act Up's 12-person Campaign '92 team that has organized an AIDS march for earlier that day, said a coalition of more than 270 groups will be represented there. They include such obvious supporters as health-care providers and gay and lesbian organizations to less predictable allies like the March of Dimes. Mr. Clinton and Jerry Brown have endorsed the group's five-point platform, she said.
Some groups say they are astonished by their success at organizing. "This whole thing just started as an idea," said Jasmine Griffin, an insurance company worker who has helped organize the "Take Back Our Lives" march, scheduled for July 13, to protest violence against women. "We put together a wish list of who we'd like to have come speak. The incredible thing is that most of them said yes!"
It is nearly impossible to predict the size of that and other rallies. Some may only bring out a handful of people to chant and sing and shake their fists. Others could draw anywhere from a handful of faithful to thousands of protesters enraged at a system they no longer trust.
 
Police Brutality an Issue
 On July 12, the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black leaders will stage a rally and march to press the Democrats to endorse more black issues. He declined to predict its size, saying: "I won't play the numbers game." But he added that preliminary rallies are already being held in Harlem and elsewhere by black leaders trying to call attention to the need for protest. "We just can't allow the convention to come through here and have laryngitis about police brutality," Mr. Sharpton said Thursday.
While the demonstrations play out in the streets around the convention hall, another, more familiar, drama is expected to stretch from Brooklyn to the Bronx. Last summer, leaders of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue said they would use the convention week to stage their largest "rescue" ever, in an attempt to shame the Democrats for their stand on the abortion issue.
Operation Rescue leaders have since indicated that activities around the convention will be of a regional rather than national scope, and presumably smaller than at first anticipated. But the group's telephone hot line on May 31 encouraged participants to "torture the Democrats" over the issue. Last week some of the top leaders started to convene in Manhattan.
Daniel Brusstar, a coordinator of the Bi-State Operation Rescue Network, which represents Operation Rescue in New York and New Jersey, said anti-abortion protesters would hold a series of prayer meetings throughout the week and would attempt to shut down abortion clinics.
"We want to try to bring attention to the reality of abortion, which is the killing of an innocent life," he said.
Abortion-rights supporters have been preparing to meet that challenge for months, and have received a surge of support themselves in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to uphold most of the limits a Pennsylvania law places on abortion. More than 2,000 volunteers have already been trained in a series of meetings held throughout the region.
Efforts to block Operation Rescue teams are expected to be a $100,000 undertaking involving the establishment of a "clinic defense hot line," a telephone bank operation designed to coordinate volunteers, and the printing and distribution of a mountain of leaflets, posters and signs. It could be the largest coordinated abortion rights effort in the history of the debate. It could also be a sideshow in a city fascinated by its discontent.

HEADLINE: Documents Warned in '85 of Iraqi Nuclear Aims

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Newly declassified Pentagon documents describe warnings as early as 1985 that there was a danger that American technology could be illegally diverted from Iraq's nuclear energy program into an effort to make nuclear weapons.
The documents indicate that Administration officials had warnings about Iraq's dangerous nuclear ambitions much earlier than previously known. They were released this week as Congressional Democrats pressed their case that the policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations toward President Saddam Hussein of Iraq were flawed up to his invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and may have also been criminal. 
 One May 1985 Defense Department document cited a Central Intelligence Agency report "indicating that Iraq continues to actively pursue an interest in nuclear weapons, that the large number of Warsaw Pact nationals in Iraq makes diversion in place a real possibility and that in the past, Iraq has been somewhat less than honest in regard to the intended end-use of high technology equipment."
 
Restrictions Were Urged
 The paper, written by Richard N. Perle, then Assistant Defense Secretary, to Caspar W. Weinberger, then Secretary of Defense, recommended that "to protect our national security interests" the United States impose certain restrictions on sensitive equipment and technology sold to Iraq.
Another document, a March 1985 Pentagon memo, said Iraq had refused to provide assurances that it would not use two American computers in its nuclear program. The Pentagon memo argued in favor of requiring such assurances, noting that the State Department was arguing against it.
"Iraq is a problem country, at least in the mid-to-long term," the memo argued, noting that it had "many if not all" of the elements necessary to reprocess uranium in place and possessed about 100 to 112 pounds of highly enriched uranium. "While we have seen no evidence of a weapons-design program, it makes sense to apply controls to help deter the use of U.S. computers in any such program."
It could not be determined whether the two computers were eventually shipped to Iraq, but American computers were used by the Iraqi military. According to a previously released November 1986 memorandum, for example, Pentagon officials warned that a license for a hybrid computer for the Saad 16 missile complex near Mosul should be denied "because of the high likelihood of military end use and the association of the involved companies in sensitive military applications." The memo stated that the computer could be used to monitor wind-tunnel tests for ballistic missiles.
 
Overrode by Commerce Dept.
 But the Commerce Department overrode the objections and the sale went through without any conditions. The Saad 16 complex was a key target of allied bombing raids in 1991 in the American-led assault to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
Representative Sam Gejdenson, the Connecticut Democrat who released the newly declassified documents on Wednesday, said he was doing so to counter President Bush's statement on a network news program that day that the United States had not enhanced Iraq's "nuclear, chemical or biological capability." Mr. Bush said that he had issued an executive order on the subject, adding, "You have repeated something that isn't true."
"I'm watching the CBS Morning News and the President says we didn't help his chemical or nuclear or missile capability at all, and that is not factually correct based on the Administration's own documents," Mr. Gejdenson said in an interview.
Some of Mr. Bush's own aides are uncomfortable with his blanket denial, which he first articulated last month at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro. The aides have noted that American technology did enhance, albeit inadvertently, that capability.
 
October 1989 Directive
 Even the executive order to which Mr. Bush referred, a national security directive signed in October 1989 that became the cornerstone for his Iraq policy of economic and political incentives, implied that the United States should sell Iraq equipment related to its nuclear energy projects as long as it was not weapons-related.
Other memos released earlier by Mr. Gejdenson showed that Bush Administration officials were convinced that Mr. Hussein would continue to develop his military capability despite the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. An undated State Department memo written early in the Bush Administration, for example, stated that Iraq's military attache in Washington was actively trying to buy equipment that could have military applications.

HEADLINE: Gov. Weld's Stature Rises in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 3

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld did something Michael S. Dukakis could not do: balance the Massachusetts budget without raising taxes. Now he is doing something George Bush will not do: advocate a change in the Republican platform favoring abortion rights.
Through a combination of fiscal conservatism and support for traditionally liberal causes like abortion rights, Massachusetts' 46-year-old freshman Governor has rapidly become a national figure and a potential leader for many Republicans. 
 "Bill Weld is already one of the more popular governors around because he has not raised taxes," said William Schneider, a visiting professor of American politics at Boston College and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "He could really emerge as the hero of the pro-choice Republicans. There are a lot of angry moderate Republicans out there, and they are a constituency waiting to be led."
 
Mixed Reviews in State
 While Governor Weld's reputation has spread nationally, he is getting mixed reviews at home. There is general agreement that his biggest accomplishment was in balancing last year's budget after three years in which Governor Dukakis presided over growing deficits as the state had to borrow from Wall Street.
"Achieving fiscal stability is the single most important thing a governor can do to help the economy of his state, especially given the perception that we were out of control," said Michael Widmer, the executive vice president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a business watchdog organization. "And Bill Weld did it without raising taxes in a year in which 30 other states had to raise taxes."
The budget for the new fiscal year, which began July 1, is expected to be passed by the Legislature within a week and to be in balance after Mr. Weld makes some minor vetoes.
But there is less agreement about whether the spending cuts Mr. Weld has made to balance the budget have been fair and about whether he has really succeeded in his much publicized efforts to transform state government by making it more entrepreneurial. A wealthy lawyer whose father ran the family investment bank, the Governor has been particularly criticized for the impact his cuts have had on programs for the poor and on public higher education.
 
'It Comes Ttoo Easy to Him'
 "I think he makes some of these cuts in a very calculated way, targeting certain groups that aren't popular so it won't affect his popularity," said Deborah Weinstein, executive director of the Massachusetts Human Services Coalition. "It comes too easily too him. I don't think he understands what it's like to live on a few hundred dollars a month."
One of Mr. Weld's biggest cuts, made with approval from the Democratic-controlled Legislature, was to replace the state's general welfare assistance with a smaller program with more stringent eligibility requirements called Emergency Aid to Elderly, Disabled and Children. Of the former 38,000 recipients, 15,000 have lost their monthly checks of up to $308 while 6,000 more are continuing to receive benefits while appealing their disqualification for the benefits.
Joyce Whitford, a 36-year-old jewelry saleswoman who has not been able to work since she suffered a nervous breakdown two years ago, is one of those appealing her benefit cuts. "He's taking things away from people who really need it," she said. "If I lose my benefits, how does he expect me to live?"
Mr. Weld also trimmed the Medicaid benefits of 9,000 people 18 to 21 years old, all young people who were not pregnant or disabled, on the theory that younger people could better withstand the loss of medical benefits than could the elderly.
In a potentially much more sweeping change, Mr. Weld's staff is preparing a plan to overhaul the state's welfare system that would essentially end Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Currently, about 200,000 children and 100,000 adults receive welfare benefits in Massachusetts.
To replace welfare, the state would increase its education and training program for women in poverty, requiring them to find jobs themselves or accept work assigned them by the State Welfare Department. In addition, Governor Weld's plan envisions greatly stepping up efforts to collect child support from fathers, using this money to partly replace welfare payments. Under the new plan, after an 18-month transitional period, mother's who had received welfare benefits would be on their own.
The plan would have to be approved by the Legislature before going into effect as well as receive some Federal waivers. In the state, it is already drawing fire.
"This would put people in an untenable position with artificial deadlines," said Ms. Weinstein, of the Human Services Coalition. "It assumes there are jobs out there, good-paying jobs, and that something magical will happen within 18 months so that these women will earn enough to pay for child care and health insurance."
Governor Weld has insisted that his cuts will preserve a social safety net. He says Massachusetts overspent on human service programs in the 1980's compared with other states and must now trim its tastes back from "a Cadillac to a Chevrolet."
That tough fiscal stance has won him praise from national conservative organizations and has led to speculation that he might be a strong candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996. In a Wall Street Journal article in February, Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, the libertarian research group, gave Mr. Weld the highest mark among the 50 governors on a fiscal report card.
 
Abortion Confrontation
 And the debate over abortion within the Republican Party could thrust Mr. Weld into the limelight at the party's convention in Houston next month, if he decides to confront President Bush and the strong anti-abortion wing of the party.
In an interview, Mr. Weld insisted it was too early for him to decide because there are still unknown factors: the public reaction to this week's Supreme Court on abortion, and whether the Republican platform committee will adopt an anti-abortion plank.
In May, Mr. Weld appealed to the platform committee to at least make the plank neutral on the subject, in keeping with the idea of making the Republican Party a "big tent" inclusive of divergent views.
"If they make it a closed tent, we'd certainly side with the pro-choicers," he said, speaking for himself. Aides to Mr. Weld say it takes six state delegations to force a floor fight on the platform, and as one of six Republican Governors who favor abortion rights, he would be willing to deliver Massachusetts.
 
Challenges Ahead in State
 Beyond this year's election, Mr. Weld faces some tough challenges in the remaining two years of his term as his state's battered economy tries to recover from its worst economic slump since the Great Depression. The recession has cost Massachusetts 10 percent of its jobs over the past three years.
Some economists think biotechnology may do for Massachusetts in the 1990's what computer companies did for it in the 1980's, and the Weld Administration has been trying to attract drug manufacturing plants. It helped find land in Boston for the Cambridge-based Genzyme Corporation, one of the most successful biotechnology companies, which wanted to move to the manufacturing stage from research and development.
But Katharine Bradbury, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, expressed skepticism about how much any governor can do to revive his state's economy. "Governors can't do much to stimulate economic growth," she said.
Mr. Weld's efforts to reform state government, making it, in his words, "slim down, get faster and more customer oriented," have also met an uneven response.
He cites the closing of nine large old state mental and public hospitals, which had been designed for 35,000 people but which were housing only 6,000. They are gradually being replaced by what Mr. Weld says will be smaller, less expensive community-based facilities.
Mr. Weld's most ambitious plan, to date, is a new bill to overhaul the state's public schools. Much like the changes introduced in Arkansas by Gov. Bill Clinton, it would strip teachers of tenure and seniority, giving school principals more authority to reward or punish their teachers' performance.
 
Promise of Education Aid
 The bill would also set a minimum statewide average for spending for each pupil of $5,058, with the state helping the poorest communities that are currently trapped by a law that inhibits them from raising property taxes as fast as the rate of inflation. Mr. Weld has promised $800 million in new state aid to education over the next five years if the are passed by the Legislature.
But Mr. Weld's proposal has been sharply criticized by some business leaders and Democrats in the Legislature. They say the Governor's new money would barely replace state financing that has been cut over the past two years. Instead, they want to ease the law that limits communities from raising property taxes for schools, something Mr. Weld adamantly opposes.
State Representative Mark Roosevelt, a Democrat who is chairman of the House Education Committee, has this assessment of Mr. Weld: "He has no idea where he is going. This man is so much more bark than bite. I don't see any entrepreneurial government. There isn't enough intellectual energy or commitment."

Excerpts From Perot's Letter to Reagan in 1987

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a letter sent by Ross Perot to President Ronald Reagan on April 8, 1987, on Mr. Perot's study of American prisoners of war in Southeast Asia. 
 Dear Mr. President:
My findings on the POW/MIA study are as follows:
We left POWs behind at the end of the war in Vietnam.
We knew we were leaving men behind.
The men left behind were held in Laos.
The evidence that men were held in Laos is substantial --
*There are 343 MIAs in Laos.
*During the war, Pathet Lao officials repeatedly made public statements about holding POWs, including statements made directly to me.
*The CIA listened to the Pathet Lao radio system during the war, and had detailed information about live POWs in Laos. (During my trips to Laos during the war, I was personally briefed on this point by the CIA.)
*At the end of the war, the Pathet Lao publicly stated that they would not release the men until they received the money promised in the Nixon reparations letter.
*The Paris negotiations with Vietnam did not include POWs from Laos. The Vietnamese emphasize this point.
*The Pathet Lao never released any POWs directly or explained what happened to the men they held. (A small number of men who were captured in Laos and turned over to Vietnam for detention were released by Vietnam, along with the other POWs.)
In the Spring of 1973, Congress decided not to pay the $3.25 billion President Nixon had committed in his letter.
Watergate was underway, and our government was not functioning well.
In April, 1973, the Defense Department publicly declared that there were no more living Americans being held in Southeast Asia.
*This is the most significant mistake made by our government on the POW/MIA issue.
*This was done at a time when we knew we had left men in Laos (and probably in Cambodia and Vietnam).
 
. . .
 Several months ago, I recommended appointing a Presidential negotiator. I urge you to appoint a personal representative to negotiate with the Vietnamese. General Vessey is an excellent choice. He will have my full support.
POW/MIA family members and veterans groups will react positively to this action.
General Vessey must report directly to you -- not to the Secretary of State or the NSC -- if he is to have the status needed to successfully deal with Vietnam.
General Vessey's role cannot be limited to recovering the POW/MIAs and remains. This would make him ineffective with the Vietnamese. His role must be a broad one -- to resolve the outstanding problems with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 
. . .
 During my meetings with the Vietnamese, I carefully postured the conversations so that the MIAs would be found in Laos and returned by the Loatian government. This approach allows Vietnam to avoid criticism for having held the men.
Information regarding economic conditions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia and other concerns expressed by Vietnam's leaders were conveyed to me during the meetings. This may be helpful to General Vessey. Howard Baker has this information, but I am not including it in this letter in an effort to keep it brief.
 
. . .

 
 Best wishes,
 Sincerely,
 Ross Perot
Comments on Meetings With Foreign Minister Thach
 
. . .
 Several times they commented, "We won the war and yet you do not treat us with respect." They feel that we are rude and arrogant in our dealings with them.
They resent the fact that they continue to allow us to come into Vietnam to talk with them about the POW/MIAs, and freely travel throughout their country -- and yet, we do not reciprocate in the U.S. They are subject to a twenty-five mile limit when they visit the UN. (Foreign Minister Thach was particularly sensitive about this subject.)
 
. . .
 "Your government declared your own men dead shortly after the war. How can you expect us to take you seriously about looking for men who may be alive after all these years. Why did your government declare these men dead right after the war?"
The Vietnamese do not trust our government. They pointed out several times that our government has not kept its promises. (It would be possible to get a list of the promises they feel we have not kept.)
The current team negotiating for MIA remains is ineffective. The Vietnamese believe they are minor figures in our government who have no authority, and can only "make demands."
 
. . .
 The economy is in bad shape. People are hungry. The soldiers are hungry and are not always paid. Corruption is a serious problem.
The Vietnamese openly admit this. It appears to be their number one concern.
*They are reading economics books.
*They know they must change their economy, but they don't know what to do.
*They would welcome our help.
*They are most interested in direct assistance from the private sector, feeling that the private sector knows more about business than the government. (I believe this is their primary interest in me.)
They would like to have an economic representative from Vietnam in the U.S., studying how we do business. (This person could be located in either the Swedish or Swiss Embassy, according to them, and would keep a low profile.)
They would like to be able to have teams come from Vietnam to the U.S. to study specific industries. The Vietnamese economic representative would coordinate these activities.
They would like for the U.S. to have economic representatives living in Vietnam. This group could be operated privately, if the government does not wish to become directly involved. The Vietnamese would prefer to have a private group from the business world, because they would have more practical experience than people from government.
The Vietnamese have studied me in detail.
They say conditions in the South are better than in the North.
These people have a great deal of pride, toughness, and willingness to endure. We must be careful when dealing with them not to underestimate them.
 
. . .
 I explained to Thach that it would not be possible for our two countries to work together until the POW/MIA problem was resolved.
*He accepts this, but needs shows of good faith on our part.
 
. ..
 Thach, who is very shrewd, picked up on Laos right away, saying he was willing to help us in every possible way in Laos. He emphasized that the Paris Treaty did not cover U.S. POWs in Laos. He knew exactly what I was doing in focusing on Laos (giving him a graceful out by having the men come out of Laos.)
He indicated a willingness to have U.S. teams in Hanoi, to conduct a full scale search of their country.
He indicated a willingness to help us establish teams in Laos to conduct searches of Laos.
After returning from this trip, I received word through an intermediary that a senior Pathet Lao government minister wants to meet with me to "sell some POWs." I doubt that it resulted from my Hanoi visit. It is a remote possibility, but I will check it out.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Dinkins Is Mastering The Art of the Mayor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Imagine a Mayor who trims $2 billion from New York City's vast bureaucracy in a single year, cobbles together a $500 million surplus despite a recession, moves aggressively against possible police corruption, stands up to the city's labor unions and demonstrates toughness and guile in outwitting state legislators.
David N. Dinkins? Precisely. 
 As recently as a year ago, that would have been unimaginable, as the Mayor and his administration lurched through a series of crises that sometimes seemed to overwhelm them. But over the last six months, and in particular over the last 11 weeks, Mr. Dinkins has engineered a remarkable turnaround, demonstrating on an array of issues that he is seizing control of his government.
"I think we're beginning to find ourselves," a senior aide said last week. "When John Lindsay came in, people said, 'These people can't even find the lights.' I think we're beginning to find the light switches, and things are working a lot better."
 
More Tests to Come
 To be sure, Mr. Dinkins still falters on occasion, and he will be tested many times before facing re-election next year. In just the next few weeks, he faces opposition to his plan for a new incinerator in Brooklyn and battles over new contracts with municipal unions. The city still confronts awesome and perhaps insoluble problems like unemployment, crime and homelessness, and voters may take their frustrations out on the Mayor.
His political opponents, including his likely challenger in the Democratic mayoral primary, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, say they have not been particularly impressed by Mr. Dinkins's recent performance. Mr. Stein contended that the Dinkins administration was in "severe disarray" during its first two years and that the Mayor had now "settled into routine incompetence."
"It's not as bad as it was," Mr. Stein said, "but it's still horrendous."
But there are abundant signs of change, both in the way Mr. Dinkins runs the city and in his results.
 
Triumph Upon Triumph
 The first sign came in January, when the Mayor issued a preliminary budget that won praise from previously skeptical business leaders and fiscal experts for beginning to confront head-on the city's long-term financial problems. In late April, Mr. Dinkins announced the budget surplus. Four weeks later, he wrapped up negotiations with the City Council over the budget for the new fiscal year a month before the deadline, the earliest such agreement in memory.
Around the same time, Mr. Dinkins received credit for the calm that prevailed in New York while Los Angeles and other cities exploded after the verdict in the Rodney G. King beating trial.
And two weeks ago, he surprised many people when he moved quickly and decisively after news reports of possibly widespread corruption in the Police Department.
Mr. Dinkins, a cautious, deliberative man who has been faulted often for responding too slowly and too dispassionately to events, wasted little time in announcing that he would set up an independent panel to investigate the charges. He also made public a plan to create an all-civilian board to review complaints of police brutality. In both cases, he overruled Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown.
 
Tactical Maneuvers
 Perhaps the most symbolic manifestation of the Mayor's newly assertive style came last week, when the Mayor used a bizarre fiscal gambit to outmaneuver several state lawmakers who were trying to place stricter legislative controls on a major expansion of the city's police force.
Mr. Dinkins had sought to save $20 million over the next year by postponing the start of training for 2,100 new police officers until the new fiscal year. He needed permission from the Legislature to postpone the starting date, and assumed that approval would be granted as a courtesy. Instead, he found himself under pressure from lawmakers who tried to withhold permission until the Mayor agreed to their demands.
Among the earlier criticisms of Mr. Dinkins was that he had not learned how to lobby the Legislature effectively. This time, he discarded his customary technique -- quietly offering reasoned arguments in the hope that his position would prevail on its merits -- for the stealth of a political in-fighter.
He ordered the police recruits to report for duty at 11:59:59 P.M. on Tuesday, the final second of the fiscal year. That enabled him to meet the letter of the law, which required the new officers to report during the fiscal year that ended Tuesday, and still avoid having to make $20 million in pension contributions for the recruits over the next year.
 
Not Taking It Anymore
 The gimmick, which worked because the recruits received no salary in the 1992 fiscal year, antagonized some state lawmakers. But it also sent them a powerful message: that the Mayor was tired of being pushed around and was willing to resort to extraordinary means to protect the city's sovereignty.
"You have to have a little bit of flair, to show that you can give as good as you can get, and he had never demonstrated that before," a senior city elected official said.
The string of successes contrasts vividly with the week in October 1990 that has long been emblematic of the administration at its nadir. Over just a few days, the Mayor reached a labor settlement with the city's teachers that was widely criticized as too expensive, announced a $1.8 billion program to add thousands of new police officers and then began talking about laying off as many as 15,000 other city workers.
Mr. Dinkins has struggled for nearly two years to overcome the sense of disarray conveyed that week. Now he and his aides believe they have finally rounded a critical corner.
"The wind's at our back," First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel boasted last week.
 
Practice and a Little Luck
 The Mayor's aides offered several reasons for the turnaround: practice (it takes time, they said, to master the complexities of the $30 billion-a-year city government), good fortune and an evolution in the Mayor himself.
Several advisers said that Mr. Dinkins had been more intense and focused since last fall. Some speculated that the Mayor finally felt really comfortable in his job, and decided with conviction that he wanted to win re-election.
Many advisers also said that Mr. Dinkins had become more open to different strategies to obtain his goals. A year ago, they said, he probably would not have approved the police-class gambit.
Mr. Steisel and Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins's chief political adviser, whose relationship has sometimes been said to be problematic now say they and other senior aides are working together more smoothly.
Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that "we're certainly more adept now than we were on Jan. 1, 1990," when he took office.
 
Ratings on the Rise
 It remains uncertain what political dividends the Mayor will yield from his managerial turnaround. Two recent polls, one conducted for a municipal union and another for New York Newsday, showed a sizable jump in Mr. Dinkins's favorable ratings, which had dropped sharply. But the polls also showed that the Mayor continued to suffer high unfavorable ratings, and Mr. Stein argued that it was hard for a politician to counteract such negative impressions.
But many politicians said the Mayor could only be helped in the long run if New Yorkers see him grappling successfully with the budget, the police and other significant matters.
"All of his actions in the last few weeks suggest a heightened capacity to respond swiftly and surely to whatever events the day brings," said Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, a longtime Dinkins ally. "In the first two years of his administration, there were fewer swift moves and fewer tough decisions."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Golden, Gifted and Confused About Her Future

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSERO KRUGLOYE, Russia

 BODY:
Svetlana Boginskaya, one of the world's best gymnasts for a very long time now, is having a case of the 19-year-old jitters.
It's not just the approaching Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, which she has said will be her last. And it's not so much the usual confusion, in the debris of the former Soviet Union, about where her loyalties lie. Nor the declining standards of food provided for the Commonwealth of Independent States' best gymnasts, who live at this permanent but deteriorating training center at Osero Krugloye, or Round Lake, in the pretty forests an hour's drive north of Moscow's grime.
Her confusion is really about growing up, and what to do with her life when her already extraordinary career as another of the great pixie gymnasts is over, as it must be, and quite soon.
 
Brilliant but Unsure
 Like Steffi Graf and other tennis stars before her, whose machinelike nervelessness began to collapse with the onslaught of young adulthood, Boginskaya sometimes wonders whether she's any good at anything at all. It is quite an unsettling thought for a gymnast whose brilliance has been indisputable since she first became all-around winner at the 1989 world championships,
"I try not to think about Barcelona," she said, playing with two thin silver necklaces and touching a line of earrings pierced into one ear. "I try not to think it's the Olympics, but that it's just another competition." She paused, pulling back her hair. "The more you think about it," she said finally, "you just get more nervous."
 
No Zmeskal Rivalry
 Although much has been made of her rivalry with the younger American star, Kim Zmeskal, 16, who defeated her in April at the world championships in Paris, Boginskaya says she feels "absolutely neutral" toward her competitors. At the 1991 world championships in Indianapolis, Boginskaya barely lost because of what many believed to have been the overenthusiasm of American judges. Asked about Indianapolis, Boginskaya began to cry, but only for a moment. Brushing a tear away and trying to hide it, she said: "Well, it's all in the past."
She stopped again, then said: "Of course, I want to be the best. I've always been that way."
Fidgeting in her pink trousers, rolled up above her molded calves, she said softly: "It may seem strange, but mostly I want to take the upper hand over myself. I feel some uncertainty, and I tell myself sometimes I can't do anything the way I want to do it, and feel I'm incapable of anything."
 
'Repetition and Repetition'
 She knows it's an absurd feeling, she said, because she's been a world champion for so long. "But the last year and a half have not been so successful for me," she said. "I'm growing older, and it becomes harder for me to train the same way as before. When I was younger I did many of the elements easier than now, and sometimes I make errors. And of course, when I was younger, we studied new aspects all the time. Now it's more routine work for me; it's repetition and repetition, which is of course less interesting."
It's a little strange to hear such thoughts from someone so girlish and lithe, seeming almost to disappear inside her fashionably loose trousers and tank top, but Boginskaya knows she must plan for her future after sports, and she knows a good show in the Olympics may be crucial to her marketability.
"In the future," she said, "maybe I'll leave for professional sport, or maybe work as a choreographer, or in advertisements for sports clothes. At least that's my plan so far." She said she's already had some proposals from manufacturers.
 
Competing for Themselves
 The Olympics itself, for the last "unified team" the former Soviet Union is ever likely to field, now provides a different sort of motivation than in the past. If previous Soviet teams were told to win for "progressive socialism" as much as for their motherland, now the athletes know that they are also competing for their careers in a tough, private marketplace.
"Before the Seoul Olympics," Boguinskaya said of the 1988 Games, in which she won the gold medal in the vault and the bronze in the all-around, "we were told we have to protect the honor of the motherland, that you perform not only for yourself, but you display the image of the Soviet Union and socialism. Now they don't say things like this, but we know ourselves what we want."
And that is? "We want to win the Olympics," she said. "There can be no minimum performance there."
 
Shows and Endorsements
 The chief coach of the women's gymnastic team, Aleksandr S. Aleksandrov, is blunter. "These girls are only teen-agers, but they understand their future depends on their performance at the Olympics," he said. "Many will leave the sport afterward, and now that it's easier to leave the country, or come and go, they can take part in various professional shows or sponsorships."
Boginskaya says she's friendly enough with her fellow gymnasts, but they're younger, "and I can't be frank with them." That's why, she said, "I mostly talk with the boys' team. They're mostly the same age, and more interesting for me." Does she have a boyfriend? Blushing, she pushed aside her hair. "Well, I have many friends who are boys, but I can't say one is my boyfriend."
She says she feels closer to the young women who were her teammates, but who now have left gymnastics to make their lives in this complicated, dead empire undergoing economic difficulty and reform.
"The girls are practically all married now and many have children," she said. "They write me in their letters, 'Sveta, enough of this gymnastics! Live a normal life!' But I think it's difficult now to live a normal life, because our country is not in a normal situation."
Aleksandrov thinks Boginskaya has "good prospects" in Barcelona in the vault, the beam (her favorite) and maybe in the all-around. As a team, he said, "our plan is three gold medals, a silver and a bronze," but he says there is more competition this year than in 1988.
As for Zmeskal, Aleksandrov says he doesn't want to offend her, "but usually each world champion brings something new, some new beauty or complexity, and I didn't see anything new in her." Frankly, he said, "I like Shannon Miller more. She has a good program that meets today's demands, at least as we see them."
Aleksandrov said he thought that some of the American gymnasts emphasize their leaping and dancing ability at the expense of mastering the sport's technical points.
Boginskaya is wistful for life, having hardly lived an ordinary one. Her father, a builder, and her mother, a housewife, are from Minsk, in Belarus. Boginskaya started in gymnastics at the age of 7, pushed by her parents. "It was boring for me at home," she said. "So in the first years of school, when a lady coach came and asked who wanted to go into gymnastics, I agreed. I wasn't much of a gymnastics fan then, but my parents said they'd better send me to some sports group, because I wasn't obedient at home and didn't listen to them."
Now, of course, her parents are proud, but she sees little of them. For more than half her life, since the age of 10, Boginskaya has been coming here to the Olympics training camp at Osero Krugloye, at first for 10 days a year, and then for longer and longer periods. "You could say I've spent most of my life here," she said.
Not that the life is bad amid the forests. There is a dormitory for the athletes, excellent facilities, no lines for food and few worries. But now, of course, with the end of large state subsidies, maintenance is lacking, the grass is growing long and the paint is peeling. And both Boginskaya and her coach agree the food is worse, with less dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables.
Will she go back to Minsk when her career is finished? "Maybe," she said. "I just don't know what will happen. So far I only know gymnastics."
Here she gave a big, grown-up sigh and shrugged. "Of course I want to do well," she said. "But life is very complicated, and in the end, you must give in to it."

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Bubble Is Going to Burst

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bush Calls on Fed for Another Drop in Interest Rates" (front page, June 24) makes me sad. This overuse of monetarism is unsound. The excessive use of monetary theory interferes with the more rational play of supply and demand in the bond market. Keith Trauner rang the bell in an article in Barron's last April 13, stating: "Never in my experience has the price of a commodity doubled in a time where its supply has quintupled." The flaw in the Nicholas Brady-Alan Greenspan bond scheme will be that the law of supply and demand will eventually catch them.
One of the dangerous consequences of this bond scheme is the redistribution of wealth taking place on Wall Street. To keep the Bush-Brady bond scheme greased, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has continually had to lower interest rates.
This continual lowering of interest rates has pushed the public out of certificates of deposit to seek higher returns. This has caused excessive evaluation in the stock market. The public is being fleeced.
This will only serve to multiply the social dislocations when the bubble bursts. President Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, is playing stooge for the Stock Exchange.
The Federal Reserve has lowered the interest rate more than 20 times since 1989. Unfortunately, gross debt keeps increasing.
The things the Bush Treasury has done to sustain this hoax go beyond the absurd. The Treasury postpones borrowing. It postpone taking over savings and loan institutions. It postpones the marking to market of bank assets. Withholding schedules have been changed, veteran benefits accelerated. The breakdown of Treasury refunding has been changed (lowering the 30-year offering).
Now, President Bush calls for lower interest rates to keep this bank-fed Treasury bond scheme going. He's over his head. The longer it takes the public to realize it, the further in the hole we get. We've already reached the point of social dislocations. What next? Anarchy?

HEADLINE: More Thoughts on the S.E.C. and Mutual Funds . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Congratulations to Barry Guthary for his insightful analysis of the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed rules to govern mutual funds ("The S.E.C. Misses on Mutual Funds," June 14). Having both sold and bought mutual funds (before my retirement), I agree with every point he makes -- particularly his emphasis on small investors. The bulk of people likely to own stock are likely to do so through some kind of mutual fund, including variable annuities. A clearer and more comprehensive prospectus would aid greatly in choosing among the hundreds of funds now available. 
 I would add only one issue to those raised by Mr. Guthary: the details, including past payout records, of variable annuities sold by insurance companies. It's well-nigh impossible for the small investor to find out the various fees assessed by the various companies; only a few are able to inform would-be purchasers of their payout records and thus enable the individual to make a reasonably informed judgment as to likely future payout. As life expectancy increases and inflation continues to be a permanent part of contemporary life, the variable annuity is growing in popularity for retirement income. The S.E.C. has extended its jurisdiction over this part of the insurance industry and demands standard prospectuses for each variable annuity, to which all of Mr. Guthary's criticisms should also apply.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
The Ultimate Hauling Machine?

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
FIRST, a brief quiz on today's topic, which is BMW. The answers will be woven skillfully into the text. Unless I forget.
1. What do BMW's initials stand for? 
 2. What major announcement did the company make last week?
3. What is the significance of the company's round emblem?
4. Why is the emblem blue and white?
5. What do you do if you are a BMW fan, can afford only one car but need room for kids, dogs, tents and skis?
Taking the last question first, you just dig down into your jeans for $38,600 and trot over to the dealer for the latest offering in BMW's midlevel 5-Series, which is really what this is all about.
The vehicle is called the "Touring," a neatly-done multi-purpose version of the 525i sport sedan and the first station wagon ever to be imported by BMW of North America.
The Touring is not the first to be made by Bayerische Motoren Werke, however. (And see how easy this is?) That honor went to a three-door hatchback version of the "02" series, and the vehicle was sold in Europe from 1971 through 1974. It was offered again in '87 and continues in Europe today as a five-door wagon in the 3-series.
As a 525i, the company says, the wagon may be more appropriate in size for the American market, and it is built on the same platform as the sedan. Like the sedan, too, the Touring is powered by a 2.5-liter in-line six that was new for '91.
It will, of course, be built in Germany, unlike a new model planned for 1995. That car, speculated to be a convertible or roadster version of the 3-Series, will roll off the line in Greer, S.C., site of the $300-million American assembly plant that was announced by BMW last week.
For now, though, the four-door wagon is the newest of the new, and its size means that it accommodates five adults and that it can carry as much as 51 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seat folded down. With the seat up, a removable window-shade arrangement covers the area, which offers about 16 cubic feet of space.
The seat itself is split 60-40 so that part of it can be folded and one or two people can still get back there next to a lengthened cargo bed. And, this being a BMW, the cargo floor is fancy, carpeted in velour and replete with recessed tie-downs.
The test car was painted a light metallic blue, and its lines were at least as pleasing as those of the sedan, although the wagon configuration impinges on aerodynamic figures.
All the same, the vehicle shares much with the sedan, including most of its dimensions, and from the windshield forward, the sedan and wagon are identical. The wagon, however, has a slightly higher roof, with built-in rails for the multifunction rack system that is available as an option.
At the rear, there is a one-piece tailgate -- but a tailgate with a difference. One of two separate latches opens the gate to its 90-degree upward position. The other opens only the rear window, allowing easy loading of smaller objects. In the gate's fully open position, two more latches let down a beautifully finished toolkit that includes wrenches, screwdrivers and such.
Like the hatch, the wagon's immense sunroof is unique and works in more than the usual tilt-or-slide ways. It consists of two panels, front and rear, and various pushes of its pair of operating buttons provide tip-up ventilation or open-air driving. The panels can be opened fully over either front or rear seat or can be slid together for a partial opening over both.
As for other body parts, the hood opens from the rear to expose a very civilized compartment under whose accoustically padded roof resides the 189-horsepower engine, mounted in north-south fashion and driving the rear wheels through a standard four-speed automatic transmission.
Performance is good if not spectacular, and zero-to-60 figures are in the 10.5-second range, with an electronically limited top speed of 128 miles an hour. The engine's 10:1 compression ratio means that the 21-gallon tank needs premium unleaded fuel, but the economy rating is reasonable at 17, city, and 25, highway.
Behind the four-spoked leather wheel, you face an instrument panel that is dominated by a 7,000-r.p.m. tach and a pleasantly fraudulent 160-m.p.h. speedometer. The wheel, of course, has an air bag in its hub, and antilock brakes are standard, just to round out the safety measures.
Heavy-duty leatherette is standard in the car, although the tester's real leather can be had at a price. The seats, like the rest of the Touring, are stiffly supportive in the Germanic mode, and other comforts are plentiful. Power equipment, for instance, extends to a telescoping wheel, and the driver information center will tell you everything but your anniversary.
The back windows go all the way down, a surprise in a vehicle of moderate size, and audiophiles will be more than happy with the 10-speaker sound system, which features tweeters in the front window posts and giant woofers in the rear ceiling.
Storage abounds, just to reinforce the notion that this is a utility vehicle that has been seriously considered by its designers. Among other things, the glovebox is a cavern, there are bins in the console, and a toll-change holder is mounted atop the map pocket in the driver's door.
Then let's see . . . yes, I did forget a couple of things.
You knew, of course, that the blue and white of the BMW emblem were Bavaria's official colors. But the emblem itself has its roots in BMW's history as a manufacturer of airplanes. It is an artist's conception of a spinning propeller viewed from the front.
And I'll give you a bonus that you are unlikely to find anywhere else. The next time somebody asks, you will know that the roof of the newest Bimmer has a load limit of 220 pounds.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Monroe

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
"WE'RE a rural town trying to be suburban," said Kenneth S. Heitzke, First Selectman of the Town of Monroe, in the northern hills of Connecticut's Fairfield County.
"It's not an Easton or a Weston," said Gary L. Sippin, president of the Chamber of Commerce, whose grandfather came from Czarist Russia and bought a farm in Monroe in 1910. "It's middle-class." 
 Lois and Robert Mitchell, who "didn't want a rarefied atmosphere," bought a new colonial on two acres on Fan Hill Road in 1988, paying in the low $300,000's. "Being a fairly young family," said Mrs. Mitchell, who grew up in Darien, "we had to watch our pennies."
Her husband is with a law firm in Bridgeport, 20 minutes away.
What is now Monroe was a northern wilderness area of Stratford in the 1600's that became the separate parish of New Stratford in 1762; it became part of the town of Huntington in 1789. Settlers grew grains, corn and flax and raised cattle and sheep.
The town was incorporated in 1823 and named for the President at the time, James Monroe, basically because "it was the 'era of good feeling,' " according to Edward Nichols Coffey, the town historian. The villages of Stevenson, Stepney and East Village and the center district became part of the town in 1823 and still remain distinct sections. As street names attest, there were hat shops on Hattertown Road, a tannery on Old Tannery Road, a copper smelter near Copper Mill Brook and a scythe and axe blade factory on Hammertown Road. There were also some pick-and-shovel mines for bismuth, limestone and copper until the mid-1800's.
After the Civil War the town's economy lagged behind industrial centers like Bridgeport, local industry faded and people moved elsewhere for their livelihoods.
New Yorkers summered there in the late 1800's. By the early 1900's, Eastern European immigrants, among them several Jewish families, began buying abandoned farms, but it was not until the 40's that the population reached 1,728. By 1950, the town's first housing boom was under way and population continued to rise, getting another boost during the corporate shift to the suburbs in the 70's.
Today Monroe has mainly one- to three-acre zoning and no sewers. Available on a quarter acre along Cottage Street is a three-bedroom remodeled ranch for $124,000. In May, an 11-year-old, three-bedroom colonial on half an acre on Settlers Farm Road sold for $252,500. And a four-year-old, four-bedroom colonial on Georges Lane, with a heated pool and 28- by 12-foot kitchen, sold last week for $319,000.
At the high end is Hattertown Woods, a subdivision with custom-built contemporary colonials on 34 lots. . A nine-room house, with four bedrooms and three fireplaces, being built on two acres there now, is priced at $475,900.
The only two condominiums in town are the 319-unit Northbrook and the 160-unit Hills of Monroe. The latter also has 16 one-family homes.
"Monroe has a very good school system with a high level of services at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer," said Schools Superintendent Dr. Norman Michaud.
An average of 82 percent of seniors at Masuk High School went on to higher education in the last three years. The school offers eight college courses through the University of Connecticut and 48 extracurricular clubs. Enrollment, now 932, is expected to reach 1,100 within five years.
ABUTTING a nature trail is the 6-8 Chalk Hill Middle School, with 696 students. Seventh graders can take exploratory French and Spanish, and troubled seventh graders are offered mentoring. The school rewards 100 percent attendence and high honors with a year-end trip. This year, 100 qualified for a ride up the Connecticut River in the Tom Sawyer riverboat.
The oldest of the three elementary schools, built as a W.P.A. project in 1935, is Monroe Elementary School, with 392 children. The others are Fawn Hollow, with 678 pupils, and Stepney, with 516. The Monroe school was damaged by fire in 1982 and rebuilt. Today it has a wing for multi-handicapped youngsters. It also has 27 computers and a Gifted and Talented Dimensions program in Grades 4 and 5.
Fawn Hollow sets aside a classroom for Kindertime, a morning and afternoon supplementary kindergarten program for up to 21 children who spend the other half of their day in any of the local schools. It is run by the local Lakewood-Trumbull Y.M.C.A., which charges $180 a month.
Stepney has a schoolwide reading program in which students clocked-in more than 2 million minutes of reading in the just-ended school year.
There are several nursery schools in town run by local churches. The pre-k-8 Roman Catholic St. Jude School has 240 pupils and charges $1,570 a year for regional parishoners, $1,855 for others.
The 43,000-volume Monroe Public Library, in the municipal complex, is open six days a week and has four story hours a week for 3- and 4-year-olds.
Although Routes 111 and 25 are dotted with 10 commercial strips, residents do department-store shopping at the Trumbull or Danbury Fair malls and rely on neighboring towns for movies.
There is no shortage of restaurants. Among the dozen are Bailey's with a continental menu; the Smithy, whose specialty is seafood and sirloin; Roberto's and Sal's Home Pizza Restaurant, and Land Ding, offering Chinese food.Bill's Drive-in offers a bit of 50's nostalgia on Friday Classic Nights, 6 to 10 P.M., from mid-May to mid-October, when dozens of vintage cars, mainly 50's models, and families gather in its parking lot.
Popular yearly events are the Memorial Day Parade; Spirit Week, early inJune,, which features an art show and strawberry festival and the Firemen's Carnival next Wednesday through Saturday, with rides and food sponsored by the Monroe Volunteer Fire Department, one of the three units with 200 volunteers and six stations. A 75th-anniversary celebration will be held next month for the Stepney Volunteer Fire Company No. 1.
The town has a wealth of outdoor recreational facilities, but no beach. But on Memorial Day, the town opened Great Hollow Lake. It is a $900,000, 16-acre manmade lake with a sandy patch at the shore in the 309-acre William E. Wolfe Park. The park also offers, for a yearly or daily fee, eight tennis courts (four lighted) and an outdoor pool. There also are two basketball courts, four baseball diamonds, hiking trails and picnic areas.
Six Sunday evening concerts are being held at the park this summer, and the new gazebo on the Monroe Town Green will be the site of other events. On an acre of land in the park, starting Oct. 7, parents and children will build a playground, for which they are raising $83,000.
FROM high points of the 135-acre Webb Mountain Park, vistors may enjoy views of the Housatonic River and the hills of Oxford. The park has seven miles of hiking trails and two large stands of blue and white spruces. There also are trails, reblazed in 1976, in the 75-acre Lane's Mines Park. Adjacent to the park is the Chalk Hill Nature Trail, developed by the Junior Women's Club of Monroe in 1980. It has numbered posts corresponding to a guidebook available in the town library. Any resident can fish, canoe or go motorboating in Lake Zoar, a manmade lake created in the 1960's.
Residents can also use Penfield Beach in Fairfield for $75 a season or Seaside Beach in Bridgeport for $30 a season.
Whitney Farm Golf Course, once the site of stables used for wintering horses, now offers 18 holes, a clubhouse and restaurant in a stone barn. The 17-acre Cricker Brook Farms Riding Academy has 30 stalls and offers private and group riding lessons. There are also an indoor shooting range at Firearms Training, run by Tim McCarthy, and a variety of activities at the local Y.
Summing up the town's attractions, Stephan H. Price said "it has a lot of lakes, a lot of lawns, a lot of brooks, and is right between New York and Hartford." Mr Price, who runs Steve Price Tree Experts, moved to Monroe 17 years ago from Stratford and found the outdoor life it afforded just what he wanted.

HEADLINE: Peru Leader's Problems Ease Abroad, but Mount at Home

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 4

 BODY:
Two months after President Alberto K. Fujimori seized dictatorial powers in South America's most unstable nation, a promise to elect and install a new Congress within six months is rapidly easing Peru's international isolation.
 But Maoist guerrilla violence and rampant cocaine trafficking, two of the problems Mr. Fujimori cited to justify his suspension of Congress and the courts, have barely been touched by the April 5 crackdown. 
In June, Mr. Fujimori announced a date for elections and in return saw a thaw in the aid that was frozen when he seized power.
 In the same month, Shining Path guerrillas detonated more than a dozen car bombs, and the Government imposed a curfew on late-night and early-morning car traffic here.
 
50 Dead in Prison Fighting
 The bombing wave was the Maoists' response to the closing of their underground newspaper by the Government and its attack on guerrilla-controlled jail blocks here. In the prison fighting, 50 guerrillas and policemen died.
 Beyond the curfew, the President decreed that convicted terrorists would face life sentences and that minors aged 15 and over accused of terrorist acts would be prosecuted as adults. In addition, he called for a national debate on restoring the death penalty in Peru.
Hard-line measures gained popularity here as the Shining Path shifted the focus of its terror in the last two years from distant Andean villages to this coastal capital, home to a third of all Peruvians.
 Over the last 18 months, support among Lima residents for the execution of terrorists has risen from 47 percent to 67 percent, according to polls conducted by Apoyo, Peru's most respected polling organization.
 
Drug Flights Resume
 In the drug war, air shipments of coca, Peru's largest export, were disrupted for six months when the United States stationed two radar units, operated by 45 American technicians, in northern Peru. But both units were withdrawn when Peruvian jets on April 24 fired on an American reconnaissance plane and a crewman was killed.
 Another American died on June 20 when an American helicopter crashed near Santa Lucia, a drug-fighting base in a coca-growing jungle valley.
 In May, small planes loaded with semirefined cocaine resumed direct daytime flights from Peru's coca-growing areas to cocaine laboratories in Colombia. In June, the Peruvian Air Force took control of two municipal airstrips in Peru's "coca basket." But drug pilots took to landing on secret strips or on straight stretches of paved road.
 Despite the lack of progress in fighting drugs and terrorism, Mr. Fujimori is regaining some of the international support he lost in April.
 
November Elections Set
 Few Peruvians and virtually no foreign governments objected when the President closed Peruvian courts for a thorough overhaul. According to public opinion surveys, Peruvians overwhelmingly believed that judges sold verdicts and, caving in to death threats, released guerrillas from jail.
 The shuttering of the Congress, however, caused most Western countries to suspend economic aid to Peru and provoked Panama and Venezuela to suspend diplomatic relations with Peru.
 "We would welcome a fairly elected, constitutional Congress," a senior American official here said this week when asked what was the major obstacle to a return to normal relations between the United States and Peru.
 In June, President Fujimori took a major step in that direction by setting elections for a Congress for Nov. 22. The 80-member Congress will have powers to legislate, to investigate the executive branch, and to amend the Constitution.
 
Loans Are Unfrozen
 The United States, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank acknowledged the move by partly unfreezing loan and aid programs. As an incentive for more democratization, the United States has kept $150 million in aid frozen.
 Now debate revolves around the election process.
 Opposition politicians charge that Mr. Fujimori wants to bend election rules and gerrymander the nation into 80 election districts to guarantee a rubber-stamp assembly.
 In response, Mr. Fujimori says he refuses to return to business as usual: a Congress paralyzed by interparty squabbles and dominated by many of the same faces who have dominated politics here since the 1960's.
 "As a statesman, he is a failure," Fernando Belaunde Terry, a former President of Peru, said of Mr. Fujimori. "Cambio 90 is nothing," he added dismissively of the President's political party.
 
Fujimori's Nightmare
 One fear haunts Mr. Fujimori as he juggles competing desires for an internationally acceptable election and for a Congress that he can control until his mandate expires in July 1995.
 An opposition-controlled Congress could exact vengeance on the President by removing him from office on charges of violating Peru's 1979 Constitution.
 "It's unlikely, but it's Fujimori's nightmare," said Alfredo Torres Guzman, president of Apoyo.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Westchester and Connecticut;
In New Haven, a Struggle for Recovery

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THOUGH blessed with some of the state's best legitimate theaters and restaurants, a felicitous green flanked by vintage New England churches and the prestige of Yale University, New Haven is still plagued by persistent crime, blighted neighborhoods and crushing taxes.
 Some stalled real estate projects are recovering from the recession and others are being born, but progress is spotty and tentative, and the city, like many others in Connecticut, is rattled by the results of a 1991 property revaluation. 
We hadn't had one since 1978," said Gerald Sachs, the assessor. "Now that there are state penalties for delays, we've had to do one, and the average assessment is more than two and half times higher. In some cases, it quadrupled."
 The office vacancy rate, says John Nussbaum of CB Commercial real estate brokers, is 30 percent. "New Haven has been unable to attract companies from outside," he said, "so local businesses hopscotch from old buildings to newer ones, doing nothing to increase the absorption of space and creating a wasteland of empty old buildings."
 "We have terrible problems that we are trying to address," said Sal Brancati, the city's Director of Economic Development. "We take each situation individually, and we consider tax abatements according to certain criteria. Manufacturing companies and companies with at least 100 employes come first."
 Macy's is a noteworthy example. Its downtown New Haven store was one of 10 nationwide scheduled to close, until city officials offered a package of incentives.
 The incentives include $12 million grants from the city and state for improving the deteriorated 1,285-space parking garage; a city tax freeze at the 1991 level that will save $100,000 a year and a reduced energy bill from the United Illuminating Company.
 The store will be a key element in a proposed 1.3-million-square-foot shopping mall that would extend from the Macy's site on Church Street to a platform over Route 34.
 Five anchor stores and 4,000 parking spaces are planned by the Taubman Company of Bloomfield, Mich., which has entered into an agreement with the city to build the mall at an estimated cost of up to $635 million. A 1998 opening is anticipated.
 The complex would be financed under recent legislation that lets the state issue bonds based on a project's ability to raise a like amount in sales tax revenues over a 25-year period. "We hope to have state financing approval by the end of July," said Mr. Brancati, noting that there are other obstacles.
 Standing between Macy's and Route 34 is the vacant, deteriorating Malley's department store, bought by Mordecai Litkis, a New York developer who has been unable to recycle it. It is one of several private properties in the mall's path that must be acquired by negotiation or condemnation. In addition, the city must get air rights over Route 34 from the state, and hold public hearings on the project.
 "A groundswell of negative public opinion could kill it," said Mr. Brancati, adding that some opposition has surfaced but that "once people understand what the mall means to the city I believe they will get on board."
 ANOTHER kind of criticism was leveled at a new factory begun by U.S. Repeating Arms Company, formerly Winchester Arms Company, in a city where random gunplay recently led to the shooting of a child on a school bus. The company responded by saying it produces only sport rifles and shotguns, not handguns.
 In New Haven since the 1850's, Winchester planned to move but scrapped the idea when city, state and Federal grants and tax abatements and subsidies from the OIin Corporation, United Illuminating and Yale University were offered. Ground was broken in June on the 350,000-square-foot factory at the edge of the Yale campus. An opening of the first phase is scheduled for next summer.
 Last month, a $30 million mixed-use project called Audubon Court was rescued from receivership by the Knights of Columbus for $6.3 million cash. Mr. Nussbaum arranged the sale, including a 100,000-square-foot office building, almost 20,000 square feet of retail space and a 290-car garage.
 "The Knights' financial stability will be an important factor for prospective tenants," said Robert Motley, CB Commercial's leasing agent. Office rents are around $19 a foot, down from $24. Retail rents have not been determined.
 The project's 28 unsold residential condominium units out of a total of 61 were not part of the deal and are being sold for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by the Beazley Real Estate Company. Prices range from $139,500 for one bedroom with one bath, to $159,900 for 2 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths and fireplace. All units are air-conditioned, have separate dining rooms, all appliances, and are ranged around a handsomely landscaped private court.
 Surrounded by an enclave of art schools, galleries and performing arts organizations, Audubon Court was completed in 1988 by the Lawrence Development Company of Bronxville, N.Y., on land owned by the New Haven Arts Council. It fills a once-vacant lot cleared during urban renewal.
 Condominiums and commercial space were being absorbed slowly through 1989, until the major tenant and mortgage holder, Connecticut Bank and Trust, was taken over by Fleet Bank and moved out. The project was then foreclosed.
 A few blocks from Audubon Court is Century Tower on Church Street, designed by Cesar Pelli and opened two years ago. Its 282,000 square feet are more than half leased, but at rentals far lower than anticipated.
 GOVERNMENT CENTER overlooking the green is another competitor, begun more than 10 years ago and built around the preserved facade of the 19th-century City Hall designed by Henry Austin. The developer is David Chase of Hartford, who started the project in 1981. It was later reduced by about 100,000 square feet to 425,000 square feet because of financial problems and it was completed in 1990. Last month, United Illuminating leased half the space.
 As for other projects, the state is paying $23 million to rebuild the faulty 2,400 space garage over the Coliseum sports arena, and Yale has contributed $10 million toward the redevelopment of Ninth Square, a downtown commercial block. But real estate professionals worry that high taxes and heavy expenditures for social problems will keep prospective tenants at bay and drive existing ones elsewhere. "A few have gone already, but it's not an exodus yet," said Mr. Motley.

HEADLINE: On the Street: Drug Gangs Thrive as Arsenals Expand

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
ON a blustery blue-sky day in New Haven recently, a 21-year-old drug boss stood on a street corner and chewed on a meatball sub while praying that it wouldn't rain.
"I guess it really doesn't matter," said the man, as he licked tomato sauce from his fingers. "I've been in this business long enough to know that if people want dope they'll find a way to buy it even if the snow is six feet high." 
 Soon after, a woman with glassy eyes walked up from a nearby house and asked the man's partner for some p-dope, or heroin, that came in a small yellow packet with the words "mad dog" stamped on the front; it sold for $20 and the transaction took about five seconds.
The drug boss said that he employed 17 lieutenants who sold drugs in key spots of the city and that they made up to $15,000 a day. "We only net around $500 apiece of that though," said the man, adding that he had been arrested several times for selling drugs and was currently out on bond on a murder charge.
Because the corner where he stood was considered one of the profitable drug outlets in the city, he said, his gang armed themselves with handguns and kept an arsenal that included two M-16's and an AK-47, just in case things got too hot. He said he got the assault weapons from a man who exchanged them for drugs and $450.
 
Better Organized, Better Armed
 "We pioneered this corner," said the man who was interviewed days before a 6-year-old boy was critically wounded by a gun shot after the schoolbus in which he rode was caught in a gang-related shootout on nearby Frank Street.
"And nobody's going to take it away from us."
As the drug trade maintains a stranglehold in city neighborhoods, street gangs that profit from the sale of narcotics have become better organized and better armed. Federal and local law enforcement officials said that over the last 10 years, many gangs have survived and prospered and some have crossed the threshold into organized criminal groups that have expanded their operations statewide.
The surge in gang activities has spurred an epidemic of gun violence in urban neighborhoods over the last couple of years. Recent shootings include incidents in New Haven where two children were wounded by stray bullets and a gang shootout in a Meriden housing project where children and their parents were gathered.
In response to the increase of drug gang violence in Connecticut, Federal agents are working closely with state and local police to curtail gang activity by surveilling and arresting more gang leaders and their weapon suppliers.
While the Connecticut General Assembly last week was debating gun-control measures intended to stem the flow of guns into the hands of minors, the agents said they were taking advantage of Federal gun control laws passed during the mid-1980's that have expanded their jurisdiction and given them more leverage to arrest violent criminals.
Convictions under the Federal statutes are also likely to result in harsher prison terms for offenders, which may greatly reduce the incidents of gang violence and discourage teen-agers from joining gangs, the officials said.
Though the bulk of the drug business is made up of small-time dealers who act on their own, law enforcement officials said, since the mid-1980's more and more ethnic gangs in Connecticut have emerged, like Los Solidos, based in Hartford; the Rats and the Cats, two Jamaican gangs based in Bridgeport, and the Latin Kings, whose members have surfaced throughout the state.
Other new gangs include those styled after or tied to California organizations, the Crips and the Bloods, which are both under Federal investigation for the looting of 3,000 firearms during the riots in Los Angeles in April.
While the ethnic gangs may require an oath of loyalty, police officials characterize the nonsectarian gangs as loosely organized business organizations that are not allied to any particular leadership beyond the local level. Their common thread, officials said, are drugs and violence.
 
Market 'Made Them Richer'
 "The drug market hasn't made these guys rich and powerful yet, but it's made them richer and given them ready cash to purchase better weapons and gain more influence," said Jack Killorin, the director of public information for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Washington, D.C., who headed the Hartford office during the late 1980's. "And their way of doing business is quite terrible. Remember, these are the people that gave us the drive-by shooting."
Though there are no precise statistics on the number of gang members or gang-related crimes in the state, police officials said that they were tracing an increasing number of assaults and homicides to gang members. While most of the offenses are drug related, they said, a growing number of incidents involve conflicts between members of the same gang. The police attributed the rise in drug-gang membership to the decline in the economy and an increasing array of social and psychological problems faced by young people growing up in urban areas.
"The system has collapsed," said Allan MacDonald, the resident agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in New Haven. "Nowadays it just makes good economic sense to deal drugs."
Mr. MacDonald said many drug gangs obtained weapons through drug users who stole the guns from homeowners, drug shops or firearms factories, or through "straw purchasers," people with clean criminal records who buy guns for themselves, then resell them to dealers.
As a result of investigations by the local police and by Federal firearms agents, Charles Hubbard, a New Haven resident, was sentenced in January to 17 months in Federal prison for reselling 130 legally bought guns that were later sold to gangsters.
And earlier this year, agents arrested Robert and Robin Carroll, the owners of a Fairfield gun shop. The couple has since been indicted on charges of knowingly selling 450 guns to a straw purchaser, Felix DeValle, and are awaiting trial. Mr. DeValle has been in prison since his arrest and is awaiting sentencing.
 
Career Criminals
 Gun-control laws passed in the 1980's have also given Federal agents more jurisdiction to arrest gang leaders, Mr. MacDonald said. Last year, agents tracked down and arrested Willie Carter Jr., a reputed leader of the Jungle Boys drug gang in New Haven. In January prosecutors used a Federal law aimed at career criminals to convict Mr. Williams, whose fingerprint was found on a gun confiscated by the agents during the arrest. Mr. Williams is currently serving a 19 1/2-year prison term.
Two weeks ago, a team of 150 law enforcement officials, which included agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration along with state and local police, raided a housing project in New Haven and arrested 14 members of the Jungle Boys and charged them with conspiring to sell cocaine and violating Federal firearms regulations.
 
Undercover Purchases
 During the raid, agents confiscated six firearms, including a sawed-off shotgun and a 12-gauge pump shotgun. The investigation leading to the arrest began in February and included undercover purchases of narcotics and electronics surveillance. If convicted of the conspiracy charges, each defendant faces a minimum of 5 to 40 years in prison.
Among their most urgent concerns, said police officials, are the Latin Kings, which began as a Hispanic fraternal organization in Chicago in the 1940's and resurfaced in Connecticut's prison system about two years ago. Since then, the police statewide have attributed dozens of assaults and several killings in prison and on Connecticut streets to the gang, which they said was tightly organized and out to recruit teen-agers and children.
 
Monthly Meetings of Task Force
 Since January, a task force of more than 50 local, state and Federal law enforcement agents has met monthly to compare information they have gathered on the gang whose membership is estimated to be 2,000 to 8,000.
In New Haven, three teen-agers were arrested and charged with assault on June 12 after their gunfire hit a school bus the day before wounding a six-year-old passenger, Cesar Sandoval, who remained in fair condition last week at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The police said the suspects were tied to the Latin Kings.
The incident followed a shootout in late April when a faction of the Latin Kings sprayed automatic weapons fire at another faction at a Meriden housing project.
 
'Serious Public Safety Concern'
 "It's become impossible to predict where this violence will erupt," said the Chief State's Attorney and a task force spokesman, Richard Palmer. "Which is why their activities have become such a serious public safety concern."
Last month, Ruperto Vincente, 39 years old, who police said led the shootout, was arrested in New York City after evading the police for three weeks. A former auto mechanic, Mr. Vincente has been charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit assault and three counts of first-degree assault.
Mr. Vincente's arrest warrant, which was made public following his arraignment, stated that the shooting appeared to be ordered by a high-ranking member of the organization, Pedro Millan. A former Connecticut resident, Mr. Millan told Latin King members in a telephone call from a Federal prison in New York State that he had been seeking to retaliate against the leader of the Latin Kings, Jose Garcia, who wanted to break from the organization. Mr. Millan has been charged with conspiracy in connection with the shooting.
 
Newsletters From Gang Members
 At the Narcotics and Vice Division of the Bridgeport Police Department on a recent day, Detective Ralph Villegas flipped through separate newsletters published by members of the Latin Kings and a black prison gang called The Nation, which were obtained by officials of the state's correctional system. Both letters read like promotional material for benevolent fraternal organizations.
But Mr. Villegas, whose office is filled with beaded necklaces from gang members and photographs of guns confiscated in narcotics raids, said the materials were merely propaganda distributed by violent criminals.
"They are an embarrassment to the hard-working Hispanic person," he said about the Latin Kings. He added that a member of the gang recently assaulted a Bridgeport police officer by throwing a rock in his face and that at least four homicides in Bridgeport were linked to the gang.
In comments about the dangers police officers face when confronted by gang members, he said: "Remember the old rule about how you never shoot a cop? Well, with these guys that rule doesn't apply."
 
Reputation and Appearance of Arms
 Mr. Villegas, who also teaches at the Police Academy in Bridgeport and briefs suburban police on the characteristics of gangs, said that most gang members carried conventional firearms that were based on reputation and appearance rather than quality. One exception is the Rats and the Tats, who have strong ties to the Shower Posse, an international criminal organization.
"They would never want to be caught with a .22 handgun," he said. "They love high-powered automatics and they're good at using them."
Of the hundreds of illegal guns flooding Bridgeport neighborhoods, Mr. Villegas said, the police may only be able to confiscate about 20 percent. Most guns are found by beat police or through drug raids, he said. Unlike the 1970's when a drug bust required fewer officers and less firepower, today's raids require high-speed dynamics with the assumption that the suspect is armed and dangerous.
"It's like working in a pressure cooker," said Sgt. Joseph Convertito, who supervises narcotics raids for the division.
 
Six to Seven Raids a Week
 Narcotics police now average around six to seven raids a week and must respond to all drug cases, from the occasional dealer trying to get money to buy sneakers to the violent career criminal. The followup paperwork involved in each raid can take hours, the sergeant said, noting that while the Police Department tried to adjust to severe layoffs and cutbacks, the drug and gun cases continued to swell.
In some instances, he said, the police come up empty-handed after a raid because dealers often hide drugs or guns outside or in a car. "It's cat-and-mouse all the way," he said. The police must also consider public safety by scheduling raids when few people are outside. At a recent early morning raid in a Bridgeport housing project, the police confiscated crack paraphernalia and residue and arrested two women and four men. Among those arrested was a man Sergeant Convertito said he had picked up two years ago on a gun charge.
"You're too early," the man said to the sergeant, adding that the drug shipment would not be there for three more hours.
 
One of Many Problems
 Standing outside the apartment while detectives handcuffed and led suspects to a white police van, Sergeant Convertito said the raid had been one of three planned that day. Neighbors who watched the raid said that while the occupants had been a nuisance, they were simply one of many problems relating to drugs that residents in the projects faced.
The city's drug and gun problem continues to worsen, said the sergeant, and he saw no relief in sight. He added that he found it hard to believe Federal Government studies reporting a decline in drug use in the United States.
"I'd love to know where they got their statistics," he said. "Maybe Iowa."
Other law enforcement officials agreed that the drug trade had become a well-entrenched element of American society with its own set of values and priorities.
 
'A Bunch of Amateurs
 In a separate interview following the accidental shooting of Cesar Sandoval, the 21-year-old drug boss in New Haven said the incident disgusted and angered him.
"Those guys that did that were nothing but a bunch of amateurs who didn't know how to shoot straight," he said. "If you want to get somebody, then you should find your target, then shoot to kill."
Bridgeport Police Chief Thomas Sweeney said fresh ideas were needed to combat the drug war and that he was tired of the arguments, both pro and con, concerning the issue of gun control. He said one of the biggest obstacles in solving the drug violence was the complacency of suburban residents who believed they were immune from the travails of the cities.
"We've got a great big problem on our hands in Connecticut, and everywhere else in this country," he said. "And it's about time we all woke up and stopped dreaming."

HEADLINE: Another Season of Music and Picnicking

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE Summer Music program at Harkness Park in Waterford started with a series of four chamber music concerts in 1984, and it has expanded every year since, becoming the largest classical musicl festival in Connecticut.
This year, Summer Music's ninth, the program will open July 18 with the pianist Leon Fleisher and the Connecticut Orchestra, and will close Aug. 22 with music from Broadway and fireworks by the Grucci family. 
 In between will be Ray Charles and the Raylettes Aug. 13, banjo player Buddy Wachter July 30, and the Pointer Sisters July 21, in addition to several classical performances.
And for the first time, Summer Music Inc., which has offices in New London, will offer two weeks of Arts Camp for children 4 to 14 years old, featuring instruction in theater, dance, puppetry and, of course, music.
"We've been modest in what we've added each year, so we don't become more than the public can handle," said Cynde Iverson, one of Summer Music's founders.
The strategy seems to have worked because, even during the recession of the last couple of years, Summer Music has grown, Ms. Iverson said.
 
Indoor and Outdoor Seating
 Summer Music was started in the fall of 1983 by Ms. Iverson, the principal bassoonist with the Rhode Island Philharmonic and the executive director of Summer Music, and her husband, Peter Sacco, the music director of Summer Music and the assistant conductor of the New Haven Symphony.
Concertgoers can choose from seats under the tent, or less costly seats on the lawn. Picnic meals are sold on concert nights.
Among the artists who have appeared at Harkness are Midori, Wynton Marsalis, Dizzy Gillespie and Jean-Pierre Rampal.
"Almost from the start, Summer Music took off in a direction we really didn't anticipate," Mr. Sacco said. "After the first season it was apparent we had something too large for a string quartet, because it loses the intimacy that the string quartet demands."
This year, in fact, Summer Music will phase out the chamber music performances, Mr. Sacco said, and the money that was used for that purpose will be directed to the Arts Camp. And the Harkness Festival Orchestra that started it all is now known as the Connecticut Orchestra.
"We're attempting, by renaming it, to give it a sense of permanence, and to show that it attempts to draw the best musicians not just from southeastern Connecticut, but from all over the state," Mr. Sacco said.
 
A Permanent Center Proposed
 Much of the success of the music series, Ms. Iverson and Mr. Sacco agree, is due to the beauty of the surroundings. The Harkness Mansion recalls the elegance of an era that passed early in this century, and the gently rolling grounds that slope down to Long Island Sound, where a tent is pitched for the music each summer, provide a perfect setting.
In fact, Summer Music is discussing with the state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the park, to build a permanent center for Summer Music.
"We're looking into the feasibility," said Richard K. Clifford, chief of the department's Bureau of Parks and Recreation. But, he cautioned, because of the state's budget problems any permanent complex is years away.
Still, Mr. Clifford said, the department appreciates the attention Summer Music brings to one of its more beautiful parks.
"The concert series has brought a lot of people to Harkness who have never been there before," Mr. Clifford said. "There's no question it's brought us a lot of recognition."
John Ostrout, executive director of the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, said Summer Music had been an "exemplary" arts organization that, in competing for grants every year, had always won financing.
"Our money is considered development money, to get an idea started," Mr. Ostrout said. "They've been able to come up with new ideas every year, to continually expand their program, so they've been successful with their grant applications."
 
Arts Camp Nearly Full
 The new idea this year is the Arts Camp, and the camp's managing director, Andrea Leiser, said of 125 spots, nearly all were full.
"Summer Music being the parent organization gives Arts Camp a lot of credibility," Ms. Leiser said. "And, we've got a terrific faculty."
Among the instructors are Carol Glynn, director of the O'Neill Theater Center's Project Earth; L'Ana Burton, founder of the Connecticut College Children's Dance Center, and Wall Matthews, composer in residence at Connecticut College.
About 20 percent of the students are from low-income families, who will attend on scholarship money from the Palmer Foundation in New London. Arts Camp is also seeking corporate donations to sponsor other children.
"Because of the cutbacks at so many schools, people feel there's a hole in their children's education, and they're looking for a way to fill it," Ms. Leiser said. "The arts are seen as sort of peripheral in the schools, unlike math and science -- and sports."
The Summer Music concert series continues to be the core of the program, however, with an additional concert in the schedule this year, bringing to 10 the number of performances scheduled.
Among them will be the Empire Brass Aug. 6; a July 25 program of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" and Holst's "Planets"; an all-Richard Strauss program Aug. 1 with the world premiere of a newly discovered arrangement of Strauss's last orchestral song; an all-Haydn evening Aug. 15, and the violin virtuoso Cho-Liang Lin on Aug. 8.
Ms. Iverson said when Summer Music started, she was warned that people would not give up their summer weekend plans in order to travel to Waterford and listen to classical music. Some warned her she would be lucky to have 200 people attend the events. The first appearance by the Tokyo String Quartet, though, drew 2,000.
"That was our first inkling that we'd hit upon something no one had expected," Ms. Iverson said. "Today, we get people calling from as far away as Ohio and Kansas who know they're going to be traveling in the area and want one of our brochures. And locally, people who formerly went to Tanglewood are staying home with us."
Ms. Iverson said that last year about 30,000 people attended Summer Music performances.
 
Budget Burgeons
 Mr. Sacco said that about half of Summer Music's annual budget, which has grown from $60,000 the first year to $750,000 today, came from ticket sales, with prices ranging from $10 to $30 depending on the seat and the show. The rest of the budget comes from foundations, government grants and the sponsorship of more than a dozen corporations.
Mr. Sacco said the outdoor setting of the concerts had its advantages, and its drawbacks.
"It enhances the experience in the best of circumstances, and distracts under the worst," he said.
"But in the middle of January in Carnegie Hall, you can hear candy wrappers rustling, and people sniffling or talking," Mr. Sacco said. "Being outside, listening to music under the stars, can be the most encompassing, most thoroughly satisfying experience of any we can offer in the symphonic world."

HEADLINE: A Rush of Candidates Courts Restive Voters

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
IN Connecticut's Second Congressional District the Republicans usually come up with one candidate to take on Representative Sam Gejdenson, the six-term incumbent Democrat. This year, though, there are three from the G.O.P. seeking the nomination, including a lawyer from Norwich whom Mr. Gejdenson defeated four years ago, Glenn T. Carberry. .
Across the state, in the Fifth Congressional District, five Democrats have filed candidacy papers to challenge the one-term Republican incumbent, Gary Franks. 
 While there may be more incumbents declining to seek re-election this year, there are more candidates than anyone can remember who are challenging state and Federal officeholders or who are trying to fill their shoes. Candidates say it has made it more difficult to get attention, attract contributions or line up delegate support for the party nominating conventions this month.
The campaign finance clerk for the Secretary of the State's office, Florence R. Cutting, said she had about 175 candidates for state and local offices, almost a third more than at this point in the election process two years ago.
"We're getting a lot of outsiders, people who have never run before," said Mrs. Cutting, referring to it as the "Ross Perot syndrome."
"And it's still early; I don't know what we'll do in September if this keeps up," she said.
For the first time in memory, this will be the first election with a third major party, which explains part of the barrage of candidates. A Connecticut Party, which was formed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., and which has the top line on the ballot this year, has already nominated almost a dozen candidates to various state offices, and promises to be a force in almost all legislative districts.
Anita L. Mielert, a former Democrat from Simsbury who was the first nominee of A Connecticut Party for a seat in the State House of Representatives in the 16th District, said she had met a lot of people working on Mr. Weicker's campaign in 1990.
"We kept in touch, talked about the issues, and when it came near the time to announce they offered me their support," Mrs. Mielert said. "The two parties we have need shaking up. There's so much garbage going on in the name of politics as usual."
Morton J. Tenzer, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut and a longtime observer of Connecticut politics, said dissatisfaction was the reason for the glut of candidates.
"The public is unhappy with the state of society, with the economy, and with politics in general," Dr. Tenzer said. "But there is nothing cohesive to form around, so people are fractionalizing all over the place."
Lisl Standen, a Democrat from New Milford who was born in Austria, worked for the United Nations for 25 years and has held a string of city and state appointive posts, is running for office for the first time in her 76 years, seeking the seat vacated by State Representative Oskar Rogg, a Republican.
"We have to take a stand, we have to be honest -- democracy is not a spectator sport," Ms. Standen said. "I always thought I would never get into politics because of my horrible accent. But I'm getting impatient."
Not everyone believes the situation has changed all that dramatically, despite the numbers at the Secretary of State's office. Lynn H. Taborsak of Danbury, a Democrat who abandoned her secure seat in the State House of Representatives to run for Congress against Mr. Franks, said that while there were five Democrats seeking the nomination, only two were serious enough to get the 20 percent needed to force a primary. And two years ago, there were seven Republicans seeking the seat when United States Representative John G. Rowland gave it up to run, unsuccessfully, for governor.
"Sure it's harder to raise money this year, but that's not because of H. Ross Perot or anything else," Ms. Taborsak said. "It's because of the economy, and the fact that people don't have the money to give."
Still, state party leaders acknowledge that they are watching the races coalesce. Democratic State Chairman Edward L. Marcus said the number of candidates might be good for the system, provided there were no fringe candidates like David Duke emerging. He said he expected that most of the neophytes would peak early and do poorly come election time, but he pointed out that in some districts, a third-party candidate grabbing 2 or 3 percent of the vote could affect the outcome.
"Everyone figures, 'why not be a State Senator?' But I don't think it's going to be that easy," Mr. Marcus said. "Still, we have to respond to each race as it develops. It makes for a very active political season between now and November. I'm not sure there will be the traditional hiatus this summer."
Republican State Chairman Richard Foley Jr. said that people contemplating independent campaigns in this Presidential election year faced a tougher task than they thought because they "don't realize where they'll be on the ballot."
With A Connecticut Party on the first line, Republicans on the second, Democrats on the third, and Libertarians, New Alliance and Ross Perot somewhere beneath them, Mr. Foley said, "Independents could end up on line 8 or line 9, and at that point you're about at the voter's right shoelace."
For the most part, though, the scramble is on within the state's three major parties. Three Republicans announced their candidacies for the United States Senate seat held by the two-term incumbent Democrat, Christopher J. Dodd, and although one, Robert Jaekle of Stratford, has dropped out, two others -- Christopher Burnham of Stamford and Brook Johnson of Greenwich -- remain in the race.
And there was talk of several others being interested in the job, most prominently United States Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Democrat in the Sixth Congressional District, who decided against running because of the time and money required for a Senate campaign.
Incumbents often interpret the rush of candidates differently.
"It just shows us the Republican party is in disarray, and can't decide who their candidate will be," said Mr. Dodd's spokeswoman, Julie Rosson Small. "It wouldn't surprise us to have another couple of candidates show up before things are over. Senator Dodd is just going to continue being a senator, and stick to his original game plan." Mrs. Small declined to say what the game plan might entail.
Some of the incumbents say the ebb and flow of political fortunes can quickly change, so they are scrutinizing their opposition. Mr. Gejdenson said he was worried about his seat when the President cut money for the Seawolf, the billion-dollar submarines built at Electric Boat in Groton, which is part of his district. A few weeks ago Congress approved financing for one of the submarines, however.
"Until the Seawolf fight was won, it looked like a much tougher year," Mr. Gejdenson said. "Things will change a dozen times between now and the election, but they're looking pretty good right now."
One of his three announced opponents, Mr. Carberry, challenged Mr. Gejdenson's assessment. He said he had put off making a decision on another campaign until only a few months ago, but so many people had approached him and told him about the growing dissatisfaction with incumbents, that he decided to try.
"It's a good sign that there are so many candidates for state and Federal office," Mr. Carberry said. "It's a sign people do want to get involved, and do believe in the future of government. The other option, in times like this, is voter apathy, and then nobody wins."
Others see the number of candidates as an opportunity, particularly if they are in an opposing party.
"The more Democrats who are in the race, the more difficult it will be to get the nomination, and win a primary, and the more money they're going to have to spend just to get the nomination," said Howard W. Waltzman, a spokesman for Representative Franks. "It undermines anyone's ability to focus on the Republican until after Sept. 5th, if there's a primary, and in this case we're sure there will be."
Even some candidates who consider themselves well entrenched find that they are facing challenges for the first time in years.
"There is a lack of leadership, a lack of sense of direction, and a genuine feeling that we're entering into a really new era, with all that's happening in the world," Dr. Tenzer said. "So we're floating around, trying to get our bearings. And, in the meantime, the whole political system is under attack."
Mr. Foley, the state G.O.P. chief, said that having more than two candidates in a race makes democracy difficult to work. Mr. Weicker, for instance, "came in when 60 percent of the people were for somebody else."
Some people point to coalition governments in Europe as evidence that third-party candidates are not the death of a political system, Mr. Foley said, but in Italy the 51st government in 47 years is now being formed.
"In some of these three-way races it would be possible to take office with 35 percent of the vote," Mr. Foley said. "Where I come from, 35 percent ain't a winner. And the loser is the general public, because you have too many narrow, parochial interests."

HEADLINE: A Candidate's Core Curriculum

BYLINE: By Paul Burka; Paul Burka is executive editor of Texas Monthly magazine.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
In a film version of H. G. Wells's novel "The Time Machine," the 19th century time traveler takes three books with him on his final return to a distant future where primitive people live without books or knowledge. The reader is left to guess what those books might be.
Ross Perot is in much the same situation. A few weeks ago, he announced that he would devote more time to studying issues. What, one wonders, is his reading list? What new knowledge will he take into his future? 
 It would be simple enough to assemble a list of influential public policy books for Mr. Perot to read: Kevin Phillips's "The Politics of Rich and Poor," Robert Reich's "The Work of Nations," William Greider's "Who Will Tell the People" and so on. But are the lessons of policy books really what Mr. Perot most needs to know? He may not be fluent in the specifics of issues, but he has shown an intuitive understanding of the nation's fundamental problems.
He has shown less understanding, however, of the eternal truths of politics: the uses and limits of power, the interaction of policy and personality, the relationship between credibility and trust, the difference between right and wrong. The more we learn about Ross Perot, the more it is apparent that these are the kinds of issues that will ultimately determine whether he can be elected President.
Here is a reading list that would enhance his appreciation of politics.
1. "All the King's Men," a novel by Robert Penn Warren (1946). Moral: The ends do not justify the means.
Gov. Willie Stark practices what Machiavelli preached. He wants to do good, but when doing good turns out not to be so easy after all, he resorts to corrupting his friends and blackmailing his enemies. "It takes dirt to grow grass," Willie says. To persuade an idealist to work for him, Willie argues that goodness can be made only from badness. But two can play this game. When the idealist's illusions are shattered, he puts Willie's philosophy to work by assassinating him.
2. "Antigone," a play by Sophocles (circa 442 B.C.). Beware of hubris, the sin of overweening pride.
Ross Perot is not afflicted with self-doubt. Neither was Creon, ruler of Thebes. "The man the state has put in place must have obedient hearing to his least command, when it is right and even when it's not," he proclaims. Sure enough, Creon has issued a wrong command: the corpse of a traitor must be left unburied. But Antigone, sister of the traitor and fiance of Creon's son, defies him, and Creon is determined to ignore all pleas for clemency. The inevitable consequences of his arrogance are the suicides of Antigone, his son and his wife. "The gods must have their due," the chorus intones. "Great words by men of pride bring greater blows upon them."
3. "The Best and the Brightest," by David Halberstam (1972). Experts don't know everything.
The men John F. Kennedy brought to Washington were the best and brightest -- "brilliant men," Mr. Halberstam writes, "men of force, not cruel, not harsh, but men who acted rather than waited." Does this sound like anybody we know? Ross Perot presents himself as a can-do man of action, and he relies heavily on bringing in elite experts to brief him.
But this combination of expertise and love of action is exactly what led America into the quagmire of Vietnam. The experts failed to factor public opinion into their neat theories. Even Lyndon B. Johnson, who ought to have known better, was so awed by the best and the brightest that he ignored the warning of his friend Sam Rayburn, the House Speaker: "I'd feel a whole lot better about them if just one of them had run for sheriff once."
4. "The Butter Battle Book," by Dr. Seuss (1984). Don't try to destroy people who disagree with you.
Yooks eat bread with the butter side up, but, "In every Zook house and in every Zook town, every Zook eats his bread with the butter side down!" This difference is enough to make each side want to annihilate the other, and to build ever more sophisticated weapons to do so.
As a cold war parable, this children's book is flawed, because the differences between the Yooks and Zooks were not so trivial. As a general indictment of feuding, however, the book has a message for a potential President with a penchant for vengefulness: Be sure what you're fighting over really matters.
5. "Character: America's Search for Leadership," by Gail Sheehy (1988). Character is a legitimate political issue.
Character is destiny, Ms. Sheehy believes, and these profiles of six Presidential candidates and Ronald Reagan try to prove it. The book would drive someone like Ross Perot nuts with its street-corner psychology but at least it explains the media's current fascination with a candidate's past: "We need the cold slap of insight to wake us up from the smoothly contrived images projected by highly paid media experts," Ms. Sheehy writes.
The best argument for character-cop journalism is the prescience of the fourth profile: "If George Bush cannot bear to offend people, if he hasn't got the outer strength to pursue a lonely course, if he feels wholly comfortable only when being liked, might he not, as a president, become paralyzed?"
6. "The Company," a novel by John Ehrlichman (1976). Political spying is a two-edged sword.
Ross Perot has a long history of hiring investigators to spy on people, including President Bush. As President, could he resist using the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the I.R.S. and other Federal agencies against his political enemies? This novel by a convicted Watergate figure might make him think twice about it.
The President and the Director of Central Intelligence are locked in a power struggle filled with snooping, surveillance and intrigue -- and the loser is the President. "The people are wholly fictional," Mr. Ehrlichman writes in an author's note. "But the forces -- the stresses, pressures, fears and passions -- that motivate the characters are real."
7. "In Defence of Politics," by Bernard Crick (1962). Politics is compromise.
College students will recognize this one. It's mandatory reading for Poly Sci 101 almost everywhere. The author, a British political scientist, describes politics as a process of discussion -- in other words, compromise. It produces progress out of dialogue and preserves both freedom and social order by bringing everybody to the bargaining table.
"There are two great enemies of politics," Mr. Crick writes: "indifference to human suffering and the passionate quest for certainty in matters which are essentially political."
8. "Lady Chatterly's Lover," a novel by D. H. Lawrence (1928). Lighten up, Ross.
There are two sides to everything -- even adultery.
9. "Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life," by Sissela Bok (1978). Tell the truth.
Why does Mr. Perot waffle, backpedal and even deny when confronted with controversial positions and statements he has made in the past? He ought to realize by now that he is far more likely to lose the Presidency by lying than by telling the truth.
Mrs. Bok, who has taught ethics at Harvard and Stanford, argues for truthfulness. "A society whose members were unable to distinguish truthful messages from deceptive ones would collapse," she writes.
10. "The Politics of Upheaval," volume three of "The Age of Roosevelt," by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (1960). How to be a successful President in a time of crisis.
Start by being committed to people, not ideology. F.D.R.'s "basic principle was not to sacrifice human beings to logic," Mr. Schlesinger writes. "He had no philosophy save experiment, which was a technique; constitutionalism, which was a procedure; and humanity, which was a faith." Then, conduct yourself in a way that sets an example for the country. If Ross Perot is elected President, he could ask for no better judgment from future historians than the valedictory Mr. Roosevelt receives at the book's conclusion: He made it possible for people to believe again in Government's capacity to solve problems of economic stability and social justice.

HEADLINE: Starting Climb to the Top at the Bottom Rung

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your front-page article about the carpentry program at the Youth Build school in Boston (June 8), one of many around the country that try to rehabilitate and prepare young inner-city males for a job market, is in a way edifying. Manual arts training is a good idea since it's about drills for coordinating mind and hands, which is good therapy; and it has commercial value. 
 Unfortunately, carpentry presents a big problem professionally for these youngsters, who're unequipped to persevere in a market that's unsteady and in which there are hurdles for white males and walls for blacks.
I've worked on large home-building construction sites as subcontractor for laborer help, and of the 100 or so carpenters, only one or two were black, mostly middle-aged men. The young white boys who hammered away had been taught the craft as pre-teen-agers and teen-agers by family members. Blacks started much later and had to wait years to be admitted into this closed shop rife with nepotism.
The urban males wouldn't have the strength to endure the trial. Thus teaching them carpentry for earning a living is as unrealistic as teaching calculus in inner-city schools to students shattered by domestic instability and who get no intellectual stimulation at home. This therefore makes these males dream when they think they could begin their own businesses as carpenters.
However, teaching them "menial" crafts makes much more sense, and is practical. I took advantage of America's disdain for menial labor and broke into major construction, providing a needed service, in which I had no competition. I built a nice business doing dirty work in cleaning, mopping and buffing.
These labors are close to these males, many having had these experiences working in fast-food restaurants. Teaching them these crafts formally would be clever. This is what I've begun to do.
Jobs in these skills are far more secure than those in carpentry; the opportunities far greater. An ambitious inner-city male could conceivably become an entrepreneur. Around the country, the market for building crafts and maintenance crafts, which includes such specialties as mopping, sanding, finishing and general cleaning, is in the billions of dollars.
The urban entrepreneur who knows his "lowly" craft well may even get to wear a suit because consumers and manufacturers need consultants. One major home improvement retailer greatly increased its sales when it hired professional craftsmen to answer customer queries and to put questions to manufacturers about the claims they make in their products. I'm writing a series of booklets on floor care and repair.
When the well-intentioned social missionaries to the ghetto, and the academics and foundations who advise them, shed their prejudices and contempt for the servant and service classes, they will see that those males they have committed themselves to serve will do better being simple than being middle class, with all its pretensions.

HEADLINE: Putting Young Farmers Back on the Land for Everyone's Good

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Quiet Exodus by the Young Leaves the Future of Family Farms in Doubt" (news article, June 9) focuses needed attention on the urgent problem of the shrinking family farm base. However, your tone of inevitability, reflecting a sadly routine analysis of agriculture, is shortsighted. 
 Our Government is struggling to create new living-wage jobs and seems clueless about how to correct the ravages of unemployment, overcrowding and disenfranchisement in our cities. Yet, at the same time, its longstanding farm policy is the primary cause of economic and social devastation in our rural areas -- fewer farmers, fewer people on the land, fewer independent food processors and other agribusinesses, and fewer Main Street jobs and businesses. The continuing depopulation of rural America and loss of farming and agribusiness jobs can only add to the strain on our beleaguered cities.
However, this decadeslong trend is not inevitable. Government policies helped created these circumstances, and dramatic changes in Government policies can remedy them. To reverse the trend, Federal farm tax, commodity program and credit policies that subsidize land consolidation and encourage intensive use of energy and agricultural chemicals must be changed. The large taxpayer investment in agriculture research and development should also be reoriented to increase rural economic opportunity and improve the quality of rural life.
A growing number of farmers are becoming involved in what is known as sustainable agriculture. These are smaller-scale, family farmers who are developing farming methods that are not only economically profitable but also more ecologically sound, often with little or no yield reductions.
Interest among young people in getting into farming is high, as demonstrated by standing-room-only attendance at a recent beginning farmer workshop in Faribault, Minn. At that meeting, LaVonne Nicholai, director of the Minnesota Rural Finance Authority, which administers the state's beginning farmer loan program, stated:
"Countries around the world are looking at the family farm as a model for agriculture and are trying to learn how to use private and public money to rebuild rural economies to insure food for future generations."
In addition to programs in several states, key beginning farmer legislation is expected to pass Congress in the next months. The agricultural credit improvement bill would return the Government's Farmers Home Administration to its original mission of providing modest amounts of supervised credit to small and beginning farmers unable to obtain credit elsewhere.
The bill would allow the agency to make down payment loans to young farmers and would establish a Federal-state beginning farmer partnership program. With more than half of all farmland in the hands of farmers who will likely retire by the year 2000, passage of this critical legislation could not be more timely.
We must have a new policy of repopulating the land and increasing rural economic opportunity. Small and moderate-scale farms, with more environmentally sound farmers, will play a key role in agriculture's future. Such a trend reversal would go a long way toward solving not only our rural woes but some of our urban ones as well.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. and Russia Reach Accord On Loan Aid and Spending Limits

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 5

 BODY:
The Russian Government and the International Monetary Fund announced today that they had reached a lending agreement that gives President Boris N. Yeltsin the endorsement he had sought from the West for his economic policies, but also commits him to cut back on Government spending just when the deficit is rising sharply.
The I.M.F. had been under pressure for weeks from the Bush Administration to soften its usual requirements so that an agreement with the Yeltsin Government could be announced before a meeting of leaders of the seven industrial powers that begins in Munich on Monday. Mr. Yeltsin is to join President Bush and the other leaders in Munich on Wednesday. 
 I.M.F. officials said in Washington 10 days ago that they planned to scale back their original plans for a multibillion-dollar package that would require more sweeping reforms from Moscow, and that they would instead seek a simplified agreement.
The formal announcement of the loan agreement today came in a one-paragraph statement signed by Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus. The statement spoke vaguely of "new measures" that will "strengthen the economic reforms and the stabilization program of the Russian Federation Government."
The agreement appears to commit the Government to anti-spending policies just when Parliament is pressing for greater outlays to subsidize state-owned enterprises that have been hurt by a steep recession and by the transition to a market economy. As a result of these pressures, the budget deficit has risen sharply in recent weeks.
A Government official said that to reach the agreement, the Russian Government and the I.M.F. had delayed talks on the issues of foreign debt and the I.M.F.'s desire for Russia to keep raising energy prices. The energy issue is one of the toughest issues in the talks because higher fuel prices would raise the cost of living.
Specifically, the agreement commits the Government and Russia's Central Bank to maintain a ceiling on loans and adhere to spending guidelines, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist and a senior adviser to the Government. Mr. Sachs took part in the I.M.F. talks last week and returned to the United States on Saturday.
"Mr. Gaidar is aware that if all the parliamentary pressures were met, that would put Russia into hyper-inflation and the Government is committed to resist this," Mr. Sachs said in a telephone interview.
I.M.F. officials did not comment on the plan, beyond acknowledging that Russia will qualify for a $1 billion I.M.F. loan, once the agreement is ratified by the I.M.F. board in August.
Mr. Gaidar and Mr. Camdessus had worked out the general terms for the $1 billion loan when they met in Washington two weeks ago. Although an I.M.F. team had been trying to negotiate the details for the past week, success came only after Mr. Camdessus flew here from Washington and met with Mr. Yeltsin on Saturday.
A broader agreement, to be negotiated in two stages over the next six months, would release a total of $24 billion in foreign assistance, including $4.5 billion from the I.M.F. and the World Bank and $11 billion in direct credits from Western governments.
Just before his meeting with Mr. Camdessus, Mr. Yeltsin told a group of journalists that the I.M.F. would have to ease up on its standard requirements because "Russia is unique and its reform is unique."
The I.M.F., however, eased up only slightly, accepting, for example, a monthly inflation rate of 7 percent to 9 percent instead of the 3 percent limit it had once sought. The current inflation rate in Russia is about 14 percent monthly, according to the Government.
The I.M.F.'s proposals mainly seek to strengthen the ruble so that it is more readily convertible into hard currencies. A stable ruble, in turn, helps to attract foreign investment and encourages foreign trade, which are two other goals being sought by the fund.
The I.M.F. has also pressed for what it describes as a stable ruble zone. Under this requirement, all the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States using the ruble as their currency must agree to a single monetary policy, preferably one controlled by the Russian Central Bank.
Today's agreement sidestepped this issue by stating that Russia and the other states will take steps to define the ruble zone and work out procedures to be followed by those republics that want to switch from the ruble to their own currencies.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ACCORDS BRING NEW FEARS ON ARMS DISPOSAL

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Federal and private experts say the recent East-West breakthroughs in nuclear arms reduction are replacing one danger with a wide range of new risks as the world's two nuclear superpowers prepare to retire nearly 40,000 warheads.
Mutual annihilation is no longer a threat. The new risks are emerging because arms reductions call for weapons systems to be disabled -- by demolishing missile silos, for instance -- and do not, as is often supposed, require nuclear warheads to be destroyed. 
 In practice, warheads and their firing mechanisms will be dismantled, and their nuclear cores either stored, pending future disposition, or recycled into new weapons.
 
New Uses for SS-18
 Even Russia's fearsome SS-18 missiles, whose retirement crowned the recent accords between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin, are exempt from actual ruin. The 12-story behemoths are simply to be taken out of military service and stored, cannibalized or used for firing payloads into space.
Few decisions have been made about the final disposition of nuclear weapons and their parts, including hundreds of tons of bomb materials like plutonium 239 and uranium 235. The full retirement operation will take more than a decade and cost tens of billions of dollars.
On Thursday, President Bush announced that the United States had completed its withdrawal of all shorter-range land and naval nuclear arms based outside the country, returning them to American soil.
 
Terror and Proliferation
 Future challenges are expected to include keeping nuclear gear secure from terrorists and thieves -- storing it, possibly for millennia without environmental damage, imparting discipline to generations of nuclear custodians, and commercially recycling some arms materials without contributing to the spread of bombs.
Two perceived dangers, especially in the former Soviet Union, are clandestine sales to black marketeers and atomic theft by terrorists.
The Russian military's system for transporting nuclear material "is not up to anything we would call Western standards, or even remotely adequate," Robert Gallucci, the State Department official dealing with Russian nuclear matters, recently warned. "If this situation doesn't get fixed, in the long term it will be an area in which we will have real worries about materials disappearing."
The biggest fear is bomb recycling. Nothing in the arms reduction accords prevents reuse. The United States pioneered this practice by taking warheads from the Pershing 2 missile, retired from Europe, and manufacturing them into weapons for bombers. Those arms, not covered by Mr. Bush's recent weapons withdrawals, are now back in Europe.
Some American experts worry that the Russians might do likewise on an expanded scale. Others dismiss the idea as extremely improbable.
Frank J. Gaffney Jr., an official in the Reagan Pentagon who how directs the Washington-based Center for Security Policy, belittled the recent accords as "cosmetic" and charged that they could allow Russia to build a covert arsenal.
That, he said in an interview, "could pose greater dangers" than the cold war did, suggesting that the Russian military might one day launch a pre-emptive strike on the West or engage in political blackmail with "large numbers of nuclear weapons they weren't suppose to have."
 
The Cuts
Some Will Be Real, Others Recycled
 The nuclear arms race peaked in the mid-1980's with the Soviet Union having roughly 33,000 weapons and the United States 24,000, according to Robert S. Norris, a senior analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council and co-author of the Nuclear Weapons Databook.
Of these 57,000 warheads, arms control treaties and unilateral actions have marked about 37,000 for retirement. Other weapons have been dropped for military reasons. The total number to be retained is estimated at 12,000, including 5,000 shorter-range ones. These reduced arsenals are to be more or less evenly divided between East and West.
Reductions began in 1987 with the signing of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which cut 2,150 Soviet warheads and 550 American ones, including those atop the West German-based Pershing 2. Its thermonuclear warhead, code-named W-85, had an explosive force five times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
Beginning in May 1990, an unknown number of W-85's were quietly repackaged into gravity bombs, Dr. Norris said. The recycled arms are now carried primarily by Air Force F-16's based in Europe.
The pace of disarmament picked up last July with the signing in Moscow of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start. It calls on each side to shed 4,500 long-range warheads. Here too, some American warheads are already being recycled. The W-76 from the Trident 1 missile, carried aboard older submarines, is being refitted for use atop Trident 2 missiles on the newest submarines.
After the unsuccessful Soviet coup attempt last August, Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised to cut, respectively, 5,500 and 11,000 shorter-range nuclear arms. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney soon afterward said that the bombs could easily be recycled. In the past, he noted, "we've remanufactured that material into new systems and into new warheads."
The Washington accord signed last month by Mr. Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin earmarks for retirement 5,000 American and 3,500 Russian long-range arms. Like earlier treaties, it has no provisions for warhead destruction, upsetting some members of Congress who worry about stability in the former Soviet lands.
 
The Philosophy
Cold War or Not, Distrust Lingers
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, criticized the Bush Administration during a June 25 hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee, calling nuclear cuts without verified destruction "a bad trade" and suggesting that Moscow's warheads could fall into unfriendly hands.
"There's going to be an overwhelming urge," he said, "to sell those warheads, to disseminate those warheads, to folks who are ready to pay a whole lot of money."
Administration witnesses strongly defended the treaties. "To verify the destruction of warheads is conceivable," said Linton Brooks, the chief American negotiator in the latter part of the Start talks. But Mr. Brooks said this would be too intrusive because East-West reciprocity would force Washington to curtail its activities, including warhead recycling.
Such remanufacturing of bombs, he went on, avoided new production costs. And even if existing arms were verifiably destroyed, he said, Washington could never be sure that Moscow was not secretly producing new ones.
"So we would spend enormous costs and not necessarily close off any doors," Mr. Brooks concluded.
Private groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists, disagree, arguing that in theory it is relatively easy to verify both warhead destruction and the cutoff of nuclear production.
Senator Biden noted such inspection ideas and accused the Administration of "old thinking."
On Thursday, the Foreign Relations Committee voted to recommend negotiations with Russia over verification methods that would cover nuclear warheads, in addition to delivery systems.
 
The Withdrawals
Guarded Convoys To Twilight Zone
 American weapons destined for retirement are stockpiled at military depots around the country awaiting disassembly. When openings arise, the weapons are put on unmarked, heavily armored tractor-trailers that ply the nation's highways in convoys of one to five trucks, flanked by armed guards in escort vehicles with darkened side and rear windows.
The bomb-carrying fleet now has 51 trucks and will soon add 7 trailers and 15 tractors for "the expanded workload," said Ben McCarty, an Energy Department spokesman.
The warheads are hauled back to a sprawling Energy Department plant in the Texas Panhandle known as Pantex, where they were first assembled. In case of an accident, Pantex's work areas, awash in reinforced concrete, can withstand usual explosions.
A main disassembly job is to gently remove the high explosives that surround the grapefruit-sized ball of plutonium at the heart of a bomb. The violent implosion of a plutonium "pit," as it is known, is the spark behind most atomic and thermonuclear blasts.
Pantex in the 1980's took apart 1,000 or so bombs a year for retirement and inspection. The plant's rate in 1991 jumped to 1,600 and is expected to reach 1,800 this year, said Tom Walton, a Pantex spokesman. By 1993, it should be 2,000. The aim is to maintain that pace for the rest of the century.
The Federal Government is pondering what to do with the plutonium pits, considered the weapons' deadliest part. Plutonium has a radioactive half-life of 25,000 years and has been called the most toxic substance on earth, since minuscule grains can cause cancer. The interim plan is to store the pits at Pantex.
The plant has 60 concrete-and-steel bunkers. During the cold war they held new bombs awaiting shipment. Now 18 are earmarked for pit storage. These bunkers already hold 2,900 pits and can accommodate about 1,400 more, Mr. Walton said. The pits are held in steel drums arranged in a single layer.
With space fast running out, the Energy Department is considering setting aside more bunkers for storage, or packing more pits into designated areas by stacking drums atop one another. That would raise the radiation dose to workers, so the agency is studying whether to replace humans with robot forklifts controlled by radio transmissions from a nearby truck.
Texas state officials are upset by such plans, charging that Pantex is fast becoming an unlicensed plutonium dump. In response, the agency says it has a good safety record and is taking every precaution at Pantex for interim storage, including assessing the environmental impact.
The Energy Department also says it is spending $110 million to beef up plant security, including roads and surveillance gear, stronger buildings and storage bunkers, alarms and radiation detectors, and new concrete guard towers with bulletproof windows.
A thousand miles eastward, in the rolling hills of Tennessee, a similar challenge is unfolding for the nation's prime handlers of uranium 235, a bomb material also to be retired, in quantities five times greater than plutonium. Both plutonium and uranium are used in H-bombs. Uranium from retired weapons is to be hauled to the Energy Department's Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge. Once the king of uranium enrichment, the 600-acre plant is now increasingly being turned to storage, as at Pantex.
"At some level of storage," a terse Y-12 statement said, "the plant might have to construct or modify additional, secure facilities."
 
The Russians
A Huge Bunker In Siberia
 Similar withdrawal and dismantling work is now under way in Russia, though few details of the operation are known publicly. Western experts tend to see Russian transportation as weak. Britain in February offered Russia 20 armored trucks for bomb removal and the United States offered 25 armored rail cars. The Russians accepted the British offer but eventually turned down the American one, saying the rail cars would be too difficult to adapt.
As for storage, Russian military officials say that they have lost depots to other former Soviet republics and that their remaining areas are quickly filling. They have asked that a promised $400 million in American aid for nuclear dismantling go to help build a huge bunker for retired weapons fuels.
The proposed center, bigger than 10 football fields, would be located near a gargantuan plant in Siberia that has five nuclear reactors and a center for plutonium-pit fabrication.
The Bush Administration is studying the bunker idea. It is also preparing to send 450 sets of armored blankets to help protect Russian nuclear weapons containers during shipment and 1,000 pieces of special clothing and equipment for any nuclear accidents.
It has ordered the manufacture, in this country, of 10,000 special canisters for the transport and storage of Russian arms material.
 
The Debate
Future Menace Or Megawatts?
 In East and West, the ultimate fate of hundreds of tons of plutonium 239 and uranium 235 is largely undecided. At the heart of an intensifying debate is whether such materials should be treated as dangerous waste or great treasures.
Private analysts say factions in both military establishments would like to retain either whole weapons or plutonium pits and other key parts, so that large arsenals can be rapidly reconstructed.
But Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee late last month that there was little to fear from a covert Russian force. "I do not see a particular danger," General Powell said, noting that some of Moscow's systems like missile silos would be destroyed and that in any case the United States had a nuclear retaliatory force "that cannot be taken out."
A different group of analysts sees bomb materials as an economic bonanza because of their value as nuclear fuel. One pound of fissioned plutonium is equal to 10 billion watts of thermal energy, an amount able to generate electrical power for millions of people. The problem is that burning plutonium 239 in a nuclear reactor is not easy, requiring special fuel processing. Even then, it remains attractive for bomb construction, creating new temptations for nuclear theft.
In contrast, uranium 235 is easily diluted into a reactor fuel that cannot readily be used in a bomb, though some analysts question whether such conversion would be economic. And the present manufacturers of nuclear fuel would undoubtedly fight such competition. Nonetheless, the option is being carefully studied.
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins in January told reporters that the idea had generated "a lot of excitement."
A less sanguine view, espoused by some nuclear arms scientists in East and West, is that the weapons materials are inherently dangerous and should be destroyed. Russian scientists at Arzamas 16, the country's main nuclear design center, have proposed burning up plutonium in underground nuclear blasts.
A different destruction plan would poison bomb fuel with radioactive waste and store it in high-level nuclear dumps, which have yet to be built and have engendered widespread public opposition.
A final proposal by Theodore B. Taylor, a former weapons designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, would have big rockets loft plutonium and other bomb fuels into the sun. Sun incineration has been discussed for years as a way of disposing of hazardous waste. One problem is that it is hardly cheap -- the bill could run into billions of dollars.
"It's dangerous stuff," Dr. Taylor said of the nuclear material. "If you can get rid of it at some reasonable cost, that seems like the best thing to do."

HEADLINE: WARSAW WELCOMES BUSH AS HE STOPS ON WAY TO SUMMIT

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, July 5

 BODY:
Flying thousands of miles to get a balm for his domestic political pains, President Bush arrived in Munich today for a seven-nation economic conference after receiving a thunderous ovation in a Warsaw square where he promised that "America wants Poland to succeed and to prosper."
"Hello Warsaw! Hello Poland!" Mr. Bush shouted cheerfully from a stage erected in Castle Square. He appeared with President Lech Walesa after a mass said for the re-internment of the remains of Ignace Jan Paderewski, the Polish musician and statesman whose dying wish in New York 51 years ago was to be buried in a free Poland. 
 "Today, Poland stands transformed," said Mr. Bush, who visited Warsaw in part to alleviate worries in Eastern Europe that the United States is too heavily focused on helping Russia to pay attention to its concerns.
"Your bold economic reforms have earned the world's admiration and support -- and what's more, they're working," Mr. Bush said, glossing over Poland's economic and political problems, which have worsened considerably since he last visited, in 1989.
 
'God Bless America'
 President Walesa drew loud cheers when he said in English, a language he has rarely spoken in public, "God bless America and God bless President Bush."
Mr. Bush came to Munich for a three-day meeting of the leaders of the seven biggest industrial democracies: the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada. Tonight he dined with President Francois Mitterrand, hoping to smooth over rough spots in French-American relationships that have formed over the United States role in European security and other issues.
White House advisers had hoped that Mr. Bush, whose approval ratings on foreign policy have plummeted with his overall popularity, would get a hero's welcome in Poland, where he was making his third visit. Indeed, the crowd, which seemed to number in the tens of thousands, cheered lustily and some waved American flags when Mr. Bush appeared.
 
'Ross for Boss'
 But there were reminders of Mr. Bush's political problems. Toward the front of the crowd, a half-dozen Americans unfurled banners that read "Ross for Boss," a reference to Ross Perot, and "Bush: The Environmental President. NOT!"
The President brought with him a plan to bolster Poland's economy by converting the $1 billion fund used to stabilize the zloty on world currency markets into loans and direct grants to stimulate investment in Poland's flagging private sector.
But even Mr. Bush's aides conceded that the plan, which would require Poland to resolve its problems with the International Monetary Fund as well as the agreement of the 16 other nations that contributed, was only a modest gesture. The sluggish performance of the United States economy prevents Mr. Bush from providing more ambitious economic assistance.
Mr. Bush's trip to Poland, to Munich, and on to Helsinki later this week for a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, was one of a series of events that the White House hoped would focus voters' attention on foreign affairs, Mr. Bush's strong suit.
But so far, that has not worked noticeably. Mr. Bush's political strategists, and Mr. Bush himself, were alarmed by the lack of any marked increase in his political standing after the signing of a sweeping arms-reduction agreement with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Mr. Bush's embarrassing visit to Panama and his difficulties at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro ended up hurting the President more than they helped.
Although Mr. Bush is trying to keep the focus on foreign affairs and away from the 1992 Presidential campaign, he seemed eager to send word back home that he was working on domestic problems even while he was overseas.
On Monday, Mr. Bush plans to meet with Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, who helped deliver that state to Mr. Bush in the 1988 election and the 1992 Republican primary, and executives of the BMW automobile company, which plans to build a plant in South Carolina near the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport.
In Warsaw, Mr. Bush did not let slip a chance to remind his audience -- and those listening back home -- of the millions of Polish-American voters. "In a strange new world called America," he said, "in the stockyards of Chicago, in the steelworks of Cleveland, in a thousand towns thousands of miles from this land they love, Poles worked and worshiped and built a better life."
 
A Changed Aura in Poland
 Mr. Bush sought to evoke the revolutionary euphoria of 1989, when Poland's voters handed the Communist Party a stunning electoral defeat. But the Poland he visited today was markedly different, with Mr. Walesa's Solidarity movement long since divided and redivided.
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who met with Mr. Bush today, handed in his resignation last week after a month of failed attempts to form a Government. The only reason Mr. Pawlek was there was that President Walesa has refused to accept his resignation. Hanna Suchocka, a lawyer, is front-runner to be Poland's fifth Prime Minister in three years, but her ascendancy is by no means assured.
Mr. Walesa told Mr. Bush, "The people of Warsaw love you," and "Only the Pope has attracted so many."
But there were signs that the enthusiasm of the crowd had dimmed from Mr. Bush's last triumphal visit, at the height of revolutionary fervor in Poland. "This was once an active opposition," said Jadwiga Kutnik, a 46-year-old lab technician. "Now people have other things to do. This is vacation time."
Others, however, were enthusiastic.
Lydia Pendrak, 37, an architect, said: "I made a special trip to see him. There are moments that one simply feels one should be in a certain place at a certain time. President Bush represents the friendship of America and Poland, and I think that's a very important thing."

HEADLINE: Welfare in the New York Area

 BODY:
States in the New York region have historically paid higher benefits than other parts of the country, but the value of Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits plus food stamps has declined faster in New York and New Jersey over the past 20 years than in the rest of the nation because these states did less to counter inflation.
Benefits in New York City -- $9,672 a year for a mother with two children as of January -- buy one-third less than in 1972, as against one-fourth less for the nation as a whole. 
 As a result, New York's status as a generous supporter of poor people has eroded. Several states pay higher benefits, including California, Vermont and Connecticut, which pays $10,344 a year. And New Jersey's benefits, at $8,292 a year for a family of three, are little more than the national average.
With the recession, the number of people in the region on welfare has climbed sharply over the last three years. In New York City, where 1 in 10 people is on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the number of families receiving benefits has risen to 258,000 this year, from the 228,000 in 1989 that was a 20-year low. An additional 138,000 families receive it in the rest of New York State, while 54,000 families in Connecticut and 130,000 in New Jersey receive it.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has promised not to balance the state budget by slashing welfare benefits and has emphasized the need to help women get off welfare through education and training.
New Jersey is more aggressively trying to change the behavior of welfare recipients by cutting benefits for women who have more children and allowing women who marry to keep more of their welfare grant. Connecticut considered similar proposals, but the Legislature did not adopt them.

HEADLINE: Santiago Journal;
Scrubbing The Skies Over Chile

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
On a clear day during the Southern Hemisphere winter, the towering Andes mountains glisten with a blanket of snow. But from here they are for the most part invisible, hidden behind a thick brown layer of smog that fills this city of more than four million people, making Santiago among the most polluted cities in the world.
This is the time of year when most Chileans would like to avoid the capital. Eyes sting. Bronchial illness surges. And, according to doctors, the march of cancer in the population increases. 
 If smog were the only pollution problem in Chile, it might seem less daunting. But it is only the most visible of numerous woes from the country's southern forests to its northern desert.
Chile has some of the world's dirtiest factories, belching sulfur dioxide, arsenic and heavy metals into the atmosphere. Many of its rivers are heavily contaminated with industrial and human waste and its natural resources, experts say, are over-exploited.
As the two-year-old democratic Government of President Patricio Aylwin enters the first stages of addressing the pollution problems, many critics are pointing fingers at the former military Government as the main cause of the problem.
 
The Free-Market Fever

They say that during the 17-year military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, economic growth, based on the free-market model of the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman, was pushed at all costs, creating a political atmosphere in which concern for the environment did not exist.
It is open to debate whether the pollution is the result of Friedman economics or Friedman economics misapplied. What is undeniable is that Chile, which under General Pinochet,emerged as the most robust and stable economy in Latin America, now faces the dilemma of choosing between the daunting cost of cleaning up -- imperiling economic growth in the process -- and the daunting cost of not cleaning up.
"For years, we could not even talk about the problems of pollution or environment," said Francisco Gonzalez, who is in charge of environment at La Ventana copper smelter just north of Chile's famous beach resort, Vina del Mar. "We could lose our jobs. And if a report was made warning of pollution, it was marked secret and put in a drawer. Produce, produce, produce -- that was the politics of the day."
The Ventana smelter, which supports the livelihood of small copper-mining operations around the country, is a classic example of the Government's problems. With its antiquated technology, the plant has spewed noxious sulphur dioxide into the surrounding area for years. Not only have its workers been exposed to dangerously high levels of toxic gases and shown a growing rate of illness, but farmers and peasants living miles from the smelter have complained of health problems, lost productivity in the fields and livestock illnesses believed to be linked to the pollution.
Though the Government installed equipment to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, it will cost $240 million to modernize the smelter and bring it up to current health standards, an investment the plant is not likely to make quickly.
"We will never clean up this area," said Carlos R. Risopatron, director of a project to monitor the Ventana pollution. "You cannot talk about decontamination. The best we can hope for is not to let the situation get worse."
Almost 400 hundred miles north along the Huasco River, farmers growing olives found that production fell precipitously, and investigators blame carbon dioxide emissions and particulate from a plant that makes iron pellets upriver.
Yet another 200 miles north near Chanaral, runoff from a large copper mine has created a vast encrustation of white sediment, including heavy metals, that flows into the ocean, a deposit that few think will ever be cleaned up.
And at Chile's largest copper smelter, Chuquicamata, researchers have found it belching unusually large amounts of arsenic, causing health problems among hundreds of workers.
Nowhere is the pollution problem worse than in Santiago. Environmental specialists consider Santiago the most polluted city in Latin America after Mexico City.
Though for years the city has had intense smog problems, experts here say the the military dictatorship and world preoccupation with the lack of democracy here muffled public debate and concern about pollution.
Experts give the Aylwin Government passing grades for its actions to date, but add that it is only now casting about for a comprehensive plan.
Santiago's pollution results mainly from the city's fleet of 11,000 diesel buses, most of which are old and burn fuel inefficiently, and from the fact that the city has more than 400 miles of unpaved roads, where vast amounts of dust are stirred up.
During the Pinochet years, the bus system was totally deregulated, and the Government permitted the import of thousands of used vehicles. By contrast, Sao Paolo, with close to 20 million inhabitants, four times the size of Santiago, has 7,000 buses.
The intensity of the pollution here is also a geological and atmospherical problem. Like Mexico City, Santiago lies among mountains and is subject to thermal inversions that do not permit polluted air to escape during the winter months.
This winter has been one of the worst. In mid-June, pollution alerts were issued for eight straight days.
 
Water Is Foul, Too
 A far greater concern, according to experts, is the pollution of the city's water supplies -- a problem brought home when cholera broke out here a year ago. The city of Santiago has no water treatment plants, and thus almost all home and industrial waste water is dumped into rivers, which in turn run through much of the country's farm land.
Two years ago officials discovered that almost all of the country's vegetables were being grown through irrigation with contaminated water.
To this day there is no regulation of toxic waste. The Government is only now trying to conduct a survey of such waste, which it hopes to complete by the end of next year.
"We have no idea of where and how much industrial toxic waste is being dumped," said Eduardo Arriagada, president of the Special Commission for Decontaminating the Metropolitan Region. "It could be anywhere. We assume a lot goes into rivers but we just don't know."
