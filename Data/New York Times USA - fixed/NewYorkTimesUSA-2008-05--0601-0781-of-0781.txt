HEADLINE: Georgian President's Party Has Wide Lead in Voting

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
As vote counts were being tallied, the ruling party in Georgia had a commanding lead in the parliamentary elections held Wednesday, cementing President Mikheil Saakashvili and his party's place as the nation's pre-eminent political force.
 With two-thirds of the polling precincts reporting, Mr. Saakashvili's United National Movement party had more than 62 percent of the vote, Levan Tarkhnishvili, the chairman of the central election commission, said by telephone. The ruling party's main opponent, the United Opposition bloc, had slightly more than 14 percent. 
 The opposition complained of irregularities in both the campaign and the vote, and vowed to challenge the results.
 International election monitors agreed that the elections, while improved over past years, were still far from perfect. In a statement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that its observers had heard ''numerous allegations of intimidation, some of which could be verified.''
 The group further noted that the ''distinction between state activities and the government party's campaign was often blurred,'' and that there were ''significant procedural shortcomings'' with the counting and tabulation of the vote. 
 But the wide margin suggested that Mr. Saakashvili, his reputation as a democrat and a reformer tarnished by a police crackdown against unarmed protesters and an opposition television station in November, would maintain his unchallenged hold on the country's politics and course.
 Mr. Tarkhnishvili said he hoped that the full preliminary results would be released Thursday night, and both the opposition and the ruling party were awaiting the report from the election monitors.
 Even before the results and assessments were in, Mr. Saakashvili claimed victory, and said the support was larger than he had predicted.
 ''I didn't expect to recover so well after the political crisis we had last year,'' he said by telephone. ''We wanted a new mandate for reforms, and it looks like we've got it.''
 Three opposition parties appeared to pass the 5 percent threshold required to gain seats in Parliament. But even if those parties were to form a coherent coalition, they appeared destined to lack the seats to be a counterweight to Mr. Saakashvili's rule.
 Mr. Saakashvili, a lawyer educated at Columbia University, came to power after a peaceful revolution overthrew the government of President Eduard Shevardnadze in 2003.
 He has been staunchly pro-Western, seeking access to the European Union and NATO and sending troops to the American-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The country's once stagnant economy has partly revived during his years in power, although poverty and unemployment remain pervasive, especially in rural areas.
 Mr. Saakashvili has also pushed his small nation in the Caucasus onto the global stage, as tensions with neighboring Russia have surged during his presidency.
 The tensions are related in part to his effort to pull Russian-supported breakaway regions in Georgia back under federal control, but also to his steady and vocal criticism of both the Kremlin's regional dominance and of the Soviet past.
 There have been signs of disaffection at home, however, since his rise to the presidency in the role of revolutionary hero.
 His opponents say that power has changed him, and that he has become arrogant and intolerant of dissent and rules the country through a small circle of insiders, some of whom are corrupt. Mr. Saakashvili's Georgia, his critics say, lacks the balance of powers of a healthy democratic system, and is run by cliquish Caucasus rules.
 Giorgi Targamadze, the leader of the opposition Christian-Democratic Movement of Georgia, a new political party, said that parliamentary elections suffered from ballot-stuffing for the government and the suppression of votes for the opposition.
 ''Unfortunately, this election was in the same tradition as bad past elections,'' he said. He said in some cases the misconduct ''was not an election problem but a serious crime.''
 The initial tallies suggested his party had received about 8.5 percent of the vote. That is enough for seats in Parliament, but less than what Mr. Targamadze said was the 14 or 15 percent he expected based on surveys of voters leaving the polls.
 A former news anchor at Imedi TV, which was raided by the police during the crackdown last year and forced off the air, Mr. Targamadze called on the president to reach out to the opposition and include them in governing the country.
 ''Saakashvili must do something to restore the trust of political parties,'' he said.
 Mr. Saakashvili, who has never hidden his disdain for the opposition, acknowledged a decline in his support since 2003, but suggested that the population saw him and his government as the most competent choice.
 ''People are basically ready to give my government another chance,'' he said.
 The parliamentary elections had been framed by diplomats and analysts as an important test of whether Georgia's ruling party and Mr. Saakashvili could restore their now checkered reputations after the crackdown in the fall, and after Mr. Saakashvili's victory in a snap presidential election this year.

HEADLINE: Veterans' Benefits Bill Wins Approval in Senate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Twenty-five Republican senators broke with President Bush and voted Thursday for a major expansion of veterans' benefits as part of a bill to finance another year of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The proposal, adopted by a vote of 75 to 22, also provides money for extended unemployment insurance benefits and other domestic programs to which Mr. Bush has objected.
 The size of the vote surprised Republican leaders, provided fresh evidence of the president's lame-duck status and suggested that election-year politics had fractured Republican unity. 
 While 25 Republicans supported the proposal, 22 opposed it. Forty-eight Democrats and two independents voted for the bipartisan measure, drafted by two Vietnam veterans, Senators Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, and Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.
 The proposal on veterans' benefits was approved by a veto-proof majority, with support from conservative Republican senators including Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Thune of South Dakota.
 The bill now goes back to the House, where its future course is somewhat uncertain. The House had endorsed a similar expansion of education benefits for veterans, but has also adopted policy measures to speed the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The Senate rejected efforts to limit the president's hand in Iraq.
 Senators John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said they were in the Senate today because of the help they had received under an earlier G.I. Bill.
 Mr. Hagel said the new legislation ''fulfills the commitment that America made in 1944, and has continued, to honor every generation of veterans since World War II.''
 The White House and the Pentagon said they feared that the bill would encourage men and women to leave the armed forces and enroll in college with federal aid, at a time when the military already has difficulty retaining troops to fight abroad.
 But Mr. Webb and other supporters of the bill said the benefits would help the armed forces recruit and retain personnel. 
 ''There are no politics here,'' Mr. Webb said. ''This is about taking care of the people who have taken care of us.''
 Under the bill, veterans who have served in the armed forces for at least three years since Sept. 11, 2001, could receive tuition assistance up to the cost of attending the most expensive public college in their state, plus a monthly housing stipend. 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the new veterans benefits would cost $52 billion in the next decade. The bill does not specify how the cost would be met.
 The bill won broad support with an assortment of domestic policy items, including a moratorium on Bush administration rules that would cut Medicaid payments to the states.
 Governors of both parties oppose the rules, which would reduce federal payments for public hospitals, teaching hospitals and services to the disabled, among others. New York, which trains 15 percent of the nation's doctors, would be particularly affected.
 After the vote, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, ''We are one step closer to making sure these devastating regulations never see the light of day.'' 
 The bill also includes money for housing and levees devastated by Hurricane Katrina, heating subsidies for low-income families, the space shuttle program, the Food and Drug Administration, biomedical research, roads and bridges, federal prisons, grants to local police departments, aid to rural schools, suppression of wildfires and preparations for the 2010 census.
 The bill would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks nationwide, with an additional 13 weeks for workers in states with high unemployment. 
 Congress also gave final approval on Thursday to a separate bill providing more than $1.2 billion in tax relief to veterans and members of the armed forces. The legislation includes tax cuts for members of the military who are receiving combat pay, saving for retirement or buying homes. It would help civilian employers keep jobs available for workers called to active military duty.
 Just before the Senate vote on veterans' benefits, President Bush, speaking to soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, urged Congress to send him a clean bill, free of extra domestic spending.
 ''Congress needs to pass a responsible war funding bill that does not tie the hands of our commanders, and gives our troops everything they need to complete and accomplish the mission,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Jim Nussle, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the president would veto the measure because it included too much money for domestic programs.
 ''It's disappointing and irresponsible that Congress has failed to complete action on a bill that funds our troops prior to Memorial Day,'' Mr. Nussle said. In linking domestic programs to war spending, he said, Congress is pursuing a ''cynical strategy.''
 But Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the administration's priorities were bizarre.
 ''When it comes to Iraq, it appears that money is no object for President Bush,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''Yet when it comes to important priorities here at home, he turns into Ebenezer Scrooge.''

HEADLINE: Respite in Oil Prices Produces an Upturn

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rebounded moderately on Thursday after two sessions of steep declines, as oil prices stepped back from their frenetic upward run.
 Oil set another trading record overnight, moving above $135 a barrel for the first time, then pulled back to settle at $130.81, offering some relief for stock investors. The Labor Department said the number of workers seeking unemployment benefits declined 9,000 last week to 365,000. The market had expected a slight increase.
 But the economic fallout from rising energy prices remained Wall Street's focus. 
 ''People are concerned about the economy and what's happening with oil,'' said Scott Fullman, director of derivatives investment strategy for the WJB Capital Group in New York.
 Mr. Fullman predicted that the markets would remain jittery and said that the low trading volumes on Thursday indicated that the gains were coming without much conviction.
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined about 427 points, or 3.3 percent, over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, the steepest two-day loss since late February.
 On Thursday, the Dow rose 24.43, or 0.2 percent, to 12,625.62. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.64, or 0.3 percent, to 1,394.35, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 16.31, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,464.58.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.90, or 0.8 percent, to close at 733.01.
 Even with the declines of more than 2 percent in the major indexes this week, stocks are still well above their mid-March lows. The Dow is 7.5 percent above its close of 11,740.15 on March 10, when investors were preoccupied with worries over the credit markets. Since then, Wall Street has reshuffled its list of concerns, placing greater emphasis on the well-being of the overall economy, not just the troubled financial companies.
 Light crude fell $2.36 to settle at $130.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 ''Hopefully it will last. But I think oil's been scaring people,'' said Todd Leone, managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Company. He said the airline industry was particularly hard hit, which ''slows down the whole economy a bit.''
 The spike in oil prices has also fanned investors' uneasiness about consumer-level inflation. The big fear is that Americans, worried about rising prices for everything, especially gasoline and food, will be less willing to reach into their wallet for other items.
 In corporate news, Ford Motor warned that it no longer expected to return to profitability by next year and that it was trimming North American production of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles for the rest of this year because of high gas prices and the shaky economy. Ford fell 64 cents, or 8.2 percent, to $7.16.
 The power wholesaler NRG Energy said it had made an offer to acquire a rival, the Calpine Corporation, for about $11 billion in stock. Calpine, which has dual headquarters in San Jose, Calif., and Houston, released details of the unsolicited bid late Wednesday. NRG fell $2.16, or 5 percent, to $40.35, while Calpine jumped $1.72, or 8 percent, to $23.
 Bond prices fell sharply on Thursday. The price of benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 30/32, to 99 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 3.91 percent from 3.81 percent.

 IMMIGRANTS FLEE SOUTH AFRICA
 As Hate Mobs Continue Terrorism
 Feneck Mgawa moved to South Africa to seek work and send cash to his family back home in Malawi. But after being beaten with sticks and pelted with rocks by a hateful mob, Mr. Mgawa intends to leave the country. He is part of a stunning reverse migration of foreigners desperate to leave South Africa after more than a week of anti-immigrant violence that has left 42 dead. PAGE A10 
 DEADLY HELICOPTER STRIKE
 An American helicopter strike killed eight civilians, including two children, during an operation against ''known terrorists'' working with the Sunni insurgent group Al Qaeda near the northern Iraqi town of Baiji, the Iraqi police said. The episode may inflame anti-American feelings already present from the admission that an American sniper had used a Koran for target practice. PAGE A16 
 CUTBACKS IN MEXICO'S DRUG PLAN
 Congress has scaled back on President Bush's anti-drug plans for Mexico and put human rights conditions on some of the aid, drawing fire from some Mexicans who accuse American lawmakers of meddling in their country's internal affairs. At issue is the performance of Mexico's army and the police, which have been accused by human rights organizations of engaging in abuses as they chase down the country's drug cartels. PAGE A6
 HOPES FOR TROOP REDUCTION IN IRAQ
 President Bush's nominees for commander of forces in the Middle East and senior commander in Baghdad told a Senate hearing that troop reductions might be possible this fall. But they acknowledged that Iraqi security forces would probably be unable to take the leading role in all provinces of the country this year. PAGE A16

 THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
 Congress, efficient? A 34-page section of the 673-page farm bill was missing from the package sent to President Bush (who vetoed it).

HEADLINE: As Market Shifts, Ford Sees Profit Fleeing

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The budding turnaround at the Ford Motor Company has stalled amid rising gas prices and falling truck sales.
 Less than a month after reporting a surprising first-quarter profit, Ford said Thursday that it would drastically scale back production and step up cost-cutting efforts in response to a sharp drop in sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles.
 Ford executives also retreated from their pledge of delivering a full-year profit for 2009. 
 The grim news underscored the toll that gas prices, now edging above a nationwide average of $3.80 a gallon, and weak economic conditions have taken on nationwide auto sales.
 Ford is now forecasting that industry demand for cars and light trucks will be 14.7 million to 15.1 million vehicles -- the lowest point in more than a decade.
 The biggest losers in the market are the big pickups and S.U.V.'s that Ford and its domestic rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, rely on for much of their profits.
 ''We saw a real change in the industry demand in pickups and S.U.V.'s in the first two weeks of May,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said Thursday. ''It seems to us we reached a tipping point.''
 The slide in pickup sales, which are tied closely to housing starts and construction activity, was particularly startling.
 Last year, pickups accounted for about 14 percent of the overall United States market, but they now represent 9 percent.
 Mr. Mulally said the striking shift by consumers from trucks and S.U.V.'s into smaller cars and crossovers now appears to be ''structural in nature'' rather than a short-term reaction to gas prices. ''We needed to act now,'' he said.
 Ford will cut its overall North American production by 15 percent in the current quarter from year-ago levels, as well as 15 to 20 percent in the third quarter and 2 to 8 percent in the fourth quarter.
 While pickup and S.U.V. production will be substantially reduced, the automaker said it would increase its output of more fuel-efficient models like the Focus and Fusion passenger cars and the Edge crossover vehicle.
 ''They had no choice but to do this now,'' said Joseph S. Phillippi of the firm AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J. ''The big trucks and S.U.V.'s are going to be under a lot of pressure for the rest of this year and probably next year, too.''
 How G.M. and Chrysler will react to the market shift remains to be seen.
 G.M.'s truck production has already been curtailed because of a 12-week strike at American Axle and Manufacturing, a key supplier. Chrysler, for its part, started the year with markedly lower production plans in anticipation of a difficult market.
 The announcement by Ford on Thursday was unexpected, given the bright outlook of the automaker when it reported a $100 million first-quarter profit last month.
 It appeared the company had turned the corner after losing a combined $15.3 billion in 2006 and 2007. But escalating gas prices and costs for materials like steel have hurt the company. 
 Mr. Mulally declined to say when Ford would achieve a companywide full-year profit, only that the automaker expects to break even in 2009.
 ''Unless there is a fairly rapid turnaround in U.S. business conditions, which we are not anticipating, it now looks like it will take longer than expected to reach our North American profitability goal,'' he said.
 Further cuts are also likely. Ford has reduced its hourly work force by about a third through buyouts and early retirement offers since 2006, and another 4,200 workers accepted a second round of buyouts earlier this year.
 Mr. Mulally said that more buyouts would be offered plant by plant, and that white-collar jobs could be cut as well. He also did not rule out more factory closings.
 ''What we're really trying to do is understand what the real demand is going to be going forward,'' he said.
 Ford's domestic sales were already down about 10 percent through the first four months of this year, when gas prices began soaring above $3.50 a gallon in early May.
 ''The traffic in the showroom got very challenging,'' said Doug Erickson, a Ford dealer in Hastings, Minn. ''And I'm afraid it's going to get worse.''
 What few customers he has are interested in high-mileage cars like the Focus, Mr. Erickson said. In terms of inventory of the Ford F-Series pickup, ''if you've got one on the lot, you've probably got enough,'' he said.
 Ford expects to maintain a 14 percent share of the United States market this year, Mr. Mulally said, and will accelerate plans to bring small cars and crossovers it sells in international markets to North America.
 While Ford's comeback hit a speed bump, it appears that one of its largest investors now has a clear path to increasing his stake in the automaker.
 Ford's board said Thursday that it would remain neutral on whether shareholders should participate in a tender offer by the billionaire financier Kirk Kerkorian to acquire 20 million shares at a price of $8.50.
 The automaker's shares were down more then 8 percent in trading Thursday, closing at $7.16 a share.
 Mr. Kerkorian, who previously built large stakes in G.M. and Chrysler, disclosed last month that he had acquired a 4.7 percent stake in Ford. Mr. Kerkorian paid an average of $6.90 a share for his initial stake of 100 million shares.

HEADLINE: 3 Auditioning to Be McCain's No. 2 Gain Qualified Backing

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
As Senator John McCain prepared to meet this weekend with three potential running mates, state Republican leaders across the country on Thursday gave a tentative nod of approval to those prospects while pointing to the possible suitability of others and emphasizing that Mr. McCain needed to please the party's conservative base.
 Many party officials said they could support those who will be meeting with Mr. McCain at his Arizona ranch: Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. 
 But they also cited other possibilities, including Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Indeed, though Mr. McCain's campaign has declined to comment on his vice-presidential search, his guests this weekend are just three among dozens of prospects believed to be on a rough list of his.
 ''I'm still perceiving a need to reassure his base,'' said Kris Kobach, the Kansas Republican chairman, one of the state party leaders interviewed Thursday. ''I think he has got to reassure conservatives that he respects the core principles of the Republican Party through this vice-presidential pick. I think that has to be the primary objective of his vice-presidential choice. He can't take conservative enthusiasm for granted.'' 
 Party leaders said Mr. Crist, Mr. Jindal and Mr. Romney shared several qualities that many Republican officials hoped for in a No. 2 on the ticket. All are youthful and Washington outsiders, current or former state governors who would offer a balance to the age and 22-year Senate tenure of the 71-year-old Mr. McCain.
 ''I'm very pleased to see that they're all governors,'' said Saul Anuzis, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. ''There's been a sense that it would be great to get someone outside of Washington and to get a governor in that second spot.''
 Mr. Romney in particular has emerged as a favorite among state party officials who met him during his failed campaign for the presidential nomination. Many said his fund-raising prowess, coupled with his high national profile and enthusiasm for long days of campaigning, would make him an attractive running mate. 
 He could also help woo voters in Michigan, his native state, and in the swing state of New Hampshire, and even give Republicans a shot in solidly Democratic Massachusetts, where Senator Barack Obama lost the Democratic primary. 
 ''He's a great campaigner,'' said Robert A. Gleason Jr., the Pennsylvania Republican chairman. ''I think he would be dynamite, especially with his background in business and economic affairs.'' 
 Doug McKinney, chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, said Mr. McCain needed ''a pure conservative'' who was strong on the economy. 
 ''He admittedly says that the economy is his weak point,'' Mr. McKinney said, ''so I think he needs to have somebody with a proven record on economics and how to manage a state.''
 Some party officials rejected the idea of a running mate from an existing Republican stronghold like South Carolina or Texas, challenging the wisdom of choosing someone who might not add electoral muscle. In contrast, Mr. Crist was cited frequently as a candidate who could help deliver Florida, the swing state where he presides as governor. 
 ''He's a twofer,'' said Mr. Gleason, noting that Mr. Crist was born in Altoona, Pa. ''When he's in Pennsylvania, we'll promote him as a Pennsylvanian, and when he's in Florida, he'll be a Floridian.''
 Although the Republicans will face off against a historic Democratic nominee, having a minority member or a woman as Mr. McCain's running mate is ''not a priority,'' said Tom Wilson, the New Jersey Republican chairman. 
 ''All those secondary qualities are nice,'' Mr. Wilson said, ''but they're deep down the list, in my book.'' 
 Mr. Wilson suggested that if Mr. McCain did decide to choose a woman, he could turn to Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman, former executives who are now advising the campaign.
 Others pointed to a prominent black Republican, Michael Steele, the chairman of Gopac, which tries to groom Republican candidates. 
 ''If we're worried about race being a question, Michael Steele is a brilliant guy, and no one would question his conservative credentials,'' said Mr. McKinney, of West Virginia. 
 Christopher C. Healy, the party chairman in Connecticut, said he believed that the importance of the vice-presidential nominee was overstated.
 ''It's a great parlor game we all play,'' Mr. Healy said. ''You look back at the Dan Quayle pick, and everybody thought that would be ruinous. And Michael Dukakis won 10 states.''

HEADLINE: Alaska Governor Proposes $500 Million in Subsidies for a Gas Pipeline

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska on Thursday proposed granting state subsidies to a Canadian company to build a long-sought natural gas pipeline.
 The 1,715-mile pipeline would deliver natural gas from the North Slope of the state to markets in Alaska and the lower United States. Ms. Palin, a Republican, proposed providing $500 million in matching funds to the company, TransCanada.
 The plan comes as the appetite for natural gas has increased nationally and the state is looking for economic alternatives as oil production on the slope declines. But the proposal faces considerable obstacles, both in the State Legislature and the private sector. 
 The pipeline, which could supply as much as 7 percent of the current natural gas use of the United States, would extend from the North Slope, over the Brooks Range and into Alberta, Canada, where it would connect with pipelines that deliver gas to Canada and the United States. It would cost $30 billion to $60 billion, and it would not be completed until at least 2017 and potentially several years after that. 
 ''A domestic supply of clean energy, you can't go wrong with this,'' Ms. Palin said in a phone interview on Thursday. ''We're ready to tap it.''
 The pipeline has been a dream for Alaska for decades, and Ms. Palin, a popular governor, made it a central focus when she ran for office in 2006. Her administration said the pipeline would be the largest construction project ever in North America, bringing jobs and economic stability to Alaska, as well as a reliable source of energy. 
 Ms. Palin's proposal now goes to the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has created special committees to review the plan over the next two months. Lawmakers, like Alaskans in general, are overwhelmingly in favor of building the pipeline. It is the details of how to do so that create conflict.
 State Senator Bert Stedman, vice chairman of a special Senate committee involved in the review, said that market conditions would ultimately shape the way the pipeline is developed and that Ms. Palin's plan appeared to take a great risk by offering so much in incentives to TransCanada. Mr. Stedman said the company would have no guarantee that producers that own rights to the gas on the slope would commit to using the TransCanada pipeline.
 Then again, Mr. Stedman said, the producers are looking for firm commitments on future gas tax rates from the state, giving some leverage back to the state and TransCanada. 
 ''How do you get it financed where there's a return to the investors and the state is treated fairly and compensated for its resources?'' Mr. Stedman said.
 Two of the three major producers on the North Slope, BP and ConocoPhillips, announced last month that they were moving forward with building a pipeline on their own, and that demand and the high price of natural gas meant they would not need subsidies from the state. They say they have committed to spending $600 million on early development of the pipeline. 
 ''We're confident we can build this project,'' said Steve Rinehart, a spokesman for BP Alaska, which runs Prudhoe Bay, the nation's largest oil field. ''We're going forward no matter what. We're interested in what's being said today, but we've already started.''
 Ms. Palin said her plan was superior because it included ''enforceable commitments'' from TransCanada and gas producers that want to use the line, including an ability to expand the line so new companies can use it, at reasonable rates. Mr. Rinehart said the producers were ready to meet those requirements, too, but Ms. Palin said there was no concrete evidence that was true.
 With the state's economy in the balance as oil production declines, the governor said: ''We don't have time to mess around. It is time to get the project built and not just keep guessing what the oil producers want from the state.''

HEADLINE: Generals Tell Senate They Hope for Modest Cut in U.S. Troops in Iraq This Fall

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT and STEVEN LEE MYERS; David Stout reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Fort Bragg, N.C. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush's nominees for commander of forces in the Middle East and senior commander in Baghdad told a Senate hearing on Thursday that modest troop reductions might be possible this fall and that the United States might not need to strengthen patrols for provincial elections now expected in November.
 But they acknowledged that Iraqi security forces would probably be unable to take the lead in all provinces of the country this year, as the Pentagon had optimistically predicted in December in an assessment of conditions. Gen. David H. Petraeus said at the hearing on his nomination to lead the military's Central Command, which includes the Middle East and some adjacent areas, that the provincial elections would probably be held in November rather than October. The reason for the delay, he said, is the recent violence in Basra. 
 That might mean that Iraq's next vote occurs after presidential and Congressional elections in the United States on Nov. 4. 
 Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, nominated to succeed General Petraeus as the top United States commander in Iraq, said he did not foresee a need for extra troops to guard against violence around the time of the Iraqi elections. Nevertheless, in response to a question from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who took time from her presidential campaign to vote on a war spending bill and attend the hearing of the Armed Services Committee, General Odierno said, ''I will never say 'never.' ''
 As expected. General Petraeus forecast modest, further troop reductions before he leaves the Iraq command in the fall.
 ''I do believe that there will be certain assets that, as we are already looking at the picture right now, we'll be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall,'' he said. 
 Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the panel, said, ''That, I think, is good news to most of us.'' He complimented the officers' qualifications, indicating their confirmation was all but assured. ''Regardless of one's view of the wisdom of the policy that took us to Iraq in the first place and has kept us there over five years, we owe General Petraeus and General Odierno a debt of gratitude,'' he said. ''And regardless how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide.''
 President Bush, during a visit on Thursday to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., again deferred to General Petraeus for any decision on more withdrawals. Another brigade of the division is headed back to Iraq in the fall. 
 ''My message to our commanders is this: You will have all the troops, you will have all the resources, you need to win in Iraq,'' Mr. Bush said at the division's annual review ceremony before 17,000 soldiers, as well as their families and friends. 
 Having faced criticism that he had not outlined a strategy for ending America's role in Iraq, or reducing it, Mr. Bush sought to do so, though only broadly.
 ''Success will be when Al Qaeda has no safe havens in Iraq and Iraqis can protect themselves,'' he said. ''Success will be when Iraq is a nation that can support itself economically. Success will be when Iraq is a democracy that governs itself effectively and responds to the will of its people. Success will be when Iraq is a strong and capable ally in the war on terror.''
 Mr. Bush cited Iraq's military operations in Basra and Baghdad, and declining inflation and increasing oil production, as progress. He also praised Iraq's leaders, who have begun passing legislation that is viewed as necessary for political reconciliation.
 ''We can't expect them to reach agreement on every issue,'' he said. ''But we can expect Iraqis of all backgrounds to take an increasingly active role in the democratic process, share power and settle disputes by debating in the halls of government rather than fighting in the streets.''
 Mr. Bush toured a barracks that became notorious in April when the father of a sergeant returning from Afghanistan posted video online showing poor conditions there, including backed up sewage in the latrine.
 The Army said it had spent $3 million on repairs since. Mr. Bush, touring that latrine, now repainted and spotless, said the fort's older barracks were being replaced by new ones.

HEADLINE: Ex-Worker In Child Care Is Sought In Smut Case

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
A former employee of a Manhattan company that provides emergency child care for workers at high-profile corporations is being sought by the authorities for possessing child pornography on his home computer, the police said on Friday. 
 Investigators are searching for the man, Fred Glen Hardy, and are distributing fliers to law enforcement agencies in the metropolitan area in the effort to apprehend him, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.
 ''The police intend to arrest him upon locating him, for possession of child pornography,'' Mr. Browne said. He would not say how the police had learned about the pornography.
 Mr. Hardy, 29, who the police said lives on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, was hired in October 2006 as a part-time teacher at the Lipton Child Care Center, on Park Avenue at East 55th Street, said Ilene H. Serpa, a spokeswoman for the center's parent company, Bright Horizons Family Solutions of Watertown, Mass.
 The Lipton center caters to several high-profile employers, including The New York Times, the New York Stock Exchange and the World Bank, as well as law firms, major-league sports teams and others. The children at the Manhattan center range in age from infancy to 12 years, Ms. Serpa said.
 On May 14, the police searched Mr. Hardy's home and seized ''thousands of images of boys ranging from 6 to 8 months to 14 years,'' Mr. Browne said. He added that the origin of the images was undetermined.
 When detectives arrived at Mr. Hardy's workplace on May 15, he was not there, the police said. He was fired that day, Ms. Serpa said, adding that fellow employees had not seen or heard from him since.
 ''From what we know, the investigation has to do with activities at his residence and in no way involved his employment or any children at the center,'' Ms. Serpa said.
 The police learned that Mr. Hardy had worked as a student teacher at the University of New Mexico on four separate occasions between February 2003 and August 2006. They are making inquiries there, in Virginia, and in Mr. Hardy's home state, Washington, Mr. Browne said.

HEADLINE: Cable's Costly Grip On America's TVs

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Americans discouraged by higher gas prices and airline fares may decide to spend more vacation time at home, perhaps watching television.
 But that, too, will cost them more than ever. 
 Cable prices have risen 77 percent since 1996, roughly double the rate of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this month. 
 Cable customers, who typically pay at least $60 a month, watch only a fraction of what they pay for -- on average, a mere 13 percent of the 118 channels available to them. And the number of subscribers keeps growing. 
 The resiliency of cable is all the more remarkable because the Internet was supposed to change all things digital. Technology has led to more choices and lower prices for news and music as well as cellphone and landline minutes -- not to mention computers, cameras, music players and phones themselves. 
 Yet here is a rare instance where Silicon Valley has failed to break a traditional media juggernaut. And not for lack of trying. 
 Technology companies keep insisting they will provide new low-cost ways to get video into the home, but so far their efforts have created more black boxes to stash under the TV, not real competition for cable that could bring prices down. 
 ''A couple of years ago, there was a thesis that we were at the twilight of Comcast as the gatekeeper,'' said Craig Moffett, a cable industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''That thesis still titillates some. But technologically and economically, it's probably not going to happen.''
 So why hasn't technology had a bigger impact? One answer is the alliance between cable companies and Hollywood producers of content to sell channels in bundles, rather than letting consumers pay only for the channels they want.
 The producers of cable television content share $15 billion to $20 billion a year in fees from cable subscribers, roughly equal to the $20 billion they receive in advertising revenue, Mr. Moffett said. 
 Without those fees, the cable companies say, prices would go up. 
 ''If each channel depended on individual consumers electing to pay individually for it, this would slash potential viewership and seriously hurt the ability of most channels to attract their current level of advertising dollars,'' said Jenni Moyer, a spokeswoman for Comcast. ''Lost ad revenue would have to be replaced by higher license fees.'' 
 The industry says the digital era has brought its customers better image quality, more on-demand services and solid value through packages that combine cable, phone and Internet service. It also says consumers are actually getting more viewing value for their dollar, at least relative to inflation. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association says that from 1998 to 2006, the price consumers paid for each viewing hour was essentially flat.
 The chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission, Gregory S. Crawford, disagrees, saying the industry is not factoring in the real cost of the programming that subscribers are watching. By his analysis, the increase has been around 50 percent from 1997 to 2005. 
 The F.C.C. and some politicians have been in a pitched battled with the cable industry, trying to get it voluntarily to offer so-called a la carte pricing. But cable companies insist that this is not economically feasible.
 Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview that since 1996, when Congress increased competition in telecommunications, prices have dropped for many other services.
 ''We've seen the opposite occur in the cable industry,'' he said. ''The dramatic increases in pricing we've seen are one of the most troubling issues from a consumer point of view.'' 
 In 2007, average monthly revenue for each Cablevision subscriber was $75, up from $65 in 2005, according to SNL Kagan, a research company. At Time Warner it was $64, up from $54.50. 
 The cable industry has never felt the pricing pressures the music industry is feeling. The most obvious reason is that Internet speeds have not been fast enough to permit easy downloading of movies and other video material. 
 That is changing, though. People are viewing millions of videos online each month -- albeit mostly short video clips, and not Hollywood movies. At the same time, the use of file-sharing tools like BitTorrent to download illegally popular movies and television shows is growing.
 Another factor helping the cable industry is the difficulty of getting video from the computer onto the TV. That may not be a deterrent for those who have grown accustomed to watching movies on their laptop. But the last thing many consumers want to do is hook up wires or program a new box before sitting back to relax and watch TV.
 In that sense, the lure of cable appears to have a sociological component. In a stress-filled life, cable television is easy to use. 
 ''I work eight hours a day facing a computer. When I come home, the last thing I want to do is mess with another computer,'' said Eric Yu, 24, a college student in San Francisco who pays around $80 a month for cable. 
 Mr. Yu said he watches only a handful of channels, including some in high definition like National Geographic. But to get them, he has to pay for a premium package. ''I just pay the bill and try to forget about it,'' he said. ''It lessens the pain.''
 Evelyn Tan, 22, a friend of Mr. Yu, takes a different approach. She pays Comcast $33 a month for Internet access and does not get cable television -- but she does watch TV programming. 
 In fact, she watches ABC shows like ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Gray's Anatomy,'' which are free on the Web. When she wants to watch shows or movies that are not readily available online, she says she easily pirates them. ''I would not pay for cable TV at all,'' she said. 
 Broadcast networks like ABC, NBC and Fox are starting to put their programming on the Internet. But most cable channels do not because they depend on subscriber revenue.
 Albert Cheng, executive vice president for digital media at the Disney-ABC Television Group, said the industry was trying to prepare for an era in which more video is watched on computers.
 ''It wasn't lost on us what happened to the music industry,'' Mr. Cheng said. Even though the audience is growing for ABC shows online, he said, this is supplementing, rather than undercutting, the television audience. 
 Enter Silicon Valley. It is trying to marry the content people want with their preferred setting for viewing it. There is a host of new set-top boxes and consumer devices aimed at bringing video and other content from the Internet to the TV.
 Apple's iTunes store offers 20,000 episodes of some 800 shows at typically $1.99 or $2.99 an episode, effectively creating an a la carte option. But consumers must either watch on their computers, wire the computer to the television or get an Apple TV. 
 This week Roku, a Silicon Valley start-up, began selling a $99 box that streams movies from Netflix straight to the TV. And this summer Hewlett-Packard is expected to introduce a device called the MediaSmart Connect, a sleek box connecting computer and TV that lets users watch Internet videos as well as rent or buy some 6,000 movies through CinemaNow, an H.P. partner.
 But the box will also demonstrate how much of a gap still separates the computer screen and the TV screen.
 Carlos Montalvo, vice president for marketing of connected entertainment at H.P., said the MediaSmart Connect and similar devices would not offer much of the programming provided over cable, or even programming that content companies allow to be delivered over the Internet to computers. The reason, he said, is that this content is licensed to be shown only on a computer, not delivered via computer to a TV.
 ''Simply because the technology is there doesn't mean that the large opus of content -- both television and movies -- that is available on the two-foot screen can move automatically to the large-screen TV,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Boom Times for Brazil's Consumers

BYLINE: By ANDREW DOWNIE

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
Consumers in the United States are tightening their belts; Brazilians are spending like there's no word in Portuguese for recession.
 Middle-class Americans are surrounded by a rising tide of angst; Brazil's middle class is growing. 
 Even some creditworthy Americans cannot find a mortgage; Brazilians are taking out loans like never before.
 ''It used to be that when the U.S. sneezes, Brazil catches pneumonia, but that is no longer the case,'' said Marcelo Carvalho, executive director of research at Morgan Stanley in Brazil. 
 Thanks to a newfound economic stability and vitality, here and in much of the region, Latin America is looking less chained to the fortunes of the United States. ''There is hard decoupling taking place,'' Mr. Carvalho said. ''The Brazilian economy is growing fast as the U.S. is, in our view, already in recession.'' 
 Brazil is doing well thanks to a combination of factors. High commodity prices, pushed by demand from China, have brought in hard currency and created jobs. 
 Foreign investment last year doubled, to $34.6 billion, much of it into the stock market, which is one of the fastest growing in the world. The currency is strong, hitting a nine-year high against the dollar last week, and will likely strengthen further given Standard & Poor's decision last week to raise Brazil's investment grade. 
 Inflation, which ended 2007 at 4.5 percent, is under control and the economy has grown consistently, if not spectacularly, thanks to the competent management of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. His far-reaching assistance program has given the poor cash to spend. Wages are rising and unemployment is falling.
 In short, more Brazilians have more money. 
 Mr. da Silva calls it a miracle. But in reality, it is something Latin American long lacked: confidence. 
 With both government and outside analysts insisting the economy can withstand the effects of a global slowdown, banks and companies are sanguine enough to lend to consumers over longer periods than ever before. At the same time, an increasingly secure middle class is confident enough to borrow -- to such an extent, analysts say, that domestic consumption has taken over from exports as Brazil's main economic driver, reducing the effect of what happens in, say, the United States.
 Because of the twin economic and credit booms, big-ticket items like houses, cars and electronics are within the reach of up to 20 million more Brazilians than ever before, Erico Ferreira, the president of the National Association of Credit, Financing and Investment Institutions, estimated.
 ''People that weren't consumers are now consumers,'' Mr. Ferreira said. ''Everyone is taking more money home. If you want credit you can get it.''
 A trip to any shopping mall or car dealership suggests that is true. Stores are packed with shoppers eager to spend. Sales of domestic appliances rose 17 percent last year, the number of cellphones increased 21 percent and sales of notebook computers and plasma and liquid-crystal display televisions nearly tripled.
 For items like cars and houses, where paying in cash is rarely feasible, the numbers are even more revealing. The number of houses bought with mortgages rose 72 percent last year to its highest number ever and the amount of money being borrowed to buy vehicles jumped 45 percent. 
 The credit explosion is a regional phenomenon, according to economists. 
 Though Latin American nations have little tradition of consumer credit, the amount of money being lent is growing rapidly, said Gregorio Goity, an Argentine economist and former head of the Iberoamerican Federation of Financial Associations.
 ''The overall totals are low because they come from low starting levels,'' Mr. Goity said. 
 ''But I can't think of one where it isn't growing,'' he added, referring to Latin America. ''People who didn't have a fridge, a washing machine, a sewing machine, a heater for winter, an air-conditioner for summer, they can buy this now and improve their quality of life substantially.'' 
 The new reality is clearest in Brazil -- where the amount of money put on credit cards rose 20 percent last year -- and particularly in the auto market. A record 2.46 million vehicles were driven off car lots last year, according to the National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers. Sales are up 31 percent so far this year.
 The reason, Mr. Lula and experts agree, is the change in payment plans. Until recently, interest rates were so high and Brazil's economy so unpredictable that banks would not lend for extended periods of time.
 Interest rates stood at 25 percent when Mr. Lula took power in 2003 but fell to 11.25 percent last year, still among the highest in the world but low by Brazilian standards. And although inflationary fears prompted the country's central bank to raise its rates 0.5 percent last month, the first increase in more than two years, most consumers' interest payments remain manageable. 
 The typical home mortgage rate is 12 percent a year; a car loan is about 14 percent to 15 percent; and for consumer goods, rates vary between 42 percent and 43 percent, said Felix Cardamone, president of the Brazilian Association of Credit Card and Service Companies.
 Home mortgages can be paid over 30 years, car loans can be paid up over seven and even computers and domestic appliances can be paid off on two-year plans. 
 ''There are two basic miracles: first raising people's income, and second, increasing the number of monthly payments that a person has to make to pay off the car,'' Mr. Lula said last month. 
 ''What did the automobile industry do? It increased the number of payments from 36 or 24 to 72, to 82. And what happened? What happened is the automobile industry runs the risk of reaching full production capacity next year. People are waiting in line to buy a car.''
 Sergio Troczynski was one of them. The 24-year-old commercial consultant finally picked up a silver Fiat Punto in April and fulfilled his dream of owning a new set of wheels. 
 Mr. Troczynski is typical of the new credit clan. A few years ago he could not afford the exorbitant installments. Today, however, he is paid enough to make a down payment on his dream vehicle -- and on a 32-inch television. He will pay the equivalent of $455 a month over 36 months for the car, and about $121 a month over 12 months for the television.
 ''I can only manage this because of the financing. There'd be no other way for me to afford it without that,'' Mr. Troczynski said. ''Before the banks didn't have any confidence and neither did the sales people. Credit is much easier to get and that makes it easy to buy a car, a house and pay it up over years.'' 
 Still, the number of Brazilians receiving credit remains relatively low. The volume of outstanding credit in Brazil in February was 34.9 percent of gross domestic product.
 In the euro zone countries' domestic credit to the private sector was 116 percent of G.D.P., according to World Bank figures from 2006; in the United States, it was 201 percent and in Japan it was 419 percent.
 Mr. Ferreira predicted that in Brazil, the proportion of personal debt to G.D.P. would rise from 38 percent to 40 percent this year, and increase by another 3 percent each year until 2013. It could rise higher if interest rates fall to single digits -- an unlikely situation, he believes -- because millions of Brazilians currently refuse to pay what they see as high rates. 
 ''The credit is there, it's available,'' said Divanir Gattamorta, a music teacher who was out shopping one recent Sunday with his wife. ''But we just saved up and bought a car.'' Mr. Gattamorta said they did not want to take out a loan because interest rates were abusive. 
 Experts acknowledged current rates put many people off and said those complaints simply confirmed the potential for future growth -- if and when interest rates fall farther. ''If interest rates fell to single digits the effect would be astronomical,'' said Mr. Cardamone. ''I don't doubt that the more interest rates fall the more predisposed people will be to take on loans.''

HEADLINE: Prayers for the Invisible: Immigrants Who Die in Legal Limbo

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Among the many rituals of the Roman Catholic Church, none specifically mention a Mass for the Invisible. Still, on Thursday, 12 people gathered at a church in Lower Manhattan to remember Boubacar Bah, a 52-year-old tailor from Guinea who overstayed a tourist visa and died in an immigration detention center. 
 Mr. Bah lived and died a member of a special class of the invisible. He was one of at least 66 people who died in custody between January 2004 and November 2007 while awaiting civil deportation hearings. Though it is not uncommon for people to get sick or hurt behind bars, the circumstances of Mr. Bah's death, and of the others, are largely hidden by the immigration detention process, which is subjected to little oversight or accountability. The deaths were the topic of an article this month in The New York Times, after a list of the dead was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. 
 To mark the lives of Mr. Bah and the others who died in detention, the Rev. Brian Jordan said Mass on Thursday evening at St. Andrew's, a Catholic church that sits among the courthouses of Manhattan, the secular institutions where citizens come to work out their legal issues. There is not much room or call for the undocumented to be in those buildings.
 ''If you're not a citizen, then you're a nonperson,'' Father Jordan said in his homily. ''You don't have rights.'' 
 That left the church. In his sermon, Father Jordan spoke about precepts of Roman Catholic theology that proclaim the dignity of all life -- ''Every person counts; no person is illegal. They may do illegal things'' -- but also spoke about an old promise made by the United States to the international community.
 ''Sixty years ago, we had a momentous event in history,'' Father Jordan said. ''The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One has a right to health and to be protected, even while one is in prison.''
 The number of people detained in immigration cases has more than tripled since 2001, government officials say. Many vanish into a system that has no resemblance to ordinary American legal procedures. There is no right to a lawyer, limited ability to contest evidence, and isolation from family or friends, who may themselves be vulnerable to deportation. 
 Simply making a phone call is often impossible: phones do not work, or the requirements for using them -- first punching in an Alien Registration Number, as opposed to an unrelated identification number that the detainees wear on wristbands -- are baffling, the Government Accountability Office said in a report issued last year. 
 At the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey, where Mr. Bah, the tailor, was held, 9 of 30 posted telephone numbers for foreign consulates -- the only way for many detainees to get legal help -- were wrong, the report said. 
 Somehow, Mr. Bah hurt his head. He was put into solitary confinement. He had a fractured skull and multiple brain hemorrhages. Eventually, he was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery. No one told his family until five days later, when he was already in a coma from which he would never emerge. 
 ''Some of the fastest growing industries in the United States are casinos and prisons,'' Father Jordan said. ''It's a big business. But the economy exists for the person, not the person for the economy.''
 The records of Mr. Bah's case were in a file marked ''proprietary information'' by the Corrections Corporation of America, a private company that has federal contracts to run many detention centers across the country, including the one in Elizabeth. The company, which has thrived with the immigration crackdown, contributes to both political parties. The magazine Mother Jones reported that among its lobbyists was the son-in-law of Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 The Mass at St. Andrew's was organized by the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, a nonprofit organization that provides citizenship assistance and other services to immigrants in New York, and most of those in the church were affiliated with the group. Father Jordan said that on weekly visits to an immigration detention center on Varick Street, he had seen improvements in recent years. But he said officials had told him that there wasn't enough money to do better at the Elizabeth center. 
 ''We're paying $12 billion a month for an unjust war, and we can't take proper care of the soldiers who are hurt fighting the war, and we can't take care of the squalid conditions in prisons,'' Father Jordan said. 
 ''What does it mean to be a human person?'' he asked. ''We should be outraged by the death of innocent people, with no access to health care, to their families, to lawyers.''
 Mr. Bah ''should be alive now,'' Father Jordan said. ''So should many others. Remember, the economy exists for the person -- not the other way around.''

HEADLINE: Teeth Gritted, Drivers Adjust To $4 Gasoline

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Hating every minute of it, Americans are slowly learning to live with high gasoline prices. For a nation accustomed to cheap fuel, big vehicles and sprawling suburbs, the adjustments are wrenching.
 Cory Asmus of Temecula, Calif., just bought a $4,800 motorcycle for his 20-mile drive to work so he could cut his gas bill to $8 a week, from $110.
 Florian Bialas, a retiree who lives near Chicago, sold his Pontiac Sunfire for $3,000 and plans to give up his license when it expires in September. ''I can walk to most places where I need to go,'' he said. 
 And Debbie Gloyd of Cleveland has parked her Chrysler Concorde and started taking the bus to work. ''I can't afford these gas prices,'' she said. ''They're insane.'' 
 With the nationwide average price for regular gasoline closing rapidly on $4 a gallon, people are bracing for a summer of expensive driving. 
 As the Memorial Day holiday starts the summer driving season, record prices are provoking dread and upsetting vacation plans. A recent survey by AAA, the automobile club, found a rare year-on-year decline, of 1 percent, in the number of people planning to travel this summer.
 Interviews with more than 70 people across the country suggested that the adjustments they were making, mental and otherwise, would last well beyond the summer. Americans have started trading their gas guzzlers for smaller cars, making fewer trips to the mall and, wherever possible, riding public transportation to work.
 For years, it was not clear whether rising prices would ever cause Americans to use less gas. But a combination of record prices, the slowing economy and a tight credit market has beaten consumers down. 
 Gasoline demand has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and is headed for the first annual drop in 17 years, according to government estimates. 
 The Transportation Department reported Friday that in March, Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles than in March 2007, a decline of 4.3 percent. It is the first time since 1979 that traffic has dropped from one March to the next, and the month-on-month percentage decline is the largest since record keeping began in 1942.
 High gasoline prices, plastered on 20-foot signs from coast to coast, are turning into a barometer of the country's mood.
 ''The psychology has changed,'' said Sara Johnson, an economist at Global Insight. ''People have recognized that prices are not going down and are adapting to higher energy costs. It's a capitulation.''
 Typically, gasoline sales rise before Memorial Day weekend. But gasoline sales dropped nearly 7 percent last week compared with the same week in 2007, according to an estimate by MasterCard. 
 Gasoline prices almost always rise in the summer, as demand increases. On Friday, gasoline prices reached yet another record, a nationwide average of nearly $3.88 a gallon. That figure was up 4 cents in one day and is 65 cents higher than this time last year, according to AAA. Diesel hit $4.65 a gallon on Friday, up $1.73 a gallon in a year.
 The force behind high gasoline prices is the high price of oil, which is being driven up by soaring worldwide demand. Oil reached a record above $133 a barrel this week, nearly five times as expensive as it was five years ago. 
 All this has led to a vast transfer of wealth from American drivers to domestic and foreign oil producers. Every one-cent increase in gasoline prices means Americans pay $1.42 billion more a year for gas, according to Stephen P. Brown, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Nearly two-thirds of that goes to foreign producers. 
 In the first four months of the year, Americans spent $158 billion on gasoline. In 2003, just as oil prices started to take off, they spent $88 billion over the same four-month period, according to Michael McNamara, vice president for MasterCard's Spending Pulse, an indicator of weekly gasoline sales. 
 Whether today's high costs will translate into a permanent change in behavior remains to be seen, of course. The Energy Department expects gasoline sales to fall by 0.6 percent this year, the first drop since 1991, but it expects consumption to rebound in 2009 as the economy strengthens.
 Still, analysts said that the hardship induced by today's prices is getting close to the level reached during the oil shock of the early 1980s. 
 Americans spend 3.7 percent of their disposable income on transportation fuels. At its lowest point, that share was 1.9 percent in 1998, and at its highest, it reached 4.5 percent in 1981, said Ms. Johnson of Global Insight. 
 Still, despite the rise in energy prices, gasoline remains cheaper in the United States than in most industrialized countries. In France, for example, a gallon of gasoline costs about $7.70 at today's exchange rates. Also, Americans pay less to drive a mile today than they did in 1980, once the impact of inflation and gains in fuel efficiency are taken into account, said Lee Schipper, a visiting scholar at the transportation center of the University of California, Berkeley.
 Mr. Schipper estimates that the cost of gasoline for each mile traveled will be about 15 cents this year. That is nearly three times the low of 5.6 cents a mile reached in 1998, when fuel efficiency peaked and prices were at their lowest. But it is still cheaper than the record paid in 1980 of 17.1 cents a mile, adjusted for inflation.
 The oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s introduced the nation's first efforts to curb consumption, including the first fuel efficiency standards and scaled-back speed limits. These had an impact on gasoline demand, which fell each year from 1979 to 1985. But then oil prices collapsed, political pressure evaporated, and many consumers lost interest in small cars.
 ''This is the wake-up call,'' Mr. Schipper said. ''We actually have a lot of choices, based on what car we drive, where we live, how much time we choose to drive, and where we choose to go. But you have built in a very strong car dependency. And when the price hits the fan, people have a hard time coping.'' 
 For many people, higher energy costs mean fewer restaurant meals, deferred weekend outings with the family, less air travel and more time closer to home. Big-box retailers are suffering as customers balk at driving to the mall, airlines have slapped on steep fuel surcharges and carmakers have seen their sales slump. On Thursday, the Ford Motor Company announced production cuts because of sharply lower demand for sport utility vehicles and pickups.
 In Los Angeles, Ron and Patricia Lowe spend more time at home on weekends, hanging out and barbecuing. They are also more likely to leave their house together now, scheduling fewer car trips and bundling their chores to cut the gas bill.
 ''If I go to the grocery store, and the mall and pick up some prescription, I do it in one shot,'' he said. 
 As gasoline prices have risen to record highs, consumer confidence, as measured in surveys, has fallen to its lowest level since 1980.
 ''The whole gas price situation makes me so angry,'' says Lissa Nash, 39, a single mother struggling to raise her two sons on a modest nursing assistant's salary. To make ends meet, she has started working extra shifts at a suburban Chicago hospital, picking up whatever overtime is available. 
 ''Rising gas prices end up hurting working, lower class people like me, who can't afford it anymore,'' Ms. Nash said.
 The higher costs ripple through the economy in unusual ways. In Round Lake, Ill. $3 still buys a wriggling tangle of night crawlers in a dirt-filled Styrofoam cup. But Marty Badegian, the 72-year-old owner of the Red Worm Ranch Bait Shop, says he might have to raise prices after his vendor imposed a $5-an-order gas surcharge. 
 ''The gas prices are killing us,'' Mr. Badegian said.
 In Encinitas, Calif., Ryan Andrews, 23, and Tara Driscoll, 21, arrived at the beach red-faced and sweating from riding their bicycles in 80-degree weather. 
 They had bought their bikes the previous week and had just cycled six miles from home. Ms. Driscoll said she had gotten the bicycle so she could ride to work every day, a commute of two miles, instead of driving. 
 ''It just makes sense,'' she said.
 At Sim's Bowling Alley and Lounge, in Des Plaines, Ill., Robin Sebastian, 51, who tends bar there, sounded bitter the other day after recalling that she had just paid $46 to fill half a tank in her 1994 Buick Regal.
 ''There are too many politicians' hands in our pockets, and too many crooks in the oil companies,'' said Ms. Sebastian, an Army veteran who served in the Persian Gulf. ''I'm all for helping other countries, but we need to help our people here in the U.S. first.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the adjustment by Americans to higher gasoline prices misstated, in some editions, the year of a car owned by Florian Bialas, who lives near Chicago and plans to begin walking to save money. It was a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire, not a 1987. (The Sunfire was not introduced until the 1995 model year.)

HEADLINE: New York's Past Beckons The Future

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Here they come, chugging down Fifth Avenue with their cargo of gleeful passengers: public double-decker buses in New York City!
 The announcement on Thursday that New York City Transit might bring back the double-decker bus, last seen plying the streets on a regular basis circa 1953, is certainly good news to fans of good old New York.
 But why stop there, oh city fathers? Surely there are dozens of icons whose time has come again. Automats! Subway tokens! The Board of Estimate! More and more of the city is becoming a museum of itself anyway, so why not go whole hog?
 And since we have the technology and the regulatory smarts now, why not retrofit some of those ancient fixtures for the modern era? Picture horse-drawn vegetable wagons, like those that worked the Bronx well into the 1940s, piled high with organic microgreens. Three-card monte games with the house advantage capped at 2 percent. Polite squeegee men who check your oil and tire pressure while you wait at the light. When you think about it, the dustbin of history is a bottomless trove of riches. 
 WORLD'S FAIRS The 1939 World's Fair in Queens introduced a futuristic gizmo called a television; no less significantly, it led to the creation of what is now known as Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The 1964 fair featured the debuts of animatronics and the Ford Mustang and left behind the super-retro-cool stainless steel globe called the Unisphere. New York may have lost its bid to bring the Olympics here in 2012, but Expo 2020 is just around the corner, and the World's Fair site is ready and waiting. 
 FIVE POINTS It's Saturday night. Want to see how the other half lives? Head on down to the intersection of Worth and Mulberry Streets. Now it's a tepid agglomeration of parking lots and apartment towers, but back in the late 1800s, it was a great place to smell the vestigial stench from the Collect Pond, take in a street fight or two, get chloroformed, and wake up in a tumble-down hellhole with no money in your pocket, a big bump on your head and a great story to tell your friends.
 THE BOARD OF ESTIMATE Until the United States Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1989, the New York City Board of Estimate, composed of the five borough presidents and three citywide officials, made most of the city's major budget and land-use decisions. It may have violated the principle of one person one vote by giving sparsely populated Staten Island as much representation as Brooklyn (fourth-largest city in America, remember?), but at least it never directed millions of dollars to fictitious community groups, a la today's City Council. Or if it did, it did so with more humor and panache.
 THE AUTOMAT We're not talking about Bamn, the new version on St. Marks Place. We're talking about the old-school Horn & Hardart Automats, the last of which was on 42nd Street and Third Avenue and closed in 1991. The ones with the chrome-plated knobs and food behind little windows. But of course the fare would be updated to today's Manhattan tastes and budgets. Tea-smoked duck in a foie gras foam, anyone? Just shovel $32 into the slot, now retrofitted to accept debit cards.
 BREADBASKET QUEENS For much of the latter 19th century, historians say, Queens was the most prolific vegetable-growing county in the country. Brooklyn was no slouch either in the produce department, ranking No. 2 in 1879. The advent of refrigeration and the ever-increasing price of land in the city eventually made farming redundant here, but the geographically correct foodies known as locavores have shown a willingness to pay a steep premium for food grown within a day's drive of home. So why not pay even more for a carrot grown in the shade of the No. 7 train? Community gardeners in East New York, Red Hook and the South Bronx are already taking their crops to market. 
 QUARANTINE HOSPITALS Smallpox sufferers to Roosevelt Island, please. Plague carriers report to Swinburne Island in Lower New York Bay. Got measles? Scarlet fever? Diphtheria? Plenty of room for you and your whole family on Hoffman Island, Swinburne's neighbor to the north. New York's 19th-century sick houses lie in ruins now, but no one else, unless you count cormorants, has come up with a better use for their former sites. With multidrug-resistant tuberculosis on the rise and SARS and avian flu lurking in the wings, it's time to reinvest in the city's infectious-disease infrastructure.
 THE BROOKLYN DODGERS Walter O'Malley picked up his ball team and went west partly because the government refused to use its power of eminent domain to acquire land for him to build a stadium near the railyards on Atlantic Avenue. But the state seems to have no such compunction these days, having begun exercising eminent domain to clear a path for the developer Bruce Ratner's Atlantic Yards mega-development next door to O'Malley's would-have-been stadium site. With Atlantic Yards currently mired in economic woes, why not give the Dodgers a chance to come home? Even if half the city boycotts them, they're still guaranteed to outdraw the Nets.
 RAT-HUNTING EXPEDITIONS A good idea that was never really given a chance. In 1931, according to Robert Sullivan's comprehensive history ''Rats,'' a dentist named Harry Unger planned to lead a gun-toting posse of 12 brave men onto Rikers Island, where the rodent community had become so populous that rats were swimming to the mainland and invading residential neighborhoods. The city called the posse off, concerned that they might end up shooting humans. Times have gotten a lot tougher for hunters everywhere since then. Guided hunts for trophy animals like bear and moose are now reeling from negative publicity, and the spotted-owl huggers keep getting new species added to the endangered list. But rats are as despised and as plentiful as ever, giving New York a real shot at marketing itself as a sportsman's paradise. 
 BOOM BOXES In a more technologically innocent era, the shoulder-mounted radio was considered an aesthetic scourge right up there with graffiti and un-poop-scooped sidewalks. Now we have cellphones. Think about it: Would you rather walk down the street to the strains of the new T-Pain single or to a junior account executive loudly booking a hairdresser's appointment?
 ICE, DELIVERED FRESH Sure, you can impress friends with your Sub-Zero fridge, but have you ever had oysters cooled on a bed of ice harvested from the Adirondacks and delivered to your door by horse-drawn carriage? Rocked your Scotch with chips of unfiltered upstate wilderness? Twenty-first-century climatic conditions might require a longer journey to get the goods, but like all the finer things in life, it's worth the trip.

HEADLINE: Mortgages Without U.S. Backing Start to Rise

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Read Floyd Norris's blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE private mortgage market in the United States -- almost moribund in the wake of the subprime crisis that bankrupted some lenders last year -- is showing small signs of revival.
 In the first quarter of this year, there were $116 billion in private mortgage loans, loans not issued or insured by the federal government or a government-sponsored entity. That was up from $84 billion in the final quarter of 2007, according to a survey of lenders by Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter.
 In the wake of the collapse of the private mortgage securitization market in the second half of last year, few banks were willing to make loans that they could not sell, primarily to the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those agencies are private companies, but they have a limited right to borrow from the Treasury, and investors generally assume that the federal government will bail them out if they get into serious trouble. 
 The agencies' share of the mortgage market rose to a record 75.6 percent in the final quarter of 2007. Add in the 1.3 percent share for Department of Veterans Affairs loans, and the 4.5 percent share for the Federal Housing Administration, and the share of truly private mortgage loans fell to a record low of 18.6 percent.
 In the first quarter, the private share recovered to 24.2 percent, meaning that in a country that considers itself the bastion of private enterprise, three of four new home loans had some sort of government-related guarantee.
 ''There are more banks and other lenders increasing their portfolio lending,'' said Guy D. Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''At year-end, banks were reluctant to do any portfolio lending.'' Portfolio lending refers to an institution's making a loan and holding on to it, rather than selling it either as a mortgage or as part of a securitization package.
 Much of that private lending appears to be in jumbo mortgages, which are too large to be bought by the agencies. The limit had been $417,000, but Congress has raised it temporarily, with differing limits in various areas. 
 There is still a great reluctance to grant mortgages to subprime borrowers. Mr. Cecala estimated that $10 billion in subprime loans were made in the first quarter, a little less than in the final three months of 2007. In 2005 and 2006, about one in five dollars lent went to subprime borrowers, with a peak volume of $625 billion in 2005. 
 While there is a little more private lending activity, the private mortgage securitization market continues to shrink. Investors have not yet been reassured that new securitizations will be safer than the disastrous ones from 2006 and early 2007.
 A look at the total volume of mortgage loans helps to explain how the mess was created. In 2003, with interest rates at very low levels, a record $3.9 trillion in mortgage loans were made, most of them for refinancing. When interest rates edged up the next year, it seemed reasonable to expect a big falloff, but the decline was only 26 percent.
 Mr. Cecala said that the mortgage industry, having greatly expanded to deal with the wave of refinancings, looked for ways to keep lending. The availability of alternative products, allowing larger loans relative to value, or giving borrowers the option to make very low payments for a limited time, grew. That easy credit helped to push home prices up, until they peaked in 2006.
 Now, with mortgage defaults rising, Congress is expected to enact housing legislation to permit the F.H.A. to guarantee refinancing loans to homeowners in danger of losing their homes. A Senate committee approved a bill this week to allow such guarantees, but only if the loan amount was reduced to a figure lower than the current value of the home. Such a reduction would cause a loss for the original lender, but that loss might be smaller than it would be with the alternative: the house goes into foreclosure.

HEADLINE: A Cantankerous Crowd In No Mood for Love

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
The predictably cranky and impatient press audience offered little love to Philippe Garrel's ''Frontier of Dawn'' at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, just a weak round of applause amid a chorus of jeers. One of the most significant and, in the United States, unknown of the post-New Wave French directors, Mr. Garrel employs poetic melancholia and unhurried rhythms that were, particularly at 8:30 in the morning, either too much or not nearly enough for a crowd that had stayed up late the previous night to take in and debate ''Che,''Steven Soderbergh's ambitious epic about the revolutions won and lost by Che Guevara. (The arguments continued hotly on Friday.)
 Mr. Garrel himself has made several films about revolutionary battles, including ''Regular Lovers,'' his unbearably sad look back at France in May 1968 and afterward. Like that 2005 film, this new one, shown in competition, was shot in glorious high-contrast black-and-white and stars his son, Louis Garrel. 
 The younger Mr. Garrel plays a photographer, Francois, who falls for an unstable actress, Carole (Laura Smet), which leads to unquiet happiness and noisier anguish. On the face of it, ''Frontier of Dawn'' comes across like a familiar if peculiarly French love story, though one tinged with madness. But few other filmmakers can -- through purely visual terms, through shades of gray, meticulous framing and harmoniously balanced bodies -- convey the mysterious transformation by which ordinary men and women become the adored. 
 The irritation with which the press greeted ''Frontier of Dawn'' should have been expected: even in France, 106 minutes of extreme behavior, next to no exposition and some grand poetic flourishes (a ghost growls in a mirror) can be difficult to digest early in the morning. Although she probably would have won audiences over anyway, the American director Kelly Reichardt (''Old Joy'') was more favorably placed on Thursday evening with ''Wendy and Lucy,'' which showed in the more hospitable context of Un Certain Regard, a category for younger filmmakers. In the space of a few years, Ms. Reichardt -- who offered a few shy words of hello before the screening, flanked by a cluster of male colleagues and her lovely star, Michelle Williams -- has become one of the most interesting young American filmmakers. 
 Her latest follows Wendy (Ms. Williams), a girlish woman with watchful eyes and a hesitant smile, who, with her mutt, Lucy, is on her way to a new life in Alaska with too little money when she runs into trouble in Oregon. With uninflected realism, an attentive camera and no weeping strings, Ms. Reichardt makes palpably, tragically real what it means to be struggling at the very edge of the economic abyss. 
 Like ''Old Joy,'' which tracks two friends on a short trip to the country, ''Wendy and Lucy'' is political to the bone but without any of the usual grandstanding. As of Thursday night's screening, though distributors were circling the room, this pitch-perfect triumph had yet to attract an American buyer. It will.
 A Teacher's Tale
 By now the stalls in the Cannes Market -- a hive of global movie commerce in the bowels of the Palais des Festivals -- have been dismantled, and most of the buyers and sellers have gone home, having by all reports conducted less business than in previous years. As the festival straggles toward its climax on Sunday evening, when a jury headed by Sean Penn will hand out prizes, a subdued, slightly downcast feeling is settling over the city. 
 The widely shared opinion among critics seems to be that this wasn't such a great year. But such snap judgments can be deceptive. A film festival is by nature ephemeral, but good movies have a way of sticking around. And after enduring a few bad ones in the past few days -- why the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino keeps being invited back to Cannes is nearly as incomprehensible as ''Il Divo,'' his latest offering -- I was happy to discover Laurent Cantet's competition entry, ''Entre les Murs.'' 
 The film, Mr. Cantet's fourth feature, concerns a young teacher dealing with a tough class in an urban high school. It's hardly a new idea for a movie -- from ''To Sir With Love'' to ''Dangerous Minds'' and beyond, Hollywood has always had a soft spot for melodramas of pedagogical heroism -- but Mr. Cantet attacks it with freshness and precision, and without a trace of sentimentality.
 The teacher, Francois (played by Francois Begaudeau, himself a teacher and the author of the book on which the film is based), is devoted and hard-working but hardly a hero. He is capable of losing his cool and lashing out at his students. More frequently he resorts to sarcasm, partly to parry their provocations and partly, one suspects, to protect himself from his emotional investment in them. Not that he would admit to any such feelings. Francois is a professional, doing a difficult job with the seriousness and alacrity it demands.
 True to its title, which means ''between the walls,'' ''Entre les Murs'' never leaves the school building. We learn nothing of Francois's private life and only bits and pieces about the backgrounds of his pupils, whose faces reflect the multicultural makeup of French society today. His interactions with them generate moments of hilarity (including a raucous discussion of the imperfect subjunctive, a point of French grammar that has caused untold misery in French classes around the world) and also painful collisions and misunderstandings. 
 Mr. Cantet has long been interested in exploring the varieties of work in modern Europe. ''Human Resources'' (1999) was about changing relationships between management and labor in the industrial sector, and ''Time Out'' (2001) examined the alienation of the corporate managerial class. 
 To describe those films in such terms and to suggest that ''Entre les Murs'' extends their themes by focusing on a man who labors in the service of the state makes them sound drier and more schematic than they are. But Mr. Cantet is motivated above all by a passionate curiosity about the way people live, and he directs with such sensitivity and skill that his curiosity becomes contagious. It is not enough to call him a realist, though he is surely at the forefront of the current wave of realism in European cinema. It's simpler to say that his movies tell the truth.

HEADLINE: 40 Million Acres of Rain Forest for the Greenest Bidder

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

 BODY:
The other day I went to a meeting to hear Harrison Ford talk about saving the rain forests and ended up listening to a man who has a rain forest to save: Guyana's president, Bharrat Jagdeo. 
 The occasion was the announcement of a new campaign to protect the world's rain forests, Guyana's included, organized by the environmental group Conservation International. (Mr. Ford, a board member, was in New York to promote his new movie and somehow got his schedule wrong.) 
 That left the spotlight where it belonged: on Mr. Jagdeo and his mission to get the world's rich nations to help save Guyana's huge rain forest from chainsaws and prevent the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. 
 Mr. Jagdeo caused a stir last year when he offered to cede the management of his country's entire rain forest -- 40-plus million acres, covering 80 percent of Guyana's land mass -- to a British government agency in return for British economic assistance. Though the British have yet to take him up on the deal, Mr. Jagdeo continues to press the case for protecting not only his rain forest, but all of them.
 It is a noble and necessary mission. The rain forests form a cooling band around Earth's equator. And their accelerating loss -- from logging, farming, mining and burning -- is a major cause of climate change, accounting for one-fifth of all carbon-dioxide emissions. That is more than the amount the United States puts into the atmosphere from all sources and more than the emissions generated by all of the world's cars, trucks, buses and airplanes. 
 Rain forests serve many important purposes. They provide clean water, protection against floods and the basis for many medicines. Yet their most useful function in a warming world is to absorb carbon and store it.
 For too long these facts have been undervalued in discussions of climate change. At the Kyoto talks in 1997, for instance, various nations proposed that industrialized countries be allowed to offset some of their own emissions by paying poorer countries not to cut down their forests. European environmental groups fiercely resisted the idea, warning that this would let rich countries off the hook, and engineered the proposal's defeat. 
 That was a colossal blunder for which the planet has been paying ever since. Rain forests continue to disappear at a rate of 20 million to 30 million acres every year. 
 Mr. Jagdeo is the perfect champion for the rain forests. Guyana, together with Suriname, French Guiana and sections of Venezuela and northern Brazil form the Guayana Shield, an ancient geologic formation that contains 14 percent of the world's carbon. The hope is that his example will inspire bigger countries like Brazil to take a far more aggressive role in protecting their forests from commercial development. 
 He also speaks with authority about the impact of global warming on poorer countries. He noted the other day that while climate change might require wealthy Americans to drive fewer S.U.V.'s, it is a matter of life and death for poor countries that face floods and drought. Guyana's capital, Georgetown, is right at sea level. If the seas rise substantially, Georgetown goes.
 Finally, as an economist by training, Mr. Jagdeo is a persuasive advocate for new ways of looking at the economic value of forests. Right now, he suggests, too many countries put no dollar value at all on their standing forests. So any payment they get from harvesting trees is seen as a clear profit. If forests are correctly valued -- for the carbon they sequester and the damage they spare the planet -- then there is far more to gain from leaving them in tact. 
 The good news is that the world is finally starting to see things Mr. Jagdeo's way. Negotiators at last year's climate change conference in Bali -- the first of several meetings aimed at crafting a post-Kyoto treaty -- agreed to address deforestation. The big climate bill that is expected to be debated on the Senate floor very soon provides incentives for American companies to invest in rain-forest projects abroad. Mr. Jagdeo may yet wind up with a buyer.

HEADLINE: Myanmar Is Said To Relent On Aid

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations, and Helene Cooper and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
Myanmar's military junta promised on Friday to allow into the country ''all aid workers'' of any nationality, after three weeks of blocking most assistance to cyclone victims, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, announced.
 Mr. Ban's statement was met with surprise and wariness by relief officials here and American officials in Washington, not least because the pledge was delivered on the eve of an international donors' conference in Myanmar this weekend. 
 While the junta has largely ignored international criticism of its response to the May 3 storm, which left some 134,000 people dead or missing, it is asking for $11.7 billion in reconstruction money. That is nearly Myanmar's annual gross domestic product. 
 Mr. Ban did not release details of his discussions with the junta or say whether it was now promising a free flow of volunteers and what aid officials say is desperately needed relief. 
 But he told reporters traveling with him, ''I had a very good meeting with the senior general, particularly on these aid workers,'' referring to Senior Gen. Than Shwe.
 Taken off guard, relief officials said a critical issue would be how free access would be to hard-hit areas, where the United Nations said aid had reached only 25 percent of the storm's 2.4 million victims.
 In recent days, Myanmar has allowed a modest flow of supplies and relief workers into the country, but the junta continues to bar foreigners from entering the badly damaged Irrawaddy Delta to assess the damage and coordinate the delivery of aid.
 Lionel Rosenblatt, past president of the humanitarian agency Refugees International, said, ''Translating what you hear in a place like that into reality, we will have to wait and see what will happen.''
 In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Tom Casey, was also cautious. 
 ''We have a whole bunch of visa applications,'' he said. ''Will they grant them? Under what conditions? Are they simply going let them go to Rangoon, or will they let them do their jobs?'' Rangoon is the former name for Yangon, the principal city of Myanmar.
 At the Pentagon on Friday, officials said they had received no official notification that the government of Myanmar would approve increased relief flights by American military cargo planes. Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the United States military had carried out 50 such flights since the cyclone. 
 He said the American military could vastly increase the daily flow of supplies if the government of Myanmar gave its approval for more flights or for naval vessels to assist in the effort.
 At the United Nations in New York, Mr. Ban's deputy spokeswoman, Marie Okabe, said the secretary general had spent two hours with the senior general, 40 minutes of which were one-on-one, with no aides present. Mr. Ban has done the same in meetings with other leaders he has sought to pressure. 
 Asked whether the secretary general's announcement risked putting a government with scant international credibility and a notorious human rights record in an unduly positive light, she said that the general had promised Mr. Ban increased cooperation. 
 ''Obviously there is going to be follow-up on this now, but what the secretary went there for was to seek these assurances, and from what we can see, he has received them from the man in authority,'' she said. 
 In the diplomatic campaign to provide cyclone relief, in fact, human rights and political freedoms in Myanmar have been all but ignored, despite being almost the sole focus of the United Nations and Western nations for nearly two decades.
 In talking with reporters, for instance, Mr. Ban did not mention Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy advocate whose freedom from house arrest has been the chief demand of the international community and whose latest period of detention expires and is up for renewal next week.
 If her detention is renewed, human rights workers said, the junta will be perpetuating an abuse in the presence of Mr. Ban and foreign diplomats.
 ''With the cyclone, the whole political side of the crisis has just dropped off the map,'' said Benjamin Zawacki, a researcher with the human rights group Amnesty International.
 Mr. Ban's meeting with General Shwe came on the second day of a visit during which he took a helicopter tour of affected areas and met with government officials and relief workers. He then flew to Chengdu, China, on Saturday to survey the earthquake relief efforts there, The Associated Press reported.
 At the donors' conference on Sunday, Mr. Ban is scheduled to meet with representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, which reached an agreement with the junta this week to coordinate humanitarian assistance.
 Although the United Nations says more than a million people are still in urgent need of food, water, shelter and medical supplies, the junta insists that ''the emergency phase of the operation is over'' and that international donors should focus on reconstruction, which would include instead large amounts of machinery and materials.
 ''This discrepancy is a confidence gap that has to be verified, that has to be reconciled,'' said the Asean secretary general, Surin Pitsuwan. ''Whether the Sunday pledging conference will be successful or not depends on the ability to reconcile the difference.''
 He added that without international access to the worst-hit areas, ''The shared concern is we don't know the extent of the damage.'' 
 The conference comes during a weekend of political significance for the junta.
 On Saturday, the generals will carry out a second round of voting in a referendum on a Constitution that guarantees them amnesty for past and future crimes, and legally cements the military's half-century of dominance.
 This second round is being carried out in the most devastated areas, where people who may not has received relief supplies will be handed ballots and where some refugees are being evicted from shelters that are to be used as polling places.
 The lack of focus on these more political issues is frustrating to Burmese exiles.
 ''If the donors don't deliver a strong message to the military regime, the generals will get away again and the U.N. will become again another laughingstock,'' said Soe Aung, a spokesman for the National Council of the Union of Burma, a coalition of opposition groups based in neighboring Thailand.
 The junta has insisted that politics have no place during the current crisis.
 In the government newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, the front page was taken up almost entirely with a photograph of General Than Shwe meeting with cyclone survivors. A headline reads, ''The government is taking relief, rehabilitation and preventive measures against natural disasters for storm-hit regions and victims.''
 Mr. Ban's visit was reported more modestly, on an inside page, under the headline: ''International humanitarian assistance should not be politicized.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Police Question Olmert Again in a Fraud Case

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
The prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, was interrogated on Friday morning by the police for the second time this month in connection with a new and potentially serious corruption scandal. Meanwhile, his lawyers failed to delay by two weeks the early court deposition of an important witness in the case, the American fund-raiser and businessman Morris Talansky. 
 The Jerusalem District Court determined that Mr. Talansky, who is eager to return to the United States, would give testimony starting Tuesday. 
 Mr. Olmert has not been indicted in the case but has pledged to resign if charged. 
 But he is continuing with a high-wire diplomatic agenda that includes delicate negotiations with the Palestinians over statehood, the resumption of peace talks with Syria and a possible cease-fire with the Islamist group Hamas.
 Investigators from the national fraud unit questioned Mr. Olmert at his official residence for about an hour, said Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman. The prime minister is suspected of receiving illicit money from Mr. Talansky, funds that the Israeli news media say amount to nearly $500,000. 
 Mr. Olmert says the money went for legitimate financing of various election campaigns and he denies ever having taken a bribe. But investigators are now believed to be focusing on tracing where the money went and what, if any, favors Mr. Talansky and associates may have received in return. 
 Israel's state prosecutor, Moshe Lador, said in court this week that Mr. Olmert ''allegedly'' received cash in Israel and in the United States from Mr. Talansky, and that ''the money was transferred in envelopes.''
 Mr. Olmert is suspected of receiving the contributions from 1993, when he was elected mayor of Jerusalem, up until 2005, while he was serving in the government as minister of industry and trade. Mr. Olmert became prime minister in January 2006. 
 The district court ruling on Friday was a second setback for Mr. Olmert's lawyers. Last week, the High Court rejected their appeal to prevent the early deposition of Mr. Talansky altogether on grounds that it would prejudice the case.
 ''The prime minister's trial opens on the day that Talansky is scheduled to testify in court,'' Eli Zohar, one of Mr. Olmert's lawyers, told the High Court. ''This creates a situation that would almost obligate the prosecution to indict the prime minister.'' 
 After the High Court rejection, Mr. Olmert's lawyers tried to delay the deposition, originally set for Sunday, by two weeks, arguing that they did not have time to prepare adequately for a cross-examination.
 The district court gave them a reprieve of two days. 
 In Gaza on Friday, five Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli fire in two separate acts. Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, said three members of its armed wing were killed in an airstrike during an Israeli military operation in the south. An army spokeswoman said the militants were carrying antitank missiles when they were hit. 
 Two Islamic Jihad militants were killed in a clash with Israeli troops in central Gaza, near the border fence. 
 In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, concluded a three-day investment conference with an announcement that $1.4 billion had been pledged by private investors around the region for projects meant to bolster the Palestinian economy. Mr. Fayyad described the pledges as a ''starting point.''
 About $2 billion worth of projects were presented at the conference. Most of the pledges are intended for the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority holds sway. 
 Last December, donor nations pledged $7.7 billion in international assistance to the Palestinian Authority over the next three years. Palestinian officials say that about $650 million has been delivered. They expect to receive less than half the amount due by the end of this year.

HEADLINE: Russia and China Condemn U.S. Missile Shield Plan as Threat to Stability

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and ALAN COWELL; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Alan Cowell from Paris. Clifford J. Levy contributed reporting from Moscow, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and President Hu Jintao of China met on Friday to conclude a deal on nuclear cooperation and together condemn American proposals for a missile shield in Europe. Both countries called the plan a setback to international trust that was likely to upset the balance of power.
 Mr. Medvedev's choice of China for an early diplomatic foray as president seemed to signal a desire to continue Moscow's assertive foreign policy -- particularly toward the United States -- that was a hallmark of his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, during his eight years in office. 
 Mr. Medvedev was inaugurated as Russia's president this month, but Mr. Putin retained significant powers as prime minister.
 The announcements came as the neighbors, who challenged the United States -- and each other -- during the cold war, grapple with newer tensions over an array of military and economic issues, including their rivalry over the energy resources of Central Asia.
 Mr. Medvedev arrived in China after a visit to Kazakhstan, which is seen as an important part of Moscow's regional energy ambitions.
 His visit here is the first by a state leader since the May 12 earthquake that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 56,000 people in southwest China, the nation's greatest natural disaster in more than three decades. Russia is among the handful of countries to have sent both aid supplies and rescue teams.
 In recent months, both countries have condemned America's plan for a missile shield. Russia in particular has long sought allies to act as a bulwark against what Moscow depicts as American global hegemony.
 In a statement signed by Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Hu, the leaders took issue once more with plans for a missile defense system ''in certain regions of the world,'' saying such measures ''do not support strategic balance and stability, and harm international efforts to control arms and the nonproliferation process.''
 ''It harms the strengthening of trust between states and regional stability,'' the statement said. 
 The White House's reaction to the statement was muted. A spokesman for the National Security Council, Gordon D. Johndroe, noted that on Thursday Mr. Medvedev made remarks indicating that he remained open to negotiations. A new round of talks involving American and Russian technical experts is expected to begin next month.
 ''We're having discussions with the Russians in good faith about the sites in the Czech Republic and Poland,'' Mr. Johndroe said. ''So we'll see.''
 The Russian-Chinese statement did not specifically identify the United States, which has angered Russia with plans to deploy elements of a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland. Washington says the shield is to protect against potential attacks by rogue states like Iran and North Korea.
 For their part, Moscow and Beijing have not always supported Washington's efforts to characterize Iran as a sponsor of terrorism and a potential nuclear threat, particularly to Israel. Iran says its nuclear development program is for peaceful, civilian purposes. 
 The joint statement also took issue with America's attitude toward the promotion of human rights, insisting that ''every state has a right to encourage and protect them based on its own specific features and characters.''
 The statement reflected an argument among Washington's critics that the United States uses the human rights issue as a means of exerting pressure. It said governments should ''oppose politicizing the issue and using double standards'' and should not use ''human rights to interfere with other countries' affairs.''
 In late March, as China was coming under growing international criticism for a harsh crackdown on pro-Tibetan protests, President Bush called Mr. Hu to urge restraint and to advise the Chinese government to meet with the Dalai Lama's representatives, according to the White House. He also asked Mr. Hu to allow diplomats and foreign journalists into Tibetan areas.
 As a signal of the warming ties between China and Russia, the two countries signed a $1 billion agreement for Russia to build a nuclear fuel enrichment plant in China and supply uranium. Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the director of Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, described the deal as ''a good addition to our presence in China.''
 Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported on Friday that trade between the countries rose to $48.17 billion last year from $10.67 billion in 2000.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall As Slump In Housing Continues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Stocks took a dive on Friday after a report confirmed fears that the housing slump, which has weighed on nearly every corner of the nation's economy, was nowhere near its end.
 Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, dipped 1 percent in April, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the second consecutive month that sales have declined. That figure represents another record low, although the report, put out by the private National Association of Realtors, dates only to 1999. 
 While sales were slightly better than economists had expected, Wall Street was unimpressed. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 146 points on Friday, capping the worst week in the stock markets since February. 
 The Dow closed at 12,479.63, down more than 500 points from Monday's opening bell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the American stock market, also stumbled, slipping again on Friday to finish down 3.5 percent for the week. 
 Bond prices rose as investors turned to the safety of government notes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.84 percent, from 3.91 percent.
 After a period of relative calm on Wall Street, investors seemed shaken by the resurgence of economic problems on several fronts. Oil, which some thought had reached a plateau at $110 a barrel, suddenly surged on reports that experts had decided dwindling supplies would not be able to keep up with global demand. Oil settled on Friday at $132.19 a barrel, up nearly $6 since Monday.
 The price of oil, which affects not only the cost of gasoline but also the price of common consumer products, has risen nearly $20 a barrel in May alone. 
 The high cost of fuel is driving fears that inflation will become unhinged. Consumers are already being squeezed by skyrocketing prices for food and gasoline, and a report this week showed businesses were forced to pay more for wholesale goods in April. 
 The home sales report on Friday topped off a dreary week. The median value of a previously owned home was $202,300 in April, down 8 percent from a year ago, the realty group said on Friday. 
 Homeowners have watched their property values plunge for months, although the slump comes after several years of a remarkable run-up in home prices. Still, economists say they believe the declines have discouraged purchases, as would-be buyers hold out for prices to fall further.
 ''Lower prices bring bargain hunters into the market,'' Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm, wrote. ''But they also drive away buyers who view their homes as an investment. In today's market, the fence sitters outnumber the bargain hunters.''
 Inventories also ticked up in April. At the current sales rate, it would take nearly a year to clear out the current backlog of unsold homes.
 Analysts fear that an increase in foreclosures will only add to the inventory overhang, pushing prices down further. Economists expect no substantial recovery in the housing market until at least the latter half of 2008.
 ''The sharp increase in inventories will continue to keep potential buyers out of the market and depress overall prices further,'' Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist of Merk Investments, wrote in a research note. 
 A loss of confidence among lenders has also put a damper on sales, as even Americans eager to buy a home are having difficulty procuring mortgages from lenders who have tightened their standards. 
 The report divides sales figures into four general regions of the country. According to the realty group, April sales dropped 6 percent in the Midwest and 4.4 percent in the Northeast, but rose 6.4 percent in the West. Sales stayed steady in the South.
 The biggest decline came in sales of apartments and condominiums, which plunged 5.2 percent after two months of rising sales. Demand for single-family homes dropped 0.5 percent in April, according to the report.
 Markets will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday, but the subsequent four days will bring a more detailed look at the troubles in the housing market. The closely watched Case-Shiller index, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, will offer a snapshot of home prices across the country in March. The Commerce Department will also report on Tuesday on sales of new homes in April.
 Reports are also due next week on consumer spending, personal income growth, durable goods orders and consumer confidence. A revised government estimate of economic growth in the first quarter will be released on Thursday.

 NO CHARGES FOR MARINES
 Involved in Civilian Shooting
 The Marine Corps said it would not bring criminal charges against officers in command of a unit involved in the shooting deaths of as many as 19 civilians during an episode in Afghanistan in March 2007. The two officers, as well as a third, will face ''appropriate administrative actions'' as a result of those shootings. PAGE A6
 CHALLENGE TO U.S. SHIELD PLAN
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and President Hu Jintao of China met to sign a pact on nuclear cooperation and condemn American proposals for a missile shield in Europe. The White House offered a muted response to the announcement. ''We're having discussions with the Russians in good faith about the sites in the Czech Republic and Poland,'' a spokesman said. ''So we'll see.'' PAGE A10 
 ACUTE CASE OF SARKOZY FATIGUE
 The visage of President Nicolas Sarkozy seems to glare back at the French whenever they open a newspaper or turn on the television. His every gesture is covered by the news media, and already 100 biographies have been published about him. Some say public opinion of the ubiquitous head of state is starting to sour. ''The obsession continues, just as passionately, but now it's negative,'' a newspaper editor said. ''In that, too, it's like a bad love affair.'' PAGE A6
 DARFUR PEACKEEPERS AMBUSHED
 A convoy of Nigerian peacekeepers was ambushed and robbed by militiamen wearing Sudanese Army uniforms. Though no one was wounded in the ambush, the attack was an embarrassment to the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping force. ''Everyone is asking, how can we protect anyone from these guys if we can't even protect ourselves?'' a senior officer based in West Darfur said. PAGE A8

 YOU LOOK LIKE A GOOD CANDIDATE 
 And Smell Like One Too
 While campaign events are largely stagecrafted, the frenzied flesh-pressing that candidates engage in afterwards offer something more raw and unpredictable. You see things and hear things on rope lines. Whiff things, too. (''I got to smell him and it was awesome,'' raved a woman about Senator Barack Obama.) PAGE A12 
 OBAMA REACHES OUT TO CUBA
 In a speech before an influential Cuban-American group in Miami, Senator Barack Obama called for greater engagement with Cuba and Latin America, saying the long-standing policies of isolation have failed to advance the interests of the United States or help people who have suffered under oppressive regimes.

 POLL FINDINGS ON GAY MARRIAGE
 More than half of Californians support a proposed ballot measure that would overturn a recent ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the state, a new poll has found. The proposed measure is expected to be on the November ballot. PAGE A16 
 INQUIRY ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM
 The inspector general's office at the Defense Department will investigate a Pentagon public affairs program that sought to transform retired military officers who work as television and radio analysts into ''message force multipliers'' who could be counted on to echo Bush administration talking points about Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and terrorism in general. PAGE A16 
 HAS SECULARISM LOST ITS SOUL?
 Austin Dacey has written a book titled ''The Secular Conscience'' but the subtitle is the one responsible for lifting eyebrows -- ''Why Belief Belongs in Public Life.'' Mr. Dacey argues that ''secularism has lost its soul'' and says that controversial religious and moral claims are beyond evaluation by reason, truth and objective standards of right and wrong, and should therefore be precluded from public conversation.

 PIONEERING RAPPER 
 Receives Rare Pardon
 Ricky Walters -- better known as the pioneering hip-hop artist Slick Rick -- was pardoned by Gov. David A. Paterson for his criminal convictions stemming from a shooting in 1990. Mr. Walters, who is a native of Britain, was facing possible deportation, and the pardon allows him to remain in the United States. It is only the 10th pardon by a New York governor since the administration of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. PAGE B1
 WHEN THE TOKEN WAS KING
 In New York, what's old is new again. New York City Transit announced that it was considering bringing back the double-decker bus. With technology and regulatory smarts, why not retrofit some of those ancient fixtures for the modern era? Automats retrofitted to accept debit cards could serve tea-smoked duck. Squeegee men could check tire pressure. And was the boombox really more annoying than the junior account executive loudly making a hairdresser appointment? PAGE B1

 AFTER A LONG SLUMP,
 IndyCar Turns a Corner
 Tony George, IndyCar's chief executive, is overseeing some good days for the once-beleaguered racing series. He recently brokered peace between IndyCar and Nascar, the racing behemoth with whom it shared a decade-long civil war. Ticket sales for the Indianapolis 500 are up, and the field boasts a good deal of star power. But his big plans are tempered with caution. ''We have to be very careful and very diligent,'' he said. ''We're going to get one shot at this.'' PAGE D6 
 YANKEES. RED SOX. AGAIN.
 The Yankees-Red Sox rivalry does not want for stoking, but there is always more to be had. In the latest round of perpetual baseball indignation, the Yankees have complained to Major League Baseball about a promotion at Yankee Stadium in which Red Sox slugger David Ortiz will try to hit a home run to a designated spot. The problem? Ortiz's called shot will be a little too reminiscent of the one made by Babe Ruth. ''You'd have to be an idiot to think the Yankees wouldn't take umbrage,'' one baseball historian said.

 A CELL PHONE PIONEER
 Struggles to Stay Relevant
 Motorola introduced the first portable commercial cellphone in 1983, and has been a major player in the mobile phone market ever since. But its market share continues to decline and morale at the company has dipped. Greg Brown, the company's new chief executive, is being asked to right the ship, but says that doing so is harder than he thought it would be. PAGE C1
 SOUTHWEST CHIEF FEELS THE LOVE
 Compared to other carriers, the annual meetings at Southwest Airlines are pretty upbeat affairs -- the company continues to be profitable and sports a healthy balance sheet even as the economy has turned sluggish. This year's meeting was an absolute lovefest, as the company's beloved co-founder, Herbert D. Kelleher, stepped down as chairman after 37 years. Whil Mr. Kelleher attributed Southwest's success to maintaining high employee morale, Joe Nocera writes that Mr. Kelleher also helped make his carrier uncommonly efficient. PAGE C1

 Burger King reached a deal with a farm workers advocacy group to help increase wages and improve working conditions for tomato pickers in Florida.

 AFTER BIG FINISH,
 'Idol' Ponders Tweaks
 The season finale of ''American Idol'' -- which boasted a rare apology by Simon Cowell and a surprise winner -- pulled in one of the talent show's biggest audiences ever, and helped Fox claim its first season as television's most-watched network. Still, the show's producers are tinkering with ways to boost ratings, like lowering the minimum age of contestants and disclosing those call-in vote totals which remain shrouded in secrecy. PAGE B7
 A MAMA'S BOY, RE-IMAGINED
 At first glance, ''Oedipus Loves You'' -- a play that updates the Greek tragedy by placing the Theban king and his particularly dysfunctional clan in the suburbs as a garage band -- sounds like a recipe for a certain aggressive sort of artiness. ''Don't make the mistake, as one man did on the night I saw the show, of bolting after the first scene,'' Ben Brantley writes. ''Unexpected rewards come to those who wait.'' PAGE B7 
 ONE LAST LOOK AT CANNES
 At the end of its screening at the Cannes Film Festival, ''Wendy and Lucy,'' a film by the American director Kelly Reichardt, did not have a buyer. But Manohla Dargis says the film, which manages to be political without any grandstanding, will almost certainly find one. A. O. Scott reviews ''Entre les Murs,'' about a young teacher dealing with a tough class in an urban high school that manages to eschew the sentimentality that often marks films that explore that well-trod cinematic territory.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Miami, Calls For Engaging With Cuba

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama on Friday called for greater engagement with Cuba and Latin America, saying the long-standing policies of isolation have failed to advance the interests of the United States or help people who have suffered under oppressive governments.
 In a speech before an influential Cuban-American group here, Mr. Obama said he would meet with the Cuban leader, Raul Castro, ''at a time and place of my choosing.'' He derided Senator John McCain and other Republican critics as embracing what he called hard-line approaches that have failed. 
 ''John McCain's been going around the country talking about how much I want to meet with Raul Castro, as if I'm looking for a social gathering or I'm going to invite him over and have some tea,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's not what I said, and John McCain knows it. After eight years of the disastrous policies of George Bush, it is time to pursue direct diplomacy, with friend and foe alike, without preconditions.''
 Mr. Obama appeared before the Cuban American National Foundation days after Mr. McCain outlined a sharply different approach in a speech in Miami. He said Mr. Obama was naive to think he could hold direct diplomatic talks with Mr. Castro and other foreign leaders who are considered enemies.
 The back-and-forth highlighted the divergent foreign policy approaches of the two candidates and underscored the significant role that Cuba policy could play in the general election. Mr. Obama's decision to address a constituency that has traditionally leaned Republican -- but among some younger voters is changing -- signaled his intent to compete aggressively in Florida, a state that could be a critical battleground.
 ''I know what the easy thing is to do for American politicians. Every four years, they come down to Miami, they talk tough, they go back to Washington and nothing changes in Cuba,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's what John McCain did the other day. He joined the parade of politicians who make the same empty promises year after year, decade after decade.''
 When he addressed Cuban-Americans here on Tuesday, Mr. McCain accused Mr. Obama of shifting his position on normalizing trade relations with Cuba. On Friday, his campaign passed out printed materials here saying Mr. Obama had a ''record of weak leadership'' on Cuba.
 ''Senator Obama's reckless judgment, and his pandering on trade, will set back relations between the United States and Latin America for decades,'' said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain. 
 In a 30-minute speech, interrupted several times by applause, Mr. Obama said that if elected president he would immediately lift the bans on family travel to Cuba and the limits on how much money people can send to their relatives in the communist nation.
 ''Don't be confused about this. I will maintain the embargo,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: If you take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to begin normalizing relations.''
 In presenting his plan for Latin America, Mr. Obama said he would increase economic aid, work with other nations to reduce drug trafficking, seek cooperation on alternative energy and expand the Peace Corps in the region. 
 The Cuban American National Foundation is the most prominent of the anti-Castro Cuban exile groups in Miami. Mr. Obama's appearance was viewed by his supporters here as a sign of change in Cuban-American political leanings.
 Jorge Mas Santos, son of the group's founder, introduced Mr. Obama and endorsed his plan to lift restrictions on visiting relatives in Cuba and sending money. He said it was time for a new approach to dealing with Cuba.
 ''The other centerpiece of U.S.-Cuba policy has been that there should be no negotiations and conversations with Raul Castro,'' Mr. Santos said. ''Although this may sound tough, on its own it's ineffective and plays into the hands of Raul Castro.''

HEADLINE: On the Reservation and Off, Schools See a Changing Tide

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARDIN, Mont. 

 BODY:
One of the last traditional chiefs of the Crow Indian tribe, named Plenty Coups, had a vision as the Old West was fading. Education would be the way of the future, he said -- a choice to be either the ''the white man's victim'' or ''the white man's equal.'' 
 Roberta Walks Over Ice was among those who heard that message, from her grandfather. She then continued the tradition, preaching the value of education to her daughter, Jasmine, 15.
 But the zeal for learning that took root in such families is now coming with a cost. Many families like the Walks Over Ices are deciding that off-reservation public schools in this small, mostly white ranching town are a better choice than schools on the reservation. 
 Hardin High School, 55 percent white in 2000, is now 70 percent American Indian. On the reservation, at Lodge Grass High School, more than a third of the student enrollment in 2000 has melted away. 
 The stigma that was once attached to sending a child off the reservation -- the legacy of forced boarding-school programs in the early 1900s that tried to strip Indians of their culture and language in the name of assimilation -- has faded as elders who remember the old days die off.
 ''If they had all the same resources, programs, assistance, whatever, I would have said, 'O.K., yeah,' but I didn't want her to struggle,'' Ms. Walks Over Ice said about her daughter. ''Jasmine was falling through the cracks. I asked them to help her at Lodge Grass, and she didn't improve.''
 Home games for the Hardin Bulldogs football team -- majority Indian this season for the first time -- now begin with traditional Indian drumming, and the Crow language is studied alongside French and Spanish. There is an unofficial line in the school parking lot, one side for whites, the other for Crow. Indian pottery-making is so well established in the art department that schools from other parts of the state now come to learn.
 Even the principal at Lodge Grass, John Small -- whose Crow pedigree extends back to an Indian scout for George Armstrong Custer named White Man Runs Him (who survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn, fought about 15 miles from Hardin) -- feels the winds of change blowing in his own family.
 All five of Mr. Small's children graduated from Lodge Grass, as did he. But five of his nine grandchildren attend Hardin schools, and his daughter, Roxanne Not Afraid, is a teacher there. This spring, the Hardin district nominated Ms. Not Afraid to be Montana Indian Teacher of the year.
 The turning tide of students has rippled far beyond education, to culture and the delicate economic balance of an area where resources like student head counts and the government dollars that come with them are highly coveted assets. 
 Since the early 1990s, Montana has lost about 1.5 percent of its public student population every year, according to state figures, with even deeper hits here in the eastern half of the state, an area largely untouched by the second-home culture that is transforming places like Bozeman and Missoula. 
 At the same time, the national demographic groove of people moving from rural to less rural places -- for jobs, choices and lifestyle -- has accelerated, with Indians participating like everyone else.
 While schools on many reservations continue to thrive, those in places like Hardin -- a small community struggling in its own way as the economics in this dry, rural corner of the West erode -- or in Parker, Ariz., adjoining the Colorado River Indian Tribes reservation south of the Grand Canyon, have caught some of the surge. A housing shortage and lack of jobs on reservations account for some of the shift too, as does the simple fact that many Indians have come to see the public schools as better than reservation schools.
 For the Crow or Apsaalooke Nation -- about 11,000 people, three-fourths of whom live on a reservation the size of Connecticut in Montana's southeast corner -- the intertwined arcs of Hardin and Lodge Grass have made for a bittersweet experience. Positive things, like ambition, hope and expression of free choice, are countered against the harm to an institution that many people look back on with fondness and nostalgia.
 At Lodge Grass, teachers have been let go and the number of paraprofessionals who once could help students has been slashed. There are only 357 students in all grades of the Lodge Grass schools, down from 559 in 2000, and the small community of Lodge Grass itself has stumbled, too, residents say, with burned-out and abandoned homes lining the road to the hilltop school.
 ''We've had to tighten our belts, and that hurts enrollment and money -- it's a vicious circle,'' said Dennis Maasjo, the superintendent of Lodge Grass schools.
 An education spokesman for the Crow tribe, Larry Blacksmith, said each family must decide for itself on the schools issue -- the tribe takes no position. But the advantages from growth have clearly made programs blossom in one place and not another, Mr. Blacksmith said.
 ''Advanced math, English, sciences -- Lodge Grass hasn't been able to offer things like that because of the money, whereas Hardin has,'' he said.
 State administrators say more exacting yardsticks of school performance, a hallmark of the federal No Child Left Behind law, and loose state rules about where children must attend school have allowed parents all over Montana to comparison shop. Then there is simply the momentum of the crowd. ''My friends are going to Hardin, so I should go to Hardin,'' said Dr. Maasjo at Lodge Grass, quoting the iron logic of teen life.
 Some tribe members and school officials at Lodge Grass also see a calculated grab by Hardin for students. A decision by the Hardin district in 2004 to stop allowing buses to take students from Hardin to Lodge Grass shifted 55 students from one district to another. That alone was a big jolt, especially on the reservation side. Lodge Grass High has only 135 students this year, compared with about 500 at Hardin.
 Hardin school officials say the changes that benefited them were mainly about education and discipline, especially a crackdown on absenteeism. The busing decision, they say, was about holding down transportation costs, not stealing students away.
 ''You hate to say we're more academically motivated,'' said Albert Peterson, the Hardin Schools superintendent. ''But we definitely push to have kids achieve.''
 How to balance academics and the new cultural mix of the Hardin system is another question.
 ''We do a lot of things differently now than we did when we were predominantly white -- we infuse Native American culture in a lot of what we do,'' said Keith Campbell, Hardin High principal. 
 But when tribal leaders announce a spontaneous event or celebration on the reservation, and call to ask that students be released, Mr. Campbell said his first priority was not to the tribe.
 ''Maybe I should feel more accountable to them, but I don't,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''I feel accountable to our school board.'' 
 Jasmine Walks Over Ice, a freshman at Hardin who wants to become a veterinarian, said she liked Hardin better specifically because it was more demanding than the reservation school she attended until fifth grade. ''There's more structure and a lot of respect for the teachers,'' Jasmine said. Her old school, she said, ''didn't challenge me.'' 
 Parents like Ada Bends, whose son, Chaz, tried Hardin but then returned to Lodge Grass, said an emphasis on test scores did not necessarily mean everyone received a great education there.
 ''The environment in any school is what every child chooses to make,'' said Ms. Bends, who works in Hardin as a case manager for a welfare-to-work program. ''I wanted him to go to school where he was happy. When a child is happy with where they're going, they're able to put more into it.''
 Chaz Bends, who is half Crow and half white, said he had felt a little lost at Hardin, where he transferred for a few months in late 2006. On his first day, he said, he was chided for parking his car on the white side of the parking lot, not the Indian side -- one of the little unwritten codes of the school's ethnic mix that he found jarring. Lodge Grass High, by contrast, is 100 percent Indian.
 Chaz, who graduates this month and plans to attend Sheridan College in Sheridan, Wyo., on a rodeo scholarship, said the teachers were the main thing he liked better about Lodge Grass.
 ''The teachers are just like us,'' he said. ''We treat each other equally. Over there, you've got to do everything their way, the way they want us to learn -- kind of like, straight-up strict.''
 Roberta Walks Over Ice also loved Lodge Grass High. But she remembers it in the '80s in the same sort of terms that Mr. Bends used to talk about Hardin. It was tough.
 ''I had teachers who were motivated,'' she said, adding, ''They gave you a goal, and said, 'This is what you're going to do.' ''

HEADLINE: Running Out of Fuel, But Not Out of Ideas

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS I watch the drama about gasoline and oil prices play out on the streets and in the news media, some images and memories come to mind.
 There is Will Rogers, the great sage and comedian, who famously commented during the Great Depression that America would be the first nation to ''go to the poorhouse in an automobile.'' This doesn't sound comprehensible now, because driving a car is so basic to American life. But in those days, it was still something of a luxury and a novelty to have a car, and to drive it to the poorhouse was a contradiction in terms.
 There are also scenes from the great ''Mad Max'' movies. In one of them, Australia has been reduced to chaos amid a cruel shortage of oil and gasoline. Men will kill in an instant for a few drops of precious gasoline to power their motorcycles, and life as we know it has stopped because of a deficiency of that magnificent stuff. 
 Most of all, the images are of the glory of driving cars, cruising through our towns and suburbs, just burning up gas with no particular place to go, to paraphrase Chuck Berry. Or of racing up and down freeways, heading out to the surf on time, with the car's chrome heart shining in the sun, to paraphrase Neil Young. (Of course, I think of driving my own mighty Cadillac STS-V, hurtling along I-10 toward Rancho Mirage at 130 m.p.h., with my wife urging: ''Great. Go faster.'') 
 Gasoline is unimaginably important in our lives in the United States. Without gas in virtually limitless supply, and at prices we could afford, American life would change. We could no longer afford to live so far from one another and from our jobs. We could no longer afford to cruise in cars incomparably larger than those of our counterparts in Europe and Asia. In a way, we would stop being America as we know it.
 Maybe this would be a good thing. After all, do we really need to have a 6,000-pound S.U.V. take a 100-pound high school student across town to buy a Diet Coke? Do we really need cars so big that they have flat-screen televisions for the children in the back? Do we really need to pour so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? And it's certainly not great to belch out immense quanta of carbon monoxide, a deadly poison.
 But we have become addicted to gasoline. (I, of course, include my own bad self.) Even if we all bought smaller cars, we would need gasoline and lots of it -- although a great deal less than what we use now. And while I have previously said, and I believe, that we are in a temporary price bubble, the prognosis for gasoline is grim in the long run.
 Long ago, when I was a thin 29-year-old, as the Arab oil embargo was creating gasoline lines in the United States, we imported a bit more than one-third of the oil we needed. As a junior speech writer for President Richard M. Nixon, I wrote what I think was the first comprehensive message to Congress about a national energy policy. My superb bosses, Dave Gergen and Ray Price, edited it. But as a nation, we did almost nothing to enact the many plans we had to make ourselves energy independent. (To be fair, R.N. also imposed some really poor restrictions on energy, especially a mind-numbing set of price controls on oil, depending upon whether it was ''old'' or ''new.'' These were a pure negative.)
 Now, imports supply nearly two-thirds of our daily needs, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. Most of this oil comes from countries that are either unstable (Nigeria) or whose leaders or people dislike us (Venezuela, Saudi Arabia). Even in Canada, long our best friend on earth, and an immense oil supplier to us, there is an active movement of environmentalists who believe it best not to develop Canada's vast oil sands and send the oil to us. That movement has recently had some frightening success.
 What are we going to do? If there were another oil embargo, we would be in real trouble. If Mexico fell into chaos, if Venezuela stopped sending us oil, there would be extreme hardship.
 Beyond that, what if we are close to peak oil -- that point at which we have pumped out more than half the oil on the planet? What if supply slips and demand continues to skyrocket, as they are already doing, and these trends continue indefinitely? What if the world has a bitter fight over its remaining oil? Even if this battle is fought with money and not guns, we are at a disadvantage with our pitiful currency and our budget and trade deficits.
 In my humble view, we are now in a short-term oil bubble. It will pass and correct, as bubbles do. And speculators will make millions, whichever way it goes. But the long run is terrifying. If we are at or past peak oil, if oil states stop or even hesitate to send us the juice, if Canada decides not to fill our needs, we are in overwhelming trouble.
 So, what to do? First, we do not kill the geese -- the big oil companies -- that lay the golden eggs. We encourage them and cheer them on to get more oil. They need incentives, not hammer blows.
 BUT most of all, we treat this as a true crisis. As my pal Glenn Beck, the conservative commentator, says, we need a new moon-shot mentality here. We need to turn coal into oil into gasoline, to use nuclear power wherever we can, and to brush aside the concerns of the beautiful people who live on coastal pastures (like me). And we need to drill on the continental shelf, even near where movie stars live. This must be done, on an emergency basis. If we keep acting as if the landscape were more important than human life, we will make ourselves the serfs of the oil producers and eventually reduce our country to poverty and anarchy.
 In that long message sent to Congress 35 years ago, there was an outline of what we needed to do on coal-to-oil and shale-to-oil, as well as wind, solar and wave power. For a generation plus, we have done next to nothing. The hour is late. The clock of destiny is ticking out, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said. Let's roll.

HEADLINE: Things We Learned This Season

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and LEW SERVISS

 BODY:
This article is by Dave Caldwell, Stu Hackel, Jeff Hale, Jeff Z. Klein, Mark Pargas, Nathan Sandals, Lew Serviss and Lynn Zinser.
 Despite the five-day wait for them to start, this year's Stanley Cup finals have fans more excited than they have been in a long time: a dream matchup between two electrifying, star-studded teams from cities steeped in hockey culture. 
 No matter what happens, the Detroit-Pittsburgh Cup series stands as perhaps the biggest success for the N.H.L. in a season with many positive developments. 
 Below, the writers and editors of The Times's Slap Shot blog look back at 10 key issues, good and bad, that defined the 2007-8 hockey season:
 Offense returns The two most creative offensive teams made the Stanley Cup finals, and Alex Ovechkin, right, of the Washington Capitals emerged as the most exciting player on any ice sheet, recalling the great scorers of the past. Despite excellent goaltending and the disappearance of the interference penalty, offense has finally begun to prevail again. 
 outdoor game made hockey cool The New Year's Day game in Orchard Park, N.Y., was attended by more than 70,000 people, looked fabulous on television and made hockey something general sports fans talked about for the first time in many years. Now everyone wants an outdoor game.
 Franchises reborn In Pittsburgh, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin marched the Penguins to the Cup finals, 18 months after reports the team might bolt for Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, the Blackhawks overturned years of stagnant stewardship by welcoming back alumni, finally televising home games and putting a collection of exciting young stars on the ice. In Washington, the Capitals surged, drawing full houses after hiring the career minor leaguer Bruce Boudreau as the coach.
 Life in the Cap Age The ramifications of the salary cap were still being felt in the third season since it was implemented. Note to general managers: when you sink nearly half your cap room on three high-powered players (as Tampa Bay did with Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards), you wind up with American Hockey League-caliber depth and the worst record in the league. 
 The weak U.S. dollar and Canada The bad economy in the United States changed the balance of power in the N.H.L. Now Sun Belt teams are in financial trouble and Canadian teams are flush with money -- a reversal from five or six years ago. 
 The rise of Russia and Europe The weak dollar also led to the collapse of the player transfer agreement between the N.H.L. and Europe. For the first time, the N.H.L. cannot dictate terms; it must deal with European clubs as economic equals. Oil-rich Russia, now with standardized contract laws, is matching North American salaries and attracting talented European players to a restructured league with Continental ambitions. 
 Questions on the standings The N.H.L. stuck by its problematic system of awarding a guaranteed point for losing in overtime or a shootout, despite another late-season spike in regulation ties. Players even said they were playing for the guaranteed point in the third period of close games, raising the question of whether the N.H.L.'s system was encouraging teams to dog it. 
 More fighting There were 624 fights among N.H.L. players this season -- up from 441 last season and 432 the season before. Can the increase be attributed to the Stanley Cup win by last season's fightingest team, Anaheim, or to the campaign to loosen instigator rules by its general manager, Brian Burke? If the Stanley Cup is won by the team with the fewest fights this season, Detroit, look for a big drop-off next season. 
 Goalie overuse Parity, or at least the perception of it, pushed coaches into using their top goaltenders more than ever. Led once again by Martin Brodeur of the Devils, 14 goalies played more than 3,500 minutes, compared with 12 last season and 8 two seasons ago. 
 Building a better hockey network With games still hard to find on television, fans need more games on the Web -- and they are getting them. You can stream N.H.L., junior and international games and probably your local house league on your computer, and use gadgets like Slingbox or the new ZeeVee ZV-100 to stream from your computer onto your TV. Conventional TV ratings, though still small, are up substantially -- spurred by big increases in hockey's traditional northern markets. 
 The outdoor game in the snow, Canadian economic strength, growth in Scandinavia and Russia, and Detroit and Pittsburgh in the final ... hockey's immediate future looks cold, and bright.

HEADLINE: When the 'I' Word Replaces the 'R' Word

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AT the end of last year, when conventional wisdom said the economy was headed for recession -- and a severe one at that --a fixed-income strategy was simple: just shift into the lowest-risk investments you could find.
 The flood of money that poured into ultrasafe Treasury bonds sent the average long-term government bond fund soaring 10.6 percent between Oct. 9, 2007, near the peak of the credit crisis, and March 10 of this year. 
 But in March, there was a noticeable shift in thinking. After the stock market began to stabilize -- a move that, in past economic downturns, has often foreshadowed a rebound in business activity -- investors started to contemplate the possibility that the economy, though still sluggish, might not be in as much trouble as they had once feared.
 Now, bond investors face some hard choices.
 As the most dire recession fears have started to abate, the bond market is beginning to fret about an equally dangerous development for its future: the growing threat of inflation. 
 Soaring crude oil prices have added to these fears. Oil passed $135 a barrel for the first time last week. And the so-called core Producer Price Index, a measure of wholesale prices excluding volatile food and energy prices, is now growing at its fastest rate in nearly two decades, the Labor Department reported last week.
 Earlier this month, before this new batch of economic data, a survey by Merrill Lynch already found that a majority of domestic fund managers feared that inflation would accelerate in the coming 12 months.
 ''If growth is not the issue, then inflation has got to be the thing to worry about -- that's been the shift in thinking,'' said Mario D. DeRose, fixed-income strategist at Edward Jones, the brokerage firm based in St. Louis. 
 Historically, fixed-income investments have done terribly in times of high inflation, because inflation eats away a large portion of bond returns. From 1926 to 2007, long-term government bonds returned 5.5 percent a year, on average, according to Ibbotson Associates. But in years when inflation rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent, long bonds gained just 2.8 percent. 
 Making matters worse, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities -- a natural defense against inflation -- have become extremely expensive in recent months, as investors have flooded into all types of Treasuries, aiming to hide from a weak economy.
 Although the value of TIPS is adjusted to reflect accelerating consumer inflation, many bond market strategists are wary of putting more money into them at the moment. ''I would consider TIPS to be a fairly expensive form of insurance against inflation right now,'' said George Strickland, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M.
 So what should bond investors do?
 For starters, they need to take a ''balanced approach,'' Mr. DeRose said. While inflationary fears are building, he said that investors must consider the possibility that these fears -- much like worries over a severe recession -- could be wrong, or at least overstated. So don't completely overhaul your fixed-income portfolio to safeguard against rampant inflation, Mr. DeRose said.
 Still, this is a time for investors ''to start taking selective risk,'' said Carl P. Kaufman, manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. ''You're not being paid to stay on the sidelines,'' he said.
 For starters, Mr. Kaufman said, high-quality corporate bonds are much more attractively priced than government debt. And if rising inflation reflects not only soaring commodity prices, but also a strengthening economy, demand for corporate bonds may hold up even if inflation fears persist.
 Moreover, even though the economy has weakened, ''the balance sheet of corporate America is still in very, very good shape,'' said Christopher T. Vincent, head of the fixed-income group at William Blair & Company, the asset management firm headquartered in Chicago. 
 Looking at corporate bonds, Mr. Vincent recommends that investors stick with intermediate-term securities maturing in 5 to 10 years, rather than locking money away for 20 to 30 years. So far, this bet has been paying off. From March 11 through Thursday, the average intermediate-term corporate bond fund returned 0.3 percent, while long-term government bond funds were down 2.5 percent, according to Morningstar.
 Even bigger values can be found in the municipal market, said Marilyn Cohen, chief executive of Envision Capital Management, a bond manager in Los Angeles. 
 Tax-free municipal bonds took a hit amid recent credit fears, thanks to troubles that bond insurers ran into recently. As a result, municipal bonds, which traditionally yield 75 to 80 percent of what equivalent Treasuries pay out, are close to Treasury yields on a before-tax basis. 
 Finally, if you are really concerned about inflation, instead of buying high-priced TIPS, consider a small allocation to bonds issued by foreign countries that benefit from rising commodity prices, said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Financial Research in San Francisco. 
 The simplest and safest way to do that, he said, is to invest in a diversified bond fund whose managers invest a portion of their assets in foreign bonds. A good example, Mr. Peterson said, is the Loomis Sayles Bond fund. According to Morningstar, this ''multisector'' bond fund held more than 10 percent of its assets in foreign bonds, with most of the remainder in domestic corporate securities. 
 Investors might also consider a small position in a fund devoted to emerging-markets debt, because many of these markets are direct beneficiaries of rising oil and natural-resource prices. If you do that, though, play it safe. Move no more than about 5 percent of your portfolio into such funds, Mr. Peterson said.
 After all, this is your bond portfolio.

THE BIG SQUEEZE 
 Tough Times for the American Worker. 
 By Steven Greenhouse. 
 365 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95. 
 Eight years ago, Deborah Shank was seriously injured when a semitrailer rig struck the driver's side of her minivan. Because Shank, then a shelf stocker at a Wal-Mart store in Cape Girardeau, Mo., had recently qualified for the company's health plan, most of her immediate hospital expenses were covered. But because the accident left her in a wheelchair, with permanent brain damage, she continues to require full-time nursing care. To help pay for it, a court set up a $417,000 trust, using the proceeds of a lawsuit against the company whose driver caused the accident.
 As The Wall Street Journal reported last year, however, a court ordered the family to reimburse Wal-Mart for the $470,000 it had spent for Shank's medical care. The court's ruling cited a clause in the company's health plan that gave it the right to recoup medical expenses if an injured employee collected damage payments in a lawsuit. 
 This practice of expense recovery, known as subrogation, has been defended on the grounds that it is unfair for someone to be reimbursed twice for the same medical expenses. The proceeds of Shank's lawsuit, however, were insufficient to cover even her nursing care, much less her original hospital expenses. Until recently, companies rarely filed subrogation suits in such cases. These suits are now widespread.
 In this and a host of other ways, the environment confronting American workers has grown nastier in the last three decades. Millions of workers have seen their employers abandon longstanding company pension plans, and even larger numbers have lost their health insurance. Violations of safety regulations and other work rules are increasingly common. The median hourly wage, adjusted for inflation, has scarcely increased at all, even as the risk of being laid off has risen sharply. 
 In ''The Big Squeeze,'' the New York Times labor correspondent Steven Greenhouse interviews hundreds of workers who have had to adapt to these changes. He explores the forces that have transformed their lives and offers suggestions for what might be done to help them cope. 
 In the aftermath of World War II, the European social democracies constructed elaborate social safety nets for their citizens, which included universal health coverage and a generous public pension system. In contrast, the American social safety net was relegated to the corporate sector. This approach was essentially an accident, Greenhouse explains, inspired by an unusually generous labor pact struck between General Motors and the United Auto Workers during the early days of the postwar boom. 
 With big American corporations largely insulated from foreign competition during that era, the system worked reasonably well. But as health care costs began to escalate and markets became increasingly exposed to competition from abroad, the profit margins needed to support the safety net started eroding.
 All the while, Greenhouse reports, the American legal climate was growing more hostile to labor unions. The watershed event, in his account, was President Reagan's 1981 decision to fire 11,500 air-traffic controllers who had initiated an illegal strike. Since then, a large industry of union-busting consulting firms has emerged and prospered, often through illegal tactics that draw little scrutiny from the Justice Department.
 Compounding the worker's difficulties has been an increasingly aggressive capital market. If an incumbent chief executive fails to take full advantage of all options for increasing a company's profits -- say, by laying off workers and cutting benefits -- outside raiders stand ready to buy up its shares and install one who will. 
 Greenhouse doesn't claim that the workers he interviewed constitute a representative sample. Indeed, many of them drew his attention because they were plaintiffs in labor-abuse lawsuits, suggesting that their employers include a disproportionate share of bad actors. But at least some companies are determined to treat their employees well. Greenhouse glowingly cites the progressive labor practices of businesses like Costco and Patagonia. We have no way of knowing, however, whether the success of these companies demonstrates the viability of a more humane business model or is instead a consequence of unusually talented chief executives who are willing to work for less.
 In any event, Greenhouse is wise to acknowledge the possibility that many of the problems he describes are rooted in competitive forces beyond any individual company's control. If so, then collective action is the only remedy. His suggestion to strengthen labor laws could help, but probably only in industries sheltered from foreign competition. (It is no accident that the handful of unions that have thrived in recent years, like the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, represent service workers and government employees, whose jobs cannot be easily shipped abroad.) But as the experience of the automobile, steel and other manufacturing industries has demonstrated, strong unions can accomplish only so much. 
 The bad news is that in today's hyper-competitive climate, the corporate sector is no longer able to administer the nation's social safety net. Government is really the only alternative. The good news is that the American economy still has the largest G.D.P. in the world -- much more than enough to support a high standard of living for shareholders, managers and workers alike. 
 As Greenhouse observes in his closing chapter, the components of an efficient social safety net are reasonably well understood. For instance, we could easily afford a single-payer health system like the one in France, which covers everyone and delivers better health care for about half the amount we now spend per capita. We could easily afford to supplement the American Social Security system, which transfers income from workers to retirees, by establishing a national retirement savings plan in which a portion of each worker's wages was deposited in a tax-sheltered investment account, enabling families to take full advantage of the miracle of compound interest. We have ample resources to supplement lagging wages by raising the Earned Income Tax Credit, which Ronald Reagan called the most effective antipoverty program ever devised by Congress. And we could easily reduce the college-tuition burden on low-income families by expanding the existing program of Pell Grants. 
 Skeptics invariably counter that the taxes needed to pay for an expanded social safety net would cripple the economy by weakening people's incentives to work hard and take risks. Yet there are many ways to raise additional tax revenue that would actually cause G.D.P. to grow rather than shrink. A tax on carbon and other environmental pollutants, for example, would raise substantial revenue and yield a cleaner, more sustainable environment. Congestion taxes would save millions of hours currently wasted in traffic jams. A progressive income tax that exempts savings would divert billions of dollars from wasteful mine-is-bigger spending contests.
 As Greenhouse's interviews vividly remind us, no economic system can prosper in the long run if people who work hard and play by the rules cannot meet their basic needs. The workers profiled in ''The Big Squeeze'' cannot afford to pay for health care or to send their children to decent schools. And precisely because of their precarious economic position, their sons and daughters are far more likely than others to go into the military. Six days after the subrogation order was issued against Deborah Shank, the family learned that their 18-year-old son, Jeremy, had been killed on duty with the Army's 25th Infantry Division in Iraq. 
 Last month, stung by unfavorable publicity, Wal-Mart abandoned its effort to be reimbursed for Shank's hospital expenses. Even so, it's little wonder that surveys find so many American workers yearning for an election that could produce genuine change.

HEADLINE: Murder, She Once Wrote

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
AROUND 8 o'clock on a breezy evening in 1992, two private investigators stepped out of their car at the Christopher Street pier in Greenwich Village and approached a group of drunks and addicts huddled over a small fire. The investigators were soon joined by three Chinatown gang members who had information that the investigators needed. But the conversation was brief; the gang leader had a temper, and guns were drawn fast.
 That was the opening salvo in a chaotic scene that also featured undercover police officers dressed as winos, a surprise attack by another gang from a car speeding along the West Side Highway, and a double-cross scheme by a member of the first gang. 
 The encounter combined some of the most characteristic elements of New York crime during that decade, which began with 2,245 homicides in 1990 and enveloped the city in a fog of fear. And though the shootout was purely imaginary -- a scene from S. J. Rozan's 1994 novel ''China Trade'' -- it fully reflects the spirit of those tumultuous years. 
 Such scenes are much harder to imagine in today's New York. 
 ''That kind of book couldn't be written anymore, because that level of lawlessness has really disappeared,'' Ms. Rozan said in a recent conversation about the changing landscape for the city's writers of crime fiction. ''Anyone who has recently come to New York would pick it up and think: 'What is wrong with this woman? What is she making up?' ''
 As New York celebrates the sharp decline in crime -- earlier this year the city revealed that the 494 homicides in 2007 were the fewest since reliable police statistics became available in 1963 -- the crime writer may be the only New Yorker for whom that drop is not an unequivocal blessing. Just as the breakup of the Soviet Union caused problems for writers whose plots hinged on the dark doings of the cold war, so New York's crime writers are wondering where to find grist in a far safer city. 
 The grimy archetypes who hung out at Ms. Rozan's pier have largely receded, and their present-day replacements offer far less satisfying literary inspiration. ''Kids from the Midwest sporting goatees'' is how Stanley Alpert describes this population in a 2007 true-crime tale, calling them people ''without a care in the world other than Corona versus Amstel.'' 
 For some of the city's crime writers, the solution is to replace the subject of street violence with the subjects of terrorism and financial shenanigans. Others are retooling their plots; a crime can seem all the more shocking when it occurs in a tranquil neighborhood. Nonetheless, many mystery writers worry that a safer New York may become their most difficult case to crack.
 ''You can't make up a romantic vision of the kind of crime you would like to write about,'' said Ms. Rozan, whose best-known protagonist is Lydia Chin, a Chinese-American private investigator in Chinatown. ''Those of us who started in a different kind of era have had to adjust.'' 
 Crime in New Disguises
 With talk of recession dominating the news, many crime writers are thinking that if the economy sputters, crime may spike. Chris Grabenstein, a writer of mysteries set in New York and New Jersey, is already pondering the possible nature of a slowdown. 
 ''If the economy were to turn,'' Mr. Grabenstein said, ''would we go back to 1978, 1979, when I first moved to New York, when there were certain blocks you weren't supposed to go on, and you weren't supposed to ride the subway after 10 o'clock?''
 Many writers also note that the decline in street crime has not left them without topics, terrorism, of course, being the most compelling. Mr. Grabenstein deployed fear of terrorism in his 2007 thriller, ''Hell for the Holidays,'' in which a group of American white supremacists, influenced by Al Qaeda's terrorism tactics, plot destruction not in a faraway land but over a hamburger at the Times Square Applebees. 
 ''We live in a bull's-eye,'' Mr. Grabenstein said of today's New Yorkers, and that widespread if rarely discussed fear of terrorism provides considerable literary grist for him and his colleagues. 
 Still, as Otto Penzler, a respected scholar of the genre and the owner of the Mysterious Bookshop on Warren Street in TriBeCa, points out, traditional crimes like theft are still around; they just come in new guises. Unfortunately, today's thieves, with their ability to transfer money in stealthy electronic fashion, provide much less drama than did the bank robbers of old, with their masks and guns and terrified hostages.
 ''There are a lot of people committing crimes now,'' Mr. Penzler said, ''and we don't always see them.'' 
 New York nevertheless remains a financial capital, not to mention a playground for the rich. Soaring property values and the city's remarkable prosperity may have made some financial crimes even richer terrain for writers. Ms. Rozan's 2006 novel, ''In This Rain,'' for example, focuses on sleazy real estate dealings in gentrifying Harlem. 
 ''That's one of those crimes that life has handed us writers that we would not have had, as real estate pressure gets greater and greater,'' Ms. Rozan said. 
 Wendy Corsi Staub, an author of thrillers and mysteries, including three written in the '90s with Ed Koch, has adjusted to the city's changing fortunes in a different way. Although her career was fueled by the crime wave of the late '80s and early '90s, she has profited from its ebb by creatively reshaping her plots. 
 ''We have a false sense of security now, and I try to exploit that in my books,'' Ms. Staub said. ''The low rate makes every murder more dramatic.'' 
 To render her literary crimes even more shocking, she centers her stories in ''happy ending, cozy, upbeat New York'' and sets them in affluent neighborhoods like the Upper East Side, where crime is even less expected than elsewhere. Her 2005 thriller, ''Lullaby and Goodnight,'' for example, depicts a successful, pregnant advertising executive who is stalked in her Chelsea brownstone.
 Mean Streets Live On
 History has shown that writers can thrive in this genre even on the safest of streets. The hugely successful television franchise ''Law & Order,'' which had its premiere in high-crime 1990, continues to thrive in a far safer New York. 
 For many writers and publishers, that franchise is strong evidence that the decline of crime does not immediately affect their profession, and that works of the imagination have a life separate from the streets. They also point to Akashic Books, which in the low-crime years since 2004 has published ''Brooklyn Noir,'' a collection of short, gritty works that has sold 15,000 copies, and followed it with noir volumes set in Queens, the Bronx and Wall Street, with more to come. 
 ''When you talk about the crime rate and real crime and how it relates to crime fiction, I think it's a tenuous relationship,'' said Keith Kahla, an editor at St. Martin's Minotaur, which publishes about 130 crime fiction books a year, many of them set in New York. 
 One reason for that tenuousness, many in the crime-writing field suggest, is that outsiders tend to focus on the image of the city during its dangerous years, a perception that is hard to erase. 
 ''They want to think of New York as the crime capital of the world,'' said Mr. Penzler of the Mysterious Bookshop, ''even if it's the nation's third-safest large city, behind Honolulu and San Antonio.''
 Jan Grape, a mystery writer who lives in Austin, Tex., is proof that perceptions about the city die hard. In 1998, she visited New York to attend the Edgar Awards, the Oscars of the mystery writing trade. The city's crime rate was already declining, but Ms. Grape still shuddered when Ms. Rozan suggested taking the subway from a Midtown hotel to a restaurant in Greenwich Village. 
 ''We've always heard that it's so dangerous to ride the subway,'' Ms. Grape said the other day, laughing as she recognized in herself the quintessential frightened tourist. ''Our perceptions about New York are about as crazy as perceptions people in New York have about Texas.''
 These perceptions may be good for the crime publishing industry. ''Most of those books that are set in New York aren't selling here -- they're selling in Idaho,'' said Mr. Kahla of St. Martin's Minotaur. ''What the heck do they know?''
 Writer With a Blindfold
 Last Dec. 31, as the year's record-low number of killings filled the headlines, Paul LaRosa, a producer of the CBS newsmagazine ''48 Hours'' and a true-crime writer, began a blog called ''The Murder Book'' that listed and analyzed every killing reported in the daily papers. 
 ''My life is all about murder now,'' Mr. LaRosa explained in an interview. In his first posting, he wrote, ''I await the first murders of 2008.'' He didn't need to wait long. His title for the next day's post read, ''January 1st -- 4 murders as of 1 p.m.'' 
 Mr. LaRosa's blog touches a truth that may help crime writers thrive in a safer New York: All a writer needs for a book is a single murder. The 494 killings reported in the city last year may have been the lowest ever recorded, but that's still 494 killings that crime writers can use for inspiration. As Mr. LaRosa put it, ''Statistics are one thing, but every story is unto itself.''
 One of the most striking approaches to the problem was Stanley Alpert's. His true-crime book ''The Birthday Party: A Memoir of Survival'' takes place in 1998, when, as Mr. Alpert put it, ''crime was down, but not out.'' Like Truman Capote, whose classic ''In Cold Blood'' he read avidly, Mr. Alpert spent much time with the criminals featured in his book, enabling him to describe fully their troubled and sometimes tender humanity. But unlike Capote, Mr. Alpert spoke to his subjects not as interviewer but as victim. 
 On Jan. 21, 1998, the night before his 38th birthday, Mr. Alpert was kidnapped at gunpoint near his Greenwich Village apartment, held hostage overnight in an apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and released the next day in Prospect Park. 
 ''My perceptions were constrained, to some extent, by the fact that I spent 25 hours blindfolded,'' Mr. Alpert, who was an assistant United States attorney at the time, said dryly. Yet the book details his cool resourcefulness as he collects clues that will lead to his kidnappers' arrest.
 Not that the book contains no light moments. When Mr. Alpert's kidnappers -- who had chosen him at random -- learned of his profession, they sought his legal advice. And upon learning that it was his birthday, they offered him drugs and sexual favors from prostitutes.
 Sometimes New York's crime writers grow wistful about the bad old days for unexpected reasons, as was the case with Donald Bain, the highly successful author of more than 30 ''Murder, She Wrote'' books along with other crime novels. 
 In January, Mr. Bain was the main speaker at a meeting of the Mystery Writers of America, held at the National Arts Club, opposite Gramercy Park. 
 At dinner in the club's high-ceilinged dining room, Mr. Bain, a tall man with a white beard, reminisced about the early '90s, when his daughter lived on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. Her apartment building was next to a social club run by Vincent Gigante, a k a the Chin, the mobster whose associates used to sit outside the club, playing cards and drinking late into the night. If one of the men saw his daughter emerging from the subway station a few blocks away, Mr. Gigante dispatched one of them to walk her home safely. 
 The other writers at the table laughed, but their laughs were tinged with nostalgia for a vanished version of New York that could hand you a scene, just like that.

HEADLINE: Inside a Museum, It's Cool

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: Yonkers 

 BODY:
 THE group of middle school students gathered around a framed lithograph by Red Grooms that resembled a puzzle more than a finished picture. ''Why would anyone buy something like that?'' one student asked with a skeptical look. 
 Jazmine Viviana Ortiz, a middle school student herself, kept her cool as she faced the group. It was her job that early spring day, as a junior docent at the Hudson River Museum here, to help her fellow junior docents relate to the work. ''Why do you think they did?'' she asked, demonstrating a golden rule of being a docent: draw the visitor out. 
 At the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., the next day, a group of high school students prepared to take children from a neighborhood after-school center on a tour of two exhibitions. The students, called junior educators at the Bruce, had a mission similar to those in Yonkers: to engage children in learning about the museum and guide them in interacting with the works on display.
 Junior docents, as they are generally known, work as volunteers and paid helpers in museums nationwide. Teenagers from 13 to 18 can be a valuable asset to heavily pressed museum staffs facing crowds of visiting school groups and community centers every day. While training these young people to work with the public -- often the youngest members of the public -- museums are also helping to shape their own futures. ''Inspire children to become the museum builders of the future'' is how one New England museum describes its junior docent program on its Web site.
 In Yonkers, the main goal is to provide a rich after-school experience for the city's teenagers, said Rebecca Kraus, the Hudson River Museum's manager of youth and family programs. Here it is not so much about exposure to art, she said, as it is about personal growth. Speaking of the 65 middle school and high school students involved in this year's program, she said: ''It goes beyond art. I'm more concerned with them developing good communication skills, good professional skills and good leadership skills.''
 After Jazmine and other junior docents gave their Grooms talks, elaborating on works like the lithograph ''Dali Salad'' and the sculpture ''Tennessee Fox Trot Carousel,'' they sat down for a feedback session. ''Talk louder,'' many students told one another. Jazmine was complimented for thinking on her feet. ''I really liked the way you bounced back the question'' when put on the spot, Ms. Kraus said. 
 Students are selected for the coveted positions each year -- 60 applied to fill 20 openings last fall -- mostly on the basis of ''their eagerness to be here,'' Ms. Kraus said. After one year in the program, high school students get paid $7.15 an hour for weekend work -- but those simply looking for a job need not apply. The program is demanding: it includes meetings, field trips, tours with curators and poring through packets of written materials to prepare tours. 
 Evaluation by more advanced junior curators, along with Ms. Kraus, is part of the process. Junior docents are required to work one weekend day a month leading tours and running family-oriented workshops related to the exhibitions; they also run the museum's summer camp and lead activities during school holidays. 
 By several measures, the program has been a success. Students stay in it for an average of five years, and some return to become interns at the museum. The 200 students who have graduated from the program since it began in 1995 have gone on to college. In January the program received a Coming Up Taller award, a national award for after-school programs, from the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. It was presented by the first lady, Laura Bush, in a ceremony at the White House. 
 As in Yonkers, the 17 junior educators at the Bruce Museum, who all attend Greenwich High School, receive nurturing, personal guidance and exposure to a host of new experiences. In return, they help younger children enjoy the museum's offerings. They fill a real need, according to Robin Garr, the museum's director of education. ''There are so many after-school programs -- it's too much for the professional staff and the volunteer staff docents'' to do alone, she said. 
 All the students are paid for their work: wages range from $7 to attend a meeting to $15 for a teaching session after a year in the program (and $13 before that). Like their Yonkers counterparts, many of the students are from a lower economic background. 
 ''We're thrilled at being able to do something for at-risk kids'' after school, Ms. Garr said, noting that enthusiasm was crucial to being accepted into the program. 
 The young people are aware of the polish they can acquire this way. Interacting with children, said Youstina Youssef, 15, a 10th grader in the Bruce program, ''helps with public speaking roles -- I'll be using these skills.'' 
 Carlos Cardona, 15, a ninth grader at Greenwich High, said he enjoyed having his ''own little audience'' when speaking to children and tried not to bore them. ''It surprised me how much the kids know,'' he said. ''I learn from them every day.'' 
 Monique Semedo, 26, was a junior docent at the Hudson River Museum for four years. Now a school psychologist in the Bronx, she recalled the advantages working at the museum gave her. ''We got to speak to curators, met artists, traveled to other museums and interacted with different groups of people,'' she said. ''I learned as a young minority woman that learning is a very positive thing. It's cool.''

 BODY:
As dollar-poor Americans cut back on their travel abroad, the stampede in the other direction shows no signs of abating. Even as oil prices rose and temperatures fell in January and February, more foreigners than ever made their way to the United States for those months, according to new data from the Commerce Department. 
 Almost 18 percent more Canadians traveled to the United States in January and February this year than in the period a year earlier. It's a sign of how much the currency tables have turned. (Until recently, one hardly ever saw the word ''strong'' next to the word ''loonie.'') 
 Other countries that came through with double-digit increases included Germany, France, Brazil, China and Italy. Among the top 20 travel-generating countries, the overall increase was 13.2 percent for the two-month period. At that rate, foreign tourism is on track to set yet another record for 2008, as it did in 2007, and serve as a much-needed economic bright spot.

HEADLINE: Help for Struggling Homeowners

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
LENDERS are increasingly willing to change their loan terms for struggling borrowers, mortgage industry executives say, but the increased flexibility has not been enough to help many homeowners who wait too long before seeking help.
 According to a recent report by the Hope Now initiative, a mortgage industry outreach group formed last year to help struggling homeowners, nearly 503,000 owners worked with lenders and loan servicers affiliated with the initiative in the first three months of this year to modify their loan payments and avoid foreclosure.
 That figure represents a significant increase over the final three months of 2007, but Faith Schwartz, Hope Now's executive director, said, ''There is still more work to be done.'' 
 Industry analysts and mortgage counselors agree. ''Hope Now is having a material impact, but it is being overwhelmed by the magnitude of the problem,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com. ''Moreover, the problem has shifted away from ARM resets, which it was designed to address,'' alluding to changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, ''and toward negative homeowners' equity and rising unemployment.''
 Mr. Zandi said that this year and next, about 3.9 million homeowners would fall behind on their mortgages. He projected that about 2.5 million would lose their homes.
 Calls continue to flood the Hope hot line at 1-888-995-HOPE (1-888-995-4673), which is the toll-free hot line affiliated with Hope Now. It is operated by the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit counseling service.
 Colleen Hernandez, the foundation's executive director, said her service had fielded about 250,000 calls in the first three months of this year (other people called their lenders directly). About 30 percent of the callers sought counseling, and about a third of those, or 25,000 people, were actually eligible for help.
 After counseling and outreach to the lender or mortgage servicer, about 34 percent had their loans modified, while another 30 percent remain in negotiations.
 Of the 250,000, then, roughly 8,500 were able to get their loans modified and another 7,500 remain in negotiations for modifications. Many of the remaining 9,000 who were eligible for help, Ms. Hernandez said, improved their finances through counseling and caught up on payments.
 In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the number of cases that lenders have modified loans for struggling borrowers has more than tripled in the past year, according to Hope Now.
 Absolute numbers, however, remain modest. Only about 3,300 mortgages were modified by servicers in the first three months of this year in New York State, for example; 2,100 in New Jersey; and about 1,200 in Connecticut.
 Connie Lassandro, housing director for Nassau County, said borrowers were still waiting far too long to seek help. ''It's so frustrating because we've saturated the community with messages about where to go for help,'' Ms. Lassandro said.
 Of the roughly 200 weekly calls that her department fields from troubled borrowers, Ms. Lassandro said, about 20 percent are current enough on their mortgages to avoid foreclosure. That is actually an improvement from six months ago, she said, when the figure was about 5 percent.
 ''We've been quite successful lately in doing loan modifications,'' Ms. Lassandro said. ''Lenders aren't breaking down the doors to do them, but they realize they have to be cooperative or they'll end up with a lot of real estate on their hands.''

HEADLINE: Oil's Rippling Effects May 18-24

 BODY:
THE NEWS Senate Democrats vented their fury at oil executives over high gasoline prices and warned of a new tax on so-called windfall profits.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Such showdowns have become routine but took on a new urgency as lawmakers prepared for a Memorial Day recess where they expected to hear from angry voters. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested corporate greed was a factor pushing up oil prices. But the executives suggested Democrats were at fault for not allowing more drilling for domestic oil. ''As repetitive and uninteresting as it may sound,'' said one executive, ''the fundamental laws of supply and demand are at work.'' 
 THE NEWS Italy announced that it planned to resume building nuclear energy plants.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Two decades ago, Italy banned nuclear power and deactivated its reactors following a resounding public referendum. The turnaround reflects growing concern in Europe over the rising price of oil and energy security, and the warming effects of carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Italy has been hit hard by oil prices as the largest net energy importer in Europe but is not alone in reconsidering nuclear power. ''The sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly all across Europe,'' said one nuclear industry official.
 THE NEWSAmerican Airlines said it would cut service by up to 12 percent and begin charging $15 for many passengers to check their first bag.
 BEHIND THE NEWS American and other airlines have been clobbered by skyrocketing jet fuel prices, which have climbed 80 percent in the last year. Airlines have responded with fare increases, surcharges and fees for services that had been free. Other airlines also plan to reduce their fleets. Unless oil prices unexpectedly retreat, nearly the entire industry is expected to lose money this year. ''It's the end of an era,'' said one airline consultant. ''Soon, like freight, we will pay by the pound for passenger air travel.'' 
 THE NEWS Ford Motor Company said it would make sweeping production cuts and miss its goal to become profitable by 2009.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Ford cited higher gas prices and slowing sales, notably, sharply lower demand for large trucks and sport utility vehicles. General Motors and Chrysler have also been hurt by slumping demand for trucks and S.U.V.'s as the industry heads toward what may be its worst sales year in more than a decade. Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the shift by consumers to smaller cars and crossovers appeared to be ''structural in nature,'' not a short-term reaction to fuel prices. ''We need to act now,'' he said. 
 THE NEWS Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles in March than they did in March 2007, a drop of 4.3 percent, the steepest month-on-month decline since 1942, when record keeping began, the Transportation Department said. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Over all, gasoline demand in the United States has fallen sharply and is headed for its first annual decline in 17 years. A recent survey by AAA, the automobile club, found a rare year-on-year decline of 1 percent in the number of people planning to travel this summer. ''The psychology has changed,'' said one economic forecaster. ''People have recognized that prices are not going down and are adapting to higher energy costs. It's capitulation.''

 BODY:
ZOOM There are many photographs of Manadel al-Jamadi's body at Abu Ghraib, but it is the one with Specialist Sabrina Harman that stands out among them -- the photograph of a pretty American girl who is alive (giving the ''thumbs up'') and a battered Iraqi man who is dead. The photograph misdirects us. We become angry at Harman, rather than angry at the killer.
 We see al-Jamadi's body, but we don't see the act that turned him from a human being into a corpse. We don't understand what the photograph means, nor what it is about. 
 Instead of ''Who is that man? Who killed him?'' the question becomes, ''Why is this woman smiling?'' It becomes the important thing, if not the only thing. The viewer assumes Harman is in some way responsible or connected to the murder, and is gloating over the body. How dare she? Isn't she in the same photograph as the body? Looming over the corpse? Even if she is not guilty, she stands in (in the viewer's imagination) for those who are.
 Photographs reveal and they conceal. Yes, at first I believed that Harman was complicit. I believed that she was implicated in al-Jamadi's death. I was wrong. I, too, was fooled by the smile.
 -- Errol Morris, 
 ''The Most Curious Thing''
 MEASURE FOR MEASURE It is an immutable ''truth'' in art and music that facts are not necessarily the best indicators of the deepest human experience.
 The table where you found the suicide note, the cup of coffee that turned cold because you were distracted in a painful reverie staring out the window at the rain dripping off the eaves, the seashell left in the coat pocket from the last time you were at that favorite spot at the ocean, when it all came clear that you were at the right place with the wrong man, the letters, the photos, the marbles and jewels -- all these artifacts carry poetic weight and should be used liberally in songwriting. These are the facts that convey truth to me.
 The exact words he said, who was right or wrong, whether he relapsed on the 7th or the 10th, why exactly she does what she does, the depth and weight and timbre of the feelings, whether Love Heals Everything -- these aren't facts, these are ever-changing blobs of emotional mercury, and when you are working in rhyme, it can be much more powerful and resonant to write about the shards of the coffee cup than about the feeling that caused him to throw it across the room. You are better off moving the furniture than you are directly analyzing the furniture maker. 
 -- Rosanne Cash,
 ''The Ear of the Beholder''
 OUTPOSTS It was one thing for the Iraq war to pass an inglorious five-year landmark in March, longer than any other American conflict except the Vietnam War. But it now looks as if it will be costlier than all wars except World War II -- with a price tag that could near $3 trillion. 
 It has already cost twice as much, in inflation-adjusted dollars, as World War I, and 10 times as much as the Persian Gulf war, according to a new book by Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes. This is in addition to the more than 4,000 American lives lost, 30,000 wounded and the psychic blows that will ripple through every town that sent a young person off to fight.
 Yet, for its prolonged clutch on our treasury and blood, no war as been so out of sight, so stage-managed to be painless and invisible. We're supposed to shop, to spend our stimulus checks, to carry on as if nothing has happened -- or is happening. Every now and then we get to rise at a stadium or pause to let some soldiers returning home from Iraq off an airplane. Some sacrifice.
 It would be more fitting for us on that plane to stand aside while a flag-draped coffin was unloaded. Then we'd get a moment to wonder what it's like to put a 19-year-old son in a grave, to lose a sister, a spouse, to see war as something more than a parlor game of neo-cons.
 -- Timothy Egan, ''The Invisible War''
 THE WILD SIDE Work on interspecies cloning has been proceeding for a number of years. Macaque (that's a type of monkey) DNA has been put into rabbit eggs; gaur (a kind of South Asian cow) DNA has been put into domestic cow eggs; mouflon (an exotic sheep) DNA has been put into domestic sheep eggs. Usually the experiments end before significant embryonic development takes place; in few cases have any live animals been born. (Unlike traditional hybrids, such animals are clearly of the species that the nucleus came from.) Most of these experiments are being done in the hope of one day being able to rescue endangered species.
 Meanwhile, in several countries including China, South Korea and the United States, human DNA has been put into eggs from both rabbits and cows; in one experiment (with rabbit eggs), some embryonic stem cells were generated.
 It may be that no human stem cell lines will be produced from such work. But even if they are not, we will learn an enormous amount about how embryos develop. This in itself may lead to insights about how to treat diseases, or to any number of important discoveries we cannot foresee.

HEADLINE: Inside a Museum, It's Cool

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: Greenwich 

 BODY:
 ON a rainy spring day at the Bruce Museum here, a group of high school students prepared to take children from a neighborhood after-school center on a tour of two exhibitions. The students, called junior educators, had a mission: to engage the children in learning about the museum and guide them in interacting with the works on display. 
 As the children shed their raincoats and lined up near the entranceway, a junior educator reminded them of the rules: no running, use a ''quiet inside voice'' and, most importantly, ''have fun.'' 
 That same week, at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, a group of middle school students gathered around a framed lithograph by Red Grooms that resembled a puzzle more than a finished picture. ''Why would anyone buy something like that?'' one student asked with a skeptical look. 
 Jazmine Viviana Ortiz, a Yonkers middle school student herself, kept her cool as she faced the group. It was her job, as a junior docent at the museum, to help her fellow junior docents relate to the work. ''Why do you think they did?'' she asked, demonstrating a golden rule of being a docent: draw the visitor out.

 The 17 junior educators at the Bruce Museum, who all attend Greenwich High School, receive nurturing, personal guidance and exposure to a host of new experiences. In return, they help younger children enjoy the museum's offerings. They fill a real need, according to Robin Garr, the museum's director of education. ''There are so many after-school programs -- it's too much for the professional staff and the volunteer staff docents'' to do alone, she said. 
 All the students are paid for their work: wages range from $7 to attend a meeting to $15 for a teaching session after a year in the program (and $13 before that). Like their Yonkers counterparts, many of the students are from a lower economic background. 
 ''We're thrilled at being able to do something for at-risk kids'' after school, Ms. Garr said, noting that enthusiasm was crucial to being accepted into the program. 
 The young people are aware of the polish they can acquire this way. Interacting with children, said Youstina Youssef, 15, a 10th grader in the Bruce program, ''helps with public speaking roles -- I'll be using these skills.'' 
 Carlos Cardona, 15, a ninth grader at Greenwich High, said he enjoyed having his ''own little audience'' when speaking to children and tried not to bore them. ''It surprised me how much the kids know,'' he said. ''I learn from them every day.'' 
 In Yonkers, the main goal is to provide a rich after-school experience for the city's teenagers, said Rebecca Kraus, the Hudson River Museum's manager of youth and family programs. Here it is not so much about exposure to art, she said, as it is about personal growth. Speaking of the 65 middle school and high school students involved in this year's program, she said: ''It goes beyond art. I'm more concerned with them developing good communication skills, good professional skills and good leadership skills.''
 After Jazmine and other junior docents gave their Grooms talks, elaborating on works like the lithograph ''Dali Salad'' and the sculpture ''Tennessee Fox Trot Carousel,'' they sat down for a feedback session. ''Talk louder,'' many students told one another. Jazmine was complimented for thinking on her feet. ''I really liked the way you bounced back the question'' when put on the spot, Ms. Kraus said. 
 Students are selected for the coveted positions each year -- 60 applied to fill 20 openings last fall -- mostly on the basis of ''their eagerness to be here,'' Ms. Kraus said. After one year in the program, high school students get $7.15 an hour for weekend work -- but those simply looking for a job need not apply. The program is demanding: it includes meetings, field trips, tours with curators and poring through packets of written materials to prepare tours. 
 Evaluation by more advanced junior curators, along with Ms. Kraus, is part of the process. Junior docents are required to work one weekend day a month leading tours and running family-oriented workshops related to the exhibitions; they also run the museum's summer camp and lead activities during school holidays. 
 By several measures, the program has been a success. Students stay in it for an average of five years, and some return to become interns at the museum. The 200 students who have graduated from the program since it began in 1995 have gone on to college. In January the program received a Coming Up Taller award, a national award for after-school programs, from the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. It was presented by the first lady, Laura Bush, in a ceremony at the White House. 
 Monique Semedo, 26, was a junior docent at the Hudson River Museum for four years. Now a school psychologist in the Bronx, she recalled the advantages working at the museum gave her. ''We got to speak to curators, met artists, traveled to other museums and interacted with different groups of people,'' she said. ''I learned as a young minority woman that learning is a very positive thing. It's cool.''

HEADLINE: Where Breathing Is Deadly

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BADUI, China 

 BODY:
 China's biggest health disaster isn't the terrible Sichuan earthquake this month. It's the air.
 The quake killed at least 60,000 people, generating a response that has been heartwarming and inspiring, with even schoolchildren in China donating to the victims. Yet with little notice, somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 Chinese die prematurely every year from the effects of outdoor air pollution, according to studies by Chinese and international agencies alike. 
 In short, roughly as many Chinese die every two months from the air as were killed in the earthquake. And the problem is becoming international: just as Californians can find Chinese-made shoes in their stores, they can now find Chinese-made haze in their skies. 
 This summer's Beijing Olympics will showcase the most remarkable economic explosion in history, and also some of the world's thickest pollution in both air and water. So I've returned to the Yellow River in western China's Gansu Province to an isolated village that has haunted me since I saw it a decade ago.
 Badui is known locally as the ''village of dunces.'' That's because of the large number of mentally retarded people here -- as well as the profusion of birth defects, skin rashes and physical deformities. Residents are sure that the problems result from a nearby fertilizer factory dumping effluent that taints their drinking water.
 ''Even if you're afraid, you have to drink,'' said Zhou Genger, the mother of a 15-year-old girl who is mentally retarded and has a hunchback. The girl, Kong Dongmei, mumbled unintelligibly, and Ms. Zhou said she had never been able to speak clearly.
 Ms. Zhou pulled up the back of her daughter's shirt, revealing a twisted, disfiguring mass of bones. 
 A 10-year-old neighbor girl named Hong Xia watched, her eyes filled with wonder at my camera. The neighbors say she, too, is retarded.
 None of this is surprising: rural China is full of ''cancer villages'' caused by pollution from factories. Beijing's air sometimes has a particulate concentration that is four times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization. 
 Scientists have tracked clouds of Chinese pollution as they drift over the Pacific and descend on America's West Coast. The impact on American health is uncertain.
 In fairness, China has been better than most other countries in curbing pollution, paying attention to the environment at a much earlier stage of development than the United States, Europe or Japan. Most impressive, in 2004, China embraced tighter fuel economy standards than the Bush administration was willing to accept at the time.
 The city of Shanghai charges up to $7,000 for a license plate, thus reducing the number of new vehicles, and China has planted millions of trees and hugely expanded the use of natural gas to reduce emissions. If you look at what China's leaders are doing, you wish that President Bush were half as green.
 But then you peer into the Chinese haze -- and despair. The economic boom is raising living standards hugely in many ways, but the toll of the resulting pollution can be brutal. The filth is prompting public protests, but the government has tightly curbed the civil society organizations that could help monitor pollution and keep it in check.
 An environmental activist named Wu Lihong warned for years that Lake Tai, China's third-largest freshwater lake, was endangered by chemical factories along its banks. Mr. Wu was proved right when the lake filled with toxins last summer -- shortly after the authorities had sentenced him to three years in prison. 
 Here in Badui, the picture is as complex as China's development itself. The government has taken action since my previous visit: the factory supposedly is no longer dumping pollutants, and the villages have been supplied with water that, in theory, is pure. The villagers don't entirely believe this, but they acknowledge that their health problems have diminished.
 Moreover, economic development has reached Badui. It is still poor, with a per-capita income of $100 a year, but there is now a rough dirt road to the village. On my last visit, there was only a footpath.
 The road has increased economic opportunities. Farmers have dug ponds to raise fish that are trucked to the markets, but the fish are raised in water taken from the Yellow River just below the fertilizer factory. When I looked in one pond, the first thing I saw was a dead fish.
 ''We eat the fish ourselves,'' said the village leader, Li Yuntang. ''We worry about the chemicals, but we have to eat.'' He said that as far as he knew, the fish had never been inspected for safety.
 Now those fish from this dubious water are sold to unsuspecting residents in the city of Lanzhou. And the complexities and ambiguities about that progress offer a window into the shadings of China's economic boom.

HEADLINE: Legislator Sees No Race Card: Just Fairness

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: Centereach 

 BODY:
 BRIAN BEEDENBENDER, the Yankees-loving upstart -- check out the spare tire cover on his decade-old, spanking clean Chevy Blazer -- who at 27 snagged a job in the Suffolk County Legislature in November, politely ponders a rude question. ''How do I know I'm not a racist?'' the freshman legislator repeats, buying time as he twirls in his office chair. Speechlessness briefly descends. 
 ''I don't know how to answer that, because how do you prove or disprove a negative?'' says Mr. Beedenbender, the sponsor of a measure affecting undocumented workers, modulating his boom-box voice for an instant. 
 ''I just know I'm not racist; I've never thought like that,'' says Mr. Beedenbender, who grew up in Uniondale (a racial stew) and Selden (predominantly white). ''If you put in a hard day's work, take your garbage can to the curb and keep your lawn nice, you're my neighbor, you're my brother.'' Note to female neighbors: he didn't forget you, you're his sisters, provided you abide by those golden rules of suburbia. But there is an exception to his neighborliness.
 This avid reader of Governing magazine (''Some of my best ideas come from there'') and former student of presidential politics (James Madison University and the University of Delaware) is prone to paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln (''When I do good, I feel good''). But on the matter of undocumented laborers and, more to the point, the scofflaw contractors who employ them, Mr. Beedenbender's neighborhood is definitely retracting the welcome mat. Countywide. 
 He is the force behind Suffolk's new worker-status bill, which, amplifying a law espoused by County Executive Steve Levy in October 2006 that mandates all 6,000 businesses with county contracts ensure that they have no illegal immigrants on the payroll, extends the stricture to the county's roughly 17,000 licensed contractors. His aim, Mr. Beedenbender says, is to level an uneven economic playing field, not to play bad cop against undocumented workers. 
 ''Cheating contractors are the target, but it's become a bit of a circus because of this reflexive attitude that blames things on race when my bill is really talking about other things,'' he argues. On principle, Mr. Beedenbender refuses to drive a county-issued car, chatter on a county-issued cellphone or take the county-issued raise of 3 percent due him in January. And he refuses to back down from his contention that undocumented workers, and the contractors who pay them peanuts, are harming the county's already fragile economy. 
 ''This is not about people, it's about a situation, an economic inequity, and since when do we reward somebody for breaking the law?'' he asks. ''To make this a bill about race turns it into two camps: If you're against it, you're compassionate and progressive, and if you're for it, you're a racist bigot.''
 Mr. Beedenbender has no shortage of critics, including one who asserted publicly that he must be racist or stupid. The ugliness has reached a point where he and a fellow Democratic legislator, Ricardo Montano, a Puerto Rican who has taken a lawsuit against the bill to State Supreme Court in Riverhead, are not on speaking terms. 
 Mr. Beedenbender moved into the good graces of Suffolk County's Democratic Party leadership while he was an aide to Mr. Levy, whose anti-illegal immigration agenda has become a national benchmark. Taking his cue from Mr. Levy, but insistent that the bill was his idea, Mr. Beedenbender campaigned on the issue last fall; he estimates he knocked on 10,000 doors. Scarcely a month into office, he sponsored a bill that, after considerable demonization and a failed ambush by Legislator Jon Cooper, a Democrat who had proposed a somewhat less punitive bill, is expected to be signed into law by Mr. Levy later this month. 
 So Mr. Beedenbender, whose father is an auto mechanic, whose mother is an insurance broker and whose first full-time job not involving manual labor was as Mr. Levy's aide, is one-for-one on the legislative floor. Next on his list: putting a cap on county debt and a dent in the foreclosure crisis. A mass deportation of undocumented workers and their dependents is not, he promises, on his agenda. 
 Mr. Beedenbender notes that Mr. Lincoln, chastised by his political elders for being a young man in a big hurry by age 21, brushed off the barbs: ''He said, 'We all have our peculiar ambition.' '' And what is Mr. Beedenbender's ambition; would he like to end up like Mr. Lincoln, minus the premature demise? ''Well, I will tell you one thing I will not do ever, and that is to serve in the State Assembly or State Senate,'' he says. ''In those institutions, you are serving at the will of the person in charge, and I'm not good at taking orders.''
 Giving orders: another story.
 ''Hey, any politician who tells you they wouldn't want to be president is lying,'' he says. Which is reminiscent of something, rumor has it, George Washington once said.

McMAFIA 
 A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld. 
 By Misha Glenny. 
 Illustrated. 375 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95. 
 Around the time the Soviet Union ceased to exist, I was waiting in the entry queue at Fiumicino Airport in Rome when I noticed a party of several dozen young Russian girls being fast-tracked past a freshly opened control window. By young I mean perhaps 15, and by Russian girls I mean beautiful adolescents with pale gold hair, perfect skin and the figures of child ballerinas. These wide-eyed coltish kids weren't dancers or on a school trip. They were hustled along by a stocky middle-aged man with a short mustache and a stash of passports in his hairy hand. It was an unforgettable image of lambs to the slaughter -- or, more precisely, of children to the brothel. You sometimes glimpse them, older now, dispersed around the world, and how they were engulfed by the criminal universe is one of the things Misha Glenny describes in ''McMafia,'' his dizzy tour of the forms of global crime born in the late '80s, when finance capital shook off restraints and the Soviet Union collapsed. 
 After a telling little prologue from 1994 involving a doorstep killing in leafy English suburbia, Glenny -- a former BBC reporter who has written on the Balkans -- begins his tour in territory he knows well. His reporting from the ruins of the Soviet world and its periphery is engrossingly dense with remembered anecdotal detail. In Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia, Glenny knows dealers on the streets and bosses in the government. He also knows what happens when his new Audi is stolen in Zagreb. 
 Glenny's criminal geography centers on the post-Soviet countries, whose influence he sees spreading outward to ''countries as far away from one another as India, Colombia and Japan.'' He signposts but doesn't travel a ''new Silk Route, a multilane criminal highway'' linking the old Soviet periphery with central and eastern Asia. None of this is quite as new as he implies. The distant countries have long and busy criminal histories of their own, and their own international trading links. Heroin was traveling across Asia into Europe in a big way from the time of the Vietnam War, and cocaine was moving north through the Americas and across the Atlantic not long after. Cosa Nostra in Italy and the United States, the Colombian cartels and the Asian crime syndicates were all operating internationally long before the world went global. So was the arms trade. The patterns and the influences were as variable as in the above-ground economy.
 Glenny is good on some connections of the gangsters without borders, like the Russia-Israel link. His account of how Israel was colonized by Russian organized crime is memorable, and his fleeting image of the unutterable squalor of Tel Aviv's brothels, staffed by captive girls from the former Soviet Union and frequented by obese American teenage tourists, is unforgettable. He is grippingly ambivalent about Dubai, the Middle East's newly created Switzerland, and how it is energized by Indian organized crime and the subcontinent's Hindu-Muslim violence. After its sections on Eastern Europe and the Soviet fringe of Asia, this is the book's best part. In Dubai, the former coastal village with a dying pearl fishing industry, we see everyone -- ''Arabs, Iranians, Baluchis, East Africans, Pakistanis and west coast Indians'' -- converge. 
 In his ''journey through the global criminal underworld,'' Glenny flits from place to place, mostly avoiding Western Europe and North America. Each stopover has a fresh cast of players and a new criminal specialty. The fragmentation obscures some terrible global patterns, like the huge return of slavery as the trafficking of people. Glenny looks at prostitution rackets out of Eastern Europe, indentured labor in the Gulf states and migration rackets out of China -- where he sees ''the future of organized crime'' -- but hardly suggests how far people themselves have become merchandise, as indentured laborers, domestic slaves, child thieves, child soldiers, child prostitutes, babies for sale and children for adoption, pharmaceutical guinea pigs or organ suppliers. All move around the world with the collusion of customs, immigration, police, social services, charities and aid agencies.
 Traveling through the global underworld and -- with the splendid exception of Dubai -- flying high over points where the licit and illicit economies meet, Glenny tends to forget that one man's crime is another man's legitimate business opportunity. The otherness of the criminal world is, of course, a premise of true crime books, offering readers both thrills and reassurance, but today's crime is tomorrow's history. A birth pang, perhaps, of democracy. The criminality in the oil and gas industries gets space in ''McMafia,'' but in the countries of the former Soviet Union rather than Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or Angola. And like the rest of history, true crime is written by the winners. ''McMafia'' runs on the insight that money is a lot easier to move around than it used to be, but doesn't consider how the first world's financial systems are linked with the proceeds of the third world's business horrors -- the car bombs, the decapitations, the endless targeted killings, the flayings alive -- it describes. 
 ''As consumers, we are all involved,'' Glenny frets at the end, calling for ''greater regulation in the financial markets'' and ''strong, well-equipped law enforcement agencies.'' But ''McMafia'' ignores a dense network of complicity in the institutions of the West. Neither, after some vague talk at the outset of ''global reach as criminal corporations aspire to penetrate markets the world over,'' does it identify a global crime corporation, or explain how its activities might be ''mirroring the global goals of legal entities such as McDonald's.'' Glenny coins the term ''McMafia'' to describe the franchising system of Chechen organized crime, which makes sense, but the notion has nothing to do with the larger story. This is less about a new globalized criminality than the old one of interplay between criminal and political interests. Colombia, Afghanistan and the ''war on drugs'' might be good places to start telling it. 
 A model for all this remains the Sicilian Mafia, which is ignored here. Mafia is about control on the ground. It maintains order locally, and its reward is a free hand in business. Mafia is government and crime intertwined, and so, below the surface, are most of the instances Glenny describes. 
 A dozen or more years ago, the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, drew my attention to two things about organized crime in Italy. One was Cosa Nostra's bulwark role in keeping the Italian Communist Party out of power during the cold war decades. When the Soviet world imploded Cosa Nostra no longer mattered quite so much and began, like the politicians it had kept in office for half a century, to feel the rule of law. That, Orlando continued, was when Cosa Nostra globalized its business in a way that made its earlier drug dealings with Asia and South America look rather timid. Now it involved heavy arms, enriched plutonium and toxic waste. Orlando flew to Moscow and was horrified at the faces he recognized in business class.
 ''McMafia'' has great anecdotes but lacks structure and is fatally weakened by global overstretch. There's no big picture here, no corporate brand, no franchise. In global crime, the structures, the methods, the personnel, the channels, the merchandise, the alliances change even faster than they do in the world of legal business. There are patterns of complicity, however, and closer to home than Glenny's nightmare settings.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Exodus: Fear, Panic And Anger

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
THE mind wraps itself around losing a job, one of life's great traumas, in jagged and swerving fits. When the call comes in, when rumor turns to reality, when it's not the broker in the next cubicle but you who is presented with a stack of severance papers, the psyche takes over.
 It goes numb. It goes into survival mode. Fear quickly turns into anger. For some, there may be relief in saying goodbye to what therapists call the ''psychological terror'' that has haunted the corridors of troubled financial institutions since last summer. But what follows -- the unknown -- may be no less frightening.
 Since August, banks worldwide have announced plans to eliminate as many as 65,000 jobs. Many losing their jobs now have lived through other crises on Wall Street -- the 1987 market crash, the widespread layoffs of the early 1990s and the financial upheaval of 1998. But investment bankers, recruiters and psychologists say the current economic downturn, the cascade of layoffs and the steady beat of grim financial news have exacted an especially daunting psychic price. 
 ''These are people's lives,'' said an investment banker in his 30s who was laid off in November from his job at a Bank of America office in New York. ''It's not head count. We're not cattle.''
 Like other employees interviewed for this article, the Bank of American employee spoke on the condition of anonymity. He and several others who were laid off said that under the terms of their severance packages, they are not permitted to sue the company or to speak out negatively about it. 
 In an e-mail message, Bank of America said: ''Job reductions are sometimes a necessary course of business, but they are never easy, whether you are receiving the message or delivering it. We always try to be as respectful as possible.''
 Even for some of those who survive a job cut, the emotional landscape can change. ''It's like I woke up and I'm in a different country,'' said a person who has worked for Merrill Lynch for more than two decades and has weathered a recent round of layoffs there.
 He described widespread anger, mistrust and angst at Merrill, both among those leaving and those staying. ''People are reeling,'' he said. ''The culture has turned. It is a nasty culture.'' 
 Merrill Lynch laid off 20,000 people in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and while many Wall Street workers say the deaths of co-workers were a shattering experience, they draw a distinction between banks' actions then and now. Merrill has laid off 4,000 employees this year. In this round, ''these were self-inflicted wounds,'' the Merrill employee said.
 The Merrill banker spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the company does not permit employees to speak to reporters without permission, and he said he feared retribution if he sought that permission or identified himself. 
 Officials at Merrill Lynch declined to comment.
 MARLIN S. POTASH, a Manhattan psychologist who specializes in financial issues and whose practice has been overwhelmed with new clients from Wall Street in recent months, describes the emotional reaction as ''the depression of the depression,'' even as she acknowledges that the economy hasn't ground into a recession, let alone a depression.
 ''This time versus other times, it feels like there are more moving parts moving faster, and more unpredictability,'' she said. ''The lack of predictability seems to be taking a huge psychological toll.'' After the crash of 1987, for example, the markets stabilized quickly. 
 And even with the financial markets gaining some ground recently, analysts say that there is underlying panic, a sense that more bloodshed lurks, that upturns are only fleeting. 
 ''The financial market volatility leads to a kind of emotional volatility,'' Dr. Potash said. ''There are seismic shifts, up and down and up and down: 'I'm optimistic -- the market's looking good, the mortgage crisis is over. Oh, my God, they canceled an order. I can't concentrate.' ''
 Among the patients who have seen Alden M. Cass, a psychologist who treats Wall Street traders and executives, are several who were laid off from Bear Stearns after the bank collapsed. 
 ''They felt as if they were led with blindfolds on into a firing squad,'' Dr. Cass said.
 Officials at JPMorgan Chase & Company, which is acquiring Bear Stearns, declined to comment.
 Dr. Cass and other psychologists and researchers who have worked with Wall Street employees say that these workers -- often drawn to the intensity and volatility of their profession -- are more prone to anxiety, depression, substance abuse and other mental stresses than the general population. They drive themselves hard. Working 10, 12, 14 hours a day is not only expected; it is also a badge of honor. 
 In some ways, these experts say, Wall Street types are perhaps better prepared to handle the shock of sudden change than those in more stable professions. But because they are typically measured by the size of their paycheck -- bonuses, in particular -- their self-worth is deeply threatened when the money evaporates.
 ''We're talking about individuals who base their identities and egos on what they do for a living and how much they make,'' Dr. Cass said.
 Yet Wall Street is also a macho, ''don't let them see you sweat'' world where showing self-doubt and weakness, whether to clients or co-workers, is about as welcome as a stock whose value is taking a nosedive. 
 Still, psychologists say, for those being laid off, whether or not they are comfortable expressing it, there is boiling anger, a sense of betrayal and loss that is bound to rise to the surface.
 That appears to be true for the former investment banker at Bank of America who talked about being treated like cattle. He said he went numb when he was brought into a conference room with his manager and told he was being let go. He would get no bonus for 2007, either, typically 40 percent of his $120,000-a year salary, he said, and he was offered eight weeks of severance pay, which he accepted.
 ''I had no emotional response,'' he said. Yet he is clearly angry now.
 ''Someone who shows up to work every day, that should engender some sense of loyalty,'' he said. He was at Morgan Stanley in 1998, when it and other Wall Street banks were laying off thousands of workers. He had joined the bank in 1997, and before the layoffs, he said, ''There was a sense of loyalty, they got my back, that sense of pride.''
 ''But that loyalty idea is gone for most of these banks,'' he said.
 He had been with Bank of America for three and a half years when the layoff rumors, swirling in his department for weeks, reached a high pitch. Since October, the bank has cut 1,150 jobs. 
 He looked for work for six months, ran through his savings and recently found consulting work. He is single, rents an apartment in Manhattan and is still paying off loans from business school, as well as several thousand dollars of credit card debt. 
 He says he decided to stick to consulting because he no longer believes he can rely on bonuses or the guarantee of a long-term full-time job. With the layoffs, he said, the banks are ''destroying their greatest assets. It's an us-against-them mentality now.''
 KATHLEEN GURNEY, a financial psychologist, a researcher and the author of ''Your Money Personality: What It Is and How You Can Profit From It,'' has developed several personality profiles of workers on Wall Street. Each, she says, will respond differently to layoffs. 
 The ''High Roller'' lives on the edge financially and becomes addicted to the thrill of earning large sums of money. But when things go bad, ''they feel the greatest frustration both financially and psychologically,'' she said in an e-mail message. The most common profile is what she calls the ''Entrepreneur,'' thriving on ambition but not taking as many risks as the High Roller. 
 ''But they can be their own worst enemy in setting up ever-larger challenges and more rewarding challenges,'' she said, and in the face of losing a job, the Entrepreneur may deny the emotional impact. 
 ''Denial is a wonderful defense mechanism as it eases the pain,'' she said, ''but it also delays the day of reckoning.'' 
 A third type is what she calls the ''Money Master.'' People who fit this profile typically earn less than and take far fewer risks than the other two types and are better prepared to handle market swings and even layoffs, she said. 
 ''They can come out of it feeling even more confident than before if they use their flexibility and figure out a new game plan,'' she said.
 A 50-year-old Merrill financial adviser had already survived the 1987 stock market crash and crushing waves of layoffs before the Bank of America employee had even graduated from business school. For him, the layoffs at Merrill were not surprising, and the opportunity he took this month for a buyout felt like a gift.
 He said that because Merrill would not authorize an interview, he did not want to be identified and risk jeopardizing the package, which provided him with 67 weeks of pay on a $101,000 salary, and the ability to stay on the company health plan, paying out of pocket about $400 more per month than he did when he was with the company.
 He said he was sometimes irked by news media coverage that described the layoffs as shocking and devastating.
 ''If you went to school and you studied this industry and you studied economic cycles, why are you now surprised that this is happening?'' he said. ''It's like going into politics and saying, 'I didn't know I could be voted out of office.' ''
 He described himself as very cautious in his own financial affairs and said he began planning for retirement early in life. ''I'm in financial planning,'' he said. ''Isn't it a sin not to do so for yourself?'' 
 For others, though, especially those not close to retirement, the trauma of losing a job and the uncertainty in its wake can be devastating. That is particularly true for Wall Street workers, psychologists say, because their colleagues, family members and neighbors typically consider them to be financially secure. 
 ''Since they are expected to be experts, job loss and financial strain can trigger shame and embarrassment,'' said Bradley Klontz, a psychologist who specializes in financial matters. ''The shame can be similar to a cop who gets mugged.''
 FOR a 40-year-old midlevel employee at Bank of America in New York, being laid off was akin to losing her identity. 
 She had been in the industry for more than 15 years, and at Bank of America for five. But she was quick to say that no one should have a ''pity party'' for her when people earning far less were losing their jobs. In good years, with a good bonus, she earned as much as $400,000.
 Still, it was the money that made her feel worth something, she said. ''There's not a sense that you're helping the world,'' she said. ''I'm not curing cancer. If the money goes away, then what?''
 She was offered 10 weeks of severance pay. ''When I got laid off, I felt a sense of panic -- what am I going to do next?'' she said. But after that initial shock, she grew calm. ''I don't have to get up anymore and go and pretend things are fine when they're not.''
 She spoke on condition of anonymity because she said she feared retribution. She has been looking for jobs, but, as many recruiters say, it is an employers' market. 
 She has had trouble sleeping; she has lost weight. She started therapy but wonders whether it is helping. Not having a schedule is disorienting. She was accustomed to leaving the house even before her child woke up and getting home after dark.
 ''The first thing people ask you is what you do,'' she said. ''If you don't do anything anymore, then how do you feel about your- self?''

HEADLINE: Macklowes Sell G.M. Building For $2.9 Billion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A group led by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chief executive of Boston Properties, a publicly traded real estate company, is buying the General Motors Building and three other Midtown towers from the financially troubled Macklowe family for $3.95 billion.
 The deal, which had been brewing for months as the Macklowes sought to get out from under more than $7 billion in debt, is a victory for Mr. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News, and his partners, Goldman Sachs and the nations of Qatar and Kuwait, who paid about $2.9 billion for the 50-story, white marble G.M. Building on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street. It is the highest price ever paid for an American office tower. 
 The sale of the building represents the loss of the crown jewel of the Macklowe real estate empire. The travail of the Macklowes and the fate of the G.M. Building have been closely watched by real estate and banking executives, both for the family drama and as an indication of the health of the real estate market. 
 The deal was struck about 2 a.m. on Saturday. Hours later, Boston Properties issued a press release announcing its purchase of the G.M. Building as well as 540 Madison Avenue, a 39-story building at 55th Street; 125 West 55th Street, a 23-story building between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue; and 2 Grand Central Tower, a 44-story building between Lexington and Third Avenues.
 ''We're thrilled,'' Mr. Zuckerman said in a telephone interview. ''It is a real commitment to Manhattan and New York City and a real commitment to the future.''
 As for the G.M. Building, he said it was a good match for his company's collection of towers in New York, Washington, San Francisco and elsewhere. ''Obviously,'' he said, ''it's perhaps the most outstanding building in Manhattan and the country.''
 Mr. Zuckerman declined to discuss the partners involved in making the deal. Boston Properties posted a $165 million deposit. The closing is scheduled to take a place over the next several months.
 For the Macklowes, it is a bittersweet transaction. Harry Macklowe, a consummate real estate gambler, ruthless negotiator and talented developer, and his son, William S. Macklowe, had struggled for more than six months to find a solution that would allow them to pay off their debts while retaining control of the G.M. Building. But in the end, they had to relinquish the tower, where they had had so much success since they bought it in 2003 for $1.4 billion.
 Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate company, said: ''It's a cautionary tale. The market doesn't always go up. You can't assume that rents will go up 15 percent a year ad infinitum.'' 
 Fifteen months ago, the Macklowes sought to double the size of their holdings in Midtown by buying seven towers from Equity Office Buildings for $7 billion. But as the subprime mortgage crisis buffeted Wall Street, they found themselves unable to obtain permanent financing and were crushed by $7 billion in short-term, high-interest loans from Deutsche Bank and Fortress Investment Group.
 Still, it is remarkable that they could orchestrate a multibillion-dollar deal at a time when the capital markets are in turmoil and rival developers were circling their real estate holdings, hungry for cheap deals. The deal for the G.M. Building and the three others was not without some drama. Vornado Realty Trust and other competitors tried to make higher offers and upend the agreement with Boston Properties.
 ''We were determined to last five minutes longer than the other side,'' Mr. Zuckerman said.
 The Macklowes will now be able to pay off a nearly $1.4 billion loan from Fortress and consolidate their remaining real estate holdings. 
 Peter Briger, co-president of Fortress, said that the company would continue to hold a small note, $150 million, backed by the remaining Macklowe buildings. He said he was pleased with the transaction. ''They pulled off a coup in terms of the restructuring and an orderly sale,'' Mr. Briger said of the Macklowes. ''It could've been a very litigious and costly process.''
 Earlier this year, the Macklowes relinquished control of the seven towers that led to their troubles. Those building are now up for sale. Harry Macklowe may not make the next Forbes 400 list, but he and his family will continue to be players in the New York real estate world.
 ''You can never count Harry out,'' said the developer Douglas Durst. ''The Macklowes will be back.''
 They will continue to own four office towers -- at 400 Madison Avenue, 610 Broadway, 1330 Avenue of the Americas and one under construction at 510 Madison Avenue -- and three residential buildings, including Rivertower, where Harry Macklowe and his wife, Linda, have a duplex penthouse. In addition, the Macklowes will keep a prime development parcel, the former Drake Hotel site at Park Avenue and 56th Street.
 ''Over all, it's a net positive outcome,'' said William Macklowe, 40. ''We still have a premier operating platform. We'll continue to expand on what we have.''
 William Macklowe took the lead in negotiating with Fortress and Boston Properties, assembling a team that included Paul J. Ingrassia, who heads Citigroup's North American real estate group; Jonathan Mechanic, a real estate lawyer; and Darcy Stacom, the real estate broker from CB Richard Ellis who handled the sale.
 ''Hindsight gives everyone 20/20 vision,'' William Macklowe said. ''The ability to harness the past for the future is what makes someone a smarter and better investor.''
 William Macklowe has clearly emerged in his own right and will now take the reins of the family company from his father, according to real estate executives who know both men well. Harry Macklowe, who is 71, has always been a fierce competitor, whether it is playing golf, sailing his racing yacht or making deals. He emerged as a developer in the 1980s, when he built the Metropolitan Tower on 57th Street, and what was the Macklowe Hotel in Times Square. Like other developers, he took a drubbing during the recession in the early 1990s, losing several buildings, including the hotel, to lenders.
 Mr. Macklowe came roaring back in the mid-1990s with a series of smaller residential and commercial buildings. He ran into trouble with his lenders in 1998 over what was to be his comeback project, a skyscraper at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue.
 That was not to be. But in 2003, Mr. Macklowe beat out half a dozen other developers to buy the General Motors Building for what was then a record amount. At the time, many real estate executives said that Mr. Macklowe had overpaid and predicted he would lose the building to his lenders. Instead, his gamble paid off. He designed the glass cubed store for Apple, which has become a popular tourist attraction, and expanded the retail space on the Madison Avenue side of the building.
 Like some kind of real estate Icarus, Mr. Macklowe was at the top of his game in early 2007 when he gambled on buying the seven towers, using only $50 million of his own money and $7 billion in debt. It was a time when foreign investors, speculators and developers broke records on a daily basis, seemingly willing to pay anything for Manhattan skyscrapers. Their calculations, as well as those of the lenders, were based not on a building's current rent roll but on an estimation of how much higher rents would go in the coming years.
 ''It was an aggressive bet at a time when the financing sources would allow it,'' Mr. Briger said. ''The market changed. There's certainly been a transition from an easy money environment to a liquidity crisis and what is quickly becoming a credit crisis.''

HEADLINE: At Least a Start On Housing's Revival

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
BY some accounts, now might be an opportune time to buy a new home. Interest rates are lower, a result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive push to loosen credit, as are prices for many houses and condominiums. There is some optimism, too, that the federal government will eventually intercede with a housing bailout to halt the rise in foreclosures and help steady the market.
 Could this mean that investors should start thinking about buying the shares of home builders again? 
 Apparently believing that the worst of the housing crisis is behind them, some investors have been picking up stocks in this beleaguered sector, pushing up share prices. 
 Last year, the SNL Home Builders Index, published by the research company SNL Financial, plunged 56.8 percent. But since Jan. 1, the index, which tracks returns on 22 publicly traded companies, is up 2.4 percent through Thursday -- although that is down from highs reached in early April, when it was up 29 percent for the year. 
 Among this year's big gainers are Dominion Homes, up 84 percent; M/I Homes, up 50 percent; and Pulte Homes, up 17 percent. 
 Yet while many industry analysts agree that home-buying conditions have improved somewhat from a year ago, they say that any talk of a recovery for the housing market over all, and for homebuilders in particular, is a bit premature.
 ''We think this is a great time to be on the sidelines'' when it comes to investing in the building sector, said Paul D. Puryear, a real estate analyst at Raymond James & Associates. 
 ''Sure, it's a better time to buy a home than last year,'' Mr. Puryear said, ''and now the question becomes: Is it a better time to buy than next year?''
 Many analysts say they think the housing market has yet to reach its nadir.
 ''We believe that a bottom and subsequent recovery in housing could take longer than is correctly being anticipated,'' said Ivy Zelman, the chief executive of Zelman & Associates, a housing research firm, citing one of her recent reports on the home-building sector. 
 ''Optimism is normally reflected in equity prices well ahead of housing fundamental bottoms,'' she added.
 Mr. Puryear agreed. ''The stocks of builders are not trading on fundamentals,'' he said. ''They are trading on the hope of what might happen in the next several months.''
 Indeed, the fundamentals are still pretty grim, according to the latest government data. The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew a mere 0.1 percent in the first quarter, and 20,000 jobs were lost in April, the fourth consecutive monthly drop. During the first three months of the year, one in every 194 households received a foreclosure filing (which could cover anything from a default notice to actual repossession of a house), a 23 percent increase from the previous quarter, according to RealtyTrac, which follows home foreclosures.
 Demand for housing, meanwhile, remains weak despite lower prices and seven rate cuts by the Fed since last September, with many buyers still waiting for signs that the market has bottomed out. New-home sales fell 8.5 percent in March from the previous month and 36.6 percent from the same month the previous year, and the median price slipped 13.3 percent from 12 months earlier, the biggest year-over-year dip in nearly four decades.
 One reason for the drop might also be tighter lending standards, which come in response to a subprime market shakeup. (About 60 percent of domestic loan officers toughened standards on prime mortgages in April, according to the latest monthly Fed survey.) 
 What most concerns industry analysts, however, is the giant glut of unsold homes. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that the number of vacant residential properties, new and existing, reached a record 18.6 million in the first quarter. 
 ''I don't think people appreciate how long it's going to take to get the inventory level back down enough to give sellers some pricing power,'' Mr. Puryear said. ''It's going to take, in our opinion, two to three years.''
 To bolster sales, home builders are again piling on incentives, including financing, free upgrades and special features. Beazer Homes USA, for example, has made eco-friendly products standard in its houses and is offering home office workstations and built-in storage units.
 But Ms. Zelman said: ''It isn't enough any more to just offer incentives. Now there has to be significant price reduction.''
 Robert I. Toll, the chief executive of Toll Brothers, one of the nation's largest builders, has already done much of the above, especially to reduce the company's inventory of ''spec'' houses -- those built without a contracted buyer. 
 ''We start off with modest incentives, then we increase them,'' Mr. Toll said in an interview. ''We might build an addition to the home for nothing, or a garden room off the kitchen, or give you a special kitchen package. We will run specials, like 'this week only' price reductions, to create urgency.'' 
 The strategy seems to be working. ''We've sold almost all of the single-family specs that we had built up,'' he said. 
 Still, it comes at a price. Preliminary numbers released this month show that in Toll Brothers' second quarter, which ended April 30, revenues were off 30 percent from the 2007 quarter and net contracts (orders minus cancellations) were 44 percent lower. The average home price also fell, to $590,000 from $711,000, which Mr. Toll attributes partly to fewer sales in expensive markets like California and New York. Analysts expect the company to report a loss when it releases its full earnings report next week.
 Other big builders have been reporting losses, among them, Pulte Homes, the Ryland Group and D. R. Horton. 
 Besides dealing with plummeting sales, many builders have had to write down the value of their land holdings, while contending with escalating construction costs, including those for petroleum-based products.
 Despite the myriad problems, there are some glimmers of hope, said David Goldberg, an analyst at UBS Securities. He notes, for example, that housing starts have been approaching 17-year lows, which means less supply hitting the marketplace, and that new-home prices have been declining faster than those for existing homes, which is helping to attract buyers and reduce the inventory of newly built homes. 
 INDUSTRY analysts say that some builders are better positioned than others. Mr. Goldberg says he likes Toll Brothers in particular.
 ''It's a different business model -- it caters exclusively to the affluent buyer,'' he said, and those buyers are often better able to withstand economic volatility. ''Toll's biggest competitors are private builders, and they are experiencing capital restraints,'' he added. 
 Mr. Goldberg has a positive view of the Centex Corporation and KB Home, though he feels that ''their valuations are too expensive right now.''
 Mr. Puryear also likes Toll, and he is optimistic about Ryland, he says, because it ''doesn't like to carry a lot of raw land -- it likes to buy finished lots.'' 
 Ms. Zelman, meanwhile, spoke favorably of the Lennar Corporation, which she says has been an aggressive land seller. The company recently sold 11,000 home sites to a new venture owned largely by an affiliate of Morgan Stanley for $525 million. Lennar will maintain a 20 percent stake in that venture.
 ''Lennar has a very strong management team -- very tenured -- that has been through several downturns and is no stranger about how to survive the downturn,'' she added. 
 Mr. Toll has steered his company through plenty of economic peaks and troughs as well, and recalls some of the more recent fluctuations.
 ''We've had five good years, from 1982 to 1987, and then we had three really bad years in '88, '89, '90, followed by five tepid years from '91 to '95, followed by 10 great years,'' he said. ''And we now have had two and a half years of one of the worst markets. 
 ''I've seen this movie four or five times now, and I assure you this, too, shall pass.''

HEADLINE: Toughest Summer Job This Year Is Finding One

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla. 

 BODY:
School is out, and Aaron Stallings, his junior year of high school behind him, wanders the air-conditioned cocoon of the Woodland Hills Mall in search of a job. 
 Mr. Stallings, 18, says he has been looking for three months, burning gasoline to get to the mall, then filling out applications at stores selling skateboard T-shirts, beach sandals and baseball caps. He likes the idea of working amid the goods he covets. But so far, no offers.
 ''I'm going to go to Iraq and get a job,'' he says acidly. ''I hear they've got cheap gas.'' He grins. ''I'm just playing. But I've been all over, and nobody's hiring. They just say, 'We'll call you tomorrow.' And no one ever calls back.'' 
 As the forces of economic downturn ripple widely across the United States, the job market of 2008 is shaping up as the weakest in more than half a century for teenagers looking for summer work, according to labor economists, government data and companies that hire young people. 
 This deterioration is jeopardizing what many experts consider a crucial beginning stage of working life, one that gives young people experience and confidence along with pocket money.
 Little more than one-third of the 16- to 19-year-olds in the United States are likely to be employed this summer, the smallest share since the government began tracking teenage work in 1948, according to a research paper published by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. That is a sharp drop from the 45 percent level of teenage employment reached in 2000. 
 The rates among minority young people have been particularly low, with only 21 percent of African-Americans and 31 percent of Hispanics from the ages of 16 to 19 employed last summer, according to the Labor Department.
 Retailers, a major source of summer jobs, are grappling with a loss of American spending power, causing some to pull back in hiring. Restaurants, also big employers of teenagers, are adding jobs at a slower pace than in previous summers, said Hudson Riehle, senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association in Washington.
 As older people stay in the work force longer and as experienced workers lose jobs at factories and offices, settling for lower-paying work in restaurants and retail, some teenagers are being squeezed out.
 ''When you go into a recession, kids always get hit the hardest,'' said Andrew Sum, an economist at the Center for Labor Market Studies who led the study on the summer job market. ''Kids always go to the back of the hiring queue. Now, they find themselves with a lot of other people in line ahead of them.''
 At the lower end of the market, adult Mexican immigrants, in particular, pose competition for jobs traditionally filled by younger Americans, like those at fast food chains. 
 ''Spanish-speaking team members in our stores have increased the age a little bit,'' said Andy Lorenzen, senior manager for human resources at Chick-fil-A, a national chain of chicken restaurants based in Atlanta, where 70 percent of the work force is 14 to 19 years old. Adult workers ''have lost jobs in this economic downturn and begun to seek employment in our stores.''
 Employment among American teenagers has been sliding continuously for the last decade and, with a few ups and downs, dropping steadily since the late 1970s, when nearly half of all 16- to 19-year-olds had summer jobs.
 Economists debate the cause of this precipitous decline in teenage employment. Many contend that the drop is largely a favorable trend, reflecting a rising percentage of teenagers completing high school and going on to college, with some enrolling in summer academic programs, leaving less time for work. 
 ''The key factor is the attraction of attending college and enjoying the increasing wage premium that accompanies this,'' said John H. Pencavel, a labor economist at Stanford University.
 In wealthier households, many have come to see summer work as a waste of time that could be spent gaining an edge in the competition for entry to elite colleges.
 ''Kids from higher-income households just aren't going into the labor market,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''They're looking for things to put on resumes, and working at Dairy Queen or Wal-Mart just isn't going to help you get into Wake Forest or Stanford. And they just don't need the cash.''
 But others, like Professor Sum, contend that plenty of teenagers want to work but face increasing difficulties landing jobs. From early 2001 to the middle of 2007, the number of Americans employed outside the military grew more than 8.3 million, according to the Labor Department, yet employment among teenagers fell more than 1.2 million.
 In the New York metropolitan area, an index by Economy.com shows a modest increase in the sorts of jobs typically filled by teenagers in the summer.
 Still, with the economy gripped by what many experts believe is a recession, opportunities are growing leaner for teenagers in most of the country.
 Even in parts of the country where there are jobs, some teenagers are having trouble finding them.
 Tulsa, a town on the banks of the Arkansas River that swelled into a city amid an oil boom early last century, seems at first an easy place to find work. This metropolitan area of 900,000 people never saw the increase in housing prices and subsequent collapse that leveled economies elsewhere. While energy prices are reaching records and the oil patch is buzzing with activity, Tulsa's unemployment rate was a mere 3.3 percent in March, compared with the national rate of 5.1 percent that month. 
 Here, the force of Hispanic immigration is being reversed: A bill aimed at cracking down on illegal immigrants passed by the state legislature late last year has prompted thousands of them to leave town.
 So along the broad suburban avenues in the southern part of town -- ribbons of black pavement lined with ice cream shops, burger stands and barbecue joints -- managers are having a hard time finding workers.
 ''Pretty much everybody is hiring,'' said Andy Irick, director of operations for Sonic, a restaurant chain based in Oklahoma, complete with blaring music and servers on roller skates. ''If you walk in and you're clean cut and presentable, you're going to get a job.''
 While summer jobs may be abundant in some industries, opportunities tend to divide along traditional fault lines like race, the connections offered by one's parents and -- not least -- whether one has a car in this sprawling city of scant public transportation.
 More than 15 percent of the city's population is African-American, according to the 2000 census. Black people are largely clustered in the older, northern part of town, on weather-beaten roads largely devoid of shopping and places to work. The suburban strip malls to the south are miles away.
 At a state-financed program that helps lower-income young people find jobs, Arbor Education and Training, some have quit coming to the center because gas prices are too high, and some have lost jobs because they could not get to work, said the program's director of operations, Jacky Noden.
 Meanwhile, at a job skills class at Booker T. Washington High School, considered Tulsa's most prestigious public campus, six graduating seniors, all bound for college and all possessing cars, already had jobs for the summer. 
 Greg Robinson, 18, cast his job as an instructor at a golf course as a perfect chance to network. ''Golf is the sport of business.''
 Shakhura Henderson, 18, saw her job as an assistant in an optometrist's office as a beachhead in a growing areaof the American economy. She and the other students stammered in veritable horror when asked if they would consider working in fast food.
 ''I don't see myself saying, 'Hey, sir, may I take your order,' '' Ms. Henderson said. ''I don't see any growth in it.''
 Claire Tolson, 17, a student at another selective school, Thomas A. Edison Preparatory, said she planned to spend the summer as a hostess at the Local Table, a restaurant specializing in produce from around the area, earning $8 an hour, plus tips.
 Tall, blond and poised, and looking ahead to a career in engineering, Ms. Tolson has two friends working at the restaurant already. One of their parents knows the owner, she said.
 ''I don't think it's too hard to find a job,'' she said.
 But Ms. Tolson's classmate, Wesley Childers, has no such connections, relying instead on newspaper classified advertisements for his job search. He wants a job so he can save money to buy a car next year, but his lack of a vehicle presents something of a Catch-22.
 ''Employers want you to have reliable transportation,'' he said.
 Mr. Childers wears a pressed blue suit and shiny black loafers to job interviews. He has applied to McDonald's and to Target, the discount department store, among other places.
 ''I haven't heard anything back,'' he said. ''There's so many other kids, and there's also so many other people who are unemployed. It's getting frustrating.''
 At Will Rogers High School in a heavily Hispanic part of town, a 15-year-old sophomore named Jose, who has lived here since he was 2 years old but lacks legal immigration papers, worried that he would not find a job. He would happily work in fast food, he said, but word is that more places are checking papers.
 ''It limits your choices,'' he said. ''A lot of people are afraid.''

HEADLINE: All the World Is Not Always a Stage

BYLINE: By CARLA BARANAUCKAS

 BODY:
FOR nearly a decade, it seemed to Barbara Krajkowski that the second sentence of every conversation she had was: ''Do you know of a space?''
 Ms. Krajkowski, the producing artistic director of the Women's Theater Company, now based in Parsippany, spent eight years moving the company from place to place, sharing stages with other groups. ''I always knew I had a season,'' she said, but anything beyond that was a question.
 No matter how strong the acting or how beautiful the costumes, the curtain cannot go up on a theatrical production unless there is a performance space. And for many of New Jersey's nonprofit theaters, the search for a place to call home is a continual challenge. 
 ''It's pretty common across the country,'' said John McEwen, executive director of the New Jersey Theater Alliance. Sometimes rental or lease arrangements fall through -- even the alliance is relocating this year to West Orange from Morristown. 
 In other cases, he said, theaters outgrow their space. That is the case, he said, in New Brunswick, where the New Brunswick Development Corporation announced plans in March for an office, residential and cultural complex that will house the George Street Theater, the Crossroads Theater and other arts groups.
 The Women's Theater Company has settled in, for now, in a 99-seat black-box theater in the Parsippany community center, which it has rented for three years. ''Right now, we are a very, very lucky theater,'' Ms. Krajkowski said. 
 Other companies, like 12 Miles West, still find themselves living with uncertainty. For years, 12 Miles West leased a theater in Montclair, which is 12 miles west of Manhattan. A rent increase forced the company to move in 2004 to an old vaudeville house in Bloomfield, leasing the space with an option to buy it, said Lenny Bart, the artistic director. But last year the new landlord and the company were unable to agree on a purchase price. 
 ''Instead of fighting or going to court,'' Mr. Bart said, ''we opted to move out.'' 
 It appeared that the 2007-8 season might be in doubt until 12 Miles West found a space to share with another theater company in Madison, more than 25 miles west of Manhattan.
 ''We were extremely fortunate that Playwrights Theater came to our rescue,'' Mr. Bart said, ''and we've had a successful first season here.''
 But he noted that every time a theater has to move, it runs the risk of losing some of its audience. In Bloomfield, the company had built its audience to about 58 percent capacity, he said; in Madison, the figure is closer to 30 percent.
 And there are no guarantees for the space in Madison, which is in a former school building on Green Village Road. Playwrights Theater, a long-term tenant of the building, owned by the Madison Board of Education, is awaiting a decision on a proposal by the Madison Arts and Culture Alliance to buy the site to develop an arts center and condominiums.
 John Pietrowski, artistic director of Playwrights Theater and president of the arts alliance, said the school board was considering proposals from nonprofit organizations as well as commercial developers. A decision is expected by October, according to the school district.
 While the board could get a higher sale price from a commercial developer, Mr. Pietrowski said, the arts alliance proposal would provide a cultural asset for Madison as well as help the town meet its requirements to provide affordable housing. Forty percent of the condominiums would be set aside for affordable housing.
 If the proposal is not accepted, both Playwrights Theater and 12 Miles West will find themselves looking for space.
 Luna Stage in Montclair is another company that may soon be hunting for a theater, said Jane Mandel, its artistic director. The company moved into a building at 695 Bloomfield Avenue in Montclair in 2001, but the owner is planning to sell the building in the next few years, Ms. Mandel said.
 ''We're not being put out in the street,'' Ms. Mandel said, ''but it's an ongoing concern.''
 Luna Stage's board is considering a number of options, but whatever approach it takes, she said, ''we definitely intend to be around -- that we're sure of.''
 One group that appears to have locked in its future is Cape May Stage. The theater, founded in 1988, moved from place to place in Cape May before it found an 1853 church owned by the city. In 2004, the company signed a 50-year lease with the city and embarked on a $1.3 million fund-raising campaign to renovate the church.
 It began performances in the renovated space last week. Although the fund-raising project received several grants, according to its chairman, Jim Moffatt, 80 percent of the money came from individual donations, some as small as $10. A gift of $200,000 came from the family of Robert Shackleton, a Broadway and Hollywood actor who died in 1956, and the playhouse is named for him. 
 The New Jersey Repertory Company, which owns its building in Long Branch, is planning to build another theater as part of a wider effort to redevelop part of the business district into an arts center, said Gabe Barabas, its executive producer.
 Another project, the New Jersey Arts Incubator, is being developed in West Orange with a performance space that could become home to theater companies while they develop business plans to become financially stable, according to Amy Simon, its executive director. The ultimate goal would be for companies to move out and become ''economic drivers in municipalities throughout the state.''
 The incubator is in the ''construction planning stage,'' said Ms. Simon, who is also a member of the State Council on the Arts. She expects it to open in early 2009.

 REPORT ON DEFORESTATION
 Puts Pressure on Brazil
 A report that destruction of Brazil's section of the rainforest has gone up after two years of decline turned what had been a long-simmering battle between businesses and environmentalists into a low-grade war. And Gilberto Camara, above, the scientist who released the report, has found himself having to defend his agency's findings against one of Brazil's richest and most powerful men. PAGE 10
 CHILDREN IN LIMBO
 Haiti and the Dominican Republic share an island, but not an affinity. And when the Dominican Republic cracked down on citizenship for children of Haitian immigrants, citing security, among those caught in the fallout was a teenage outfielder looking for a better life. PAGE 6 
 PRAISE FOR CHINA EFFORTS
 The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon, flew to the heart of China's earthquake zone to praise the country's response to the disaster and pledge his organization's support. The visit came on the heels of one to cyclone-torn Myanmar, and his actions and comments seemed to invite comparisons between the responses of the two countries. PAGE 8
 NATIONAL
 A POLITICAL INTENSITY
 Reflected on the Web
 Handicappers rate the Senate race in Minnesota one of the most competitive in the nation, and the abundance of state Web sites devoted to political issues reflects the intensity. One has been detailing tax problems of the likely Democractic nominee; another tracks the moves of the Republican incumbent on a ''Weasel Meter.'' PAGE 23 
 BEYOND THE RESERVATION
 With old stigmas among American Indians about sending a child off the reservation eroding, Lodge Grass High School near Hardin, Mont., has lost more than a third of its enrollment since 2000, and nearby Hardin High School is now 70 percent American Indian. The turning tide of students has rippled far beyond education, to culture and the delicate economic balance. PAGE 16
 A LOBBYING LABYRINTH
 As Senator John McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis is overseeing new lobbyist-related guidelines that the campaign has issued in an effort to safeguard Mr. McCain's reputation as an opponent of special interests. But Mr. Davis's own business dealings illustrate the limits of those guidelines in defining what it means to be selling expertise. PAGE 22

 A FILL-IN SPEAKER 
 Draws Student Cheers
 Maybe it isn't so liberal, and is instead, as its president says, amazingly diverse. Still, Peter Applebome writes in Our Towns, Wesleyan University's getting Senator Barack Obama as its last-minute graduation speaker ''was a little like Notre Dame getting the pope.'' PAGE 27
 CUTTING CORNERS
 New York City, long a destination for young people of expansive dreams but limited means, has always inspired various cost-cutting measures: apartment sharing, scrimping on or skipping meals. But smaller measures help, too, like subletting a walk-in closet. PAGE 27
 SPORTS
 A GOALIE IS BACK,
 But Not Welcomed
 With the Olympics approaching, Hope Solo is expected to start in goal for the United States women's soccer team. But eight months after her benching at the Women's World Cup -- which she and others roundly criticized -- the wounds have not yet healed. And some wonder about the impact that might have. PAGE 1
 HE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS
 If a male tennis player is going to win only one Grand Slam event, it should be at home. Preferably he should be the first favorite-son winner in decades, and another should not come along for at least 25 years. Oh, and being handsome will help. Just ask Yannick Noah. PAGE 1
 RETURN TO GRACE
 Mitch Williams can't undo the pitch (''fastball, down and in'') that Joe Carter hit for a three-run homer in Game 6, costing his Phillies the 1993 World Series. But in Philadelphia these days, Williams is a popular local guy making good again. PAGE 2

 DICK SUTCLIFFE, 90
 His idea to use animated characters to teach religious principles resulted in the cartoon show ''Davey and Goliath,'' a stop-action animated show about a boy and his dog finding their way in a world of temptation.

 MINING THE HILARITY

 ''You Don't Mess With the Zohan'' is a movie about an Israeli assassin who fakes his death, flees to the United States and becomes a hairdresser. Sold yet? O.K. Adam Sandler plays the lead role. So, yes, it's a comedy. About tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Can this work? PAGE 1
 IN THE END IS THE WORD
 There is something about having prompted a death sentence that tends to skew the focus a novelist draws. Salman Rushdie has lived that existence since 1989, and along the way given rise to assorted other personal controversies. Now his latest novel, ''Enchantress,'' has a chance to turn the public focus back on his work. PAGE 1
 BOOK REVIEW 
 MEDICAL HORRORS,
 Up Close and Personal
 Shannon Burke has turned his five years as an E.M.T. and paramedic into the raw material for novels that contain more reflections of lived experience than some (especially recent) memoirs, Liesl Schillinger writes in a review of the new one, ''Black Flies.'' Be advised: some of it is ''shock treatment for the conscience.'' PAGE 1
 INSIDE A CONSERVATIVE
 Two new books provide looks at the late William F. Buckley Jr. The works -- one by him, about Barry Goldwater, the other a biography -- both make crystal clear, Victor S. Navasky writes, that ''Buckley was at least as interested in joining the Establishment as in criticizing it.'' PAGE 8
 TRAVEL

 There are people who see a body of water -- the Thames, say, or San Francisco Bay -- and are moved by the urge to get into it and swim. These are the people for whom swimming-oriented tours and vacations were created, with various outfits eager to provide the service. PAGE 3
 BARGAINS IN EUROPE
 Looking for bargains on accommodations, food and entertainment in London, Paris, Barcelona, Berlin or Rome this summer? Ha! Good luck! But, with their public transportation systems, at least you can get around without taking out a second mortgage. (Good luck if you need that, too.) PAGE 7

 EMOTIONAL IMPACT
 Of Economic Pain
 In economic terms, the country may or may not be in a recession. But in psychological terms, Wall Street could be described as being in a depression, particularly if you are one of the thousands who have lost their jobs or fear that you will. PAGE 1
 DRAWING THE HEAT
 Blaming speculators for rising prices may be as old as the markets. But when the subject is energy and the almost daily record prices, and Congress joins the anti-speculation bandwagon and starts talking legislation, something could actually happen. Is it populism, or just common sense? PAGE 2

 New hand-held video devices for enlarging print are offering people who have lost some of their sight several advantages over traditional magnifying glasses, including the ability to heighten contrast. But price is not among them. PAGE 4

 The neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor probably would not recommend her methodology to others -- she had a stroke -- but she is pushing what she learned as a result: that people can choose to live a more peaceful, spiritual life by sidestepping their left brain, the part that gives us context, ego, time, logic.

 Take one smart middle school student who isn't quite living up to his parents' expectations. Blame the distractions: video games, girls, video games, TV. And video games.

 THE QUESTIONS RAISED 
 By a Success in Iraq
 In Basra today, the death squads are in hiding and Islamist militias have been evicted from their strongholds by the Iraqi Army, so British and Americans are wondering if the approach might work in other troubled areas of Iraq. But Iraqis are asking why it didn't happen years ago. PAGE 1
 APPEASEMENT REVISITED
 President Bush's disparagement of ''appeasement'' in a speech before the Israeli Parliament was seconded by Senator John McCain, who mentioned Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who met with Hitler in Munich and ceded Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland to the Nazis. But the comparison with today, Isaac Chotiner writes, is imprecise. PAGE 5

HEADLINE: Law Is the Law, but Producing Is His Life

BYLINE: By ROBERT SIMONSON

 BODY:
JOHN BREGLIO'S shift from veteran theatrical lawyer to fledgling Broadway producer either took place gradually, over three decades, or in a split second, depending on how you look at it. And like the seasoned negotiator he is, Mr. Breglio maintains that both scenarios are arguable. 
 ''The process of deciding to leave the practice had always been hovering back there in my mind for many years,'' he said during a recent interview at his corner office at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he retains a desk despite having resigned in January after 37 years. (He remains ''of counsel.'') 
 The itch to produce full time continued to nag at him for months, he said, after the 2006 opening of the current Broadway revival of ''A Chorus Line,'' his virgin effort as a showman. Nevertheless, he had continued to ride the fence, refusing to quit his day job at the firm, where he represented an enviable list of top-shelf clients like Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Patti LuPone, the Public Theater and the August Wilson estate. 
 During the current ''Chorus Line'' revival's pre-Broadway run in San Francisco, he lived out of a suite at the Clift Hotel, performing his lawyerly duties during the day and overseeing the production in the late afternoon and evening. The schedule rendered him nearly immobile. He thought stress had crippled him, but it turned out he had Lyme disease.
 Then one night in January 2007, he said, his eureka moment finally arrived. While standing at the back of the Schoenfeld Theater on Broadway, he heard Charlotte d'Amboise, who plays Cassie in ''A Chorus Line,'' sing: ''God, I'm a dancer. A dancer dances.''
 ''I've heard that line a million times,'' said Mr. Breglio, 61. ''But this time I thought, 'That's it!' I shouldn't be teaching others to do what I should be doing for myself. I don't want to be a plumber anymore. What was the choice? Drop 'A Chorus Line'? I could have, but would I ever have contemplated it? No. Could I stop practicing law? Yes.'' 
 Bob Avian, who directed the revival of ''A Chorus Line'' and has known Mr. Breglio since the first production, said, ''John always wanted to be a producer.'' He said that Mr. Breglio ''went into theatrical law because he loved the theater so much. He had a feeling for law and thought: 'What a perfect solution. I'll put the two together.' ''
 Mr. Breglio's first project as a full-time producer will be a project, like ''A Chorus Line,'' originally staged by Michael Bennett: ''Dreamgirls.'' It will open next spring far, far out of town, at the Charlotte Theater in Seoul, South Korea, before starting an American tour the following fall in Boston. A West End production in London and an Asian tour are also in the works, Mr. Breglio said. 
 The Seoul premiere will have a Korean cast and an American creative team led by the director Robert Longbottom. ''It will be the model for the physical production in America,'' Mr. Breglio said, adding that unlike the revival of ''A Chorus Line,'' which faithfully followed Bennett's original blueprint, this will be a thorough rethinking.
 Opening a possibly Broadway-bound show in Southeast Asia is an unusual move. But Mr. Breglio has his own ideas when it comes to producing. 
 For one, he insists on being the sole voice of authority on his productions. ''A Chorus Line'' had a handful of investors, each surrendering a large percentage of the $8 million budget. Normally that would have purchased name-above-the-title rights. But only Mr. Breglio's production company, Vienna Waits, is listed on the title page of the program. 
 ''John sat them down,'' Mr. Avian said, ''and said: 'This is the deal. I'm in charge.' ''
 Furthermore, he breaks -- on principle -- the producing imperative voiced by Max Bialystock in ''The Producers'': ''Never put your own money in the show.'' He won't say how much he invested in ''A Chorus Line,'' only that the amount was ''substantial'' and ''well north'' of $100,000. 
 He also said he is determined to make money in the theater, a business in which successful shows are about as common as light traffic in Times Square. ''A Chorus Line'' earned back its investment 19 weeks after it opened. 
 ''I am not willing to throw 100 darts at the dartboard blindfolded and assume one is going to hit the bull's-eye,'' he said. ''The challenge is to start with material you love and then figure out an economic model for the show that makes any sense at all.'' 
 Mr. Breglio's attachment to ''A Chorus Line'' and ''Dreamgirls'' runs deep. He met Bennett, their primary creator, shortly after becoming a lawyer. The two men got along well, so after ''A Chorus Line'' hit big, Bennett asked Mr. Breglio to leave his firm and join him in a production enterprise called Quadrille Productions. Mr. Breglio soon found himself frustrated by the narrowness of working for one client, however, and returned to Paul, Weiss. 
 After Bennett died in 1987, Mr. Breglio became executor of his estate, and he is now the sole agent of Bennett's beneficiaries (of which he is one).
 '' 'Chorus Line' was special for him because of Michael,'' the veteran producer Emanuel Azenberg said. ''Maybe that's what it took for him to be catalyzed out of the firm. I think he's crazy to become a producer. Welcome to the lunatic asylum.''

GOVERNESS 
 The Lives and Times of the Real Jane Eyres. 
 By Ruth Brandon. 
 Illustrated. 303 pp. Walker & Company. $25.99. 
 Early in Queen Victoria's reign, 30 percent of adult Englishwomen were single -- and considered, as one social commentator put it, ''redundant.'' If of gentle birth and no means, without a family to care for, an extra woman naturally sought work as a governess. Living in another family's home made romance unlikely and isolation inevitable, with poverty and unemployment always on the horizon. It was a grim life, grimmer still because it was the only choice open to many. As Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre decides, ''I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better.''
 In ''Governess: The Lives and Times of the Real Jane Eyres,'' Ruth Brandon covers about 80 years in the profession, concentrating on the era when a rising cadre of nouveaux riches and an abundance of single women came together to make the at-home lady educator a household staple. Few of the 25,000 governesses in England in 1851 were employed past the age of 40, since most families preferred to hire malleable young things, despite the dangers of youth: husbands and sons could always be tempted. (Witness Mr. Rochester.) 
 A governess had to be a lady. Part of her function, as Brandon puts it, was to ''impart a veneer of class to the 'wild and unbroken' '' family members, including parents. But the presence of a bona fide lady might threaten a mistress uneasy with her new social status, so governesses had to be kept in their place. (This problem was peculiarly British; America's looser class system made governessing quite different.) 
 Relegated to the nursery, where she spent 12 or more hours a day educating, feeding and otherwise looking after her charges, a British governess might expect to earn between $:8 -- barely enough to keep herself in books and clothing -- and $:100 a year. She taught multiple languages (including French, naturellement), simple arithmetic, music, drawing and history, but perhaps none of them well. Lessons came from what she had learned from her own governess or at a school for girls, thereby perpetuating an impoverishment of female education that roused the ire of several of Brandon's subjects.
 Brandon calls her choice of representative women ''rather arbitrary,'' as well as ''small and random.'' The reader might also add ''uneven,'' since the book devotes much attention to the famous feminist writers Mary Wollstonecraft and Anna Jameson, as well as to Anna Leonowens (best known from Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical, ''The King and I,'' inspired by her memoirs of teaching in Siam). More obscure governesses, whose lives are harder to unpuzzle -- and might thus be more intriguing -- get less time. 
 It's surprising that Brandon didn't devote a chapter to Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, given her frequent references to the governesses in novels like ''Agnes Grey'' and ''Jane Eyre.'' Those famous novels could have benefited from an analytical eye. Brandon is also a fiction writer, and she leans heavily on the novels of the period to provide cultural background; she might have spent more time exploring the ways in which a novelist's imagination transformed the governess's actual experience.
 Instead, Brandon devotes more than 50 pages each to chapters on the Wollstonecraft sisters and Claire Clairmont, all of whom led fascinating lives -- but not while they were governesses. Mary Wollstonecraft, in fact, was a governess for less than a year before she turned to writing essays, children's stories, a novel and works on the education of women. Brandon concentrates more on Wollstonecraft's achievements and adventures than on her work in the schoolroom. We don't need to know quite so much about her romantic comings and goings in order to understand how her brief stint as a governess affected her later life, or to understand the place of governessing among the limited options for women at the time. (Wollstonecraft, after all, was exceptional.) We certainly don't need to know about Clairmont's mother's paramours. Clairmont was a governess for decades, but her early life with Byron, Shelley and her stepsister, Mary Shelley (daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft), gets the most attention. How many other governesses had these kinds of experiences?
 The shorter chapters about hitherto overlooked women are far fresher. In 1784, Agnes Porter entered the new profession early enough to eke out a quite pleasant existence with an earl's extended family. Just a couple of decades later, however, Nelly Weeton's letters and diaries recorded suffering to rival Bronte's most gothic moments: a cruelly selfish brother, nasty employers with nightmarish homes and a disastrous marriage entered into, apparently, solely for the chance to bear a child of her own. The scene in which rats attack the body of a little girl who has been burned to death ranks with the highest flights of Victorian horror. There's nothing happy to take away from Weeton's story, but it makes for titillating reading -- if, that is, her journals can be considered a reliable source. As with the novels she discusses, Brandon might have approached these diaries with a more critical eye. Was Weeton really, as she portrayed herself, an entirely innocent victim?
 Brandon's final chapter is devoted to the women who improved female education in the last decades of the 19th century. Without having worked as governesses themselves, Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon founded what would become Girton College, Cambridge, in 1869. Non-governess female employment agencies were also established in London, thereby helping usher the age to an end. ''Young women today,'' Brandon notes, ''grow up in the world that Mary Wollstonecraft dreamed of.'' While that may be too sunny (and novelistic) a conclusion, at least we're better off than poor Nelly Weeton, with more to hope for than Jane Eyre.

HEADLINE: Finding Potential For Debt In Distress

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
THE credit crisis and economic slowdown have sunk billions of dollars of debt into distressed status -- deep in the junk-bond pile. Money managers have traditionally profited in such markets by buying debt on the cheap. 
 Individual investors can get into the game indirectly, through a small number of mutual funds, including BlackRock High Yield, Mutual Recovery and Northeast Investors Trust, which hold some distressed debt. 
 ''Right now, we think there is going to be tremendous opportunity over the next 12 to 18 months,'' said James Keenan, manager of BlackRock High Yield, which has returned 0.41 percent in 2008 and 7.15 percent, annualized, over the last three years, according to Morningstar. (All figures are through Thursday.) 
 Mr. Keenan foresees raising the fund's current investment in distressed debt to 10 to 15 percent of assets, from the current 2 to 3 percent, as opportunities arise. 
 Distressed debt is often defined as the obligations of companies in default or perilously close to it. The term may also be used for debt paying a very high yield -- 10 percentage points more than 10-year Treasuries. 
 Investing in such debt is risky, but handsome profits can be made by converting it into equity ownership as restructured companies leave bankruptcy. 
 The sharp rise in interest rates on lower-rated debt issues in recent months probably presages a rising tide of defaults, said Kenneth Emery, director of default research at the Moody's Corporation.
 ''Historically, there's a tight correlation between high-yield spreads and default rates,'' Mr. Emery said. Already, the global pool of distressed bonds and bank loans is approaching $600 billion, he said.
 Little cash has actually been drawn down to buy distressed debt thus far. ''There have been a lot of funds raised,'' said Michael Embler, chief investment officer for the Mutual Series funds of Franklin Templeton. ''Most of the money has not been deployed.''
 Oaktree Capital Management, based in Los Angeles, is a longtime investor in distressed debt. The firm has unspecified billions invested in such debt, said Howard S. Marks, its chairman, with $10 billion more ready to be deployed. 
 The question for Mr. Marks and others is when to start buying in earnest. Early buyers risk ''catching a falling knife,'' in market parlance, if prices keep tumbling. But late buyers risk losing out on the best deals and the best returns. ''We think we have to catch a falling knife,'' Mr. Marks said. 
 Other deep-pocketed buyers seem to be coming to the same conclusion. For example, the Blackstone Group, the big private equity group, has been finding good investments in distressed debt, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive, said in a recent conference call.
 At Mutual, Mr. Embler is waiting for some of the debt that financed buyouts in the last year to tumble into distressed status.
 ''There was a tremendous amount of leverage in those buyouts,'' he said. ''Some of them will hit the wall.'' 
 Just nine months ago, Mutual Recovery held virtually no distressed debt, but with recent purchases of leveraged-buyout-related bank loans, it now has ''5 to 10 percent'' of its portfolio in the lowest-rated obligations, he said. ''We do think there will be more opportunities in the next 6 to 12 months,'' he added.
 The fund is down 4.31 percent this year and has returned 6.33 percent, annualized, over the last three years.
 ALSO prepared to buy, but not convinced that prices have bottomed, is Bruce H. Monrad, who manages the $1.5 billion Northeast Investors Trust fund with his father, Ernest E. Monrad. The fund is up 0.14 percent this year and has returned 5.59 percent, annualized, over the last three years.
 ''We're still in the very early innings,'' he said. ''We're probably going to see 30 percent of the total junk bond market default over the next five years. And yet fewer than 30 percent of junk bond issues are selling at distressed prices. There may still be a lot of overpriced junk.'' 
 The Northeast fund holds debt from one issuer -- the Trump casino empire -- that produced a big payday in the past. After Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004, Northeast received a package of stock and bonds in the restructured company, Trump Entertainment Resorts. Northeast sold the stock but still holds some bonds, whose current yield is roughly 14 percent.
 In terms of the broader credit market, Mr. Marks of Oaktree Capital said he saw a possible silver lining in the current situation, at least for investors in distressed debt.
 ''This could be the biggest credit crisis of our lives,'' he said. ''And if it is, that argues for higher returns.''

HEADLINE: Riding Out Downturn, Developers Adjust

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
HAMPERED by the broadening credit crisis, builders in Westchester, as elsewhere in the New York area and the country, are seeking ways to ride out what economists describe as the worst housing downturn since the late 1980s.
 The National Association of Home Builders reported this month that its members were increasingly losing heart as the market erodes; the association's housing market index, which measures builders' confidence, declined in May to its lowest level since January 1985.
 ''As a result,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, a researcher for the association in Washington, ''developers are putting some projects on hold, reducing the size of other projects and diversifying. The fact is that just about everybody in the business is having to adjust in some way.'' 
 Reflecting the national trends, some builders in Westchester have shelved residential projects and are waiting out the storm. Others are hedging their bets by diversifying into commercial or retail projects. At least one is forging ahead with new residential construction -- though it is directed at a narrow segment of the market: older buyers with enough equity built up in their current homes to reinvest.
 In New Castle, the developer for Chappaqua Crossing, a proposed development that would include 278 condominiums for residents 55 and older on the former Reader's Digest campus, has decided to wait and is eschewing residential sales altogether.
 Felix T. Charney, a principal of Summit Development of South Norwalk, Conn., one of two companies behind the project, said that even if the project received town approval today, construction would not begin until the market showed signs of a comeback. 
 ''As a company, we wouldn't begin a for-sale residential project at this point,'' Mr. Charney said, explaining that part of the problem is the difficulty of borrowing money from banks in the current economy.
 Summit, which has built more than 1,000 residential units over 27 years and has developed four million square feet of commercial space, has no residences for sale now, Mr. Charney said. Instead, it is focusing its efforts on acquiring and leasing office space. 
 On the New Castle project, for example, the condominium proposal wending its way through the town's approval process is all but irrelevant to Summit's immediate goals: seeking tenants for vacant office space in the 700,000-square-foot Reader's Digest Association building, which it acquired in 2004 and partly leased back to the publisher. It also recently acquired two office buildings in Fairfield County, Conn., Mr. Charney said. 
 In New Rochelle, Cappelli Enterprises is moving ahead on its residential projects while focusing on other kinds of development as well, said Joseph V. Apicella, an executive vice president. 
 In addition to mixed-use projects in places like White Plains, Yonkers and Thompson, in Sullivan County, the company has begun a $50 million renovation of New Roc City, an entertainment complex it built in 1999 in New Rochelle. In a partnership with Entertainment Properties Trust, Cappelli has leased 160,000 square feet in the 375,000-square-foot complex to Target.
 ''Even in this market,'' Mr. Apicella said, ''major retailers are interested in opening stores in areas that they considered to be underserved.''
 And at the same time, Cappelli Enterprises has proposed a $500 million mixed-use development in New Rochelle's downtown that would include 258 residential units, a 380,000-square-foot office building, a 200-room hotel and 200,000 square feet of retail space. 
 ''Because so many other residential projects are on hold,'' Mr. Apicella theorized, ''by the time our projects go online 18 months from now, there will be a limited amount of residential inventory and built-up demand.''
 ''It may seem counterintuitive,'' he added, ''but here we are in a recession, and we're going right into the headwinds.''
 In another move that may seem contrarian, given the state of the market, Ted Weinberg of Weinberg Brothers in Eastchester is building 26 luxury single-family houses on 18 acres in New Rochelle, near the Scarsdale and Larchmont borders. The 3,800-square-foot houses, laid out on half-acre lots on a former driving range, are selling for $2.2 million to $2.4 million.
 Who is buying today? Mr. Weinberg described his customers as at the ''recession-proof end of the market.'' 
 They are empty nesters, he said, who have accrued equity in their homes for 25 or 30 years and now want smaller houses, with features like ground-floor master bedroom suites, in gated communities with all the trimmings of a high-end hotel, like concierge services. 
 ''So even if the market is not so good, and they're not getting as much for their houses as they might have,'' Mr. Weinberg said, ''they're still taking out plenty in terms of equity and parlaying that into these homes.'' 
 Richard and Merry Feintuch, a retired lawyer and his wife who spend seven months each year in Delray Beach, Fla., recently bought one of Mr. Weinberg's house, where they will live during the spring and summer months. Mr. and Mrs. Feintuch, who have two grown sons, sold their five-bedroom colonial in Scarsdale last year for more than $2 million. ''Yes, I took a hit on that house compared to what I might have gotten for it in a better market,'' Mr. Feintuch said, ''but I'm retired, and I want to enjoy life now, not wait for the economy to improve.''
 As for Mr. Weinberg, he has sold 16 of the homes, he said, ''and I haven't even put an ad in the newspaper.''

HEADLINE: We're Still No. 1. But for How Long?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Imbalances of Power'' (column, May 21):
 Thomas L. Friedman writes about a shift in the global balance of power that has allowed the rise of other nations. And he says our lack of a sufficient energy policy has negatively affected the role that the United States will play in the near future. 
 I look at the prospects of the United States' losing its single-power status in two ways. First, it points to the failed presidency of George W. Bush. Second, it raises the possibility that a diminished role in the geopolitical landscape could be a blessing in disguise for the United States. 
 Much has been written about why the Bush administration's policies have negatively affected the role the United States plays in the world. But I've seen little mention of how a multipower world might be exactly what this country needs. 
 In a multipower world, the United States would be able to shift its focus away from foreign policy and begin addressing our nation's problems, like health care, public schools and poor infrastructure, with more resources and with increased focus on the problems at home.
 Marc Franzblau Anderson, S.C., May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes, ''It baffles me that President Bush would rather go to Saudi Arabia twice in four months and beg for an oil price break'' (in other words, an increase in production) rather than ask Americans to conserve energy by driving more fuel-efficient cars or promote a carbon tax.
 Follow the money. The people who have the president's ear aren't concerned about the price of oil. They're watching volume, because they make their money on the margins, which remain relatively unchanged. The only way they can keep reaping profits is by maximizing the amount that flows through the pumps. 
 And with regard to the possibility of a carbon tax: as far as President Bush is concerned, the words ''President Bush'' and ''tax'' can be used in a sentence only with the descriptor ''cuts,'' no matter the logic for conservation.
 Martin Adickman Great Neck, N.Y., May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Why is Thomas L. Friedman baffled that President Bush has not mobilized our economy to find an alternative to oil and has not encouraged Americans to conserve energy? 
 President Bush is a creature of the oil industry, and his success in driving its profits to new heights is the signature achievement of his administration. 
 This is the same president who, after 9/11, encouraged Americans to support the country by going shopping. His fiscal policy is based on self-indulgence. Why would he tell us to sacrifice now, especially as our stimulus checks arrive in the mail?
 Stephen S. Power Maplewood, N.J., May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The unilateral actions taken by the United States in starting the war in Iraq -- which entailed a blatant disregard of other nations' concerns and interests, amounting to thumbing our nose at the rest of the world -- have set an example for many other countries. 
 That example is that there's little need to heed other nations' views. We're now seeing this idea pursued full force by Iran, Russia, China and other countries. 
 What is the incentive for other nations to listen to the United States' pleas when America has seemed to disregard the international community for the past seven and a half years? 
 Jeff Solomon Chelmsford, Mass., May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thank you, Thomas L. Friedman, for stating a glaring fact that so many Americans choose to ignore. 
 Because shallow examples of American-generated pop culture continue to bombard us every day and emblems of American capitalism pervade the international landscape, many of us confuse this soft power with actual political and strategic influence. 
 The idea that America is all-powerful is a farce, since we cannot even take baby steps to fix the country's broken educational, pension and health care systems. We've done little to deal with the current economic crisis, and our government is reluctant to assist American families in need. 
 The blindness of our energy policy has caused us to become the lapdog of Saudi Arabia. Decreasing our dependence on foreign oil through the creation of sustainable, economically fair alternative energy plans would not only stabilize our economy and create jobs, but would also prove to the rest of the world that we truly believe in the ideas of equality and democracy for all. 
 Alanya Green New York, May 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is rightly concerned about the vast gap between the current state of affairs in the United States and its potential for doing much better. 
 He cites Fareed Zakaria's thesis that America's relative decline is mirrored by the rise of other powers, like China, Russia and India. But while it is true that the world is losing faith in America's ability to lead in the world, I would argue that there has hardly been a corresponding rise in confidence in China or in the European Union. 
 Have China or Russia, with all their newfound wealth and power, done any better in helping Myanmar or Darfur or in slowing climate change? 
 India may have multiple TV news channels now, along with armies of software programmers, but has it become better able to deal with internal or external terror threats? 
 Have any of these countries advanced stem-cell research or alternative energy production enough?
 Students of history may note that it was well over a thousand years between the decline of Rome and the rise of the British Empire. Until another nation is able to command the world's admiration, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, America will remain the worst possible nation in every respect -- but only if you do not count all the others.

HEADLINE: Divining A Lesson In Basra

BYLINE: By STEPHEN FARRELL

DATELINE: BASRA, Iraq 

 BODY:
-- On Basra's Corniche, the boulevard past which the mingled waters of the Tigris and Euphrates flow into the Persian Gulf, there is a collective sense of relief these days.
 With the death squads in hiding and Islamist militias evicted from their strongholds by the Iraqi Army, few doubt that this once-lawless port is in better shape than it was just two months ago.
 But Iraqis are asking why it didn't happen years ago, even as the British and Americans are turning their gaze forward, to whether the operation can in any sense be a template to apply to other troubled areas in Iraq.
 The swirl of assessments, sometimes conflicting, indicate just how difficult it remains to draw any sure lessons, even from the step forward in Basra, about how to build stability and unity in Iraq. 
 BASRA'S RESIDENTS
 Two months after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki ordered the military offensive, residents of Basra talk of feeling safer, if not yet entirely safe, after years of oppression by armed gangs and ''enforcers'' of Shariah, or Islamic law. In the four years that British troops patrolled here, from 2003 to late 2007, the outlaws emerged and preyed on musicians, alcohol sellers, Christians, unveiled women, academics -- anyone not embracing their extreme vision of Islam.
 Now the shops and restaurants in Basra are open later, and alcohol is back on sale, discreetly. The government's troops seem to have quelled Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army and other militias. But some poorer areas like Hayaniya are still tense, and even in the city center the safety seems precarious, guaranteed only by thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police officers at checkpoints everywhere.
 In the inevitable post-mortems, a principal question has been whether the multinational troops in southern Iraq, led by the British, should have rid the city of its gangsters long ago.
 Such questions are natural for Basrawis, who for decades have glared balefully from a city overflowing with oil and water toward the skyscraper opulence of their lesser-endowed but better-governed cousins farther down the Persian Gulf in Bahrain, Dubai and Qatar.
 They watched Britain cut its forces in southern Iraq from 46,000 troops in 2003 to 4,000, and last September pull all those out of Basra's city center to the airport, miles out of town, before turning over full control of the province to the Iraqis in December.
 During those years, many resentful Basrawis say, the British were involved in a war that was deeply unpopular back home, and therefore had no stomach for sustaining the casualties necessary to restore order.
 ''I have been very frustrated at the British,'' said Brig. Gen. Edan Jaber, a police commander in Basra. He said the British ''gave a high priority to their own security'' and ''were not forceful with the cases they faced in the street.''
 It is a common criticism. ''The Americans go in with huge force and hit hard, not like the British,'' one Iraqi soldier complained. ''Our people need a powerful force, not a weak one. We had just left Saddam Hussein behind. How could anyone be soft after that?''
 THE BRITISH OFFICERS
 The British reject such arguments, saying they faced a very different problem from the one facing the Americans 300 miles north. Here, mafia-style Shiite gangs rose in an overwhelmingly Shiite town; up north, Sunni and Shiite factions waged civil war in divided cities like Baghdad and Baquba.
 Before the British withdrew from the city center, they were already arguing that their continued presence made the situation here worse because they had become a ''magnet'' for attacks.
 ''There's no doubt that for some parts of the community, we are as much part of the problem as the solution,'' Lt. Col. Patrick Sanders, the British commander of the Fourth Battalion of the Rifles Regiment said last July. ''We need to leave. There is no question about it. The only way that you can solve the problems of Basra is with an Iraqi solution.''
 Only minutes before, a Mahdi Army mortar attack had forced him and his men to drop to the ground at the riverside Basra Palace headquarters, a site they would soon evacuate.
 He added: ''As long as we are here the Iraqi security forces are far less inclined to confront the militias,'' because ''the militias will then see them in the same way that people might have seen the Vichy government in France.''
 Now, Maj. Tom Holloway, a British military spokesman in Basra, rejects the suggestion that British forces failed to confront the militias. ''We did,'' he said this month. ''This time last year, 19 Brigade were extremely busy conducting strike operations in the city most nights, lifting known Shia extremists, and the backlash from that was incredible levels of violence.''
 The British argue that it was precisely their withdrawal from central Basra -- after the Iraqi forces were ready to take over -- that made Prime Minister Maliki's March offensive palatable to the Iraqi public.
 ''Operation Charge of the Knights was one that needed doing, and it needed doing by the Iraqis,'' said Major Holloway. ''It needed to be Iraqi-led, and indeed it was.''
 THE IRAQI COMMANDER
 Looking ahead, the issue is whether the Iraqi military, police and government can sustain the improvement here and elsewhere, or if areas like Basra, Mosul and Baghdad's Sadr City will return to chaos once the gunmen regroup.
 Even Gen. Mohan al-Freiji, the Iraqi who commanded the Basra operation, asserted that as of mid-May the city was only ''75 percent secure.''
 The general said that the root problem was not military, but a political and economic one. Basra, he said, had been neglected for decades and needs a huge program of investment, cleanup and job creation.
 THE AMERICANS
 In Baghdad, American officials have kept an eye on Basra. But they say that Baghdad's sectarian divisions make it a vastly different challenge.
 With an estimated three million inhabitants, Baghdad's troubled Sadr City is more populous than all of Basra.
 In addition, while Basra is a historic city with a sizable middle class and intelligentsia naturally resistant to the Islamists, Sadr City is different -- a recently-created spillover district where the Mahdi Army has a much larger pool of potential fighters.
 Although there are obvious similarities, with the Iraqi Army push into the heart of Sadr City last week following a deal with Mr. Sadr, one American officer cautioned, ''We are eager not to take the Basra model and drop it over on top of Sadr City.''
 The Basra experience is also being studied farther north in Mosul, where an operation was launched this month to clear Sunni insurgents. 
 Maj. Gen. Mark P. Hertling, the American commander in northern Iraq, said that planning and intelligence problems that plagued the initial phase of the Basra offensive were not repeated in Mosul. But he also said that Mosul, a city of 1.9 million, was far more cosmopolitan; its population includes Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Yazidis, Shiites and Turkmen.
 ''It is a very different circumstance in Mosul than what occurred in Basra, and I think to a degree what's going on in Sadr City, as well, right now,'' he said in Baghdad. 
 ''But the good news story,'' he added, ''is that the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi police and the Iraqi government are now reacting very well to very different circumstances on several different fronts.''
 Skeptics caution against premature celebrations, of course. One warning sign may be that Mr. Sadr's supporters, quiescent but by no means defeated, are already complaining that the Basra operation was a cynical exercise mounted by Mr. Maliki to weaken his Shiite rivals ahead of provincial elections in the fall.
 Such interpretations evoke a theme in a November 2007 report by the International Crisis Group. The report criticized the Americans for targeting Mr. Sadr's Mahdi Army in its power struggle with Mr. Maliki's coalition partner, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, and its armed Badr wing. (Both forces have Iranian backing.)
 ''The U.S. has fully backed I.S.C.I. in this rivalry,'' said the Crisis Group. ''This is a risky gambit. Unleashing I.S.C.I./Badr against the Sadrists is a dangerous policy that will further deepen intra-Shiite divisions; it also is a short-sighted one, given the Sadrists' stronger mass base.''
 In fact, many Iraqis and outsiders believe the solution to a politically divided country has to be political, not military. ''Our concern is that there are elections coming up in October,'' said Nigel Haywood, the British consul general in Basra. ''You can guarantee safety up to a point with troops on the ground, but for real safety what you have to have is the will in the population to say, 'Actually, we don't want the militias to come back in, and if there is trouble we will report them to the security forces.' ''
 Across town in Basra, General Mohan balked at drawing too many conclusions from Basra even in the military sphere, and particularly any reflection on whether American troops will continue to be needed elsewhere in Iraq.
 ''We are talking about Basra,'' he said, cautiously. ''Regarding the rest of Iraq, each province has its circumstances.''

HEADLINE: Senate Race In Minnesota Shows Power Of Bloggers

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: EAGAN, Minn. 

 BODY:
On a laptop at a kitchen table in this cheery Twin Cities suburb, headlines ripping into Al Franken, the satirist whose campaign for the United States Senate is seen as one of the most competitive in the nation, are written up day after day for Minnesota Democrats Exposed, a political blog created by a former Republican Party researcher.
 Michael B. Brodkorb, the blog's creator, has worked on the campaigns of some of this state's top Republicans. Mr. Brodkorb's critics say the Web site's claims, screamed in red uppercase letters, are often breathless, far-fetched and painfully partisan.
 But Minnesota Democrats Exposed has dealt several blows to Mr. Franken's campaign lately: revelations that he owed $25,000 to the State of New York for failing to pay workers' compensation insurance and that his corporation was in forfeiture in California. 
 With only weeks until the state Democratic Party's convention, where Mr. Franken is expected to win the party's endorsement to run against Senator Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent, people here disagree about how much these financial questions will matter to voters in the fall.
 What Mr. Franken's circumstance has proven, though, is that no Minnesota candidate this fall can afford to ignore Mr. Brodkorb, or the rest of the state's universe of Web sites devoted to local politics. Experts here say the abundance of these blogs is a mirror onto this state, its partisan split in recent years and its long tradition of intense political activism (by some measures, voter turnout here was the highest in the nation in 2006). That said, they are anything but Minnesota Nice.
 Eric Pusey's liberal-leaning mnblue, for instance, tracks Mr. Coleman's moves on a ''Weasel Meter.'' Some blog live from the smallest of political meetings and the forgotten campaign stops. Enough of these writers have cropped up here now to make a Minnesota Organization of Bloggers, better known here as the Mob. 
 ''We've kind of got a center of gravity going on up here,'' said Mitch Berg, part of a group that started a True North Web site in 2007.
 The Franken campaign has played down the significance of the revelations first raised on Mr. Brodkorb's site, but there are signs the tax problems may be trouble for Mr. Franken, a former comedian who has worked hard to show voters that his campaign is serious. A recent poll of voters by The Minneapolis Star Tribune that showed Mr. Coleman leading Mr. Franken (though within the margin of error) also found that 42 percent of those polled were not satisfied with Mr. Franken's explanations of his tax problems; 28 percent said the problems made them less likely to vote for him.
 ''This looks like random incompetence mostly,'' said Lawrence Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. ''But Franken has taken a pounding, getting tattooed by story after story, which is preventing him from making this a referendum on the incumbent.''
 In March, Mr. Brodkorb reported that Mr. Franken's corporation, Alan Franken Inc., owed a penalty of $25,000 to the state compensation board in New York for failing to carry workers' compensation insurance from 2002 to 2005. State officials said they sent Mr. Franken 12 letters on the matter, but received no answer. 
 Mr. Franken, who has since paid the debt, declined an interview on the issue. Andy Barr, a spokesman for the campaign, said Mr. Franken had not known of the oversight by the corporation (which consisted of Mr. Franken, his wife, Franni, and an assistant or two), and received none of the letters. The state's letters were sent to the Frankens' New York apartment, officials there say; the couple moved to Minnesota at the end of 2005, though the family still owns the apartment.
 In April, Mr. Brodkorb wrote that Mr. Franken's company was in forfeiture in California. Other reporters found the reason: California authorities said Mr. Franken's company had failed to pay franchise tax fees from 2003 to 2006, and owed nearly $5,000, which Mr. Franken has since paid. Mr. Franken's company paid no franchise taxes to the state in those years, Mr. Barr said, because Mr. Franken believed his accounting firm had shut down the corporation after 2002.
 The reports led Mr. Franken to hire a new team of financial advisers to review his finances. Late last month, Mr. Franken announced the findings: although he had paid state income tax on his earnings, his accountant had, in some cases, paid it to the wrong states. Like professional athletes, entertainers are, in some instances, required to pay taxes to states where they earn money. He had paid more than $917,000 in state taxes to New York and Minnesota from 2003 to 2006, but should have sent parts of that sum (the total would actually have been about $4,000 higher) to 17 other states where he performed. Mr. Franken's supporters, and several Democratic-leaning blogs, have dismissed the problems as meaningless, an accountant's bureaucratic errors.
 ''We're in two wars and a recession,'' Mr. Barr said. ''This is not the time to try to have an election about something else.''
 Still, the campaign was clearly worried: it created an emergency phone bank one evening to call the more than 2,500 Democratic convention delegates and alternates and deliver the news before it came out the next day in the newspapers. 
 Many state Democrats (here, the party is known as the D.F.L., for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party) dismiss Mr. Brodkorb as a mouthpiece for accusations the Republicans dig up and want to present in a way more likely to catch on than a news release. Indeed, Mr. Brodkorb, 34, once worked on the campaigns of Republican leaders including Mr. Coleman, and last year managed, without pay, the campaign of Ron Carey to be re-elected the state's Republican chairman.
 Mr. Brodkorb began his blog anonymously in 2004 when he was still working for the state party, then identified himself in 2006. ''Look,'' he said in an interview in his kitchen, ''while my perspective is through partisan blinders, I think it passes the smell test every day.''
 But Mr. Brodkorb insists that he gets tips from Democrats, too, and is not paid by the state party or any candidate. Tom Erickson, a spokesman for Mr. Coleman's campaign, said it had not provided leads connected to Mr. Franken's tax woes, adding, ''Michael has an extensive network of sources.''
 Republicans have seized on the slow trickle of developments, questioning Mr. Franken's explanations and suggesting that more issues might emerge. 
 ''There are so many unanswered questions,'' said Mr. Carey, the state Republican chairman. ''What resonates with people is, 'I pay my taxes. Why shouldn't he pay his?' And it's one of those things we're probably at the opening chapters of the book in this story.''
 Then again, already, there were other stories bubbling forth. 
 D.F.L.-leaning sites like MNPublius, the creation of Matt Martin, 23, had turned to claims that Mr. Coleman might face his own financial embarrassment: Mr. Coleman this month declined a D.F.L. demand that he return campaign donations from workers at a firm that once lobbied on behalf of a faction of Myanmar's military government. Other sites raised questions about the state Republican Party's own financial reporting issues; state party officials acknowledge they are reviewing Federal Election Commission filings since 2002, but argue that their sort of errors have been common among state party organizations.

HEADLINE: The Snare of Privilege

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- Hillary Rodham Clinton, Wellesley '69, Yale Law '73 and the first lady of the land for eight years, is suddenly a working-class heroine of guns and whiskey shots. Barack Obama, Columbia '83 and Harvard Law '91, visits bowling alleys and beer halls and talks about his single mother who lived on food stamps.
 John S. McCain III, United States Naval Academy '58, the son and grandson of admirals and the husband of one of the richer women in Arizona, chases after the conservative, anti-elite religious base of the Republican Party, and prefers to talk about the ''cabin'' at his Sedona weekend retreat rather than the Phoenix home lushly featured in the pages of Architectural Digest in 2005.
 In an increasingly populist country, it's not surprising that all three presidential contenders have been sprinting away from the elitist label for much of this primary season. But do they really expect to get away with it? 
 More to the point, should they? Don't voters want the best and brightest, and best-credentialed, rising to the top?
 Not exactly. Americans have been ambivalent about elites since the nation was founded by revolutionaries who were also, in many cases, landed gentry. And status and wealth still play an outsize role in our supposedly classless society. 
 Our presidential history is a case in point. Although there has long been an anti-aristocratic bent to American politics, voters have put some famous aristocrats (including two Roosevelts, one Kennedy, all Harvard men) into the White House, and have all but idolized them as well. Over the last 20 years, every president has been a graduate of Yale. In 2004, two members of the university's rarefied secret society, Skull and Bones, ran against each other, and the more elite candidate, George W. Bush (Andover, Yale, Harvard Business School, son of a president), won.
 But it's not always easy to say exactly who, or what, constitutes the elite -- especially in recent decades. In his book ''The Power Elite,'' published in 1956, the leftist thinker C. Wright Mills identified a class ''composed of political, economic, and military men,'' who harnessed ''the major means of production'' along with ''the newly enlarged means of violence'' created in the nuclear age. In 1975, the neoconservative Irving Kristol described the elite, or ''the new class,'' as he termed it, as a confederacy of like-minded liberals in a range of professions -- from journalism to law -- who were ''suspicious of, and hostile to, the market precisely because the market is so vulgarly democratic.'' 
 Mr. Mills and Mr. Kristol shared the belief that ''the elite,'' however they were defined, wielded disproportionate influence. This year, these competing views remain in place. Republicans sneer at Democrats for being cultural elitists, and Democrats deride Republicans as economic elitists. But the old labels have been turned inside out.
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain have both derided Mr. Obama as ''elitist'' for his remarks about bitter rural voters who ''cling'' to guns and religion, even as Mr. Obama, in a counterpunch, mocked her courtship of gun owners, depicting her as a kind of ersatz Annie Oakley ''packing a six-shooter'' in a duck blind. And Mr. McCain, throwing a haymaker of his own, pointed out in a recent speech to members of the National Rifle Association that ''someone should tell Senator Obama that ducks are usually hunted with shotguns.''
 Amid all this, some have noted that we have reached a curious moment in American history: an African-American candidate, born seven years after the Supreme Court repudiated segregation in public schools and four years before the Voting Rights Act was passed, finds himself struggling to overcome an aura of privilege.
 ''It really is a delicious irony that the first serious black candidate for president should suddenly be described as elite,'' said Tom Wolfe, the author of ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' and a longtime chronicler of the nation's fixation on status.
 One reason is that Mr. Obama holds two Ivy League degrees at a time when not all Americans accept the notion of an Ivy League education as a triumph of American opportunity. As elite campuses have become more culturally diverse, but not necessarily more accessible to many in the middle class, the perception persists that high-powered connections still matter. 
 ''Most people in America just don't buy into the idea of a meritocracy as defined by Ivy League meritocrats,'' said Nicholas Lemann, the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and the author of ''The Big Test,'' a history of the SAT and the rise of the American meritocracy. ''That's one reason why the average American buys the person who doesn't have fancy college credentials but who built a business from scratch, like the guy who owns a Toyota dealership in Marietta, Ga., and who grew up poor.'' 
 In a nation without a titled aristocracy, an elite education may well be the most important membership card. ''American elites have a problem that the Europeans don't, which is how to assure that their children and their children's children retain their elevated social position,'' said Jason Kaufman, a Harvard sociologist who has written on elites and American culture. ''Americans do this through cultural institutions and exclusion -- art museums, classical music and tremendously elitist universities.''
 There may be another reason Americans are skeptical about the idea that the best rise to the top: those at the top haven't performed too well lately. Christopher Buckley, Yale '75, the novelist and humorist, notes that recent Iraq books contain echoes of ''The Best and the Brightest,'' David Halberstam's classic account of the huge failures of the Ivy League brain trust in the Kennedy White House who propelled the nation into Vietnam. ''If you loved Vietnam, brought to you by Harvard and Yale, you'll love Iraq,'' Mr. Buckley said.
 Consider some crucial players in the Iraq war: former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Princeton '54; Vice President Dick Cheney, Yale dropout; I. Lewis Libby, Yale '72; and L. Paul Bremer III, the former top American civilian administrator in Baghdad, Yale '63, Harvard Business '66. Mr. Bush, Mr. Bremer and Mr. Libby also graduated from Andover.
 Mr. Buckley recalled a famous line uttered by his father, William F. Buckley Jr., Yale '50, who observed in the 1960s that he'd rather ''be governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston telephone book than by the 2,000 members of the Harvard faculty.''
 Ivy League credentials aside, what matters in the end to most voters, when it comes to choosing a president, is not academic pedigree, but rather the candidates' ability to make an emotional connection and to win trust and confidence. The most famous aristocrat-presidents of the 20th century, John F. Kennedy and Theodore and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, all had that gift, and it outweighed the advantages -- and drawbacks -- of education, wealth and privilege.
 This year's focus on the crucial swing states, and their large working-class populations, has made inspiring those voters and playing down elitist credentials a political necessity. At the very least, Mrs. Clinton's lopsided primary victories in West Virginia and Kentucky show how much more work Mr. Obama, the likely Democratic nominee, must do with this critical slice of the electorate. 
 ''We believe in the best and the brightest, but you've also got to relate to ordinary people,'' said Ed Rollins, the longtime Republican strategist who was the national chairman this year of the unsuccessful presidential campaign of former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. ''I think one of the problems that Obama has is that he gives a magnificent speech, he can inspire massive crowds, but he seems aloof up close.''
 The lesson has not been lost on Mr. McCain, whose third-generation Annapolis lineage makes him perhaps the most elite of the three candidates and is married to a woman whose money financed his political career. In a speech last month in Inez, Ky., the Appalachian coal-mining hollow where in 1964 Lyndon B. Johnson declared his war on poverty, Mr. McCain tried to bridge the difference.
 ''I cannot claim that the circumstances of our lives are similar in every respect,'' Mr. McCain told a friendly crowd at the Martin County Courthouse. ''I'm not the son of a coal miner. I wasn't raised by a family that made its living from the land or toiled in a mill or worked in the local schools or health clinic. I was raised in the United States Navy, and after my own naval career, I became a politician. My work isn't as hard as yours.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. McCain assured the crowd that ''you are my compatriots,'' and ''that means more to me than almost any other association.''
 It was a peculiarly American sentiment -- hopeful, political, perhaps naive. But it was as old as the nation itself.
 ''I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has,'' Lincoln told Union troops assembled at the White House in August 1864, before promising them all ''equal privileges in the race of life.''

HEADLINE: A Spike in Screams Before Graduation

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn. 

 BODY:
 At first it just seemed like another high-minded commencement for the eco age -- green ribbons, information on buying carbon offsets to negate emissions from long-distance travel, music by Wesleyan University's manic, thunderous Japanese taiko drummers, an A-list, politically appropriate speaker in Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
 But then came an altercation between the police and students, described on campus alternately as ''the incident'' or ''the riot,'' and Mr. Kennedy's withdrawal after his brain cancer diagnosis and the announcement that Barack Obama would pinch hit, Indiana Jones-style. Who says graduation has to be boring? 
 If everything about college is also about something else -- marketing, mission, politics, placating alumni, even education -- there was no shortage of story lines to be found in the events leading up to Wesleyan's 176th commencement on Sunday. But at this historically (if, officials insist, not uniformly) liberal university, no one was complaining about the finale. Let's face it, Wesleyan's getting Mr. Obama as a last-minute graduation speaker, even if under trying circumstances, was a little like Notre Dame getting the pope. 
 ''Everyone found out at the same time after we put it on our Web page,'' said Holly Wood (yes, but she's actually just a working-class kid from the Poconos), co-founder of a widely read student blog, Wesleying (wesleying.blogspot.com). ''I got out of my car and everyone was screaming, and my phone went off and someone told me, and I screamed. I called my mom, and she screamed. It was like this relay effect of people on the campus, all screaming.'' 
 It has been fairly apparent for some time that if college students were the ones to pick the next president, Mr. Obama would be in very good shape. But few places would be more hospitable than Wesleyan, a school of 3,200 students long known for liberal instincts in politics, arts and campus culture. 
 Still, even at Wesleyan, there's a recognition that there's a fine line between being perceived as progressive and being perceived as one of the last outposts of the Woodstock Nation. So the school's president, Michael S. Roth, a 1978 Wesleyan alum, is quick to point out less politically correct Wesleyan grads (Bill Belichick '75, the coach of the New England Patriots, was among those inducted Friday into the first class of the Wesleyan Athletics Hall of Fame). And he says academic rigor, success in the sciences and political activism all coexist comfortably on campus.
 ''There's a stereotype based on a little sliver of the campus that became well known in the 1980s, but that's totally inaccurate now,'' he said. ''There's an amazing level of true diversity here; we have a Christian fellowship and Young Republicans, as well as students who want us to divest from doing business with companies that make weapons.''
 Students have somewhat mixed feelings. In a brand-name world (and a recession job market), students care about the Wesleyan brand, too, and can do without the more baroque post-hippie notions of life there. On the other hand, some worry that the administration is too intent on creating a watered-down, made-for-the-rankings image, a tension highlighted when Mr. Roth decided it was time to rename the beloved Zonker Harris Day festivities, which paid tribute, often quite literally, to the drug-addled character from Doonesbury. That provided more grist for aggrieved ''Keep Wesleyan Weird'' traditionalists. The fallback position was to call the event ''Ze Who Must Not Be Named Day.''
 And then there was the less airy campus controversy that popped up May 16, when Middletown police cars unexpectedly converged on about 150 Wesleyan students celebrating the end of exams on a street of university-owed housing. According to the police and student reports, a bottle was thrown at a police car and things quickly got out of control. Five students were arrested, and the police used pepper spray and Tasers to break up the crowd. At least two students were bitten by police dogs. Mr. Roth, on his blog, cited both inappropriate actions by students and an overreaction by the police, but it was all, as Zonker Harris might have said, a bummer, both as event and as metaphor. 
 As one senior pointed out, students shouting ''Hell no, we won't go,'' after an altercation at a party, isn't quite the model of civic engagement the largely privileged Wesleyan students say they aspire to. And it did not help that online newspaper comment pages were full of hostile remarks, a reminder that being at an elite university might impress some people but it makes you a fat target for others and that times change but town/gown tensions seem to be eternal.
 So students were licking their wounds, and balancing sympathy for Mr. Kennedy with concerns about whether they'd have a commencement speaker when Mr. Obama's surprise appearance was announced on Thursday.
 On Friday, the taiko brigade was pounding away like maniacs on drums and plastic garbage cans and seniors were pondering life beyond Mr. Obama, when they will descend en masse on Brooklyn or Boston, the two prescribed destinations.
 Most seemed to proclaim themselves more than satisfied with their Wesleyan education and more or less ready for what passes for the real world. ''I'd say I feel as prepared as any 22-year-old could,'' said Alex Rosen, a senior from Newton, Mass. ''Which isn't that prepared.''

HEADLINE: The Freedom Nonagenda

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
James Traub is a contributing writer. His book ''The Freedom Agenda'' will be published in September.

 BODY:
When John McCain talks about the world, he returns again and again to the subject that so preoccupies George Bush -- democracy. McCain says that democracies share not only values but also interests that differ fundamentally from those of authoritarian states. In a major foreign-policy speech this past March, he spoke of ''the great nations of India and Japan, Australia and Brazil, South Korea and South Africa, Turkey and Israel,'' and proposed that the U.S. and Europe join with them in ''a global coalition for peace and freedom'' that he calls the ''League of Democracies.''
 This month, in a speech he gave in Columbus, Ohio, McCain offered more detail on his bold proposal, forecasting that the league, once formed, would apply ''stiff diplomatic and economic pressure'' to force the government of Sudan to accept a peacekeeping force in Darfur. The organization would go on to use ''the economic power and prestige of its member states to end other gross abuses of human rights.'' 
 We don't hear much about the propagation of democracy these days, largely because President Bush's own democratic crusade has sown so much chaos, and so little liberty, abroad, and above all in the target region of the Middle East. Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton shy away from Bush's clarion calls. But not McCain. In the 2000 Republican primaries, it was he, and not Bush, who was the candidate of the so-called national greatness conservatives and argued for an assertive, interventionist policy. Now McCain sounds the same resonant tones that come so naturally to Bush. ''Since the dawn of our republic,'' he declared in a speech last year, ''Americans have believed that our nation was created for a purpose'' -- the universalization of our own democratic principles. The League of Democracies would be the body through which we would advance that great mission. 
 McCain did not conjure this idea from thin air. A number of Democratic thinkers, including Anthony Lake, one of Obama's key advisers, have proposed a ''Concert of Democracies,'' which, despite the mild-mannered 19th-century name, also foresees free societies as the global peacekeeper of last resort. The appeal of some kind of action-oriented democratic body has grown in recent years as Russia, China and other authoritarian states have used their positions in the United Nations Security Council to block almost all proposed forms of intervention, whether economic or military, in places like Sudan, Myanmar or Zimbabwe. The logic is straightforward: if it's only the world's democracies that accept the universality of fundamental human rights, then only an organization of such states will authorize action to protect victims of abusive dictators like Robert Mugabe. 
 There are, however, several large and possibly insuperable problems with this theory. For one, many democratic countries might well refuse to join an organization of global security that excludes China. For another, such an organization would be acting only in the countries of nonmembers, which would undermine its claims to legitimacy. (What happens when the league imposes sanctions on, say, Syria, and only Israel, of all the countries in the region, gets to vote?) And finally, most third-world democracies are profoundly reluctant to meddle in neighbors' affairs, as the tepid response of President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to Mugabe's depredations has made all too plain.
 McCain's democracy talk has a ''soft power'' side as well as a hard-power one. His underlying premise is that the United States has a deep national-security interest in the growth of democracy abroad. Our strategy of relying on autocrats to protect our interests in the Middle East and elsewhere has backfired, he said in his March speech; we should promote democracy abroad because ''it is the democracies of the world that will provide the pillars upon which we can and must build an enduring peace.'' In an effort to change the face of the Islamic world, he said, ''scholarships will be far more important than smart bombs.''
 Of course, George Bush and Condoleezza Rice have said the same thing for years, and we are more unpopular today, above all in the Middle East, than we have ever been before. McCain seems to understand that the United States needs to re-earn the right to talk about its principles. The league itself, he said, would be an exercise in multilateralism, founded on ''mutual respect and trust.'' What's more, he added, ''America must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model. . . . We can't torture or treat inhumanely suspected terrorists we have captured.'' McCain called for the detention facility of Guantanamo Bay to be closed.
 But it isn't only our audience in the Middle East and elsewhere that has stopped paying attention after more than seven years of pious talk from the Bush administration. The American people themselves have lost faith in the language of adventurous idealism. We recognize that our heroic designs have come to grief in Iraq. We see how very little we have accomplished in the Middle East, for all our swelling rhetoric. And we have learned, to our pain, that most of the world does not look to us for guidance, does not accord us much moral authority, does not even believe that our wish to propagate democracy is sincere. The national mood is retrenchment -- perhaps not cynicism or isolationism, but at least a wary and pragmatic realism. A big hangover, at home as well as abroad, awaits whoever inherits the presidency.
 And yet McCain may very well be right that retrenchment is not in our national interest. If that's so, the challenge that either he or one of his Democratic adversaries will face is to persuade Americans, as well as people around the world, that it is not idealism and the democratic mission that have come to grief in the Middle East, but inattention, self-delusion and arrogance.

HEADLINE: It's Not a Campaign, It's a Mission

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Leon Lim, a 35-year-old doctoral student in Sanskrit from Dayton, Ohio, decided with his wife, Ranjani Powers, a yoga instructor, to head off to Bali, or India, or anywhere, really, just ''somewhere very far away'' -- from the Iraq war, the Patriot Act and the tanking dollar, Mr. Lim said. 
 ''We were just so disillusioned with the way everything was going,'' explained the shaven-headed Mr. Lim, who wore a gold hoop earring in each ear. The couple had supported Ralph Nader in 2000, Ms. Powers said, but had since ''given up on America.'' 
 But they found an unlikely reason to stay: Ron Paul, the libertarian Republican congressman from Texas who continues to run for president, even months after Senator John McCain has essentially sewn up the nomination. 
 The Lims were among 1,200 or so supporters in Louisville, Ky., on May 17 who greeted their candidate like a rock star when he walked on stage at a rally at the ornate Louisville Palace Theater. He wore a crisp dress shirt the color of mint ice cream and a color-coordinated tie, which made him look like an insurance claims adjustor. 
 ''The war on drugs has wasted $300 billion and has undermined our civil liberties!'' he said. 
 People in the crowd, many under 30, if not 25, rose to their feet and thundered in applause, even if they looked as if they had stumbled into a Republican rally on their way to the Coachella rock festival. In many cases, hair was aggressive, clothing artfully tattered. Beards seemed to have a mind of their own. 
 ''I talk about bringing the troops home from Iraq, but also don't you feel like it's about time they came back from Korea, Europe and Japan?'' the candidate then asked.
 The audience whooped in approval, as if Ron Paul were a lead guitarist tearing off a solo.
 Mr. Paul was supposed to be a memory by now. But in the Oregon primary last week, he won 15 percent of the vote, and the campaign appears to be growing into something beyond a conventional protest campaign. Some supporters have helped turn the outspoken congressman's campaign into a colorful, loud sideshow with their guerrilla marketing tactics -- self-penned Ron Paul anthems on YouTube, a Ron Paul blimp, T-shirts that portray Mr. Paul as a world-historical icon like Che Guevara. 
 Attendance at Ron Paul campaign stops has nearly returned to pre-Super Tuesday levels. A group of supporters recently announced plans to start Paulville, a gated community in West Texas, where believers can pursue the candidate's libertarian ideals as a cooperative lifestyle. Ron Paul's book, ''The Revolution: A Manifesto,'' rocketed to No. 1 on a New York Times best-seller list on May 18 (it has since dropped). Supporters are starting to discuss creating yippie-ish disruptions at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul in September to gain visibility for the movement.
 Many supporters say that such gestures are not the final gasp of a failed political campaign, but a spark for a ''revolution.'' And Mr. Paul encourages such talk. When he speaks or writes of revolution, the congressman means it in the 1776 sense, except that the oppressors now live in Washington, not London. The candidate wants to turn back what he sees as 200 years of creeping expansion of federal power, dissolve the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service, return to the gold standard, bring the troops home, not just from Iraq, but from everywhere -- and yes, legalize pot, at least for medical purposes.
 This message has hit home -- not only with some traditional libertarians, but also among a small but passionate group of young voters who came of age after Sept. 11, during the debates about the Iraq war, the Patriot Act and Abu Ghraib. For them, the Ron Paul message has the feel not of 1776, but of 1968, when an unpopular war raged abroad, and a subculture of disenfranchised young people embraced an unorthodox philosophy built around a utopian ideal of freedom. 
 Of course, Ron Paul is a lot closer to Barry Goldwater than to Eugene McCarthy. But his young supporters, many of whom call themselves former liberals, said the peacenik left shares much with the libertarian right. 
 ''It's about taking the country back,'' Mr. Lim said, waving off the policy differences between his old ''political saint,'' Mr. Nader, and his new one, who is anti-Roe (Mr. Paul opposes abortion personally, but thinks states should decide the issue) and supports gun rights. ''Whether you believe in abortion or not, in guns or not, that's not the point,'' Mr. Lim said. ''It's about the way the country is going: to hell in a handbasket.''
 Mr. Paul's voters tend to be younger and angrier than most Republicans. Exit polls in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan by Edison/Mitofsky showed that Mr. Paul's voters tended to strongly disapprove of the Iraq war, and hold a far more negative opinion of the Bush administration than other Republican voters do. In Michigan, where Mr. Paul received 6 percent of the vote, 34 percent of Paul voters were under 30, compared with 13 percent of voters there over all. (Mr. Paul is also, largely, a guy thing. In the New Hampshire primary, where the candidate received 8 percent of the vote, his support was 77 percent male, according to exit polls.) 
 With young voters comes youthful enthusiasm. ''This is the message of the Beatles, the Dylans of the world,'' said Marc Scibilia, a 21-year-old songwriter from Buffalo, referring to Mr. Paul's platform. Mr. Scibilia posted a video of his Paul-themed song, ''Hope Anthem,'' on YouTube, and this summer he will lead a 28-city ''Freedom Tour'' featuring other musicians. Mr. Paul's message of freedom and peace is ''an ancient message -- it inspired people in the 60s and 70s,'' Mr. Scibilia said. ''I want to bring back that era of magic.'' 
 Some supporters are as quick as Dylan fans from the 60s to label mainstream politicians as sell-outs and compromisers. They cherish their candidate's outspokenness.
 ''Man, I've straight hated politics, I've just never liked the authority,'' explained Tommy Rayome, 19, a ''musician-slash-cook-slash-whatever'' from Lexington, Ky., who was one of more than 600 people who showed up at last week's Ron Paul signing at a Borders bookstore in Louisville. 
 Mr. Rayome, whose unkempt ash curls cascaded from a knit Rasta cap, wore an enameled American flag pin on his faded maroon T-shirt. He said that he fell for Mr. Paul almost instantly after his roommate, also a supporter, described the candidate's lack of hypocrisy. (In Congress, Mr. Paul is known as Dr. No, for his staunch refusal to vote for any bill he thinks might expand government power.) ''I said, 'All right, I like him,' '' Mr. Rayome recalled. ''He's a terrible politician, so he's the best.''
 Brad Linzy, who writes for a small entertainment magazine in Evansville, Ind., said that by now, Mr. Paul is more than a political preference. ''The man is my hero,'' he said. ''He is a hero on the level of a Gandhi.'' Adhering to the candidate's calls for a hard-currency economy, Mr. Linzy, 30, keeps nearly half his savings in silver bullion, and scours antiques fairs and rummage sales for objects containing silver. 
 In this passionate support, some political observers hear echoes not from 1968, but from 1964 -- when Barry Goldwater lost the presidential election but won a fervent following.
 The youthful zeal of the Paul movement ''does recall the early Goldwater movement, which was also jam-packed with people dropping out of graduate school, college, maybe even high school, to devote themselves 24/7 to what they called the 'revolution,' '' said Rick Perlstein, author of ''Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus'' (Hill and Wang, 2002).
 And such movements don't always stay in the margins forever, he said, adding that the young supporters who stumped for Goldwater's failed presidential bid helped lay the seeds for the Reagan revolution 16 years later.
 The figure at the center of the tempest looks like an unlikely political idol. Waiting in an empty green room at the Palace Theater before taking the stage, Mr. Paul looked slender, stooped, slightly sad. But that image dissolves when he begins to speak about the unlikely sense of community spawned by his traditional libertarianism. 
 ''It does bring people together, people who were totally apathetic,'' he said in an interview afterward. ''They're very diverse. But they understand the issue of freedom. There's a reason for this. If you're free to live your life as you choose and spend your money as you wish, you're not competitive with other people, you don't tell people how to live.'' 
 Libertarianism and utopianism are part of the plans for Paulville, outside of Dell City, Tex. For now, the town is little more than an idea and a title deed to a 50-acre parcel of desert. The goal, according to www.paulville.org, is ''to establish gated communities containing 100 percent Ron Paul supporters and or people that live by the ideals of freedom and liberty.''
 For $500 apiece, the residents would buy shares representing one acre of land to homestead. The site contains no contact information, but land records indicate the first purchase was made by the Jason Ebacher Land Investment Group. Mr. Ebacher, a Ron Paul supporter in Farwell, Minn., did not respond to requests for interviews.
 The candidate himself, however, has said that supporters should take the message out into the world, not hide from it. 
 At a recent mixer at a bar on East 15th Street in Manhattan, it seemed as if Paul supporters had built a community without the help of gates. 
 ''Don't you feel like an evangelist sometimes?'' asked Rain Chacon, 36, a television writer and former Kucinich Democrat who lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. ''It's like, 'Here's The Book, have you read The Book?' '' she said, wearing a Fleshtones T-shirt and cat's-eye glasses and hoisting her copy of ''The Revolution'' into the air.
 The assembled -- a few women and about 15 men -- cheered with approval. They talked about their beliefs in spiritual terms, using phrases like ''seeing the light.'' Those who follow ''the movement'' are termed ''awake.'' The fact that their candidate has essentially zero chance to be president did not seem to faze them. 
 ''As Ron Paul said himself, the revolution has to be more than Ron Paul,'' said Andrew Rushford, 25, a legal assistant who lives in Brooklyn. ''To him, it didn't start the day he was born. It started in 1776.''

HEADLINE: Web Site Puts Focus on Fix In Sports Bets

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
LONDON -- With Internet gambling predicted to surpass $20 billion in 2008, and with illegal wagering accounting for $150 billion in the United States, by some estimates, the temptation for those seeking to influence the outcome of games has never been greater. Now, a raft of gambling scandals in sports, from cricket to soccer and most recently tennis, has raised an uncomfortable question: Are the games we watch fixed? 
 Last Monday, a report commissioned by the major tennis governing bodies recommended that 45 matches played in the last five years be investigated because betting patterns gave a ''strong indication'' that gamblers were profiting from inside information. And those matches, the report said, may be only the tip of the iceberg.
The match fixing might never have been discovered had it not been detected by Betfair, which has revolutionized online wagering since its Web site started in June 2000. At any moment, Betfair's customers have $360 million on account and are at their keyboards, matching odds with fellow bettors in 80 countries. It is eBay for gamblers, with wagers being made in real time, usually after the matches have begun. 
 Betfair has become a focal point for the growing list of match-fixing scandals. Over the past seven years, it has alerted dozens of sports about suspicious betting activity, leading to investigations in horse racing, soccer and now tennis.
 ''You're at risk of being victimized by inside information if you're playing these markets,'' said David Forrest, an economics professor at the University of Salford in England. ''While Internet gambling has offered transparency, it has offered temptation as well. There's greater liquidity for the cheats, and new forms of wagering and more money than ever. There are more incentives for athletes or officials to manipulate or fix a game.'' 
 The most prominent scandal has involved the tennis player Nikolay Davydenko, ranked fourth in the world and seeded fourth in the French Open, which begins Sunday. At a tournament in Sopot, Poland, in August, Mr. Davydenko went from being a heavy favorite against 87th-ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina to being a significant underdog during the match.
 Mr. Davydenko's odds got longer, and more money came in for Mr. Vassallo Arguello, even after Mr. Davydenko won the first set. Mr. Davydenko retired because of an injury with Mr. Vassallo Arguello ahead, 2-6, 6-3, 2-1. During the match, Betfair notified the ATP, the men's professional tennis association, that its security team had recognized irregular betting patterns. After the match, Betfair voided $7 million in bets, the first time in its history that it had taken such a measure. It turned over all of its data to the ATP.
 Mr. Davydenko has denied wrongdoing. He has refused a request from ATP investigators for the cellphone records of his wife and his brother.
 The incident, along with the fact that at least a dozen ranked players told members of the news media that they had been asked to throw matches or had heard of similar approaches made to other players, prompted the 66-page report, ''Environmental Review of Integrity in Professional Tennis.''
 Now many in professional tennis are calling for a global anticorruption body for sport, to run along the lines of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The idea has been embraced by most major sports in Europe.
 ''Insider trading is a bigger deal in sports than in the financial markets,'' said Justin Wolfers, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, who studies gambling. ''We have the Securities and Exchange Commission here. Why not the same for what is a multibillion-dollar sports gambling market?''
 From its office above the Thames, Betfair has been the de facto watchdog for sports. Computers glow 24 hours a day, and televisions beam in snooker, basketball, soccer and horse racing, among the sports on which Betfair offers 4,000 kinds of bets a week.
 Betfair's founders, Andrew Black and Edward Wray, whose backgrounds are in the stock market and investment banking, say they have built a better mousetrap. More than a million customers of the Web site, Betfair.com, wager against each other, setting their own odds and paying a fraction of what traditional bookmakers charge.
 As Internet gambling has boomed from a $6 billion industry in 2003 to the more than $20 billion expected this year, according to the Maine-based research firm Christiansen Capital Advisors, Betfair's revenue has grown to $372 million, from $64 million in 2003. Last year, by taking 2 percent to 5 percent commissions on winning bets, Betfair posted profits of $64 million, according to its annual report.
 Its founders wanted to transplant the fundamentals of investment banking to sports. Now, Betfair handles 15 million transactions a day, or more than all of the European stock exchanges combined. Sports betting is legal in Britain; 8,000 betting shops are licensed and regulated by the government, as are the Internet gambling sites based here.
 Betfair offers betting on major sports based in the United States, like the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball. But it does not take any wagers from the United States or China, Japan, Hong Kong or India, places where online gambling is illegal. The men's singles competition at the United States Open was the most popular tennis event on Betfair in 2007, with $307 million bet.
 What Betfair brought to gambling was transparency. It has agreements with 32 sports governing bodies and is seeking more, promising to share in real time any unusual betting activity.
 ''We can tell you every single bet ever placed and who made it, from what funds and where those funds are going,'' said Mark Davies, a Betfair managing director and a former bond trader. ''It is a complete audit trail, and we want to share it with the governing bodies of sport.''
 But many sports governing bodies have refused Betfair's offer, Mr. Davies said, including the International Olympic Committee. During the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Betfair matched $80 million in wagers on Olympic events. A spokeswoman for the I.O.C., Emmanuelle Moreau, said that the committee had taken proactive measures to address gambling threats. She also said it expected to have a system in place to be alerted to irregular betting before the Beijing Games in August.
 ''I have been told by one sport that they did not want to sign an agreement because they did not want to know the level of corruption that existed,'' Mr. Davies said. ''But it exists, and we're just showing what has always been there.''
 Still, others say that Betfair's ''in-running bets,'' which may not necessarily affect the final outcome, are ripe for manipulation. 
 This month, for example, the British Horseracing Authority charged nine people, including a prominent trainer, Paul Blockley, and a jockey, Dean McKeown, with corruption, saying they shared inside information that their horses were not going to run well. The bettors, including five racehorse owners, had put money on horses to lose, which Betfair permits.
 ''Betting corruption existed before Betfair,'' said Paul Scotney, the director of integrity services and licensing for the British Horseracing Authority, which has disciplined more than a dozen jockeys, as well as trainers and owners, with the help of Betfair's data. ''But Betfair offers other, and more, ways of cheating.'' 
 More worrisome for Mr. Forrest, the economist and co-author of a recent study, ''Risks to the Integrity of Sport From Betting Corruption,'' are sports like tennis, in which a player can deliberately lose the first set against an inferior opponent so that the odds rise, then go on to win.
 ''It is a greater incentive for an athlete or official to participate in this type of manipulation,'' Mr. Forrest said. ''It is within their control, and they do not have to lose the match.''
 Jenny Williams, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, which regulates Britain's gaming industry, said her agency was gathering information about in-running betting and its pitfalls. 
 ''The jury is still out,'' Ms. Williams said. ''You can produce a theoretical risk, but we need to determine if it is going on.''
 How many of the world's sporting events are fixed? By virtue of the fact that match-fixing is a crime and most gambling is illegal, most economists and sports officials hesitate to guess.
 The United States is hardly immune. On May 16, federal prosecutors asserted that the N.B.A. referee Tim Donaghy admitted to betting or providing inside information to gamblers on more than 100 games, many of them that he had officiated. The league said Mr. Donaghy was a rogue referee, but there are enough instances of gambling scandals in the world to suggest that match-fixing is also part of the American landscape. 
 In 2006, for example, Mr. Wolfers, the Wharton professor, after reviewing 16 years of college basketball results, found that point shaving had occurred in about 1 percent of the games. A Stanford economics student, Jonathan Gibbs, suggested in an undergraduate thesis that similar forces may be at work in the N.B.A.
 In fact, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's gambling survey of 21,000 athletes released in 2005 found that 35 percent of male athletes and 10 percent of female athletes said they had bet on college sports in the previous year. Of the 2,132 Division I football players surveyed, 1.1 percent (23) reported accepting money for playing poorly in a game. Of the 388 Division I men's basketball players surveyed, 0.5 percent (2) reported such conduct. 
 A total of 2.3 percent of the Division I football players and 2.1 percent of the Division I men's basketball players surveyed said they had been asked to influence the outcome of a game because of gambling debts, and 1.4 percent of the football players and 1 percent of the basketball players acknowledged actually affecting the outcome. 
 Mr. Wolfers said there was more to worry about in American sports, on which more money was bet illegally and without regulation. ''There is a greater potential for corruption,'' he said. ''Bad guys are going to get away with more stuff unless we channel it into a legitimate economy.''

CHART: How Betfair Works: The Money Flows When the Match Begins Traditionally, bets are made before a game or event, and the wagering ends once the action begins. But Betfair offers real-time betting, allowing gamblers to place bets based on the game's fluctuations. Its bets are not placed with bookmakers. Instead bettors are matched with other bettors in much the same way the stock exchange pairs sellers and buyers.

HEADLINE: How Green Is the College? Time the Showers

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: OBERLIN, Ohio 

 BODY:
Lucas Brown, a junior at Oberlin College here, was still wet from the shower the other morning as he entered his score on the neon green message board next to the bathroom sink: Three minutes, according to the plastic hourglass timer inside the shower. Two minutes faster than the morning before. One minute faster than two of his housemates. 
 Mr. Brown, a 21-year-old economics major, recalled the marathon runner who lived in the house last semester, saying: ''He came out of the shower one morning and yelled out: 'Two minutes 18 seconds. Beat that, Lucas!' '' 
 Another of Mr. Brown's seven housemates, Becky Bob-Waksberg, racked up the morning's longest shower: Eight minutes. The house cuts Ms. Bob-Waksberg slack, Mr. Brown said, because of her thick, curly hair, which takes longer to shampoo. 
 So it goes at Oberlin's new sustainability house -- SEED, for Student Experiment in Ecological Design -- a microcosm of a growing sustainability movement on campuses nationwide, from small liberal arts colleges like Oberlin and Middlebury, in Vermont, to Lansing Community College in Michigan, to Morehouse in Atlanta, to public universities like the University of New Hampshire. 
 While previous generations focused on recycling and cleaning up rivers, these students want to combat global warming by figuring out ways to reduce carbon emissions in their own lives, starting with their own colleges. They also view the environment as broadly connected with social and economic issues, and their concerns include the displacement of low-income families after Hurricane Katrina and the creation of ''green collar'' jobs in places like the South Bronx. 
 The mission is serious and yet, like life at the Oberlin house, it blends idealism, hands-on practicality, laid-back community and fun. 
 ''It's not about telling people, 'You have to do this, you have to do that,' '' Mr. Brown said. ''It's about fitting sustainability into our own lives.'' And hoping, he added, ''that a friend will come over, recognize that it's fun, start doing it, and then a friend of theirs will start doing it.'' 
 With their professors as collaborators, and with their own technological and political savvy, students are persuading administrators to switch to fossil-free fuel on campus -- Middlebury is building an $11 million wood-chip-powered plant, part of its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2016 -- serve locally grown food in dining halls and make hybrid cars available for shared transportation when, say, the distance is too far to bike and there is no bus. Students are planting organic gardens and competing in dorm energy-use Olympics. At Oberlin last year, some students in the winning dorm did not shower for two weeks, officials said. 
 ''This is a generation that is watching the world come undone,'' said David Orr, a professor of environmental studies at Oberlin. Projects like the Oberlin house, he said, are ''helping them understand how to stitch the world together again.''
 Dr. Orr's course in ecological design became the incubator for the house when Mr. Brown and the two other founders of SEED, Kathleen Keating and Amanda Medress, enrolled in it last spring. They had done research on sustainability houses at Middlebury, Brown and Tufts, and had persuaded the college to turn over an aging, drafty two-story house. But before they could move in, they needed to make the house energy efficient. 
 The class studied water and energy use, insulation, heating and cooling, and financing. Nathan Engstrom, Oberlin's sustainability coordinator -- an essential position on many campuses these days -- gave advice. John Petersen, the college's environmental studies director, checked out the house's wiring.
 The college spent $40,000 to renovate the house over the summer, bringing it up to safety code. Mr. Brown used the carpentry skills he had learned from his father to pitch in on weatherizing. 
 The students moved in last September. ''We sat down and had a meeting -- 'O.K., what next?' '' Mr. Brown recalled. ''We didn't know what it meant to have a sustainable house.'' 
 That first night, amid confusion about who was home and who was out, they left the lights on. ''We said, 'Oh, no, we just had a terrible first day,' '' Mr. Brown said. '' 'We're leaving lights on everywhere.' '' 
 All year they studied together in the living room at night so they would not have to turn on lights in the other rooms. They mastered worm composting, lowered the thermostat -- keeping it at 60 degrees for most of the winter and piling on blankets -- and unplugged appliances. There is no television, but no one seems to consider that a hardship. 
 ''You have the rest of your life to watch TV,'' Ms. Keating said. 
 The unplugging of the refrigerator was not so easy. The house is divided in two, and each half has a kitchen. With everyone eating meals at a nearby student-run co-op, a decision was made to save energy by disconnecting the refrigerator and appliances in one kitchen. But which one? 
 ''The fridge was kind of controversial,'' Ms. Bob-Waksberg said. ''We kind of had a little feud going on for a while. We talked it out.'' 
 Now that the weather is warm, the residents of the house like to barbecue. Oberlin's president, Marvin Krislov, dropped by with his young daughter a few weeks ago for burgers and grilled corn. Offering the ritual tour, the students demonstrated how they caught their shower and sink water in buckets and reused it to flush their low-flow toilet, a budget model improvised with a couple of salvaged bricks in the tank. 
 ''He was using us to chastise his daughter for leaving lights on and the water running,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 The bathroom is the showstopper on the tour. Besides the hourglass timer -- Mr. Brown pointed out that it was called a shower coach and cost $3 online -- the shower's energy-saving motivational accessories include a picture of former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina plastered to the ceiling. 
 That was Ms. Bob-Waksberg's idea. No one wants to linger in the shower with someone staring down from the ceiling, she said.
 ''You could also look at it another way,'' she said, ''that John Edwards is encouraging me to take a shorter shower.''
 Why Mr. Edwards? ''He had the strongest global warming policies of any of the candidates,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Ms. Bob-Waksberg, a religion studies major from California, was one of 25 students who applied to live in the house. With the house's three founders looking for nonenvironmental studies types for diversity, Ms. Bob-Waksberg's major, along with her confession that her environmental work had amounted to ''various weed-pulling, clean-up-the-bay projects'' back in high school, made her a shoo-in.
 ''We kind of roped Becky into sustainability,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Ms. Bob-Waksberg, along with Mr. Brown and carloads of other students, went to New Orleans to help after Hurricane Katrina. She will return to the city this summer to teach. 
 By next fall, the house's 24-hour energy-use monitoring system will be fully up and running. Every turn of the faucet, every switch of a light, will be recorded, room by room.
 The house, with its mismatched secondhand furniture, comic book posters and bicycles parked in the living room, is a popular meeting place for environmentally conscious student groups. Ms. Bob-Waksberg's quirky, hand-printed signs (on recycled cardboard) admonish visitors to turn off lights and unplug appliances. The sign next to Mr. Brown's electric keyboard in the living room says: ''The music was beautiful. Now go do your homework and don't forget to unplug me.'' 
 ''My keyboard,'' Mr. Brown said, ''is one of my indulgences.'' 
 He confessed to another one. Sometimes, he said, ''on a Friday after a long week of finals, I have to have a bath and a beer.''
 What about the shower timer? He laughed, sheepishly.
 ''I hide it on the floor,'' he said.

HEADLINE: TAX EXEMPTIONS OF CHARITIES FACE NEW CHALLENGES

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: RED WING, Minn. 

 BODY:
Authorities from the local tax assessor to members of Congress are increasingly challenging the tax-exempt status of nonprofit institutions -- ranging from small group homes to wealthy universities -- questioning whether they deserve special treatment. 
 One issue is the growing confusion over what constitutes a charity at a time when nonprofit groups look more like businesses, charging fees and selling products and services to raise money, and state and local governments are under financial pressure because of lower tax revenues. 
 And there are others: Does a nonprofit hospital give enough charity care to earn a tax exemption? Is a wealthy university providing enough financial aid? 
 In a ruling last December that sent tremors through the not-for-profit world, the Minnesota Supreme Court said a small nonprofit day care agency here had to pay property taxes because, in essence, it gave nothing away. 
 The agency, the Under the Rainbow Child Care Center, charges the same price per child regardless of whether their parents are able to pay the full amount themselves or they receive government support to cover the cost.
 ''We were shocked,'' said Michelle Finholdt, who founded the center in 1994 and scraped together the money to buy a building in 2002. ''There are a lot of other organizations in our area that we're similar to, and they are exempt from property taxes.'' 
 The tax-exempt status of charities costs local governments $8 billion to $13 billion annually, according to various rough estimates. 
 And local assessors are not the only government officials scratching their heads over which groups deserve privileged tax status. Congress has threatened to impose a requirement that wealthy universities make minimum payouts from their endowments and raised questions about whether nonprofit hospitals are really all that different from their for-profit -- and tax-paying -- competitors.
 And, concerned about the way some churches are spending money, the Senate Finance Committee has asked for detailed financial information from six evangelical ministries asking them to justify their tax exemptions. 
 Others are questioning whether some tax-exempt nonprofits, primarily universities and hospitals, have accumulated so much wealth that they should no longer be considered charities. In Massachusetts, where Harvard's endowment has reached $35 billion in assets, legislators are weighing whether to impose a 2.5 percent annual assessment on universities with endowments of more than $1 billion. 
 The idea behind tax exemptions is that the organizations provide a public service or substantially reduce the burdens of government. Standards from property-tax exemptions are set by the states, while the federal exemption means charities are not taxed on their income.
 Almost 88 percent of overall nonprofit revenues in 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available, came from fees for services, sales and sources other than charitable contributions, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics. Nonprofit health care providers, day care centers and retirement homes, among others, are often difficult to distinguish from their tax-paying competitors. 
 ''We're all seeing the growth of revenue in this area we call earned income,'' said Audrey R. Alvarado, executive director of the National Council of Nonprofit Associations, adding that the Minnesota court decision ''is saying, 'Wait a minute, charities are supposed to give things away for free.' ''
 ''It goes to the core of how nonprofits are classified and defined,'' she said, ''and I think it is an example of the confusion in the public, and even among folks in the sector itself, about what a nonprofit is.''
 Evelyn Brody, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and an expert on nonprofits and property taxes, said that, in studying the issue in 2002 and revisiting it last year, she had seen an explosion of cases across the country in which charities were challenged to say why they deserve their property tax exemptions. 
 As universities charge high tuitions, and pay large salaries to administrators, they have become prime targets. For example, New London, Conn., assessed property taxes on a skating rink owned by Connecticut College. Local assessors tried to tax Smith College in Northampton, Mass., arguing that the women's college engaged in sex discrimination and thus was not charitable. 
 Smaller organizations that provide services like day care or drug treatment are being challenged, too. The Oregon tax court denied property tax exemption to a residential substance-abuse treatment center because it catered to ''addicted professionals'' and, like Under the Rainbow, did not give away its services.
 The Minnesota Department of Revenue and county tax assessors say the uproar over the court ruling here has surprised them.
 ''From the assessors' standpoint, the Under the Rainbow ruling didn't change anything for us,'' said Thomas J. May, the tax assessor for Hennepin County and a spokesman for the state's assessors. 
 In determining which organizations qualify for exemption, assessors in Minnesota rely on the State Constitution, which explicitly exempts things like public burial grounds, seminaries and colleges and universities from taxation, and on six criteria set out in a 1975 State Supreme Court decision. 
 Mr. May said that the determination process had become increasingly difficult, however, noting that the Mall of America, a major tourist attraction, was seeking tax exemptions as part of its plans to expand, arguing that it aids the state economy by drawing visitors.
 ''From our perspective in the assessment field, it's harder to define what's a nonprofit these days because there are so many different types, and many of them are doing the same thing for-profit groups that aren't exempt are doing,'' he said.
 Some 95 percent of Under the Rainbow's $550,582 budget in 2006 came from fees for services paid by families or by county and tribal governments. The court concluded that because the center charged all families the same amount, regardless of their ability to pay, and because its rates were not lower than those of its competitors, it was not an institution of ''purely public charity'' under the law and thus was subject to thousands of dollars in property taxes -- $16,000 in 2006 and in 2007. 
 ''The extent to which the recipients of the charity are required to pay for the assistance received tests for a value that is fundamental to the concept of charity -- that is, whether the organization gives away anything,'' Chief Justice Russell A. Anderson wrote in the decision.
 Additionally, the court ruled that government payments were not evidence of charity -- those payments were not a gift.
 These two elements of the ruling have profoundly alarmed nonprofit groups in Minnesota and elsewhere. 
 ''There are between 300 and 500 nonprofit groups in this state that could lose their property tax exemptions under that ruling,'' said Jon Pratt, executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, which represents about 2,000 of the state's roughly 3,400 charities.
 RSI Inc. in Duluth is among those at risk, said Jon Nelson, its executive director. The organization was founded 30 years ago by parents of mentally disabled children when the state closed the last of its homes for the disabled.
 More than 93 percent of its $11 million budget this year will come from government, and 6 percent will come from clients. ''For-profit businesses aren't going to take on these clients, and the state long ago recognized that as a nonprofit,we could provide better care at a lower cost than it could,'' Mr. Nelson said. 
 ''This court ruling is just ripe with unintended consequences,'' he said. ''The state is cutting off its nose to spite its face.'' RSI owns real estate valued at $5.5 million and would pay an estimated $110,000 in property taxes if it lost its exemption.
 ''The nonprofit sector is being pressed to be more business-like and to find new ways to fill the gaps between what government will pay and what services cost, but then assessors want to treat us like businesses, which pay taxes,'' said Jan Malcolm, chief executive of the Courage Center in Minneapolis and a former state health commissioner. 
 The Courage Center, which provides services and facilities for physically disabled people, estimates that a change in its tax exemption would cost it $1.7 million -- $1.4 million in property taxes and $300,000 in sales taxes, which are linked to payment of property taxes in Minnesota.
 That, Ms. Malcolm said, would force the center to cut programs and services.
 This month, the Minnesota Legislature passed a tax bill that establishes a one-year ban on reversing property tax exemptions held by existing nonprofits.
 The bill requires legislators to set criteria to define what is ''purely public charity,'' a phrase included in many state statutes on charitable property tax exemption, in an era of nonprofit groups that charge for their services and receive only negligible amounts of donations.
 ''We need to figure out what we mean by 'purely public charity' because, frankly, we can't afford as a state to lose nonprofits providing these kinds of services,'' said State Representative Paul Marquart, chairman of the property tax subcommittee. ''But it isn't going to be easy.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about challenges to the tax-exempt status of nonprofit institutions referred incorrectly to an effort by local assessors to tax Smith College, arguing that as a women's college it engaged in sex discrimination and thus was not charitable. That effort took place in the early 1980s, not recently, and the assessment involved an observatory owned by Smith in Whatley, Mass.; the assessors were not trying to tax the entire college, which is in Northampton.

HEADLINE: World Bank, U.S., Britain and Japan Take On Warming

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The World Bank will raise at least $5.5 billion with the United States, Britain and Japan this year for climate change funds that will help poor nations use clean technology and tackle global warming, a bank official said on Sunday. 
 The bank will agree to set up the funds at its July board meeting and will raise the money by autumn, the bank's vice president for sustainable development, Katherine Sierra, said in an interview in the Japanese city of Kobe, where she is attending a meeting of the Group of 8 environment ministers.
 ''We are hoping that initially the clean technology fund may begin with $5 billion and the other one may be $500 million for climate resilience,'' Ms. Sierra said, adding a further announcement may be made at the G-8 summit in July.
 The three-day meeting in Kobe is part of efforts to develop a successor to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which expires in 2012. Japan wants the focus of a G-8 meeting in Japan's northern island of Hokkaido to be the drafting of a new accord.
 Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and Antigua and Barbuda are also taking part in the Kobe meeting.
 The bank announced earlier last week 40 developing and industrialized countries had agreed to create two international investment funds to help developing countries use clean technologies and mitigate the impact of climate change.

HEADLINE: For Women Warriors, Deep Wounds, Little Care

BYLINE: By HELEN BENEDICT. 
Helen Benedict, a professor of journalism at Columbia, is the author of the novel ''The Opposite of Love'' and the forthcoming ''The Lonely Soldier: The Private War of Women Serving in Iraq.''

 BODY:
THIS Memorial Day, as an ever-increasing number of mentally and physically wounded soldiers return from Iraq, the Department of Veterans Affairs faces a pressing crisis: women traumatized not only by combat but also by sexual assault and harassment from their fellow service members. Sadly, the department is failing to fully deal with this problem. 
 Women make up some 15 percent of the United States active duty forces, and 11 percent of the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nearly a third of female veterans say they were sexually assaulted or raped while in the military, and 71 percent to 90 percent say they were sexually harassed by the men with whom they served. 
 This sort of abuse drastically increases the risk and intensity of post-traumatic stress disorder. One study found that female soldiers who were sexually assaulted were nine times more likely to show symptoms of this disorder than those who weren't. Sexual harassment by itself is so destructive, another study revealed, it causes the same rates of post-traumatic stress in women as combat does in men. And rape can lead to other medical crises, including diabetes, asthma, chronic pelvic pain, eating disorders, miscarriages and hypertension. 
 The threat of post-traumatic stress has risen in recent years as women's roles in war have changed. More of them now come under fire, suffer battle wounds and kill the enemy, just as men do. 
 As women return for repeat tours, usually redeploying with their same units, many must go back to war with the same man (or men) who abused them. This leaves these women as threatened by their own comrades as by the war itself. Yet the combination of sexual assault and combat has barely been acknowledged or studied. 
 Last month, when the RAND Corporation released the biggest non-military survey of the mental health of troops since 2001, it unwittingly reflected this lack of research. The survey found that women suffer from higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression than men do, but it neglected to look into why this might be, and asked no questions about abuse from fellow soldiers. Terri Tanielian, the project's co-editor, told me that RAND needs more money to explore these higher rates of trauma among women. 
 As the more than 191,500 women who have served in the Middle East since 2001 return home, they will increasingly flood the Veterans Affairs system. To ask those who need help for post-traumatic stress disorder to turn to a typical Veterans Affairs hospital, built in the 1950s and designed to treat men, is untenable. Women who have been raped or sexually assaulted often cannot face therapy groups or medical facilities full of men.
 At the moment, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates only six inpatient post-traumatic stress disorder programs specifically for women. And although all 153 department-run hospitals will treat women, only 22 have stand-alone women's clinics that offer a full range of medical and psychological services. 
 This number of clinics may seem adequate for the 1.7 million female veterans currently at home, especially since they represent only 7.2 percent of all veterans at the moment, but it isn't. Many clinics are miles from where soldiers live, and many more are open only a few hours a week and lack staff members trained to deal with sexual assault, let alone assault combined with combat trauma. 
 The Department of Veterans Affairs says it plans to open more clinics for post-traumatic stress disorder, but how many will be only for women remains undecided. 
 Women are the fastest-growing group of veterans, and by 2020 they are projected to account for 20 percent of all veterans under the age of 45. Not all of these women will have suffered sexual assault, but many will have medical or psychological needs that conventional department hospitals cannot meet. 
 The Department of Veterans Affairs must open more comprehensive women's health clinics, designate more facilities for women who have endured both combat and military sexual trauma and finance more support groups specifically for female combat veterans. The best way to honor all of our soldiers is to do what we can to help them mend.

 DEATH OF REBEL LEADER
 Raises Hope for Hostages' Release
 The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, confirmed the death of its senior leader, the legendary guerrilla Manuel Marulanda, following an announcement by the country's Defense Ministry. President Alvaro Uribe said he had been contacted by the group's senior leaders to discuss the possible release of hostages taken by FARC, including a former presidential candidate and three American military contractors.

 CHINA CALLS FOR MORE FOREIGN AID
 China is appealing for more international aid in the aftermath of the powerful earthquake that devastated parts of the country's southwest. At least five million people are now homeless, and Chinese officials worry that the international community may not have nearly enough tents to house them. PAGE A5 
 LEBANON ELECTS NEW LEADER
 Gen. Michael Suleiman was elected the new president of Lebanon, a first step in a formal power-sharing pact between the country's divided political factions. The election came after 18 months of political conflict and was a clear victory for the Shiite militant group Hezbollah and its allies in the opposition. But in a brief speech. Gen. Suleiman made deferential gestures toward both sides of Lebanon's political divide. PAGE A5
 MBEKI BLASTS XENOPHOBIC ATTACKS
 President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa had been excoriated in the press for offering only faint and infrequent condemnations of the recent anti-immigrant violence in his country that have left 50 people dead. He responded on Sunday with a 10-minute, nationally televised speech, but the attacks and his handling of them come as setbacks are tarnishing his leadership. PAGE A5
 WHEN THE GOOD TIMES ARE ROUGH
 These should be good times for Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the president of Argentina. Consumer spending is up, the prices of agricultural commodities are soaring and foreign investment has been steadily flowing into the country. But a conflict between her government the country's farmworkers has weighed down her popularity, and her economic policies are beginning to limit foreign investment. PAGE A8
 MAYBE THE TRUTH ISN'T OUT THERE
 Britain's Ministry of Defense released hundreds of files documenting U.F.O. sightings from 1978 to 2002 to the public, which was a bit anticlimactic for U.F.O. enthusiasts. There wasn't much evidence of alien visitation, just a lot of one-page forms carrying details from witnesses like how big the supposed aircraft was and what, if anything, it seemed to be doing.

Kennedy as commencement speaker at Wesleyan University to explore the relationship of protege and mentor, honoring Mr. Kennedy and reflecting on the legacy of the Kennedy family. He also called on the graduates to change the country and the world through service to others, a theme Mr. Kennedy had planned to focus on. PAGE A10
 TAXING SEX
 A California assemblyman has an idea to help close the state's $17 billion budget gap: a 25 percent tax on the gross revenues of entertainment that relies on naked people to produce it. The proposal has united in opposition an unlikely alliance of pornographic film producers, the Chamber of Commerce and cable television operators. Roughly 85 percent of all pornography and 40 percent of its distribution comes from California, said one industry executive. PAGE A11
 LOOKING FOR A RUNNING MATE
 Eyes were on the comings and goings at Senator John McCain's ranch near Sedona, Ariz., on Sunday. Guests included some said to be potential running mates. Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who challenged Mr. McCain for the Republican nomination, were all there. All three have been talked about as possible vice presidential picks. The McCain campaign said everything was purely social. PAGE A13

 WAVING THE BANNER

 Its inception dates to the Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979. The chairman of Lord & Taylor at the time ordered that ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' be played every morning. So before customers are allowed inside its flagship store on Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor plays an orchestral recording of the national anthem. Some mornings, the shoppers waiting outside raise their voices in song. PAGE A15

 To go along with a bit of a makeover inside the Empire State Building, the guards are getting a new wardrobe as well. Plain polo shirts and dark slacks are out. In is a look that was the style when the building was new. Chevron-topped sleeves on the jacket, special logo on the ties. ''This is a classic for Art Deco,'' said an executive of the uniform company. PAGE A14
 TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A SUICIDE
 Gary A. Berwick's suicide was a shock to people who knew him. But to some of his friends in the New York State Police, from which he retired in April, it is no great mystery what drove Mr. Berwick to despair. They say there was just too much politics to bear, some of it linked to the travails of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, followed by accusations by the new governor of a rogue unit said to be engaged in political espionage on behalf of elected officials. Mr. Berwick, his friends say, took those criticisms personally. PAGE A14Metropolitan Diary A15

Cablevision executives have declined interviews, which is not a response most journalists generally find encouraging. PAGE C1
 TREMORS IN OPRAHLAND
 The average audience for ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has fallen nearly 7 percent this year, its third straight year of decline. ''Oprah's Big Give'' started big but steadily lost nearly one-third of its audience. The circulation of O, The Oprah Magazine has fallen by more than 10 percent in the last three years. Amid all this, and criticism by some of her endorsement of Senator Barack Obama, Ms. Winfrey is embarking on what is perhaps her biggest project yet: the start-up of OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network.

Both finalists were named David. Imagine the tension. And imagine tension in the world of balloon-twisting. It is there, detailed in a new documentary, ''Twisted: A Balloonamentary.'' All this and more in Media Talk. PAGE C4TRYING TO REVIVE THE DVD
 In an effort to bolster declining DVD sales, Warner Brothers is planning an unusual effort around its upcoming adaptation of the popular graphic novel ''Watchmen.''

 CABLE MAKES GAINS
 In the traditional September-to-May broadcast season that ended last week, audiences increasingly chose ad-supported cable channels rather than the major networks. Some executives credit (or blame) the writers' strike.

 Mark Alpert's day job, as they say, is as an editor at Scientific American. He is now also a novelist, having produced ''Final Theory,'' the premise of which is that Albert Einstein unlocked the secret of the universe, the famed Unified Field Theory, and then entrusted parts of it to each of his students.

 Music reviews look at new CDs by Usher, 3 Doors Down, Esperanza Spalding, Cyndi Lauper and the Ting Tings. ''Bring Ya to the Brink,'' Ms. Lauper's first album of original material in roughly a decade, is ''long on thudding downbeats and short on nuance or grace,'' Nate Chinen writes. ''Perhaps Ms. Lauper felt she had to come up with some upbeat new songs to perform on this year's True Colors Tour.'' PAGE B1 
 A NEW MUTATION
 ''The Andromeda Strain'' is back, in mutated form. This version is a four-hour miniseries starting Monday night on A&E, an adaptation that, Ginia Bellafante writes in her review, is less faithful to the original text of Michael Crichton's 1969 novel than the 1971 film was, though retaining essential plot elements. But the shows leading genius ''adds all the tension of someone conducting a tax audit.'' PAGE B7

HEADLINE: Economy Aids Picture Tube TV Sales

 BODY:
Economy Aids Picture Tube TV Sales 
 The slowing American economy has had an unexpected effect on the television business: a resurgence in the popularity of the standard picture tube TV. 
 According to new sales figures from the DisplaySearch research firm, tube TVs edged out plasma models to become the second-most-popular technology in the first quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of 2007, plasma enjoyed the No. 2 spot, after liquid crystal display. 
 The reasons are simple, said Paul Gagnon, the company's director of North American TV research: price sensitivity and a sense among consumers that they should buy a cheap digital-capable set before the nation switches to all-digital broadcasting next year.
 For those who still want to buy a flat-panel TV, the economy has led consumers to rethink their need for the biggest and best. ''With the Super Bowl in January, typically sales of larger sets do well in the first quarter,'' Mr. Gagnon said. But this year, ''sales of TVs in the 30- to 37-inch size were stronger than expected.'' Smaller sets mean lower revenues for the manufacturers.
 One bright spot for the industry is that sales of TVs 50 inches and larger were ''stronger than expected,'' Mr. Gagnon said. If the rich do not always get richer, so far at least many seem to have retained their ability to buy big TVs. ERIC A. TAUB

HEADLINE: The Wars We Choose To Ignore

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Gen. John A. Logan was a Union officer, a fierce Republican partisan, an early advocate of the kind of volunteer army the United States now fights wars with. He is also one of the people credited with coming up with the holiday that we celebrate today. A statue in Logan Circle in Washington shows the general on horseback flanked by two female figures said to represent America at war and America at peace.
 Given public indifference to a war that refuses to end, perhaps a third statue should be added: America at peace with being at war.
 Even as we celebrate generations of American soldiers past, the women and men who are making that sacrifice today in Iraq and Afghanistan receive less attention every day. There's plenty of blame to go around: battle fatigue at home, failing media resolve and a government intent on controlling information from the battlefield. 
 According to the Project for Excellence in Journalism's News Coverage Index, coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has slipped to 3 percent of all American print and broadcast news as of last week, falling from 25 percent as recently as last September. 
 ''Ironically, the success of the surge and a reduction in violence has led to a reduction in coverage,'' said Mark Jurkowitz of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. ''There is evidence that people have made up their minds about this war, and other stories -- like the economy and the election -- have come along and sucked up all the oxygen.''
 But the tactical success of the surge should not be misconstrued as making Iraq a safer place for American soldiers. Last year was the bloodiest in the five-year history of the conflict, with more than 900 dead, and last month, 52 perished, making it the bloodiest month of the year so far. So far in May, 18 have died. 
 Television network news coverage in particular has gone off a cliff. Citing numbers provided by a consultant, Andrew Tyndall, the Associated Press reported that in the months after September when Gen. David H. Petraeus testified before Congress about the surge, collective coverage dropped to four minutes a week from 30 minutes a week at the height of coverage, in September 2007. 
 It was also pointed out that when Katie Couric, CBS's embattled anchor, went to Iraq to report the story, she and her network were rewarded with their lowest ratings in over 20 years. Hollywood producers who had hoped there would be a public interest in cinematic perspectives on this war have been similarly punished.
 The war remains on the front burner for some outlets. On Sunday, The Los Angeles Times gave over much of its front page to chronicling Californians who have died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Washington Post continues to personalize the war with a series called Faces of the Fallen. 
 Earlier this spring, Alissa J. Rubin of The New York Times wrote about flying in a C-130 in Iraq, accompanied by soldiers, including one in a coffin at the back of the plane.
 ''I wondered what exactly he had died for. And although I did not know him, I felt melancholy as we flew onward, accompanied now by ghosts and memories of loss,'' she wrote. 
 She may have been haunted by her proximity, but the rest of us? Not so much. I asked Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, how a war that had cost thousands of lives and over $1 trillion was losing news salience.
 ''There is a cold and sad calculation that readers/viewers aren't that interested in the war, whether because they are preoccupied with paying $4 for a gallon of gas and avoiding foreclosure, or because they have Iraq fatigue,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, adding that The Times stays on the story as part of an implied contract with its readers.
 Other news editors have made the judgment -- perhaps prodded by falling revenue and slashed news budgets -- that public attitudes toward the war have become so calcified that few are interested in learning more. Why bother when things don't change? 
 Except that they do, in a heartbeat. Last Thursday, Steve and Linda Ellis of Baker City, Ore., held a funeral for their daughter, Army Cpl. Jessica Ann Ellis. Corporal Ellis, a 24-year-old combat medic, died May 11 in Baghdad, a victim of a roadside bomb during her second tour of Iraq. She had been injured just three weeks before in a similar attack, but chose to go back out. She was assigned to the Second Brigade Special Troops Battalion, Second Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division and had curly, unruly hair, which brought her the nickname ''Napoleon Dynamite'' early in her military career.
 More than 300 people gathered around this collective wound at St. Francis de Sales Cathedral, according to The Baker City Herald. In the funeral Mass, Bishop Thomas Connolly spoke plainly of her contribution.
 ''She was a good medic, well-trained and as brave as could be,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. 
 Hanging in the building where I work, there is a striking picture from the newspaper's archives (by Angel Franco, a New York Times photographer) of a young soldier in Arizona looking up into the eyes of her father, saying goodbye, her eyes shiny with love and fear. I look at the picture every day as I walk by and think of my 20-year-old twin girls, safe at college. The feeling of gratitude is always followed by guilt. My girls are out of harm's way, but what about that man's daughter? What about Ms. Ellis? 
 On Saturday, her parents received an e-mail message from one of the colleagues in Iraq she was charged with looking after. 
 ''There are wounds that don't show on the outside,'' he wrote. ''She gave me the best medicine for what I had -- hope and love.''
 In a phone call Sunday, Mr. Ellis set aside his grief to describe his loss and the loss to the country she served.
 ''She wanted to be there for her guys; she told us that,'' he said. ''She gave the largest sacrifice a person possibly could, selflessly, like she did every day of her life.''
 He added, ''Jessica was a child who had no care in the world, none, besides making you smile, besides making you feel better.''
 And although the Pentagon and the current administration will go to great lengths today to talk about the pride we should all feel in the fighting women and men of this country, increasingly onerous rules of engagement for the news media and the military make it difficult for the few remaining reporters and photographers to do their job: showing soldiers doing theirs.
 Yes, the message seems to be, we honor the dead, but do not show them in your pictures. Of course, we care deeply about the wounded, but you now need their signed permission to depict their sacrifice. As the number of reporters and photographers has gone down, the efforts to control those who remain have gone up.
 Ashley Gilbertson, a freelance photographer who has covered the war for Newsweek, Time and The New York Times and has written about covering the conflict in a book called ''Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,'' will be going back to Iraq in June. It will be his sixth time there, temperatures will range up to 130 degrees, and each time he has gone back there have been new restrictions.
 ''Many of my colleagues have turned away from the story because it has gotten to the point where they feel they just aren't going to get anything useful, which I completely understand,'' he said, adding that nonetheless, when the surge ends this summer, he wants to be there to chronicle what follows. 
 General Logan wrote long ago that both the glories and the consequences of war needed to be shared by all. He warned against ''the dangers of confining military knowledge to a comparatively small number of citizens, constituting the select few who may hold the destinies of the country in their hands.''

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing, at a Price

 BODY:
For years, officials in New Jersey have talked about the need for more affordable housing and then done almost nothing. The need is pressing, and the state may finally be ready to move. Unfortunately, this newfound resolve carries serious risks. Unless the state changes its current plan, some of the new housing will be built on the few parcels of undeveloped land that still remain. That must not be allowed to happen. 
 The conflict between two competing and legitimate needs -- low- and moderate-income housing and breathing room -- is a national problem. Anyone who drives into rural areas of Pennsylvania, New York and other northeastern states is struck by the number of houses mushrooming on what just a few years ago were huge stretches of farmland. 
 Under New Jersey's plan, which could take effect in October, one unit of affordable housing would have to be built for every five units of market-rate housing. The current required ratio is one for every eight. Commercial developers, meanwhile, would be required to provide one new affordable housing unit for every 16 jobs generated by commercial development. Both requirements could go a long way toward meeting the state's need for at least 115,000 new affordable housing units. 
 The downside is that the rules will put more pressure on rural towns to build housing: assigning them an ''obligation'' for new affordable units within their borders. That makes little economic sense. Many small towns offer no real job opportunities and no public transportation to places where the jobs exist. 
 There would be other pressures. As now happens in the suburbs, builders could use a rural town's affordable-housing obligation as cover for winning approval of projects containing many market-priced homes.
 The plan will also make it difficult for remote communities to shift their obligations to cities and suburbs that want more housing and can also provide jobs. 
 As much as more affordable housing is needed, it should not be built at the cost of further paving over an overdeveloped, overcrowded state like New Jersey. In this day of $4-a-gallon gasoline and clogged highways, it also makes no sense to build affordable housing in areas where the new residents would then have to drive 30, 40 or 50 miles just to get to their jobs.

HEADLINE: Donors Press Myanmar to Let Aid Workers In

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
Delegates from 52 donor nations meeting on Sunday in Myanmar pressed its government to make good on a promise to give foreign aid workers free access to millions of isolated cyclone survivors. 
 Leading the one-day meeting, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said that the government was ''moving fast in the right direction'' and that he was confident Myanmar would honor the pledge, made to him on Friday by the leader of its military junta, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. 
 Mr. Ban offered no details, according to reporters from news agencies who were permitted to accompany him in Myanmar. 
 ''There is good reason to hope that aid to the worst affected areas of Myanmar will increase significantly in the coming days,'' Mr. Ban said. 
 But he insisted that donors would need ''unhindered access to the areas hardest hit by the disaster,'' access that has been denied to most foreigners. 
 Several countries made preliminary pledges of more than $150 million in aid, The Associated Press reported, but most were contingent on gaining greater access. 
 Myanmar is asking for about $11 billion in reconstruction aid. 
 Asked at a news conference about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, whose year-to-year house arrest was expected to be extended soon, Mr. Ban said, ''We must think about people just now, not politics.'' 
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who is the symbol of her people's democratic aspirations, has been held under house arrest for 12 of the past 18 years. Until now, her freedom had been at the top of the agenda of the United Nations in its dealings with Myanmar. 
 Cyclone Nargis, which struck on May 3, left at least 134,000 people dead or missing. Three weeks later, only 23 percent of the two million people living in the hardest hit areas had been reached by aid, the United Nations said in a new assessment issued on Saturday. 
 Relief experts speak of a second disaster involving deaths from disease and lack of medical treatment should large-scale aid continue to be delayed. 
 In the first public comment by the government since the pledge to Mr. Ban, Myanmar's prime minister, Lt. Gen. Thein Sein, appeared to confirm the new policy on access. ''We would warmly welcome any assistance and aid which are provided with genuine good will from any country or organization, provided that there are no strings attached nor politicization involved,'' he said. 
 That invitation did not appear to include American, British and French naval ships that had been cruising off the Myanmar coast loaded with supplies, equipment and small boats. 
 The official news media in Myanmar has said no naval vessels would be permitted to deliver supplies. Over the past week, under an agreement with the government, American military aircraft have made 60 landings with relief supplies in Yangon, the country's main city, but Americans arriving with the deliveries have been confined to the airport. 
 Americans took part in the conference and were among the parties seeking greater access for their aid workers. 
 At least one United Nations aid agency, Unicef, said there were signs that its foreign workers would be allowed to travel to the hard-hit countryside as early as Monday. Like most foreigners, the Unicef employees have been confined to Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon. 
 Until now, the military has mostly insisted that all aid go through its hands and has even confiscated supplies from residents who tried to distribute it. 
 Like some other relief agencies, including the Red Cross, Save the Children and World Vision, Unicef has been able to deploy local staff members in the affected areas and to deliver supplies, mostly those already stockpiled in the country. 
 But the groups say that foreign experts would bring crucial knowledge and experience to a huge and complex task. 
 About 500 delegates from donor nations attended the conference, headed jointly by the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
 A point of contention between Myanmar and potential donors is the nature of the emergency. The government asserts that the emergency phase of recovery is over, and it is asking for economic assistance to rebuild shattered towns, rehabilitate contaminated rice fields and replace livestock swept away by the storm. 
 But hundreds of thousands of survivors remain stranded without help. Mr. Ban emphasized that their basic needs remained unmet and said that he expected the relief effort to last several months.
 The United States was prepared to offer much more than the $20.5 million it had already donated, said Scot Marciel, deputy assistant secretary of state for Southeast Asia. But he said further aid was contingent on improved access to the worst-hit areas.

HEADLINE: The White Working Class: Forgotten Voters No More

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Ruy Teixeira, a Democratic analyst of voting trends, wrote the book on the core issue in the endgame of the party's nomination fight. Its title is ''America's Forgotten Majority: Why the White Working Class Still Matters.''
 One might conclude that Mr. Teixeira is troubled by Senator Barack Obama's performance in recent primaries against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton among the voters known by nicknames like Joe Sixpack or Nascar Dad or Waitress Mom. 
 Actually, he is not.
 Mr. Obama, who leads the delegate count, ''is clocking in where he needs to be'' with white, working-class voters to win the White House in November, Mr. Teixeira said.
 Through most of the primaries, the constituencies supporting either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama have remained remarkably stable. While Mr. Obama, of Illinois, has energized young, African-American and affluent voters, his rival from New York has dominated among women, Hispanics, blue-collar whites and older voters. 
 Among white, working-class voters -- most commonly identified as those without a college degree -- Mrs. Clinton has won by 2 to 1 or better in states like Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama has fared better among less culturally conservative working-class whites in states like Oregon, where the environment is a central issue for voters. Still, Mrs. Clinton's claim that she is best positioned to win the ''hard-working Americans, white Americans'' has become the linchpin of her argument that she is more electable than Mr. Obama.
 But Mr. Teixeira, who is not backing either candidate, does not buy that argument. He dismisses intraparty contests as ''pretty poor evidence'' of whether Mr. Obama, as the Democratic nominee, could attract the blue-collar support he would need against Senator John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee. 
 No Majority Needed
 And how much blue-collar support would Mr. Obama need? Not a majority, said Mr. Teixeira. Though blue-collar Democrats once represented a centerpiece of the New Deal coalition, they have shrunk as a proportion of the information age-economy and as a proportion of the Democratic base. 
 Al Gore lost working-class white voters by 17 percentage points in 2000, even while winning the national popular vote. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts lost them by 23 points in 2004, while running within three points of President Bush over all. Mr. Teixeira suggests that Mr. Obama can win the presidency if he comes within 10 to 12 percentage points of Mr. McCain with these voters, as Democratic candidates for the House did in the 2006 midterm election.
 In recent national polls, that is exactly what Mr. Obama is doing. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Mr. Obama trailing by 12 percentage points with working-class whites; a poll by Quinnipiac University, showed him trailing by seven points. In each survey, Mr. Obama led over all by seven points.
 Democrats learned from Mr. Gore's Electoral College defeat that national polls are not everything. Mrs. Clinton's advisers point to states like Florida, where Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. McCain while Mr. Obama lags behind, as evidence that Mr. Obama's working-class weakness could prove decisive.
 Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agrees. He said recent focus groups among blue-collar whites in Florida, Michigan and Missouri found ''very significant'' resistance to Mr. Obama. He attributed that partly to racial attitudes, but more broadly to the cultural distance those voters felt from the liberal, Ivy League-educated candidate.
 Help From New Voters
 But Mr. Ayres concedes that resistance need not be fatal to Mr. Obama's candidacy. ''The question is whether they'll be counterbalanced by the new voters and young voters he brings in,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama's advisers, and some unaffiliated strategists, acknowledge that he would lose some working-class votes that Mrs. Clinton might receive should she somehow win over enough superdelegates to capture the nomination. But they insist the answer to Mr. Ayres is yes, Mr. Obama would attract other voters to offset those losses.
 In two states where Mrs. Clinton swamped Mr. Obama among working-class white voters, some recent surveys have shown him leading Mr. McCain. Is working-class resistance in Ohio and Pennsylvania going to be enough to prevent Mr. Obama from winning, asks Mark Mellman, an adviser to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and other Democratic politicians. ''I think the answer is, not.''
 Mr. Teixeira argues that Mr. Obama's standing with working-class whites may be artificially low in the wake of his skirmishing with Mrs. Clinton and the controversy over his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.
 ''Yes, he has a problem,'' Mr. Teixeira said. ''But it's a solvable problem.''

HEADLINE: After Years of Turmoil, Newsday Prepares for Another Owner

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Not so long ago, Newsday belonged to the front rank of American journalism. It reached far beyond its original role as chronicler of Long Island, covered news worldwide, undertook big reporting projects and even had the audacity to take on the New York City market. 
 But since 1995, a series of owners and managers has chipped away at Newsday's news budget and its mission, turning it into something smaller, more local and, in many ways, less ambitious -- a good regional newspaper.
 Now, as readers and Newsday journalists (past and present) contemplate a takeover by Cablevision -- the fourth distinct regime in 13 years -- they are debating whether this change means continued shrinkage, an infusion of new resources or something in between. 
 They note that Newsday has had the freedom to offer critiques of itself and its corporate parents, and they wonder if that kind of independence will continue. 
 Cablevision, controlled by the Dolan family, has never run a newspaper and has had prickly relations with the news media -- several reporters and editors tell tales of Cablevision executives going off the record just to tell them ''no comment.'' Newsday journalists wonder aloud whether the Dolans' declining to be interviewed after the $650 million purchase was announced early this month should be seen as an ill omen.
 ''This is not a journalism company,'' said Howard Schneider, who retired as Newsday's top editor in 2004. ''Do they understand the mission of a newspaper and what made this one great?''
 The experience at Newsday has been replicated across the country. In the last two years, buyers with no newspaper experience have taken over The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, and the Tribune Company, publisher of Newsday, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun, among many others. 
 In each case, they struggled financially, as the new owners found that the industry was far more troubled than they had expected, and harder to change than they had hoped.
 ''We're very aware of our inexperience with newspapers,'' Charles F. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, told shareholders last week. ''We plan to consult widely and seek advice from people'' who know the field.
 Cablevision executives have said that the newspaper and the company's cable system can promote each other and sell ads together, increasing subscriptions and revenue. Whether that means halting the bleeding of newsroom resources -- or even reversing it -- remains to be seen. 
 The company declined to comment for this article, and many employees of the paper declined to comment on the record for fear of offending their new bosses.
 Newsday is the sole major news outlet devoted primarily to Long Island, an affluent region of 2.8 million people.
 ''There's no question that Newsday dominates,'' said State Senator Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader of the Long Island faction in New York's Legislature. ''To get a story out, you need to get it in Newsday,'' and that has become harder with the newspaper's cutbacks, he said.
 Senator Skelos is one of the many powerful people and ordinary readers who have been frustrated by the absence of an alternative voice in Long Island affairs. The frustration has been most acute for conservatives.
 Unlike most papers, Newsday was born into newspaper royalty. Its founder, Alicia Patterson, was the daughter of Joseph Medill Patterson, founder of The Daily News in New York, who had also been a co-owner and publisher of The Chicago Tribune.
 Ms. Patterson married Harry F. Guggenheim, an heir to the famed mining fortune, who put up $750,000 to start a newspaper -- to keep his restless new wife busy, it was said. As editor in chief and publisher, she built Newsday, which began publishing in 1940, into the dominant voice of Long Island, a booming suburban region.
 Ms. Patterson died in 1963, and seven years later, Mr. Guggenheim sold the paper to the Times Mirror Company of Los Angeles, controlled by the Chandler family.
 For the next 16 years, David Laventhol was the driving force behind Newsday, first as the top editor and then as publisher. He hired more staff, inaugurated a Sunday paper, deepened the business report, and established overseas and domestic bureaus.
 In the mid-1980s, the paper created New York Newsday, a distinct edition for New York City readers, going head to head with The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times. It never turned a profit. It is impossible to imagine any newspaper company taking such a gamble now, said Richard Galant, a former managing editor of Newsday who retired this year.
 ''Newsday was so successful in the 1980s that it literally would turn away advertising because there was a limit; the paper could only print 256 pages a day,'' he said. ''It fueled the creation of New York Newsday, with the vision that Newsday would be expansionist, that no horizon was too broad.''
 Newsday became such a prolific breeder of journalistic talent -- led by columnists like Murray Kempton, Jimmy Breslin, Gail Collins and Jim Dwyer -- that other papers continually raided it. 
 If there was a peak in Newsday's life -- in journalism and popularity, if not in profit -- it arrived in the 1990s. Of the 19 Pulitzer Prizes the paper has won in its history, 8 were for work done from 1991 to 1996, including two for international reporting.
 It was not obvious then, but the era that had made it possible was already coming to an end. Otis Chandler, the Times Mirror chairman who had invested heavily in Newsday, stepped down in the 1980s, and relatives who were less interested in journalism began to gain influence. In 1993, Newsday's circulation began to drop sharply, making it harder to justify more losses. Mr. Laventhol, who had become president of Times Mirror, retired at the end of that year.
 A full break with the old regime arrived in 1995, when Mark H. Willes, a former executive of General Mills, became chief executive of Times Mirror. A few months later, Mr. Willes, dubbed ''the cereal killer'' in the company's newsrooms, put an end to New York Newsday.
 What remained was a strong and highly profitable paper, with a news staff of more than 500 and daily circulation above 500,000, but this new Times Mirror era would last only a few years. In 2000, the company was bought by the Tribune Company of Chicago, which had a more frugal culture and set about making cuts at its new properties.
 The 2001 recession and the industry's accelerating loss of readers and advertisers to the Internet led to more rounds of cuts. Then came the revelation that Newsday had been falsifying its circulation numbers, at least since 2000, by as much as 100,000 copies daily. 
 The scandal -- which the paper covered aggressively in its pages -- resulted in guilty pleas from several employees to criminal charges in 2006, refunds of millions of dollars to advertisers and the Tribune's realization that Newsday was neither as big nor as profitable as it had been led to believe. 
 ''The arc of this paper was one of expanding ambitions all the way up to 1995, and shrinking ever since then,'' said Mr. Schneider, the former editor, now the dean of the school of journalism at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ''When the Tribune Company came, there was hope that the ambition could return, that they would invest and we could start a new chapter and do new things with TV and the Web. But their philosophy, the changing times, the circulation scandal -- it all conspired against that.''
 Tribune eliminated Newsday's foreign bureaus and most of the jobs in its Washington bureau, among other cuts. The newsroom has a staff of more than 300 today, still among the biggest in a shrinking industry, and the paper's weekday circulation is about 380,000, 11th-highest in the country. Last year, it had an operating profit of more than $80 million on revenues of about $500 million.
 ''The paper has less reporting than it used to, and like a lot of people, I'm hopeful that will change because the Dolans are Long Islanders and they'll want to invest in it,'' said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller and a lifelong Long Islander. ''But no one knows.''

HEADLINE: Turning Schools From Death Traps Into Havens

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The potential for a modest school to survive a powerful earthquake is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in Balakot, Pakistan, one of hundreds of communities near the border with India shattered by a devastating tectonic jolt on Oct. 8, 2005. 
 About 80,000 people died in all, including 17,000 children in more than 7,000 schools that collapsed. Balakot, draped on a rugged hilltop, became a field of rubble. Out of several school buildings, the only one that remained standing was the one that had been reinforced two years earlier with a couple of extra columns and roof beams.
 Garry de la Pomerai, a British rescue expert who spent days seeking survivors amid wreckage in the region in the days after the quake, said he marveled at the surviving schoolhouse when he returned to tour the town on May 15, just three days after another devastating quake in a different part of the world left hundreds of children and staff members crushed in their classrooms.
 Mr. de la Pomerai was attending a long-planned international conference on school safety in Islamabad even as armies of rescuers were clawing at the remains of collapsed schools in China's Sichuan province. 
 ''I'm sick to death of going to schools where there are no survivors,'' Mr. de la Pomerai, 49, said in a telephone interview from the safety conference. ''That's the very future of a community.'' 
 After the Pakistan quake, he joined a growing international coalition of engineers, safety and community activists, earthquake experts and disaster agency officials trying to transform schools from death traps into havens when disaster strikes. 
 The movement really began in California in 1933, when 70 schools collapsed around Los Angeles in the so-called Long Beach earthquake and a mob sought to lynch a city school-building inspector. It was after hours when the quake occurred, and the inspector escaped the mob. But a month later the legislature passed what is now called the Field Act, a school earthquake-safety law with strict standards and penalties, requiring careful design and independently inspected construction.
 Since then, no student or teacher has been hurt during a quake in a school built under the Field Act's terms. And the cost of repairing damage to those schools has ranged from 10 to 100 times below repair costs for other schools, said Brian E. Tucker, an earth scientist and the founder of GeoHazards International, a group working to limit predictable losses in such calamities. Moreover, the quake-resistant schools cost only about 4 percent more than they otherwise would, he said. 
 In Balakot, new, sturdier school buildings -- built with the help of a Swiss development agency -- stand near the repaired surviving structure. But also nearby are the small graves of some of the children killed in 2005. 
 Despite progress in California and a few other places, including Bogota, Colombia, vulnerability prevails around the world's seismic hot spots, from the Pacific Northwest to the Philippines. 
 Pakistan has barely begun to deal with the threat. Mr. de la Pomerai, in a speech at the conference, noted that 80 percent of the country's quake-threatened schools remained unfortified. 
 In India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, a massive existing school-construction program -- producing about 30 new schools each day over the last several years -- has begun to incorporate earthquake-resistant features and training for 10,000 masons and more than 1,100 junior engineers. But 125,000 existing schools remain ''unsafe and in need of retrofit,'' according to a 2007 report from the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.
 The persistent vulnerability is not limited to remote regions of developing countries, but extends to the city centers of places as cosmopolitan as Portland, Ore., and Istanbul, both of which face looming seismic shocks. 
 Yumei Wang, the director of Oregon's geohazards team, said a quick evaluation last year found that 1,300 of the state's schools (housing 340,000 students) and emergency-services buildings had a ''high or very high'' risk of collapse in a substantial earthquake. 
 And the region faces the near-inevitable prospect of a great earthquake on the Cascadia fault, possibly a 9.0 -- 32 times more powerful than the 8.0-magnitude temblor in Sichuan. The last such quake there occurred in 1700, raising a tsunami potent enough to be recorded in Japan. 
 While money is slowly flowing to retrofitting programs in Oregon, Washington state and British Columbia, decades of work will be required to bolster all schools. ''We don't just need a few demonstration projects,'' Ms. Wang said. ''We have to start fixing dozens of buildings and then hundreds. Otherwise we're going to have this tremendous disaster and huge cleanup like you've seen in other places.''
 Retrofitting is advancing far faster in schools serving wealthier areas than those in poor ones, frustrating many earthquake experts. That pattern was revealed in some stricken Chinese cities. But it exists in Oregon as well, Ms. Wang said. ''The poor districts don't even know about this risk because they are struggling with everything else,'' Ms. Wang said. ''It's ugly to talk about, but there's this disparity. The rich school districts are getting better education, better textbooks, better sports -- and safer schools.''
 The main challenge in bolstering resilience to such geophysical shocks, Ms. Wang, Mr. Tucker and many other experts said, is not the structural engineering. There is no mystery to adding and securing iron rods in concrete, securing floors to beams, boosting the resilience of columns, monitoring the size of gravel mixed with cement. 
 It is not cost, either. In California, Dr. Tucker notes, the premium for building earthquake resistance into new schools is less than 4 percent. The payoff, beyond saved lives, is significantly lower repair costs after a temblor -- 10 to 100 times less than in unimproved buildings. (In poorer countries, the differential in cost could be substantially higher, other experts note, but the payoff, they say, is priceless.)
 Rich or poor, the big challenge lies in overcoming social and political hurdles that still give priority to pressing daily problems over foreseeable disasters that may not occur for decades, scores of years, or longer. In some developing countries there is a tendency to ascribe earthquakes and their consequences to fate, but Dr. Tucker and other experts say that lets the authorities off the hook. 
 ''I can't hold a government responsible for protecting its citizens against a meteorite falling out of the sky,'' Dr. Tucker said. ''But I can and do hold a government in a country with known seismic risk responsible for protecting its children, who are compelled to attend school, from the school collapsing during an earthquake.'' 
 Dr. Tucker has written or co-written a lengthening string of reports pointing to the building risks worldwide as more populations shift to urban areas, often into shoddy, hastily built structures, with children sent to schools in similar, and often worse, condition.
 Arthur Lerner-Lam, who maps disaster risks at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, agrees that urbanization in earthquake zones is setting the world up for its first true megadisaster -- a million-casualty earthquake that many seismologists say is only a matter of time. The greatest risk, he said, lies in a belt from Italy and Turkey through central Asia and the Himalayas into central China. 
 In such regions, Dr. Tucker said, the best blueprints and materials are no guarantee of safety without adequate building codes, laws, training, inspections and enforcement. 
 The biggest challenge of all may simply be redefining security, and building societies that demand that government investments match risks, said Fouad Bendimerad, an engineering and risk-management consultant in California and chairman of the Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative.
 ''The typical government spends around 15 percent of its G.D.P. to defend against exterior military threats that may never occur during the lifetime of generation,'' Dr. Bendimerad said. ''Why do we want to exonerate governments from dedicating a small portion of that 15 percent to protect against the threats of natural hazards that we know will happen?''

HEADLINE: Trying Again On a Coast That Defies Big Dreams

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: PACIFIC BEACH, Wash. 

 BODY:
Big Bold Dream No. 1 arrived on the cloudy coast of Washington State in 1905. It was called the Moclips Beach Hotel, 270 grand rooms at its peak, with a railroad depot and waves crashing beyond the veranda. Then the ocean washed it all away. 
 Half a century later came Big Bold Dream No. 2: Ocean Shores. Thousands of lots sold, many at $600 each, sight unseen. Pat Boone moved to town and hosted celebrity golf tournaments. Now? Ocean Sores, some call it, strip malls and sprawl. Beloved by some, but the Malibu of the Pacific Northwest it is not. 
 And so, on the clear and sunny Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, when summer unofficially began on beaches across the country, there was David Hughes, getting lost as he tried to deliver a sleeper sofa to 24 Primrose Lane, currently at the edge of construction in Big Bold Dream No. 3.
 ''This is weird,'' Mr. Hughes said.
 Without realizing that it was his destination, Mr. Hughes had arrived in Seabrook, or, as the decal on the white Jeep outside the sales office says, ''Washington's new authentic beach town.'' 
 Everywhere he turned, perfect porches led to perfect front doors and perfect neo-Nantucket bungalows. Adorable children pedaled past on charming old-fashioned bicycles, no parental supervision necessary in this safe setting. 
 This looked nothing like the rest of the ZIP code, which is anchored by Pacific Beach, a misty mix of recreational vehicles and military families taking leave behind the concrete-block walls and chain-link fences of a Navy resort.
 ''It's like a little Pleasantville,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''It's kind of creepy.''
 About 100 houses have been built in Seabrook, all of them set back across the highway from the beach, and 350 more are planned on about 100 acres. Small two-bedrooms start around $400,000 and larger houses near $1 million.
 Shops and a Main Street are still to come, as is a boutique hotel and an organic community garden. Trails have been cut through the woods leading to a beautiful, endless beach. In the evenings, hot tubs and s'mores over outdoor fire pits complete the postcard. 
 ''For me, this is about building a public place that will be here for generations,'' said Casey Roloff, who is developing Seabrook.
 Mr. Roloff is a disciple of New Urbanism, a place-making school that is centered around small lots in walkable villages that took off with the growth of Seaside, in the Florida Panhandle. He grew up in Vancouver, Wash., but spent several years living on the Oregon coast. There he built smaller New Urbanist-style developments, Bella Beach and Olivia Beach. 
 But the success of those projects only increased his ambition and gave him the resources to spend about $3 million buying timber land in Washington, with an eye toward transforming a coast that has long defied developers' dreams.
 ''This is my baby,'' said Mr. Roloff, 36. ''I was trying to figure out why people didn't go to the Washington coast, and basically it was the built environment.'' 
 Grays Harbor County, which includes Pacific Beach and Aberdeen, its largest city, has struggled for decades amid declines in the logging and fishing industries. The unemployment rate, while on the way down, is close to 7 percent.
 Outside of Ocean Shores, the coast here is scattered with motels, the occasional estate and a few newer subdivisions. But it is mostly trees and small beach towns like Moclips, where retired postal workers and maintenance men still own little houses right on the ocean. 
 The rise of Seabrook, about a three-hour drive from Seattle, has prompted sneers and some tension because of the upscale market it goes after. Its impact on the water and sewer system has been a point of dispute, too. 
 But the development has generally won praise from local officials and residents for bringing construction jobs, increased tourism, relatively gentle treatment of the land and a sense of validation among some who have long endured as much as 100 inches of annual rainfall and ripping winter winds here.
 ''A million dollars for a house that is not on the beach?'' said Kelly Calhoun, president of the Museum of the North Beach. ''We never expected that, not out here.''
 The sleeper sofa finally did make it to 24 Primrose Lane. Dr. Rich Krug, a surgeon from Olympia, chased down the wayward delivery truck on one of those old bicycles and provided directions. He had rented a place in Moclips a couple of years back and had seen Seabrook shortly after construction began in 2004.
 ''My first thought was, 'Who is the nut job who is doing this?' '' said Dr. Krug, 40. ''If you can't see the broader vision, you just see a few fancy-looking houses going up in the woods in a depressed area on the opposite side of the water. You think, 'Who is going to buy those things?' ''
 One answer turned out to be Dr. Krug; his wife, Darla; and their five young children. Mr. Roloff walked them around Seabrook last summer, and they soon spent about $800,000 on a three-bedroom vacation home with a separate mother-in-law suite. They moved in this past weekend.
 ''I'm a zealot; it's the zeal of the converted,'' Dr. Krug said. ''Part of my zeal is it's so different from what's been done to this coastline so far. 
 ''It's a little bit like a religious movement,'' he said, ''but I try to modulate my enthusiasm to not come off too much like a cult member.''

HEADLINE: Montana Dam Is Breached, Slowly, to Restore a Superfund Site

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: MILLTOWN, Mont. 

 BODY:
Milltown Dam, a symbol of industrial progress that became a symbol of destruction, was recently breached, and two parts of the Clark Fork River were joined again.
 There was no dynamite, no wrecking balls, no ''blow and go'' removal. Instead, an earthen dam blocking a specially built channel was removed to allow a small trickle of water to flow through and gradually grow larger. The main part of the dam will be demolished over two years. 
 When the project is complete, it will cost $120 million. 
 Taking out the 1908 structure is the thorniest part of one of the largest toxic waste cleanups in the country, in what is known as the Clark Fork Basin Superfund Complex. The slow-motion breach at the end of March was intended to minimize the effects of releasing of sediment contaminated with heavy metals captured behind the dam. 
 ''The slower it goes, the better,'' said Sandy Olsen, head of the remediation division in the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. ''It's not as dramatic. But there are fewer and less intense impacts on the fish.''
 Last fall, the reservoir was lowered and workers removed 700,000 cubic yards of sediment behind the dam. An additional 1.5 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment is still to be removed. 
 ''We had to do it slowly because we had to control the scour,'' said Matt Fein, who oversaw the project for Envirocon, an environmental remediation business in Missoula. A high volume of rushing water would have scoured the remaining tons of toxic debris and other sediment off the river bottom and sent it downstream to choke the river and kill fish. 
 The river, the largest in Montana, flows through Missoula, a few miles downstream, and eventually into Idaho. It is a prized trout fishery.
 To allow the slow removal, water was diverted to a new course. As the redirected flow churned up uncontaminated sediment, it was blended with clean water flowing over the dam. An estimated 300,000 tons of sediment will move downriver in the next few months, much of it in the spring runoff. Three million tons of uncontaminated sediment will flush downriver in coming years. 
 In the next two years, contractors will dismantle the rest of the 28-foot-high dam near the confluence of the Blackfoot River and the Clark Fork. 
 The river is being monitored to gauge how the breaching affects fish. Eventually, the river should be cleaner, which should help the fish, including the threatened bull trout. 
 ''There are about 500 fish per mile,'' said David Schmetterling, a biologist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. ''Once the river is restored, we could see twice as many fish.''
 In March, one of 15 trout fitted with transmitters in their stomachs swam through the site of the old dam and upriver 10 miles, one of the first fish to make the run from below the dam in a century. 
 Since the 1860s, when mining began, mineral- and arsenic-laden waste -- arsenic was used to separate metal from rock -- from the Butte mines 120 miles south, atop the Continental Divide, has flowed into the headwaters of the Clark Fork. 
 Flooding, especially a ferocious incident months after the dam was completed in 1908, sent tons of arsenic, copper and other heavy metals into the river. 
 The last stop for most of the waste, though, was at this dam. Six million cubic yards of mine waste gathered behind it and backed up on the flood plain. 
 In 1981, officials discovered that water backed up behind the dam had forced the arsenic into nearby groundwater and contaminated wells in the settlement of Milltown, home to several dozen residents. The area was listed as a federal Superfund site in 1983.
 Although the sediment has very low levels of arsenic, the arsenic has leached into the groundwater over decades. Since last October, workers have been loading waste on a 45-car train, hauling it 90 miles up river each day to a small town called Opportunity and dumping it into an existing waste site. 
 The additional 1.5 million cubic yards will be removed through 2009. The other waste has been stabilized and will be left in place. 
 All told, enough sediment -- a fine-grained clay -- will be removed to fill 679 Olympic-size swimming pools. After the dam is removed, more tailings along the river upstream will be reclaimed. 
 In some places, the ground is turquoise from high levels of copper from the mines. ''It might take 12 or 15 more years to finish the Clark Fork,'' said John Wardell, regional director of the Environmental Protection Administration. 
 The water in the reservoir dropped 14 feet when the dam was breached. As the water flows again, officials estimate it will take 4 to 10 years for the wells to be flushed clean. 
 Officials planned the release before spring runoff, when flows were low. Biologists from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks have placed trout in cages above and below the dam to see whether copper and arsenic concentrations would become lethal. So far, the fish have survived.
 Many residents doubted that an effort would be made to cleanse the area. ARCO, the oil company that is now BP-ARCO, bought the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1977 and inherited the clean-up bill. Metal produced from the mine was negligible, and ARCO closed it in 1983.
 Officials contended that the mine waste was better left in place. But in February 1996, a 14-foot-thick ice jam careered down river, leading to fears that it would take out part of the dam and unleash layers of waste. 
 The Montana Power Company, which owned the dam then, hastily drew down the water. The ice, no longer floating, was stranded just above the dam. 
 But the sudden release of water scoured a four-foot-thick layer of heavy metals off the river bottom and sent it over the dam and downstream.
 A result, officials said, was a huge fish kill. The next spring, biologists counted the number of catchable rainbow trout and found that the fish had decreased nearly two-thirds. 
 ARCO has spent nearly $1 billion cleaning up all the Anaconda properties. 
 As big as the Superfund cleanup here is, residents hope it is the beginning of a trend. 
 ''There's 150,000 abandoned mine sites and tens of thousands of miles of logging road in Montana,'' said former Representative Pat Williams, who works at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West, a research organization. ''This project can be the epitome of a new restoration economy in this state.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 29, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the breaching of a dam on the Clark Fork River in Montana as part of a toxic waste cleanup misstated the reason that arsenic-laden waste is found in the river. The waste comes from naturally occurring arsenic in the ore minerals that have been mined in the area over the years; arsenic was not used by miners to separate metal from rock.

HEADLINE: Foreign Markets Diverge on Concerns About Oil and U.S.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
European stock markets edged higher Monday and Asian markets fell amid worries about high oil prices and the United States economy on a day when American markets were closed for Memorial Day. 
 Major stock market indicators edged up in Germany and France, but the main market gauges fell more than 2 percent in Japan and Hong Kong after the Chinese government announced an overhaul of its telecommunications sector.
 Crude oil futures, which rose to a record above $135 a barrel last week, were trading above $133 a barrel in electronic trading on Monday after militants in Nigeria said they had destroyed an oil pipeline and killed 11 soldiers. The government said none of its troops had died.
 In Germany, the DAX index rose 0.14 percent to close at 6,953.84 points with Merck KGaA, the producer of drugs and crystals used in liquid-crystal displays, rising more than 2 percent.
 Automobile stocks like Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen posted declines after crude oil prices rose. 
 The July contract for light crude was up 94 cents, to $133.13 a barrel, in electronic trading by late afternoon in Europe. There was no floor session on the New York Mercantile Exchange due to the holiday.
 Shares of Daimler lost 1.13 percent, Volkswagen fell 0.86 percent and BMW shares dipped 0.37 percent.
 In France, the CAC-40 index rose 0.08 percent to close at 4,937.84, led by the power companies Gaz de France and Suez, both of which won court approval on Friday to pursue a merger. Shares of Gaz de France were up more than 2 percent while Suez shares rose nearly 1.5 percent.
 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 2.3 percent, to 13,690.19.
 ''What underlined selling was ongoing concern over inflation as oil prices still remained very high,'' said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC in Tokyo.
 Hong Kong shares were dragged down by a plunge in China Mobile, the mainland's largest mobile service provider, on worries about increased competition after China announced that it was revamping its telecommunications sector. The Hang Seng index fell 2.4 percent to 24,127.31.
 Traders said turnover has been relatively low lately, indicating trade would remain sluggish in the near future, as oil prices are likely to climb further and the United States economy slows.
 ''Trading is sluggish, as there's no clear picture for both local and regional markets,'' said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities.
 China Mobile shares tumbled 8.2 percent. China's three other Hong Kong-listed telecom operators -- China Unicom, China Netcom and China Telecom -- are also involved in the revamping, but remained suspended from trading Monday.
 On the Chinese mainland, the Shanghai benchmark index fell to a one-month low on renewed worries over further monetary tightening. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell 108.55 points, or 3.1 percent, to 3,364.54, the lowest since April 23.
 Financial shares were among the worst hit, with Industrial & Commercial Bank of China sinking 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Helping Prisoners Re-enter Society

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Second Chance'' (editorial, May 20):
 Most re-entry efforts focus on prison inmates, yet about nine million people cycle annually through our country's jails. This is roughly 10 times the number who leave prisons. 
 Jail inmates generally return to their communities after short incarcerations, bringing with them a higher incidence of communicable diseases and mental health conditions than exists in the general population. 
 Left untreated, these problems add to society's health burden, emergency room costs and municipal budgets. They also increase the likelihood that inmates will commit new offenses and return to jail again, at public expense.
 Jails are required to provide health care to inmates. This mandate creates an opportunity to support re-entry efforts. By linking inmates with community-based doctors, whom they can continue seeing after release, jails can stabilize inmates' health and help improve the health and safety of the community.
 The Second Chance Act is a welcome step. We can do more to support jail inmates by remembering that they are part of our communities and by providing them with community-based health care during incarceration. 
 Keith Barton South Londonderry, Vt., May 20, 2008
 The writer, a physician, is medical director of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services in Oakland, Calif.
 To the Editor:
 Financing of the Second Chance Act will support useful services to support the transition from prison to community. But these services must also be accompanied by removal of conflicting and counterproductive policies that stand in the way of community reintegration. 
 For example, while New York State allocated $3.1 million to assist re-entry efforts this year, the same budget projects an estimated $40 million in revenues from fees and surcharges imposed on people convicted of crimes, 80 percent of whom are indigent. 
 This crushing debt will leave releasees unable to acquire employment and housing, reverting to a life of crime that jeopardizes the community safety. 
 If New York is truly committed to public safety and reintegration, it must stop using financial penalties that undermine the intent of legislation like the Second Chance Act. 
 Marsha Weissman Executive Director Center for Community Alternatives New York, May 22, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial prompts me to note several aspects of New York's second-chance philosophy. 
 As The Times has noted, four upstate prisons are being kept open, fully staffed, costing taxpayers $33 million a year, during tough fiscal times and when the prison population is down by 8,000 people over the last decade. That money could be better used for re-entry programs, lessening recidivism, bolstering the upstate economy, and a real battle against crime. 
 We would never staff a school without students or a hospital without patients. Let's use criminal justice resources to reduce crime.

HEADLINE: Soaring Fuel Prices Take a Withering Toll on Truckers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
As his logging business expanded in the pine and hardwood forests of eastern Georgia, Jesse Hendley got into trucking. He scraped together the cash gradually to acquire seven tractor-trailers so that he could not only sell timber to mills in the south, but also charge the mills for delivery. 
 Today, though, all seven rigs are parked. The soaring price of diesel fuel -- over $4.50 a gallon from $2.50 a year ago -- has stripped the profit from hauling. 
 If diesel prices do not decline and make that side of the business viable, Mr. Hendley says, he will have to sell his trucks, or try to sell them. That is just what thousands of other truckers are doing as they shed used rigs in what appears to be the biggest shakeout since trucking was deregulated in 1980. 
 ''Most truckers are one major breakdown -- a broken axle or a damaged engine -- away from bankruptcy,'' said Mr. Hendley, who laid off his last driver this month and turned to independent operators to ship his logs. 
 The squeeze on truckers' profits from rising fuel costs is compounded by the slowing economy, which is reducing freight traffic. Truckers say they find it hard to impose fuel surcharges, in part because their industry has suffered for years from over-capacity as deregulation drew thousands of small operators into trucking. 
 John Seibert, a research analyst at the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, said ''that a company seeking to ship something can put a load on a dock and some trucker will come by and pick it up, accepting the offered rate.''
 Like the truckers, air freight operators are being hurt by higher fuel costs, although less so. But railroads, the third pillar in the nation's freight infrastructure, have so far sidestepped losses, the Association of American Railroads reports. That is partly because of rising exports of coal and grain, which travel by rail to port cities, and partly because some trucking companies have turned to rail to move trailers long distances. 
 ''By using railroads, we are achieving some economy on fuel,'' said Dan England, chairman of C. R. England, a family-owned company based in Salt Lake City that runs 3,600 tractor-trailers and now regularly loads 350 of the trailers on railroad flat cars to get them from, say, Chicago to Los Angeles. 
 Still, 70 percent of the nation's freight tonnage moves over the highways on trucks, much of it in the diesel-powered tractor-trailers of the nation's 350,000 independent operators, each with a fleet of up to five vehicles, one usually driven by the proprietor. Profit margins, notoriously thin in good times, are minuscule now, and each rise in fuel prices pushes more truckers into the red.
 More than 45,000 vehicles, or 3 percent of the tractor fleet, have disappeared from the highways since early last year, according to America's Commercial Transportation Research in Columbus, Ind. That surpasses the last great shakeout, in the early 1980s, when deregulation, along with a recession, high interest rates and the second Arab oil embargo, took out 33,000 tractors.
 While small operators like Mr. Hendley, of Millen, Ga., appear to be bearing the brunt of the damage, carriers with at least five trucks are also going out of business at an accelerating pace. In the first quarter, 935 of these larger operators shut down, the American Trucking Association reports, up from 385 a year earlier and the highest quarterly failure rate since the 2001 recession. 
 ''There are so many used trucks in dealer lots now that some of the larger dealers have stopped buying them,'' said James McCormack, whose Web site, www.truckertotrucker.com, markets used trucks. ''From what dealers tell me, exports have become their best outlet, particularly to Russia.''
 His own site listed 1,250 new ads in April from owner-operators, up from 900 in March and 450 a year earlier. Many of the owners are no longer able to lay out $1,100 to fill a 250-gallon fuel tank, which they often need to do two or three times a week. The increased outlay for fuel more than eats up the earnings of many small operators once they meet their truck loan payments and pay for insurance, maintenance, tires and the like. 
 ''If the prices asked are low enough,'' Mr. McCormack said of the advertised trucks, ''dealers will pick up single units and resell them.'' 
 Trucks are also going abroad. Nearly 24,000 used, over-the-highway tractors have been exported since early last year, the Commerce Department reports, or nearly three times the number in 2006. The weakness of the dollar makes the prices more attractive to foreigners and less so to potential domestic buyers. 
 The nation's air cargo carriers are also paring their operations somewhat. Northwest Airlines, for example, dedicated 13 giant 747-200's to carrying freight between the United States and the Far East, a business that brought in $840 million, or 7 percent of the airline's total revenue last year. The price of jet fuel, however, has risen faster than freight rates, and Northwest recently shrank its cargo fleet to 12 planes. 
 The airline also dropped cargo service to Singapore and Bangkok, the least profitable markets, said Ben Hirst, a senior vice president, and soon will pull out of Taipei and Guangzhou, China. 
 ''We are seeing demand falling while fuel costs have gone up faster than we can raise rates to cover them, despite 20 surcharges,'' Mr. Hirst said.
 United Parcel Service notes a shift to slower and less expensive ground shipments from air cargo. ''People are trading down because of our numerous fuel surcharges,'' said Norman Black, a U.P.S. spokesman.
 Adding surcharges that keep up with fuel prices is hardest for small truckers. Until the deregulation of interstate trucking, the government kept shipping rates high enough to cover trucking costs, while limiting the number of truckers. After deregulation, thousands of trucks were purchased, largely on credit, by individuals who gambled that freight rates would stay high enough to cover their costs -- loan payments, insurance, tires, repairs, food on the road, Social Security taxes, tolls, accountants and fees to brokers who obtain loads.
 In time, fleets of fewer than 10 trucks, with the proprietor often driving one, carried much of the nation's highway cargo. 
 ''It's the Horatio Alger myth,'' said Michael H. Belzer, a professor of industrial relations at Wayne State University and an ex-trucker. ''These are people who want to be their own bosses in an occupation that is not always economically rational.''
 That marginal viability -- rewarding owner-operators and many employed drivers with incomes that, even in good times, are less than $40,000 a year for 80 hours a week on the road -- is now disappearing. The lumber mills paid Mr. Hendley $3.25 a mile to bring his logs from the forests. But diesel fuel, which had eaten up 25 percent of this revenue, in the end consumed 59 percent -- not enough, he said, to cover other expenses and profit. 
 The large carriers -- J. B. Hunt, Yellow Freight, C. R. England and others -- with fleets in the thousands, have efficiencies beyond the reach of the small truckers. They can minimize, for example, the number of miles a truck runs empty en route to a cargo without collecting revenue. In addition, England runs refrigerator trucks, a specialty that commands higher shipping rates.
 Even so, the surge in diesel fuel prices is eating steadily into profits. At England, for every dollar of revenue, 96 cents now goes to costs, up from 92.8 cents last year and 90.8 cents in 2006.
 ''We are going to each customer and asking them individuallyto agree to pay more,'' Mr. England said. ''This is new for us.''
 Dan Little of Carrollton, Mo., does not have that much bargaining power. At 49, he has been a trucker for 30 years, driving one of the three trucks in his fleet himself and hiring drivers for the others. His rigs go empty to the Southeast, where they pick up underweight cattle and deliver them to Texas and Kansas, to be fattened for slaughter.
 The roundtrip, half of it without a load, was bringing Mr. Little $2,100. When fuel costs rose early this year, he sold one rig for $20,000 and gave up the lease on the other. Paying the drivers had eliminated his profit.
 Then on April 1, Mr. Little decided to park the truck he drove, falling back on the $1,200 a month that his wife, Barbara, earns helping handicapped children. ''I just got fed up with being broke,'' he said, ''or braking an axle, as I did on one trip to Georgia, and ending up losing $300.''
 He got other owner-operators to join him in a trucker protest movement -- one in which a parade of drivers in tractor-trailers recently converged on Capitol Hill in Washington, seeking relief through Congress. 
 Mr. Seibert, whose Independent Drivers Association includes as members many of the protesters, said the drivers ''think that government should not permit a situation in which the market does not pay them for their work.'' He added, ''It would seem that they are demanding a return to some form of regulation.''

HEADLINE: Small Businesses on Discount

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
To all the usual reasons that small businesses are put up for sale -- personal problems and personnel squabbles among them -- add economic woes this year. But even as for-sale listings rise around the country, so is buyer interest.
 ''When economic times get tough and people can't find a job, they will go out and buy a job,'' said Ronald W. Hottes, president of the Business Team, a broker in Torrance, Calif. 
 The problem, though, for owners seeking to sell their businesses is that prices appear to be softening -- a reflection of a variety of causes, among them tighter credit markets, rising costs and fewer customers.
 The country's largest listing site, bizbuysell.com, has 50,000 businesses for sale -- up from 43,000 this time last year, said Michael K. Handelsman, the site's general manager. The number of businesses being sold also rose, to 1,795 listings that closed in the first quarter of this year, a 66 percent increase from 1,081 sales in the same quarter of 2007.
 In Gaithersburg, Md., mill3nnium.com reported that businesses for sale on its site had surged in the last year. The site focuses on the metropolitan Washington area, and one reason for the surge was a decline in customers. Those businesses included delis, dry cleaners, dollar stores and gas stations. 
 ''We have 80 to 100 listings, double the number we had last year,'' said the site's owner, Moses A. Zuniga. ''Every business is hurting.''
 Such sites can give only a snapshot of the market, Mr. Handelsman acknowledged, because ''when a listing is removed, we always check to see if it sold, but the broker doesn't always tell us.''
 Several brokers say that buyers typically are people who are retiring and looking for a second act or laid-off corporate executives looking for a business to run.
 Retirement, illness, divorce, death -- and simple burnout -- still drive the majority of owners to sell, but in the rocky economy, some otherwise solid businesses are now having a hard time. Their owners decide they cannot hold out for better times, so they sell for less, business brokers say. 
 A decline in revenue was one reason that Richard Lightowler decided to sell the family's retail nursery in West Linn., Ore., in January. When he took over the Willamette General Store from his parents in early 2007, he said, he evaluated the business. He said he found it difficult to manage the adjacent nursery, which specializes in ponds and pond supplies, as well as the store's growing business in expensive Traeger barbecue grills.
 So he decided to sell the decade-old nursery, which had been bringing in $150,000 annually several years ago. Business had slipped even though nurseries generate higher margins than the hardware, barbecue supplies and food that are the core items at the blue-and-white clapboard general store, he said.
 ''A few years ago -- based on how it was doing then -- I could have gotten $50,000 for the nursery,'' said Mr. Lightowler, 40. ''But I had to ask less, about $40,000, and accept $33,000.''
 Phillip L. Beukema, of Luxemburg, Wis., who recently sold his online business, Corporate Apparel Unlimited, may have been luckier in his timing. Over the last eight years, he and his family built the company, which sells promotional items like T-shirts on 13 Web sites, with some 25,000 clients, and recorded $2.8 million in sales in 2006.
 Then he and his wife, Charla, both 55 years old, decided last August that they wanted to retire. So last fall he listed the company with a business broker, Cornerstone Business Services, in nearby Green Bay, and the transaction -- he did not disclose the sales price -- closed on Feb. 15. 
 The price, said Mr. Beukema, a former college dean, would probably have been less if he had tried to sell this year.
 ''As the subprime situation hit last year, we noticed about a 10 percent slide in orders,'' he said. ''So if we had put it on the market in January, the asking price would have been in jeopardy. I don't think we could have gotten the same figure for it.''
 Pinpointing what is happening to sales prices nationwide is difficult because data is diffuse and unreliable. It is possible to advertise nationally on a Web site, but the buying and selling of most small businesses remains local. And most transfers of small businesses are between individuals, who are not required to register such transactions.
 But both listing sites and brokers around the country say that sellers have become more flexible about price. In a survey by the International Business Brokers Association of its 2,000 members, nearly 73 percent predicted that 2008 would be a buyer's market. The survey was released in January. 
 Cress S. Diglio Sr., the association's chairman and president of Corporate Investment International, which is based in Orlando, Fla., said that ''this year the number of sellers will easily outpace the number of qualified buyers.''
 One reason is that a crucial small business financing tool, home equity lines of credit, has been drying up as house values fall. Traditionally, small businesses have had a hard time obtaining commercial credit, and that is worsened in rough economic times, several brokers said.
 ''A year ago, people were using home equity loans,'' Mr. Hottes said. ''And now they are drawing down their 401(k)s.''
 Sellers -- who historically have provided financing to sell their small businesses -- are doing so more than ever, said Julie Gordon White, chief executive officer of BlueKey Business Brokerage in Point Richmond, Calif. 
 Even so, an unpleasant truth is that many, if not most, businesses do not sell. For decades, the conventional wisdom was that brokers sold about one out of five businesses they listed. But a new study by Louis O. Vescio, owner of Sunbelt Business Brokers in Melbourne, Fla., found that the percentage was only 10.5 percent.
 The main reason, Mr. Vescio and others said, was that ''most small business owners keep bad records,'' so buyers cannot get an accurate financial picture. 
 Confidentiality can also hamper sales, brokers said.
 ''It's not like a house where you want everyone to know it's for sale,'' said Mr. Diglio, who has been in the business for two decades. ''You don't want employees, customers or competitors to know you are selling.''

HEADLINE: Spoleto U.S.A. Forecasts Higher Costs And Deficit

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., after a decade of economic health, has hit hard times.
 Festival officials released financial figures at a board meeting open to the news media on Monday. They projected a $292,000 deficit for this season, a number that could be much larger without the release of money from a rainy-day fund. 
 ''It will be remembered as the year we went back into the red,'' said Carlos Evans, the treasurer. 
 The officials cited a number of reasons: a drop in money from corporate donors, including a real-estate company that has taken a big hit in the subprime mortgage crisis; the loss of about $250,000 in state money because of budget cuts; the weak dollar, which makes it more expensive to pay foreign artists; and higher transport costs because of the price of oil. The total budget is forecast at $8.7 million. On the plus side Mr. Evans pointed out that the festival had run an operating deficit of $3 million a decade ago, and that since then its net worth, including the endowment, had risen to $21 million.
 Higher expenses also came from mounting ''Monkey: Journey to the West,'' the spectacular ''circus opera'' by Chen Shi-Zheng, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Budget figures showed that ''Monkey'' is projected to cost $1.3 million, compared with $342,000 spent on its slot last year. The extra expense was covered by using a rainy-day fund of $1.4 million. 
 ''Monkey'' was expensive in part because of its large cast and the need to rebuild the set to fit inside the Sottile Theater. Organizers also publicly discussed for the first time at this festival how ''Monkey'' came to be here. It was a last-minute addition after the collapse in December of an agreement by the Gate Theater in Dublin to send over its production of ''Sweeney Todd.''
 There were disagreements over the staging of ''Sweeney,'' said Nigel Redden, the Spoleto Festival's general director. In addition, the music director took another job, and one of the actors withdrew for family reasons. So the director pulled out, and the actress playing Mrs. Lovett quit because of that. ''The whole thing unraveled,'' he said. ''We felt that we had to have something to round out the festival.''
 After a week's scramble, agreement was quickly reached to bring in ''Monkey,'' which had been commissioned in part by the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris. The Chatelet waived its fee, Mr. Redden said. 
 ''Basically 'Monkey,' I think, was an expensive choice but a very good one,'' he said, adding that it was expected to sell out.

HEADLINE: More Travelers, Costlier Oil, And More Commotion

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE airlines are running out of ways to squeeze money out of passengers, now that they have jacked up fares all year and slapped extra charges on checked bags.
 What next? Pay toilets? Or how about this: Oxygen masks that drop down to offer passengers better air in those cramped, smelly cabins. The oxygen masks are already bundled overhead for emergencies. So just hook them to seatback credit card scanners. One swipe of the American Express card and bingo, you're in a meadow in springtime rather than in some foul 737 circling Dallas.
 Seriously folks, we're in a fix, us and the airlines. Passengers can grouse about airline management all we want, but the jig really is up. With oil at $130 a barrel, airline losses mounting, and most of the realistic revenue-raising ideas exhausted, all the airlines can do is to shrink the system and hope for the best. 
 Thus airlines are now steadily reducing domestic seating capacity. Industry analysts say that the domestic system needs to shrink by about 20 percent this year compared with last year -- at a time when most flights are already taking off full. 
 ''I see spreading panic in the front offices of airlines. But this is not a time to panic, it is a time to think,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group aviation consultancy. 
 There's a lot to ponder. How much more can fares be raised before demand drops even below the capacity of a shrunken system? How many annoying new fees can be added before customers push back harder than the market can bear?
 After all the major airlines, and a few low-cost carriers, announced a $25 charge for the second checked bag for most coach passengers, American Airlines raised the stakes and said it would begin charging $15 for the first checked bag.
 The extra bag charges are now starting to appear at airports as summer peak season bears down. That is incremental revenue, certainly. But what about the added commotion? After all, curbside skycaps and terminal ticket clerks have to collect that money and make change. Lines inevitably grow. 
 And more passengers certainly will try to cram even more into carry-on bags -- adding one more brick to the load for flight attendants who already struggle mightily to fit everything into overhead bins. So the cumbersome task of getting everyone seated for takeoff now becomes more challenging.
 ''Airlines need to realize that they have to get the customer on their side, and you don't do that by making them line up longer at the counter checking bags,'' said Mr. Boyd.
 Every business traveler I know understands that the airlines are not intended to operate profitably at oil prices anywhere near $130 a barrel, incidentally. Fares undoubtedly will rise. 
 But ''nickel and diming'' customers is counterproductive, argued Mr. Boyd. Like many other industry analysts, he thinks airlines need to come to terms better with the huge costs of a delay-riddled system, and to plan more intelligently to dig themselves out of it.
 Last week, the majority staff of the Joint Economic Committee in Congress issued a report that underscored the second biggest problem in air travel, after oil prices. That is the extra costs on airlines imposed by an air transportation system that has not been able to cope with demand for years.
 Last year, ''air traffic delays raised airlines' operating costs by $19 billion,'' counting fuel, crew, maintenance and other costs incurred by planes circling and waiting to land or sitting at gates or on tarmacs beyond departure times, the report said.
 Officially, about a quarter of all flights arrived late last year. But airlines routinely build extra time into the schedule for many flights, which ''significantly underestimates the problem,'' the report said.
 There are no easy answers. Mr. Boyd says airlines need to fix inefficient internal flight operations systems, while passengers need to insist politically that the national air traffic control system gets fixed. 
 Imposing annoying extra fees for marginal revenue ''just makes it harder for the rest of us to do business,'' he said, adding: ''I understand it's crisis time for the airlines, but when you panic in a crisis, you're doomed.''

HEADLINE: Polishing for the Inauguration

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
A half dozen or so hotels in Washington are undergoing extensive renovations, in part to take advantage of business related to Inauguration Day. This is good news for executives visiting the city, for any reason.
 Two Holiday Inns recently have been rebranded, upgraded and reopened as Thompson and Affinia hotels, while many top luxury hotels, including the Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton, Washington, are undergoing multimillion-dollar facelifts. In addition, a $100 million renovation of the Marriott Wardman Park, a convention hotel that is the city's largest, was completed in January.
 Experts say these changes not only mirror what is happening in the hotel industry nationally, but also reflect a growing sophistication in Washington as a travel destination. 
 The latest renovations and upgrades ''are par for the course,'' said Jan D. Freitag, a vice president of Smith Travel Research, a lodging research company. ''The last couple of years have been very good to hotel owners, so they have money in the bank to spend.''
 ''With a perceived downturn in the economy, the question is how do you keep your hotel attractive to potentially dwindling travelers? That necessitates a renovation,'' he added.
 Michael MacNair, a travel management consultant based in Alexandria, Va., who is helping to plan travel for the campaign of John McCain, also attributes the hotel renovations and upgrades to a ''significant revitalization'' of Washington, and to the strength of government consulting business.
 ''When I got here 25 years ago,'' Mr. MacNair said, ''there was the basic Hilton and the basic Sheraton, with no personality. Now, people's tastes have diversified. The average business traveler is looking for a unique experience, and hotels are transforming their product to deliver it.'' 
 Another factor behind the renovations, according to Bill Hanbury, chief executive of Destination DC, the city's convention and tourism corporation, is the increase in international visitors to Washington, both for business and pleasure. The city estimates there will be 1.15 million foreign visitors in 2008, up from one million in 2007. 
 Increasing competition from new hotels in suburban Washington has added to the pressure in the District of Columbia. Kimpton, which has seven boutique hotels in the district, is expanding in suburban Virginia, while Gaylord Hotels opened a 2,000-room convention hotel in Prince George's County, Md., in April.
 The inauguration, of course, is the icing on the cake. The event ''puts the city on the map worldwide,'' said Adriaan Radder, general manager of the Ritz-Carlton, Washington. ''Every hotel benefits from the huge demand and has the opportunity to drive higher revenues than would be generated otherwise.'' 
 Some of the greatest change has come in the high-end segment. The 28-year-old Four Seasons at Pennsylvania Avenue and M Street Northwest is undergoing a $40 million renovation, scheduled to be completed by December, that includes a new lobby restaurant, the addition and expansion of guest rooms and the addition of a fifth presidential suite. 
 The eight-year-old Ritz-Carlton at 22nd and M Streets Northwest is undergoing a $12 million facelift. Eric Ripert, chef of the New York fish restaurant Le Bernardin, opened the Westend Bistro at the hotel last fall. The hotel's newly renovated club lounge and suites have more contemporary, lighter decor; guest rooms are now being similarly refurbished.
 The St. Regis, occupying a 1926 Italian Renaissance-style building at 16th and K Streets Northwest, reopened in January after a $52.5 million renovation, which includes a refurbished lobby, spa and guest rooms.
 Thompson Hotels opened the Donovan House, a luxury boutique hotel, in March in the former Holiday Inn at 14th and M Streets Northwest. It has undergone a renovation that cost more than $35 million, and its unusual furnishings include egg-shaped chairs suspended from the lobby ceiling, and ''cocoon'' showers, resembling a nautilus shell, in guest room bathrooms. 
 Affinia Hotels opened the Liaison Capitol Hill in April, on New Jersey Avenue Northwest between D and E Streets, with 343 guest rooms that have high-tech amenities and contemporary furnishings. The hotel was renovated at a cost of more than $12 million, and will get a rooftop pool and lounge next year, and a lobby restaurant this summer.
 The $100 million renovation of the Marriott Wardman Park, at 2660 Woodley Road at Connecticut Avenue Northwest, involved redecorating all 1,316 guest rooms. A steakhouse was added along with a 3,000-square-foot fitness center.
 The Georgetown Inn, Hilton Washington and the Jefferson are all planning to refurbish, while W and the team of Marriott and the boutique hotelier Ian Schrager plan to open hotels in Washington. But, with the exception of renovation of the Georgetown Inn, none of this will occur until after the inauguration.
 These upgrades and openings are good news for business travelers because they ''raise the bar,'' said Christopher Hunsberger, general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel Washington D.C. ''As one hotel renovates, everyone looks and tries to reassess what they need to do to be competitive. The product offering has gotten substantially better for travelers, the options are greater than ever.''
 Mr. Radder, for one, said he believed that demand for luxury hotel rooms ''has not grown as fast as the supply has increased.'' This is already translating into some discounts: Donovan House is offering introductory room rates, starting at $295 a night. After Labor Day, rates will start at $375.

HEADLINE: AUTO INDUSTRY FEELS THE PAIN OF TIGHT CREDIT

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The auto industry is getting sideswiped by the housing crisis.
 Auto lenders and banks, closing their wallets, have prevented hundreds of thousands of consumers from obtaining the financing for a car. Home equity loans, which had been used in at least one of every nine deals, when lenders were more generous, are no longer a source of easy money for many prospective buyers. And used-car prices have fallen nearly 6 percent as repossessed cars and gas-guzzling trucks and S.U.V.'s flood auction lots. 
 Those forces, on top of the softening economy, are putting enormous pressure on the American auto industry as it faces what may be its worst year in more than a decade. About 15 million vehicles are expected to be sold in 2008, down from 16.2 million last year, as sales reach the lowest levels since 1995, according to the marketing firm J. D. Power & Associates.
 The impact on the broader American economy could be profound. Not only is the car a consumer's biggest purchase after the home, but the auto industry remains one of nation's most important economic engines. With less money available to bolster the industry's growth, the businesses that support it are also facing the prospect of a sharp slowdown. 
 ''It is a bleak picture, and it all hinges on the availability of financing,'' said William Ryan, a financial analyst at Portales Partners who has followed the auto business for years. ''The whole universe related to the auto industry is touched in some way -- parts suppliers, manufacturers, salespeople, trucking people, the paint and metals industries. Even semiconductors.'' 
 Within the auto sector, problems stemming from the continuing tightening of credit have already started to spread. Auto lenders like Chase, Capital One and GMAC are finding it harder and more expensive to obtain money for loans. Profits also look dimmer as the lenders absorb losses from defaults and pull back from making new loans. 
 Car dealers and manufacturers will probably face months of weaker profits as they offer more incentives to sell new vehicles. Luxury car sales, which provide outsize profits for auto companies, are off 13 percent from last year, according to the Autodata research firm. And consumers, facing potentially higher mortgage payments and $4-a-gallon gas, are delaying purchases of midmarket cars. 
 ''The housing crisis, defined with the credit crisis, has really knocked consumers back on their heels,'' said Michael J. Jackson, the chairman of AutoNation, the largest automobile retailer. 
 But the auto industry may not suffer the same severe downturn as the housing sector. One reason is that auto lenders have long issued loans expecting that vehicles, as collateral for the loans, start to lose value as soon as they are driven off the lot. In contrast, mortgage lenders during the housing boom believed that home prices would keep rising. 
 Still, the parallels are striking. Easy money and lax underwriting helped extend a boom for automakers from 2005 to early 2007. With Detroit pumping out new cars, consumers were encouraged to buy even though they might not have needed a new vehicle. 
 Now, just as in the housing sector, the auto industry is suffering, too. 
 Borrowers are falling behind on their car payments at a rate faster than in other recent downturns. And losses are considerably worse. Auto lenders sustained losses on about 3.4 percent of their loans in the first quarter, a rate about 30 percent higher than in 2002, according to data from Moody'sEconomy.com. Even some of the most creditworthy borrowers are stressed. 
 Recently there have been a few small signs of improvement. But auto lenders have struggled to find investors willing to buy packages of new loans. Just as in the mortgage markets, a sterling credit rating -- the bond insurer's seal of approval -- is no longer trusted. 
 ''It's a challenge, but it's not a crisis,'' said William F. Muir, president of GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors that is now operated as a joint venture.
 As the pool of money available to auto lenders has dried up, they have cut back on making new loans. Since late last year, nearly every auto finance company has tightened its lending standards. They are forcing borrowers to put more money down. They are also demanding higher monthly payments and requiring stronger credit records and more stringent documentation. 
 Subprime auto lenders have been forced to pull back the most. AmeriCredit, a big subprime finance company, said it would issue about $3 billion in new auto loans this year, compared with $9.2 billion in 2007. That translates into around 340,000 fewer vehicles being financed this year. But lenders catering to less risky borrowers are also retrenching. 
 ''Capital One is pulling back, Citi is pulling back, HSBC and Wells Fargo are pulling back,'' said Mr. Ryan, the analyst. So are the finance entities that serve the major automakers, like GMAC, Chrysler Financial and Ford Motor Credit. ''What you are seeing at AmeriCredit is probably happening everywhere else, but probably to a lesser degree.''
 Many dealers say that buyers who would have been shoo-ins for a loan a year ago are now being turned away. Ken Somerville, business manager at Pedigo Chevrolet in Indianapolis, said the tougher standards were having a ''significant impact'' on his ability to help customers get financing and close a sale. 
 ''Chances are, if we can't help them, they've already been somewhere else that couldn't either,'' he said.
 Some of the biggest drops in car sales have been in areas where home prices have fallen most sharply. The housing boom created thousands of jobs, robust consumer confidence and strong demand for pickup trucks. Today, that has all vanished. 
 As home values have declined, millions of consumers have maxed out on home equity debt. In hot markets like California, nearly 30 percent of all consumers tapped into the value of their homes to help finance their new cars, according to CNW Marketing Research. In Florida, about 20 percent used home equity loans. New car sales in both states are down about 7 percent. 
 Those areas are also seeing surges in repossessed vehicles. Bill Glover, a veteran repo man in Fort Meyers, Fla., says he has recovered more than 100 cars a week since October, doubling his usual business. ''I'm picking up 2008s already,'' he said. 
 In the past, Mr. Glover mostly took back cars from borrowers with sketchy credit who habitually fell behind on their car payments. But that circle has widened. ''Lately what we're picking up is crew-cab pickup trucks,'' Mr. Glover said, ''and anything having to do with construction.'' 
 The rise in recovered vehicles, along with tighter loan terms and weak demand from buyers, has put pressure on the used-car market too. In April, sale prices dropped 5.9 percent from a year earlier, with S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks plummeting even more, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value index, a widely followed measure that was not adjusted for seasonal differences. Prices had been rising for more than four years until last fall. 
 Analysts say there are few signs that this downward spiral will end soon. At the Midwest Auto Auction lot in the Detroit suburbs, there were plenty of deals one recent Friday morning. 
 Drivers shuttled more than 180 vehicles across the auction lot in two lines as the auctioneer, Ed Dunn, wearing an ivory cowboy hat from his perch above the floor, bellowed their make, model and year.
 The first car up for sale was a 2007 Lincoln MKZ luxury sedan with leather seats, which had been repossessed by a local credit union. But there were no bids. So Mr. Dunn lowered the starting price again and again. 
 At long last, somebody bid $13,200 for the car. Sold? Sure. But at roughly $10,000 below its Kelley Blue Book value.

HEADLINE: Convicted Gambler Whose Lawyer Is His Son

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Father and son shared little in common. There were no Little League games, no backpacking trips, no going to the movies together. The father, Raymond Marquez, was just too busy.
 From the 1950s into the 1990s, the elder Marquez, now 78, was spending most of his time at his gambling parlors in Harlem, building a reputation as Spanish Raymond -- the notorious kingpin of the illicit numbers racket. Mr. Marquez became known for flashy clothes and jewelry, owning luxury cars and even a yacht.
 His son, Raymond David Marquez -- he goes by R. David Marquez -- was on a much different track. He went to elementary school in Great Neck, N.Y., an affluent community on Long Island where he grew up, bounced around boarding schools and then went to college. Of his father's business, he said: ''It really didn't faze me one way or the other. I always stayed in school. I was trying to become somebody, trying to do something.''
 Despite their differences, this father-son tandem is now linked in a way few others are: The son is his father's lawyer. 
 After a decade-long focus on civil cases involving medical malpractice and personal injury, David, in 1994, began devoting a large part of his practice, which he runs out of the family home in Great Neck, to his father, representing him in both criminal and civil matters.
 David, 57, helped negotiate a plea agreement for his father in a 1994 gambling case in Manhattan. He has defended his father against attempts by the city and state to collect back taxes and won his father an acquittal on gambling charges filed in 1998 by the Manhattan district attorney. Most recently, he represented his father in a $15 million lawsuit against the city that claimed that his father had gotten bladder cancer from secondhand smoke while in detention at Rikers Island. A jury this month found the city not responsible.
 Still, Raymond Marquez has not avoided serious legal problems. He served eight years in a federal prison, has had to forfeit $1 million in assets, served five years of probation and still owes the city more than $1 million in back taxes.
 He said he encouraged his son as a child to pursue the law because he spent a lot of time around lawyers -- socially and as a client -- and liked the work they did. ''He works very hard at whatever he does,'' Mr. Marquez said. ''He's very thorough.''
 David is not surprised by his father's sentiment. ''He was trying to elevate the family'' by running numbers, he said. ''He wasn't trying to create a crime dynasty.''
 Bonded by kinship and court appearances, the two men have a somewhat ambivalent relationship.
 On the one hand, because lawyers must have a good rapport with their clients -- having to tell them hard truths they might not want to hear -- Raymond and David Marquez are close on some level. Yet people involved in cases with them said their relationship seems very businesslike.
 David Marquez said he represents his father with no more vigor than he does any of his other clients. He took on the smoking case, he said, because he believed that the city did was in the wrong, not simply because his father said he was a victim. 
 Raymond Marquez was born and raised in Harlem, the son of natives of Puerto Rico who eked out a living running a grocery store in Harlem. He graduated in 1947 from Textile High School on 19th Street in Manhattan, where he met his wife, Alice, who was born in the Bronx and is also of Puerto Rican descent.
 David Marquez, who was born in 1951, lived with his parents in a small one-bedroom apartment on 95th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. He was their only child. When he was about 3, his father bought a home in Great Neck. 
 Raymond said his mother bought the ranch-style house for him in 1953 for about $30,000. He said he later repaid his mother. With its finely manicured lawns and statuettes decorating the inside and outside, it is a leap up from the drab parlors where the numbers business boomed.
 In Great Neck, David Marquez said, he stood out as a Puerto Rican among mostly white neighbors. Trying to find a place where he fit in, he attended boarding schools in Tarrytown, N.Y., Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Bristol, Conn. He eventually returned to Great Neck for his senior year and graduated from public high school there.
 In school, David Marquez said, he did not know exactly what his father was doing, only that he was different from the other fathers. His father spent days away from home, and he would see him mostly on weekends. His father took him to Harlem every now and then to see his grandparents. But he said he never took him to a gambling parlor.
 As he got older, David picked up tidbits of his father's life here and there -- in newspaper articles, conversations with family members and with school friends whose parents, he said, were also involved in crime. 
 In 1969, Raymond went to prison on federal gambling charges. While his father was behind bars, David got a bachelor's degree from Inter-American University of Puerto Rico in business and economics, an M.B.A. from Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., and a law degree from Inter-American. 
 Though he was not bitter with his father, David said, visiting him in prison was difficult.
 ''I was never mad at him for what he did,'' he said. ''I always understood that we were living the benefits of his activities. I wasn't raised poor.''
 But Raymond, who said he never wanted his son to have any part in his criminal business, was not proud of the example he set. ''I'm sure he's not too happy with the life I've lived,'' he said. ''I'm unhappy that I couldn't offer him a better social presentation, that I couldn't be in a category that's more socially accepted.''
 David, who has been practicing law in New York since 1984, said he believed some judges may have been hard on him because of his father's past. And his relationship with some fellow lawyers soured after they found out who his father was, he said. ''I do believe that the association between my father and I, despite our differences in careers, that it's had a negative impact on my career,'' he said.
 Still, people who have seen David in the courtroom described him as polite, passionate in his arguments and sometimes awkward with his humor. ''He is one of the hardest-working, hardest-fighting lawyers for the rights of his clients who I've seen over the years,'' said Stuart Perry, a lawyer who has worked with David.
 Despite illnesses including bladder cancer, arthritis and macular degeneration, Raymond can show a fire similar to his son's. His ailments have taken their toll. He said he tires easily and is usually in bed by 7 p.m. He is eager to talk about his past.
 He remains adamant that law enforcement authorities unfairly made him a target. He said that he was a hard worker like anyone else and that he was living a middle-class life, not the life of a millionaire. Mr. Marquez blamed Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, for his troubles.
 Mr. Morgenthau prosecuted him on federal gambling charges when he was a United States attorney in the 1960s, and since he has been the Manhattan district attorney, his office has prosecuted him twice. Mr. Marquez reached a plea agreement on gambling charges in 1996, and was acquitted of gambling charges in 2001.
 ''I sometimes question myself, 'Why this fanatical pursuit of me by a man like Robert Morgenthau?' '' Mr. Marquez said. ''It's just something that I cannot understand.''
 Mr. Morgenthau declined to comment, but Daniel J. Castleman, the chief assistant district attorney, said that the evidence against Mr. Marquez had been compelling and there was little question about his stature in the numbers business.
 ''This was not some small fish,'' Mr. Castleman said. ''He was the biggest thing in numbers for three decades or more.''
 Raymond Marquez now divides his time between Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where his wife owns a hotel and a motel, and Great Neck, where David lives in the house that was bought in 1953. He said he occasionally buys a lottery ticket, but has not participated in the numbers racket in a decade, not because he opposes it, but because he was so far removed from that environment.
 Their legal partnership could soon come to an end. David is considering appealing the decision in the smoking case, the last of the cases in which he is representing his father. Once they leave the courtroom for the last time as client and lawyer, their relationship may no longer have a strong anchor. 
 Raymond and David speak regularly and get along well, but they acknowledged that their differences might prevent them from sharing a truly intimate bond.
 ''If I were a lawyer and he was a lawyer, we'd have something in common,'' Raymond Marquez said. ''Or if we were both in the numbers game, we'd have those in common. But we're on opposite sides of the fence with a big gap in between. That gap does create a problem in that we don't see eye to eye and we can't.''
 David Marquez interjected: ''Does that mean that when it comes to legal battles that I would turn my back on him? No.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosure's Residue

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 

 BODY:
The house on East 24th Street was the worst of the six that David Law and Trey McCallister worked on the other day here. The front door had been kicked in so many times that the dead bolt was exposed and bent. Trash littered the front and back yards. A copper pipe was gone. 
 ''Somebody has been trying to destroy this place,'' said Mr. McCallister, eyeing the door.
 But the two men have seen far worse as they go from one deserted house to another in northern Florida, where the foreclosure crisis has struck particularly hard. 
 Mortgage companies hire contractors like these men to inspect and maintain houses that once-proud owners can no longer afford and no one else wants. These days, business is brisk. 
 These contractors and thousands like them see first hand the detritus of the subprime era: peeling paint, gutted interiors, family dogs left behind to starve, overgrown lawns infested with snakes. 
 In Florida, the crisis can seem overwhelming at times. 
 It can take months, even years, for some homes to wind through foreclosure in the backlogged local courts.
 The longer a home sits vacant, the more vulnerable it becomes.
 After a few months, the Florida weather starts to takes a toll. Mold and mildew creep. Algae chokes forsaken swimming pools. Sometimes vandals strike. And sometimes wiring or plumbing just give out. 
 The home on East 24th Street has been vacant for several years, said Gloria Roberts, a next-door neighbor.
 Another home that Mr. McCallister and Mr. Law visited in the affluent Sawgrass golf community in the oceanside city of Ponte Vedra Beach was last occupied in December 2006, according to a neighbor there.
 Local and state governments have become concerned about the upkeep of foreclosed homes, which can drag down real estate values in neighborhoods and provide havens for drug users and gangs. Over the last year, localities have stepped up code enforcement by levying fines on mortgage companies for the degradation of homes they are repossessing.
 The problem of vacant homes is all the more striking when considered against predictions by economists that a couple of million more homes will enter foreclosure in the next two years, said Cheryl Lang, president of Integrated Mortgage Solutions, a company based in Houston that contracts with Mr. McCallister and Mr. Law on behalf of mortgage companies.
 ''We still have two million more people that need to go through this process,'' she said. ''That's like the entire town of Tampa going through foreclosure.''
 Nearly 3 percent of homes that were once occupied by their owners in the country were vacant in March. That is up from less than 2 percent three years ago and is the highest since the Census Bureau began publishing the number in 1956.
 For people like Mr. McCallister and Mr. Law, the surge in foreclosure has been good for business. Tim Doehner, executive director of the National Association of Mortgage Field Services, a trade association based in Ohio, estimates that most of his members have doubled their revenue in the last year. Individual contractors can bill as much as $5,000 every two weeks, said Jimmy Lyons, one of the partners in the firm, Landwise Inspection Services of Lake City, Fla., that Mr. McCallister and Mr. Law work for. 
 But the rising price of diesel fuel, wood and other supplies cuts sharply into their earnings. Mr. Law said he often spent $140 a day filling his pickup truck, which tows a large trailer that carries a riding lawnmower and other supplies. The contractors cannot easily pass rising costs to lenders because they work under contracts or, in the case of some loans, at rates set by federal agencies. 
 Still, business is growing and drawing in newcomers.
 Mr. Lyons, a former deputy sheriff, entered the home inspection business years ago but branched out into field service work for mortgage companies two years ago when a friend suggested the housing boom would soon give way to a housing bust. 
 Back then, ''I just couldn't see it,'' Mr. Lyons, 56, said. ''It fell exactly like he said it would.''
 After a quarter century in law enforcement, he still looks and plays the part of the easygoing rural county sheriff and is a reserve officer in Columbia County west of Jacksonville. At one home this month, he scrambled through an open window when the door was bolted while his younger colleagues looked on in amazement.
 Mr. Law left a field sales job with the Kellogg Company, the cereal maker, to join Landwise, because he said he was tired of the corporate world. He said taking care of vacant houses could be grueling but also rewarding and allowed him to work by himself, which he said he enjoyed. He often works seven days a week because his employer is often flooded with orders.
 ''It occupies a lot of my time,'' he said and added with a laugh, ''I don't have much of a life outside of this.'' 
 When he arrives at houses, Mr. Law reaches for his digital camera and starts snapping pictures to document his presence and problems that need attention. Mortgage companies require before and after photos to be sent to them electronically before paying for work done to the home.
 If it is their first visit to a vacant home, the contractors change the locks on at least one door so the mortgage company can have access. They use locksmith's tools to gain entry to the house, though on some occasions they use open windows, as Mr. Lyons recently did. The contractors board up broken windows, cut the grass and record significant damage. Depending on the extent of the destruction, mortgage companies will commission the contractors to repair the home.
 At the home on 24th Street, Mr. McCallister, 39, who had worked in the timber business until last year, wedged open the back door with pliers and Mr. Law installed a new lock. The interior of the house was mostly empty and musty. The outside was another story. A large tree branch shared the back yard with an empty propane tank, Styrofoam containers and food wrappers.
 After surveying the trash and photographing it, Mr. Law and Mr. McCallister concluded they could not cut the grass without cleaning up the yard. They would have to ask the mortgage company whether it wanted them to remove the trash and how much it would pay for the work.
 Contractors say the damage at vacant homes can be significant, though it is not always clear who the culprit is. It could be an angry homeowner upset about losing a home, but it also could be vandals and thieves scouring homes for copper plumbing, which they can sell. To limit losses, a few mortgage companies are making offers called ''cash for keys'' to delinquent borrowers if they leave their homes quickly and in good shape.
 Two of the six homes the contractors visited in the Jacksonville area appeared to be pristine. The two also had for-sale signs from real estate agents, suggesting the borrowers were trying to sell but could not find a buyer before they had to leave.
 For the contractors, foreclosures can strike close to home. Mr. Law recently inspected a home across the street from his residence and Mr. McCallister was sent to a home formerly occupied by a family whose daughter was friends with one of his three daughters.
 ''I was fortunate that everyone was gone,'' Mr. McCallister said, so he did not have to see his daughter's friend. 
 In most cases, the contractors do not interact with the homeowners, but sometimes the contractors are present during evictions that are conducted by county sheriffs. Mr. McCallister recalled the eviction of a 60-year-old man who had misread his eviction notice and thought he had one more week to leave.
 ''He fell down on the floor and started crying,'' Mr. McCallister said. ''We gave him 24 hours and he had his stuff moved out and he found another place to live.''
 In their work, the contractors come across the everyday debris of human life, from old microwave ovens to couches and a child's cherry-red tricycle. Sometimes they discover abandoned pets. Mr. Law recently found three kittens that he took to a friend who is an animal lover.
 Though homes were found for all three of the kittens, many other pets meet a worse fate. Ms. Lang of Integrated Mortgage Solutions has started a nonprofit group, No Paws Left Behind, to find homes for abandoned pets and to offer help with pets to homeowners in foreclosure. She said contractors working for her company had found abandoned animals from birds to horses.
 While business may be good for firms like hers, Ms. Lang said it was difficult not to be disenchanted when the housing bust is seen from the street level, as many of her contractors do. Just a few years ago, policy makers and the mortgage industry were celebrating record home ownership rates in the country -- a sign that the American dream was within reach for a large majority of the population. 
 Speaking on the phone two days after Mr. Law and Mr. McCallister's visit to the home on 24th Street, she said the home's condition stuck with her.
 ''Somewhere along the line someone wrote that property off,'' she said. ''There were birthdays celebrated there and anniversaries and there were lives that were lived there. And now the door is bolted shut.''

HEADLINE: Indy Jones Finds Gold At Global Box Office

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The hard sell worked. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,'' pushed by one of the biggest marketing campaigns in Hollywood history, sold an estimated $151.1 million in tickets in North American theaters over the five-day holiday weekend. 
 The box office gross, generated between Thursday and Monday, put to rest questions about whether one of moviedom's most popular characters could strike a cultural chord after a 19-year hiatus from the big screen. Overseas the movie, which generated mixed reviews from critics, sold an estimated $143 million in tickets between Thursday and Sunday; Monday estimates were unavailable. 
 The domestic box office total fell short of records and failed to meet the sky-high expectations of some analysts, expectations set in large part by an aggressive advertising push from Paramount Pictures that brought a half-dozen ''Indiana Jones'' billboards to some intersections. Paramount is spending $150 million to market the $185 million picture, according to a Goldman Sachs media analyst.
 Last year's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' had a better Memorial Day weekend and ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,'' released in 2005, holds the record for the biggest five-day opening tally in history with $172.8 million in tickets sold.
 Paramount said it was thrilled with the results, particularly that the film gained box office momentum as the weekend progressed. ''It was a spectacular weekend, and we are particularly excited to see the family business,'' said Rob Moore, president for marketing. ''Fans of the original films are sharing their love for this character with their kids.''
 The fourth Indiana Jones movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, with George Lucas as executive producer, drops in on the intrepid Dr. Jones, the whip-wielding archaeologist, in the 1950s. This time he squares off against Soviet agents in the jungle as he attempts to uncover the mystery of a crystal skull believed to hold extraterrestrial powers.
 Adjusted for inflation in ticket prices, the first Indiana Jones movie, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981) sold a total of $606.4 million at North American theaters, according to Box Office Mojo. ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984) sold $368.3 million; ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (1989) sold $340 million.
 No other movie of significance opened over the Memorial Day weekend. ''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'' from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media limped into its second weekend, selling about $28.6 million in tickets ($96.7 million overall) between Friday and Monday and dropping 48 percent from its softer-than-expected opening. Perhaps the popularity of ''Indiana Jones'' with families drew some ticket buyers who might have chosen ''Caspian,'' box office analysts said.
 The big-budget sequel to ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' almost lost its berth to ''Iron Man,'' which sold $25.7 million in tickets ($257.8 million overall). The staying power of ''Iron Man'' is particularly notable -- it opened on May 2 -- because summer-event movies, especially in recent years, have opened big and then faded quickly as the next would-be juggernaut arrives on marquees.
 ''Iron Man,'' the story of a brilliant engineer who builds a metal suit that allows him to fly, has benefited from an ensemble cast that can actually act and not just look pretty, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media by Numbers, a box office tracking firm. The decision to hire the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges helped the movie attract an older audience that might typically eschew a comic book blockbuster, he said.
 Marvel Studios produced the film, with Paramount handling distribution and marketing.
 Two holdover pictures rounded out the weekend's Top 5. The 20th Century Fox comedy ''What Happens in Vegas,'' starring Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher, earned a strong $11.3 million (for a total of $56.5 million), while ''Speed Racer,'' the expensive Warner Brothers film that is now officially a flop on a massive scale, sold $5.1 million ($37.4 million overall.)

HEADLINE: $1.85 Fee to See Doctor? Czechs Say, Too Much

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
In the Czech Republic, you can now see a doctor for about $1.85. A day in the hospital can verge on $4. This is not cause for celebration.
 For Czechs, who visit their doctors more often than anyone else in Europe, it has led to great outrage. In fact, the idea of charging anything at all for health care can generate significant controversy, not to mention abrupt about-faces in policy, here and in other Central European countries.
 In Hungary, health care fees were resoundingly defeated in a nationwide referendum in March, which resulted in the firing of the health minister. Here in the Czech Republic, which began imposing the modest fees at the start of the year, the prime minister himself was forced before the constitutional court in Brno to testify as the court weighs overturning them. It is scheduled to rule on Wednesday. 
 Countries rich and poor struggle with how best to provide affordable health care to their citizens without breaking the bank. In places like the Czech Republic, there is a sense of betrayal, because the state long took care of them, but also a justified fear for those left behind in the recent years of growth and change. Even in Prague, known as the golden city, new wealth for some -- and their rising expectations for top-notch care -- has meant only higher prices for those trapped with low salaries or fixed pensions.
 ''I have to save so I have money for food,'' said Kveta Lachoutova, 78, a widow who is a retired statistician. In an interview in the waiting room at her doctor's office here, she said that she was trying to live on a monthly pension of about $600, while spending close to $400 on rent and utilities. ''I don't buy anything else,'' she said.
 For healthy people with jobs, the fees are quite literally pocket change, usually paid with the same 10 and 20 crown coins as streetcar tickets in Prague ($1 is worth around 16 crowns). Affluent Czechs will admit privately that they spend far more on veterinary care for their cats and dogs than for their own medical care, even with co-payments for some medications.
 But many Czechs see it as a matter of principle that health care should be free -- though the system is financed in part through payroll deductions -- along with a strong sense of solidarity for the poor. ''The only analogy I can think of in our political culture is primary schools,'' said Marc J. Roberts, a professor of political economy at the Harvard School of Public Health who has worked in Central Europe. ''Most people in the United States believe that primary education should be free and open to all and that it shouldn't be subject to market principles.''
 Under communism, health care was free, only up to a point. Bribery for better care was a common practice and can still be a problem, particularly in Hungary where it remains widespread. 
 The region has been a laboratory of health care reform in recent years. The effort has been led by free-market advocates from booming Slovakia, which sports a flat tax and scorching economic growth, at a rate of more than 10 percent last year. 
 Slovakia introduced modest payments for doctors' visits and hospital stays in 2003. But, as would later happen in Hungary, the fees did not last. The left-wing government that came to power in 2006 rolled them back later that year, within just a few months of taking office. 
 ''What we want to achieve in the health system is a higher individual responsibility, making the consumers more responsible for what they consume,'' said Peter Pazitny, executive director and one of the founding partners at the Health Policy Institute in Bratislava, and formerly the principal adviser to the Slovakian minister of health.
 The need for reform in the region, Mr. Pazitny said, is obvious. Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that the Czech, Slovak and Hungarian health care systems rank at or near the bottom of all member countries in life expectancy, as well as mortality rates for strokes, heart disease and cancer.
 The Czech government was receptive to the Health Policy Institute's input and even employs another of Mr. Pazitny's partners in Prague. But the members of the opposition would prefer that their former countrymen left them -- and their health care system -- alone. 
 ''I would understand if these Slovak boys would do it as a paper for their seminar at university, but here they are introducing it into real life,'' said Michal Hasek, leader of the Social Democratic caucus, the largest opposition party in Parliament. 
 The Czech Constitution says that ''citizens have on the basis of public insurance the right to free medical care and free medical aids under the conditions defined by the law.'' The new payments were not only unconstitutional, according to Mr. Hasek, but also causing real pain in some segments of the population. Opponents and the local tabloid news media have made premature babies in incubators, whose parents must pay the hospital fees, into symbols of the new system.
 Experts disagree on whether upfront fees to discourage doctors' visits are a good idea from a public health perspective, and even question whether they create much in the way of savings for the overall health care system. ''Most expensive, unnecessary services are not asked for by patients, but suggested by the physicians just to generate more revenue and more income for them,'' said Peter Gaal, professor of health policy at Semmelweis University in Budapest.
 The fees here, $1.85 for a prescription as well as a doctor's visit, and twice that for a day in the hospital, are clearly having an effect on Czech behavior. The Health Ministry said the number of prescriptions fell 40 percent in the first quarter, though some of that may have been a result of stockpiling at the end of last year. The government estimated that public insurers had saved more than $100 million in the first quarter compared with the previous year, while providers collected $62 million in fees. 
 ''We try to take out some of the costs that people can pay for themselves from the health care system,'' said Tomas Julinek, the Czech health minister, in an interview in his office last week. But there is a cap on payments, set at just over $300 for the year, which Mr. Julinek said would also protect the seriously ill.
 Several chronically ill patients said that they were not sure how the cap would work, or exactly which costs would be included. ''So far, I see the negatives and I experience the negatives,'' said Lenka Vondrackova, a multiple sclerosis patient struggling to get by with her husband and two teenage sons on about $1,200 a month, a combination of his salary and her disability benefits. 
 They live crammed into a tiny apartment in a Communist-era apartment building in Cerny Most, a neighborhood in the far eastern part of Prague. Her regimen of medications requires five pills in the morning, a nasal spray once a day and three more pills in the evening, along with a shot administered by her husband or one of her sons. Before the reforms, they were able to save a little each month. ''Now everything that's left is taken up by the fees,'' said her husband, Pavel. 
 ''I believe that in the future it will become evident that there will be more money for better equipment and medication,'' she said, wishing in particular for pills that could take the place of the painful injection she dreaded each night. ''If it works out,'' she added, looking away, torn between skepticism and hope.

HEADLINE: The Frenzy for Campaign Money

 BODY:
The power of money in politics has never been more pronounced or problematical as it is in this year's presidential campaign -- the costliest in the nation's history.
 Painful contradictions abound. Senator John McCain, who made a career of attacking big-money abuses in politics, has had to send five top campaign aides packing after their lucrative professions as special-interest lobbyists, capital insiders and money bundlers became too embarrassing to ignore. He is keeping on his main strategist, Charles Black, who says he has retired from his lucrative profession as an uber-lobbyist for a string of dictators and other unsavory foreign leaders.
 Senator Barack Obama, after presenting himself as a fighter for the publicly subsidized campaign reforms of the Watergate era, is raising such prodigious donations on the Internet that he seems likely not to honor his offer to accept spending limits in the general election. And the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, champion of the fabled money-raising machine of the 1990s, has slipped $19 million into debt -- half of it her money. 
 And still, all three candidates are promising to rein in the role of money in politics by updating the Watergate public subsidies -- right after this campaign is over. That's not good enough. 
 Yes, the public subsidy for presidential elections has been badly eroded by inflation after three decades. But unless those who lay claim to the presidency set an example by taking the public money, reform seems unlikely. Begging, borrowing and spending as much lucre as they can lay their hands on and disdaining public financing is a recipe for certain failure.
 Mr. Obama has the biggest bag of loot so far, boosted by more than 1.5 million Web supporters extending largely small-caliber donations. The senator is justifiably proud of this outlet for grass-roots democracy, but his description of it as an alternative public-financing system is absurd. Nothing is more grass-roots than the $3 checkoff available to every taxpayer.
 Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Obama vowed to accept the tighter alternative of public subsidy and its spending limitations -- a not-so-shabby $85 million for the general election -- providing the Republican nominee does the same. Mr. McCain seems ready to do that, and we hope he does. Should Mr. Obama renege, he would become the first presidential candidate to reject the general-election limits. 
 Should he honor the pledge, Obama campaigners fear being overpowered in a parallel money assault waged by way of the Republican Party's deep coffers in battleground states and well-financed shadow-party attack groups. 
 Facing such a dilemma is the stuff of political leadership. As a candidate running against money-driven Washington, Mr. Obama should follow his initial instinct to defend the public alternative. Otherwise, the 2012 campaign will become an even less inhibited chase after special-interest donors. Even with the Obama Web boom, a good half of all primary money -- some $366 million -- still comes from individuals giving $1,000 or more. 
 The candidates scrambling for ever more money must commit before the voters to saving public financing, and then make its updating a top priority upon election to the White House -- or return to the Senate. 
 All three have at hand a fine model for this task -- Senator Edward Kennedy, who was a principal force in marshaling the bipartisan Congressional majority that first enacted public financing into law. It's time to update and strengthen this historic measure.

HEADLINE: Republican Senate Candidates in New Jersey Want You to Know Their Names

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Depending on whom you ask, this is a story about Maverick Murray, Jersey Joe and the Liberal Loser Lobbyist. Others regard it simply as the Republican primary to choose a candidate for the United States Senate in New Jersey.
 All would agree that it has not been the neatest, nor the most electrifying, of affairs.
 Murray Sabrin, otherwise known as Maverick Murray, is a finance professor at Ramapo College and a former Libertarian who has boasted about the endorsement of the Gannett newspaper chain -- or, more precisely, the presumed endorsement of a Gannett executive who died in 1957.
 Jersey Joe, State Senator Joseph Pennacchio of Morris County, is a dentist by way of Brooklyn who once wrote a 94-page manifesto under a pen name that called for a new nationalist party that he said would be a tribute to Ronald Reagan. Critics said it smelled like fascism. 
 Then there is the candidate without a self-imposed nickname -- unless you count the Liberal Loser Lobbyist tag invented by Maverick Murray. He is Richard A. Zimmer, a former congressman who ran unsuccessfully for this same Senate seat 12 years ago, but was persuaded by Republican leaders to try again this year as a last-minute substitute. He is a lobbyist who lives in Washington. 
 If you do not know their names, much less their views on the war in Iraq, the faltering economy or how New Jersey can squeeze as much money as possible from Washington, count yourself among a majority of voters.
 Political analysts say there are reasons that Mr. Pennacchio, Mr. Sabrin and Mr. Zimmer have struggled to register with the public, including the prolonged Democratic presidential primary between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the unexpected primary challenge to Senator Frank R. Lautenberg by a fellow Democrat, Representative Robert E. Andrews. The three Republican candidates have also struggled to raise money, so they have been unable to buy much advertising time leading up to the primary on June 3.
 Whatever the reason, when analysts are asked what issues or moments have characterized the race, the response of Roger A. Bodman, a veteran Republican strategist and a former state transportation commissioner, is not unusual. ''I frankly don't know,'' he said. ''They're trying to get the attention of what I would call a sleepy Republican electorate at this point.''
 While there is little disagreement that whoever prevails on the Democratic side -- either Mr. Lautenberg or Mr. Andrews -- will be favored in the November general election, the race is likely to attract national attention as the undercard on a Republican ticket headed by Senator John McCain.
 At best, national Republicans are thinking that the presidential race could be in play in this Democratic-leaning state, because Mr. McCain is considered a maverick who will attract moderate and undecided voters. At the least, the state party is hoping that the general election will proceed more smoothly than the primary.
 The tragicomedy began to unfold in March, when the presumed Republican favorite, Anne Estabrook, a wealthy real estate developer and political novice, dropped out after she had a slight stroke. Party leaders approached numerous people before recruiting Andrew Unanue, a 40-year-old nightclub owner whose family owns Goya Foods. 
 But Mr. Unanue's candidacy disintegrated after an admission in a court case that he sometimes came into work hung over, the disclosure that he lived in Manhattan and not New Jersey, and his refusal to interrupt a vacation in Vail, Colo., to announce his candidacy and hit the campaign trail rather than the ski slopes.
 Then came John F. Crowley, a 41-year-old millionaire biotechnology executive from Princeton who raised the hopes of Republicans with a compelling personal story about starting up a successful medical research company after doctors told him there was no treatment for a rare neuromuscular disorder that afflicted his children. But despite entreaties from many Republicans, including a personal pitch from Mr. McCain, Mr. Crowley said no, then probably, then no again.
 Finally, the Republicans settled on Mr. Zimmer, who, at 63, does not offer quite the obvious generational contrast to the 84-year-old Mr. Lautenberg that Mr. Unanue or Mr. Crowley would have presented. To many weary Republicans, Mr. Zimmer's selection felt anticlimactic.
 ''This thing has been all about process,'' said Jennifer Duffy, a senior political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''It's almost letting air out of a balloon.'' 
 Most analysts say the race will be close, with Mr. Pennacchio and Mr. Zimmer viewed as the favorites despite Mr. Sabrin's self-proclaimed status as the ''front-runner.'' But at least there are clear ideological differences.
 Mr. Zimmer is a classic New Jersey Republican moderate. He is an environmentalist and supporter of abortion rights who was ranked as the most fiscally conservative member of Congress three times by the National Taxpayers Union. But he has been critical of how Washington under the Bush administration has managed the nation's checkbook.
 ''I think the Republican Party lost its way on the issue of fiscal responsibility,'' Mr. Zimmer said in a debate last week. 
 But he hardly stirs any passions on the campaign trail, and he has been muddied by reports that he paid only $169 in taxes on a 23-acre property that he says is a legitimate farm. Opponents insist it is simply an unfair tax break.
 Mr. Pennacchio, a legislator since 2001 who turns 53 on Tuesday, has urged energy independence and the repeal of the alternative minimum tax. A textbook conservative candidate, he has the support of the state's prominent anti-abortion group, New Jersey Right to Life, and a better ballot position in several counties.
 He is also trying to win points for arduous campaigning, in contrast to Mr. Zimmer. ''People don't like that,'' Mr. Pennacchio said in a recent televised debate. ''They don't like their elected officials anointed.''
 But most political analysts agree that Mr. Pennacchio has been hurt most by the manifesto he wrote that recommended the conversion of former military installations into camps for the homeless. Mr. Sabrin, who was born in Germany and whose parents are Holocaust survivors, demanded that Mr. Pennacchio quit the race.
 For his part, Mr. Sabrin, 61, has tried to position himself as the Ron Paul of New Jersey, pushing for an immediate withdrawal of United States forces in Iraq, and he has argued that the declining value of the dollar should be the most important issue.
 Yet despite Mr. Sabrin's embrace of the mercurial Mr. Paul, he has tried to overcome the label of fringe candidate after losing twice in statewide races -- as the Libertarian candidate for governor in 1997, and in the Republican Senate primary in 2000.
 Despite their minority party status and the musical chairs aspect of the Republican race, what is clearly hurting all three candidates is their anemic fund-raising. They have raised a total of less than $1 million, with most of that coming from their own pockets. By comparison, Mr. Lautenberg has raised at least $4.7 million, and Mr. Andrews more than $2.2 million.
 In all, it is not surprising that the race has received so little attention from the media. Mr. Pennacchio scheduled a news conference last week on the steps of the State House, a conspicuous Trenton locale that often draws a crowd, if simply out of curiosity. The only people to show up were three reporters, two campaign aides and Mr. Pennacchio himself.

 MARINES PUSH BACK TALIBAN,
 And Help Revive Afghan Town
 For two years British troops staked out a presence in Garmser, a small district center in southern Afghanistan, and fended off attacks from the Taliban. But it took the Marines, specifically the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, about 96 hours to clear out the Taliban in a fierce battle and push them back some 6 miles. The result of the operation has been palpable. The district chief returned from his refuge in the provincial capital and 200 people gathered for a meeting with him and the British to plan the regeneration of the town. PAGE A6 
 ARREST OF LEADER UP FOR EXTENSION
 Almost lost in the clamor over Myanmar's devastating cyclone, the house arrest of the charismatic pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, reaches a deadline for its annual renewal. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 62, has been detained at home on and off for 12 of the last 18 years, and the year-to-year extension of her term has become routine. Most analysts expect the detention to be extended again this year. PAGE A15 
 POLICING USE OF MEXICO MONUMENTS
 Mexico's anthropology institute oversees a vast collection of pyramids, shrines and other attractions, all more than a century old. With 800 researchers, the institute churns out academic treatises that seek to make sense of the country's past. It also rejects anything seen as exploiting a historical artifact's dignity, such as Hidalgo State's advertising campaign featuring a soap opera actress wearing the state's most eye-popping sites on her flesh. PAGE A10 U.N. SAYS RUSSIA SHOT DOWN DRONE
 A United Nations investigation has concluded that a remotely piloted Georgian reconnaissance aircraft that was destroyed last month was struck by an air-to-air missile fired from a Russian fighter jet. The report suggested that Russia's actions called into question its role as a credible peacekeeper in Georgia's territorial disputes, and it presented the Kremlin with a diplomatic embarrassment over its policy in the southern Caucasus and its previous statements about its military activities there. PAGE A10 
 BOMBER KILLS 2 AMERICAN SOLDIERS
 Two American soldiers were killed in Iraq and a suicide bomber struck an American-backed Sunni militia just north of Baghdad, leaving two Iraqi police officers and three militia guards dead. Insurgent attacks in recent days have dropped to their lowest weekly level since late March 2004, according to data released by the United States military. The decline follows a cease-fire with Shiite militias in Baghdad. PAGE A15 
 NATIONAL
 CAMPAIGNS TRY TO COPE 
 With Theft by Insiders
 The F.B.I. is investigating Christopher J. Ward, once the go-to guy for Republican politicians looking for help managing their campaign finances, after the National Republican Congressional Committee said hundreds of thousands of dollars was missing and presumed stolen by Mr. Ward in a sophisticated embezzlement scheme. The episode is the latest instance of theft from a political coffers, a serious and growing problem in campaign finance. PAGE A21 
 CANDIDATES IN NEW MEXICO
 Senators Barack Obama and John McCain appeared before two different crowds of military veterans and their families in New Mexico, in a possible preview of their camp's two strategies if they meet in the fall election. ''It's significant that they are here,'' Gov. Bill Richardson said in an interview in Las Cruces, a city on the state's southern border that was a battleground within a battleground in the presidential race four years ago. ''Western states will get priority attention.'' PAGE A21
 ANOTHER TRY AT A PERFECT TOWN
 Pacific Beach, Wash., has been the site of ambitious residential developments before. One was washed away by the ocean. Another became an unsightly stretch of strip malls and sprawl. Seabrook -- an idyll full of perfect porches with perfect front doors and adorable children -- is the attempt by developers to transform the obstinate coastal area. One hundred houses have already been built, with 300 more planned. ''It's like a little Pleasantville,'' a furniture deliveryman said. ''It's kind of creepy.'' PAGE A16 
 CLINTON'S COMMENTS ON 1992
 Most of the attention given to Senator Hillary Clinton's much-discussed comments about continuing on in the Democratic race focused on her invocation of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination. But she also spoke about her husband's bid for the White House in 1992, and said that he was still campaigning well into June. But what she did not mention was that while Bill Clinton still faced a challenger for the nomination, he had effectively secured the nomination months before then, and had been trying to prod his opponent out of the race for some time. PAGE A20
 BUSINESS
 TELECOMS GAINING GROUND IN DEVELOPING NATIONS
 In countries that don't have landlines for wide use, people rely on mobile phones. That makes emerging markets particularly attractive to foreign investors. So the $90 million SBC paid to acquire nearly 16 percent of a small South African company called MTN in the 1990s (and sold two years later) would cost about $6 billion today. That reflects a new order in the mobile telecommunications industry, with American companies taking a back seat to upstart rivals overseas. ''Many big U.S. telcos eventually lost interest in these markets: they were too small,'' one former telecommunications executive said. PAGE C4 
 DEALING WITH EMPTY HOMES
 What happens to the many homes left empty following the sudden halt of the subprime era? Family dogs are left behind to starve. Thieves steal copper pipes. Backyards become littered with trash and junk. Mortgage companies have hired contractors to maintain many of the empty properties that have been foreclosed on. And these days, business is brisk. PAGE C1
 FUEL PRICES TAKE TOLL ON TRUCKERS
 Truckers' revenues are being squeezed on two ends: the sagging economy means there is less freight traffic, and the rising price of diesel fuel has cut into earnings made from deliveries. Profit margins in trucking are thin even in good times, but they are minuscule now, and each jump in fuel prices is pushing more of the country's truckers into the red. PAGE C1
 S.E.C. SHIFTS HEALTH CARE STANCE
 The Securities and Exchange Commission informed companies that they must allow shareholders to vote on a proposal for universal health insurance coverage. Shareholders -- which include religious groups and labor unions -- have offered the proposal in an effort to draw the nation's largest corporations into the debate over the future of health care, which has become one of the most important issues in domestic policy. The move is a shift by the S.E.C., which had allowed companies to exclude similar proposals in the past. PAGE C1 
 FUROR IN GERMANY OVER PRIVACY
 Deutsche Telekom announced that it had secretly monitored thousands of phone calls so that it could identify the source of leaks to the news media about its internal dealings. The admission of ''severe and far-reaching'' misuse of private data set off a firestorm in Germany over threats to personal privacy. The German government has a 32 percent stake in the company -- the dominant provider of fixed-line phone service in the country -- and said the spying operation was a ''serious breach of trust.''

 SCIENCE TIMES
 OF DARWIN AND DOSTOYEVSKY
 For years, there has been a huge divide between those in the humanities and those in the sciences, or what the physicist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow called the ''gulf of mutual incomprehension.'' An ambitious program at Binghamton University in New York called the New Humanities Initiative hopes to reconcile the two. Or try to, anyway. PAGE F1 
 LIES MY PARENTS TOLD ME
 Jennifer Buettner stumbled upon her idea for a children's placebo after listening to her young daughter perpetually complain of various mystery ailments. So she founded Efficacy Brands (without a hit of irony) and began selling a chewable, cherry-flavored tablet to trick kids into thinking they are taking something. But some doctors question the ethics of the idea, and say that placebos are only effective if the parents think it's a real pill too. PAGE F5 
 FORGOING THE DYNAMITE
 The Clark Fork River is the largest in Montana, and is a prized trout fishery. But on the other side of the Milltown Dam that separates the river lies 1.5 million cubic yards of toxic sediment from heavy metals. So how does the state take down the century-old dam without exposing the trout to the toxic waste? Very, very slowly. PAGE F3

 WITH LABORERS HARD TO COME BY,
 Farmers Change Their Approach
 Crackdowns on illegal immigrants throughout New York state have meant that people who manage the fields and dairies have had to change the way they do business. Some are scaling down the land they have to harvest, while others have made large capital investments in mechanical systems that will allow them to cut their work forces. ''We don't take it lightly to make these changes,'' a cherry farmer said. PAGE B1 
 8 WOUNDED IN HARLEM SHOOTINGS
 Police responded to a several shootings that began on a stretch of Lenox Avenue north of 126th Street in Harlem and left as many as eight people wounded, the authorities said. The Police said they believed that the shooting stemmed from a disturbance at Marcus Garvey Park, where gunshots broke out in a large crowd. At least two of the victims appeared to be teenage boys, the police said. PAGE B6 
 TISHMAN AND TENANTS AT ODDS
 Since its record-breaking, $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan, Tishman Speyer Properties has accused hundreds of rent-stabilized tenants of living somewhere else other than their apartment, and denied many of them renewal on their leases. Residents and lawyers say it is part of an aggressive attempt to drive out low-rent tenants for high-rent ones. Tishman Speyer said they are trying to rid the buildings of tenants who are there illegally. PAGE A1 
 ARTS
 HIS LIFE WITH THE DEATHS
 The State Carried Out
 Among the first images in ''At the Death House Door,'' a documentary to be shown this week on the Independent Film Channel, is Rev. Carroll Pickett, a soft-spoken prison chaplain, walking tenderly in a lonely field of concrete crosses engraved with dates and numbers. Viewers will learn that Mr. Pickett, a 74-year-old Presbyterian minister, was anguished by his job, and that he finally concluded that the death penalty served neither justice nor morality. The movie's director and cinematographer, Steve James and Peter Gilbert, who made the 1994 basketball documentary ''Hoop Dreams,'' hope the film will renew debate about the death penalty. PAGE E1 
 ARTIST REVIVES RENAISSANCE SKILL
 Unusual for a 35-year-old contemporary artist, Alison Elizabeth Taylor's favored medium is wood marquetry, a craft that, like oil painting, flourished during the Renaissance. ''Room,'' a massive installation and the highlight of Ms. Taylor's solo show at James Cohan Gallery in Chelsea, uses nearly 200 types of inlay. Inside the piece, the viewer encounters a trompe l'oeil furnished domestic space whose windows look out onto a trompe l'oeil landscape. PAGE E1 
 INDY JONES IS GOLD AT BOX OFFICE
 The hard sell worked. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,'' pushed by one of the biggest marketing campaigns in Hollywood history, sold an estimated $151.1 million in tickets in North American theaters over the five-day holiday weekend. The box office gross, generated between Thursday and Monday, put to rest questions about whether one of moviedom's most popular characters could strike a cultural chord after a 19-year hiatus from the big screen.

 TRAINER REMAINS OPTIMISTIC
 On Big Brown's Recovery
 Rick Dutrow, the trainer of Big Brown, said he was encouraged by the colt's recovery from a stress fracture on his front left hoof. Big Brown is a favorite to win the Belmont Stakes on June 7, and so his trainers and handlers are being cautious. ''We can most likely jog him, but I don't want to do that,'' Mr. Dutrow said. ''I want Ian to look at him again before we actually go to the track. If he looks great tomorrow, I still won't jog him.'' PAGE D1 
 RANDOLPH STILL ON THE HOT SEAT
 Willie Randolph is still the manager of the New York Mets, but for how long? After a two-hour meeting, Omar Minaya, the team's general manager, offered his support to Mr. Randolph and that he has a contract that extends through the 2009 season. But it's what he failed to say that was revealing. PAGE D5
 A LOS ANGELES SOAP OPERA
 The Los Angeles Lakers don't do easy. Last summer, Kobe Bryant, their superstar and arguably the league's best basketball player, was demanding a trade. But he relented, the team's young players developed in a hurry, and they added All-Star Pau Gasol to the roster before cruising to their conference's best record. Now they're two games away from the N.B.A. Finals. So why can't the team's general manager relax? PAGE D6

HEADLINE: Third World Telecom Moves to the Front

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and KEVIN J. O'BRIEN. 
Kevin O'Brien reported from Berlin and Heather Timmons from New Delhi.

 BODY:
The MTN Group, a small mobile operator in South Africa, attracted an investment in 1995 from SBC, an American telecommunications company. Now MTN is a sprawling company that spans 21 countries with 70 million customers, and it is attracting outside investors again.
 But this time around, companies in emerging markets are on the prowl, reflecting a new order in the mobile telecommunications industry. American companies, it seems, are taking a backseat to upstart rivals overseas. 
 Over the weekend, MTN traded Indian suitors, swapping merger partner Bharti Airtel for rival Reliance Communications. Whether or not this combination holds up, bankers predict some deal will be completed. 
 In the last few days, China said it would reorganize its six telecommunications companies into three. In effect, two of its old fixed-line companies will get some assistance to put them on better footing with China Mobile, the world's largest leading mobile company with almost 400 million subscribers. 
 If both series of deals go through as planned, four of the top seven operators, China Mobile, China Unicom, America Movil and MTN-Reliance, would be based in emerging markets. Of the three remaining based in the West, two -- Vodafone of England and Telefonica 02 of Spain -- have extensive operations in developing markets. The other is T-Mobile of Germany. 
 ''The focus of the wireless business is shifting rapidly from the developed Western markets to the developing world,'' said Madhusudan Gupta, an analyst based in Singapore for the research firm Gartner.
 Although American mobile operators were active investors in emerging markets during the 1990s, many of them quickly exited, a trend that accelerated after the plunge in telecommunications and dotcom stocks in 2000. SBC, now a part of AT&T Wireless, sold its stake in MTN after only two years. It paid $90 million to acquire nearly 16 percent. That portion of MTN would cost about $6 billion today.
 ''Many big U.S. telcos eventually lost interest in these markets: they were too small,'' said Robert Chaphe, who was chief executive of MTN from 1995 through 2002 and is now semiretired and living in Florida. ''Now U.S. telcos see more opportunity closer to home. After all, risk ratios are lower in Kansas than in Africa.''
 The development of the mobile markets was left for years to Europeans and homegrown companies. Now these fast-growing telecommunications giants are eager to go global. 
 John Gole, an analyst at International Data Corporation in Prague, said that recent rapid economic growth in India, China and the Gulf states had created a new breed of regional mobile operators. They include companies like Orascom of Egypt, with 71 million customers in Africa, the Middle East and Asia; Etisalat, based in Abu Dhabi, with 6.6 million customers and 10 operators in Africa; and the Zain Group of Kuwait, with 45.7 million customers and 22 operators in Africa and the Middle East.
 ''These booming economies and a general economic liberalization have led to the creation of new competitors with the means and experience to expand in emerging markets,'' Mr. Gole said.
 A combined Reliance and MTN would have about 116 million customers, making it the seventh largest mobile operator in the world, just below T-Mobile, the wireless subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. It would dwarf the largest operator in the United States, AT&T Wireless which has 71.4 million customers.
 Putting together a deal will not be easy. Reliance's market capitalization is $27.5 billion, about $10 billion less than MTN's, and it has about 20 million fewer customers. MTN's management balked at a takeover by Bharti, a bigger company, proposing that MTN become the parent company instead. 
 Even though it's a smaller company, Reliance may also balk at a subsidiary role. It is a publicly traded unit of a conglomerate controlled by Indian businessman Anil Dhirubhai Ambani, a conglomerate with a market value of $75 billion. 
 Bankers, analysts and news reports suggest a handful of nascent mobile powers based in emerging markets are interested in MTN, as well as European telecommunications companies. 
 ''Something has to happen,'' said a banker whose firm was working with a third telecommunications company, which he would not identify, that hoped to woo MTN.
 MTN and Reliance have been skillful at generating profits from customers who typically spend very little for mobile service -- less than $20 a month at MTN and less than $9 at Reliance, based on their latest quarterly reports. That compares with $54 a month at Verizon Wireless in the United States, according to a quarterly report from Vodafone, which owns a 40 percent stake in Verizon.
 Reliance earned a profit of $1.4 billion on $4.8 billion in sales in the year that ended March 31. MTN had a profit of 11.9 billion South African rand, or $1.6 billion, in 2007 on sales of 73.1 billion rand, or $9.7 billion.
 Reliance has recently expressed serious interest in Africa, where there are few landlines and much potential growth in mobile lines. Through its subsidiary Reliance FLAG, the company is investing $1.5 billion to lay a submarine fiber optic cable to Africa. In February, the company bought a small Ugandan telecommunications company, and said it plans to invest about $500 million there in the next five years to provide mobile, Internet and broadband service. 
 There are many risks for any outside company looking at Africa's fast-growing markets, analysts say. Andre Wills, managing director at Africa Analysis, a wireless industry consulting firm in Centurion, South Africa, said: ''You need to have a significant understanding of the African operating environment and the challenges of working across all of these different regulatory environments.''
 If Reliance were to move significantly into Africa, it could raise the stakes for international investors like Vodafone, which has a subsidiary in Egypt and operations in seven other African countries; Orange, which owns stakes in operators in 13 African countries, and Portugal Telecom, which has operations in Angola and Morocco.
 Other possible suitors for MTN might be Vodafone, which owns 50 percent of Vodacom, another South African operator, and Deutsche Telekom and VimpelCom, which is based in Russia. Vodafone executives have said that the company is not planning any move on MTN. Deutsche Telekom and VimpelCom declined to comment.
 Africa, where 29 percent of the population owns a cellphone, according to Gartner, is just one of several promising markets. In India, market penetration is 34 percent, well below the United States, at about 70 percent, and Western Europe, at more than 90 percent.

HEADLINE: Memorial Day Draws Two Messages on Iraq

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL FALCONE; Jeff Zeleny reported from Las Cruces, and Michael Falcone from Albuquerque. Larry Rohter contributed reporting from Bayamon, P.R.

DATELINE: LAS CRUCES, N.M. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain stood before hundreds of flag-waving veterans and their families on Monday and vowed not to waver in his support of the Iraq war. ''Even,'' he said, ''if I must stand athwart popular opinion.''
 Senator Barack Obama addressed a separate audience of veterans and received vigorous applause when he declared, ''As many of you know, my intention is to bring this war in Iraq to a close and to start bringing home our troops in an orderly fashion.'' 
 If Labor Day is the traditional opener to the fall presidential race, this Memorial Day offered at least a preview into the summertime duel between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama, who for the first time were campaigning in the same swing state on the same day.
 As Mr. McCain spoke about the costs and sacrifices of the Iraq war at the Veterans Memorial in Albuquerque, Mr. Obama praised the patriotism of America's soldiers before taking voters' questions -- and hearing their frustrations about Iraq and a host of other concerns -- at an outdoor forum against the backdrop of the Organ Mountains here.
 The campaign stops provided a window into how both men, should they become the nominees of their respective parties, are shaping their candidacies, employing the power of their biographies and honing their arguments in their appeal to voters. 
 Will the Iraq war and the nation's security once again be the chief concern to voters in the general election? In a 20-minute speech, with the flags of all branches of the armed forces at his back, Mr. McCain made 14 references to Iraq. Later, he invited Mr. Obama to join him on a tour of Iraq. (Mr. Obama did not immediately say whether he would accept.)
 ''As long as there is a reasonable prospect for succeeding in this war,'' Mr. McCain said, ''then we must not choose to lose it.''
 Or will economic anxieties at home and a fierce disapproval over the direction of the country be of higher concern to voters? In 10 minutes of prepared remarks, Mr. Obama did not mention Iraq, only raising it when someone in the audience spoke critically of the war in a 30-minute question-and-answer session.
 ''It's going to take some work,'' Mr. Obama said, ticking through a lengthy list of domestic challenges awaiting the next president, including health care and improving the quality of life for veterans. ''It might even take two terms.''
 Here in New Mexico, a clear and breezy holiday provided something of a soft launching for the budding contest between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama. The outlines have been coming into sharper focus in recent weeks, but were framed even more distinctively on Monday as a generational divide, presenting diverging backgrounds and far different life experiences to voters.
 Of course, too, the Democratic nominating fight is not yet complete.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton spent the day in Puerto Rico, campaigning for the island's June 1 primary. But Mr. Obama's decision to invest time here -- rather than Puerto Rico or Montana and South Dakota, where the final primaries take place June 3 -- suggested that the decision not to declare victory was simply a formality. 
 It was no accident, of course, that Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama staged their Memorial Day campaigning in New Mexico, which for the last two presidential cycles has been more closely divided than any other state. (In 2004, President Bush won the state by 5,988 votes, while in 2000 Al Gore defeated Mr. Bush by 366 votes.)
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who two months ago endorsed Mr. Obama, said the Western States were fertile turf for Democrats. But Mr. McCain's home state, Arizona, and his popularity among some Hispanic voters, present Mr. Obama with a challenge. 
 ''It's significant that they are here,'' Mr. Richardson said in an interview in Las Cruces, a city near the state's southern border that was a battleground within a battleground in the presidential race four years ago. ''Western states will get priority attention.''
 So on a day dedicated to honoring the nation's servicemen and women, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama did not directly engage one another, even on their differences on the way forward in Iraq, as they campaigned about 200 miles apart. 
 Mr. McCain acknowledged that many members of the military were serving longer deployments than expected in Iraq, but said the United States should continue to keep troops in the country as long as there was a ''reasonable prospect'' for success. 
 ''Our defeat in Iraq would be catastrophic, not just for Iraq, but for us,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I cannot be complicit in it. I will do whatever I can, whether I am effective or not, to help avert it.''
 One week after Mr. McCain mentioned that Mr. Obama had not chosen military service, he did not repeat it, though he reminded voters that he was the son and grandson of a distinguished naval family.
 ''I was blessed to have been born into a family who made their living at sea in defense of our security and ideals,'' Mr. McCain said.
 Mr. McCain also kept alive a debate about a new G.I. Bill to provide tuition assistance and other benefits, which he opposes, arguing that his own counterproposal would be better for the military. The bill sponsored by Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, passed the Senate last week by a vote of 75 to 22. Mr. Obama supports that plan, but Mr. McCain favors an alternative that would give returning service members education payments based on years of service.
 Mr. Obama, who did not criticize Mr. McCain over the matter as he did last week, sought instead to use Memorial Day to continue the task of introducing himself to a wider swath of voters. He reached for a military lineage, too.
 ''I speak to you today with deep humility. My grandfather marched in Patton's Army, but I cannot know what it is to walk into battle like so many of you,'' Mr. Obama said. ''My grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line, but I cannot know what it is for a family to sacrifice like so many of yours have.''

HEADLINE: Making the Move Into Ownership

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For the last few years, I have been an evangelist for renting.
 I've told my sister-in-law and her husband that they would be crazy to abandon their reasonably priced one-bedroom rental in Brooklyn. When two of my colleagues were moving to Los Angeles, I e-mailed them a spreadsheet that helped persuade them not to buy a house there. That same spreadsheet was the basis for an article in 2005, when I argued that ''renting has become a surprisingly smart option.'' Last spring -- like any good evangelist, comfortable with repetition -- I wrote a similar article.
 The case for renting has been simple enough. House prices rose so high in the first half of this decade that you could often get more for your money by renting. You could also avoid having a large part of your net worth tied up in a speculative bubble. 
 All this time, I have been a renter myself, first in the New York suburbs and then in Manhattan. But my wife and I will be moving to Washington this summer. And the housing market has, obviously, changed quite a bit since our last move, in 2005. Nationwide, prices fell 14.1 percent from early 2007 to early this year, as Standard & Poor's reported Tuesday. Home prices almost certainly still have a way to fall, but they're now well below their peak. 
 So my wife and I began our search with open minds, willing to consider renting or buying. We ended our search by signing a contract to buy a house.
 This is the story of my conversion.
 One of the big lies of the real estate business is the idea that renting a home is tantamount to throwing money away. It's a useful fiction for real estate agents, because they make vastly bigger commissions on house sales than rentals. But the comparison isn't nearly so straightforward for the rest of us.
 Renting involves one obvious, recurring cost that can never be recouped: the monthly rent check. Buying, on the other hand, involves multiple expenses, some of which aren't so obvious. On top of closing costs, there are repairs, property taxes, mortgage principal and mortgage interest. (The mortgage-interest tax deduction reduces this last cost but doesn't eliminate it.) When you own, you also lose the ability to invest your down payment elsewhere, like the stock market.
 Of course, owning also brings benefits that have nothing to do with money. You can settle into your home, confident that no landlord will kick you out. You can repaint the walls and redo the kitchen. All else being equal, owning seems far preferable to renting.
 Knowing all this, my wife and I were willing to buy a house even if it was ultimately going to cost us a bit more than renting. We just weren't willing to have it cost a lot more than renting. 
 Over the last several years, I've come to like a simple, back-of-the-envelope way to compare the costs of renting and owning. You find two similar houses, one for sale and the other for rent, and divide the sale price by the annual rent. You can call the result the rent ratio.
 The concept will probably sound familiar to stock market investors. It's the real estate market's version of a price-earnings ratio -- a measure of how expensive an asset is, relative to the underlying economic fundamentals. Like a P/E ratio, the rent ratio provides something of a reality check.
 Throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s, the average rent ratio nationwide hovered between 10 and 14. In the last few years, though, it broke through that historical range and hit almost 19 by the time the housing market peaked, in 2006. 
 And while home prices -- and rent ratios -- have always been higher on the coasts, they reached whole new levels recently. In the Washington area, the ratio went above 20. In Boston, New York, Los Angeles and south Florida, it topped 25. In Northern California, it approached 35, higher than it had been in any city, at any point on record. 
 In concrete terms, a rent ratio above 20 means that the monthly costs of ownership well exceed the cost of renting. At current mortgage rates, for example, a $500,000 house would typically bring monthly expenses of about $3,000 (taking into account taxes, repairs, a typical down payment and, yes, the mortgage deduction). When the rent ratio is 20, that same house could be rented for only about $2,000 a month. 
 There are two problems with buying a house in this situation. The first, plainly, is the extra $1,000 you're paying each month for the privilege of owning, on top of the thousands of dollars you spent on closing costs. The second problem is that a rent ratio above 20 is a good indication of a bubble. When the prices of houses get out of line with the competition's prices -- that is, those in the rental market -- a correction is coming. 
 The question facing my wife and me was whether we were entering the market before the correction had gone far enough. I really didn't know what the answer would be. So as we looked at houses, I started calculating rent ratios.
 In the neighborhoods where we were looking, two-bedroom condominiums were selling for $400,000 and being rented for about $2,100 a month, which makes for a rent ratio of 16. Four-bedroom houses were selling for $700,000 and being rented for almost $4,000, which makes for a rent ratio of 15. No matter the price range, pretty much every apples-to-apples comparison produced a similar ratio. 
 Historically, this is still a bit high. But it's very different from where the market was just a couple of years ago. With house prices having fallen over the last two years and rents continuing to rise, the decision became a much closer call. We would now have to spend only a little more each month for the privilege of owning. 
 This month, we found a house that we really liked, and we made an offer. It was accepted.
 I'm still not sure how good our timing was. Based on the backlog of houses on the market, I fully expect that our new house will be worth less in six months than it is today. I'm also not sure that we would have been willing to buy in Boston, New York or much of California, where the rent ratios remain above 20, according to data from Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 In fact, if you're now renting -- almost anywhere -- and do not need to move, I'd probably recommend that you wait to buy. The market is still coming your way. 
 But it's O.K. with me if our timing wasn't perfect. After several years of reporting on the housing market, I'm convinced that the most common real estate mistake is viewing a house first as a financial investment and only second as a home. That's one big reason we ended up in this bubble-induced mess. 
 Most of the time, the decision whether to rent or buy should be based above all on life circumstances. Do you expect to move again in a couple years? Or is there a good chance that you're ready to settle in -- and stop worrying about real estate for a while? 
 The housing bubble, unfortunately, forced a reconsideration of this standard, because houses became so overvalued. But they're slowly coming back to reality, which means that buying has again started to make sense for more people. Apparently, I'm one of them.

HEADLINE: Oyster Farmers Find a Boutique In the Bay

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: Southampton, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 PULLING out a receipt from the Grand Central Oyster Bar when you're standing on the quiet shores of the Shinnecock Indian reservation seems so wrong.
 Ancestors of the 600 people who live here have been gathering shellfish along the eastern shores of Long Island for centuries, with no help from professional shuckers and certainly no credit cards.
 Madeleine Rogers, the tribal council member who manages the modest oyster farm the Shinnecocks started three years ago, studied the price that a briny Long Island oyster might bring 90 miles away, in Manhattan: $2.05. Then she looked out at the bay, where mesh bags and plastic trays hold almost 250,000 of them. Plenty were full of meat, ready for the underappreciated spring oyster season, which starts in May and ends in June.
 ''I ought to just fill up the back of the car and drive a bunch of these over there,'' she said. 
 They would no doubt be downed quickly. New York's appetite for oysters is long and legendary, rising and falling for decades along with the wild stocks that grow in nearby waters. 
 New York oyster eaters who want to look in their own backyard now have more choices than ever. In the waters around Long Island and stretching into the coves of a couple of neighboring states, dozens of boutique growers are finally getting a handle on the deceptively simple art of oyster farming. 
 Encouraged by state aquaculture programs and fueled by the local food movement, New York oyster growers who once considered themselves hobbyists are taking their shellfish to neighborhood markets and beyond.
 Since 2000, the number of state-issued aquaculture permits has grown to 51 from 38, and the number of oysters harvested has doubled.
 ''The Northeast seems to be where it's happening right now,'' said Rowan Jacobsen, author of ''A Geography of Oysters,'' which examines what he says are over 200 oyster appellations of North America. 
 ''Everything is super-hyper-regional,'' he said, which is leading people to discover New York area oystering grounds like Mecox Bay, Pipe's Cove and Saddle Rock. 
 In the waters surrounding Long Island, people tending underwater lots as small as five acres are cultivating oysters with deeper cups and meatier bodies than the everyday Atlantic oyster, grooming them so the shells are uniformly clean and thick. 
 Better hatchery stock offers a hedge against disease. And the new crop of boutique growers better understands variables like water quality, tidal flow, shell care and seasonality. As a result, oyster eaters can parse out specific characteristics beyond a clever name. 
 ''You are seeing better virginicas than you ever have before,'' Mr. Jacobsen said. ''You can actually pick out appellations.''
 The oyster to which he refers is the Crassostrea virginica, or the Eastern oyster. Three oyster species are popular on the West Coast. But in the east, the virginica dominates. 
 In Manhattan and Brooklyn, where plenty of restaurants serve oysters from both shores, some are adding more New York oysters to the mix. At Oceana, it's often a Pine Island pulled out of Oyster Bay by Frank M. Flower & Sons, the last of the large, old oyster companies on Long Island. 
 Some refuse to serve West Coast oysters at all. Peter Hoffman, chef and owner of Savoy and Back Forty in Manhattan, finds them too fat and creamy. He loves the sharp upfront brine of the virginica, but as he learned at a recent tasting of 20 Northeast oysters, there is more to an oyster than salt.
 ''I always thought what I wanted was brine, brine, brine, but some of those were like drinking seawater when you get knocked down by a wave,'' he said. ''I saw it was all about balance.''
 (For the record, Mr. Hoffman and other fans of the local oyster generally take them cold and plain, with only the slightest bit of acid from a drop of lemon or mignonette sauce to soften the salt.)
 If something that grows in the sea could have a terroir, it would be oysters. There is no Widow's Hole striped bass or Fishers Island bluefish. But when the modern-day oyster renaissance began in the mid-'90s, naming an oyster after its home waters became important. 
 Bob Rheault, who runs the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, estimates there are now 300 named oysters on the Eastern Seaboard. 
 ''There are a lot of small growers coming online who recognize that in order to have a good marketing plan they need a name,'' he said. ''I'm seeing it in every state in New England and even down into the Chesapeake.''
 Of course, this can be maddening to serious oyster eaters and chefs, who agree that some of those names are all smoke and mirrors. 
 Take the Blue Point, for example. Technically, a Blue Point is supposed to be from the Great South Bay bound by Fire Island and the south shore of Long Island, where in the 1800s Blue Points were the gold standard. 
 But the Blue Points at an oyster bar may have been grown in Connecticut, New Jersey or even Virginia. 
 A New York state law in 1908 prohibited any oyster that had not spent at least three months in the Great South Bay from being sold as a Blue Point. Even then, the law was largely ignored. 
 Chris Quartuccio, an oyster dealer and grower, has started producing what he calls true Blue Points off a 100-foot dock thrust into the Great South Bay near Captree Island. His oysters are opaque and plump with lots of bright brine and a rich finish -- markedly different from the lean, muddy-tasting generic ''Blue Points'' sampled recently at some oyster bars in Manhattan.
 He sells what he calls genuine Blue Points, or Blue Islands, in his Blue Island Seafood Market in Sayville and occasionally to Manhattan restaurants, including Grand Central Oyster Bar. There, they go by the name Great South Bay so as not to be confused with the other Blue Points.
 Like many of the new boutique oyster growers, he wants to encourage oyster farming as a way to help the ecology and economy of Peconic Bay and other Long Island waters, where the traditional baymen have balked at aquaculture.
 ''If we could show other baymen we can be successful, we hope we can get 10 or 20 growers in the Great South Bay just like they have in the Peconic,'' he said.
 Not everybody agrees that Northeast oysters -- let alone Long Island oysters -- are special.
 ''My preference is for Pacific oysters, which to me have a wilder, more complex flavor than Atlantic oysters,'' said the chef Michael Mina, who uses oysters extensively in many of his 11 restaurants, especially the ones in Las Vegas and California.
 Mr. Mina does have a favorite Atlantic oyster, though. Like many chefs, he prefers the Island Creek, produced by a small co-op of growers who pull their virginicas out of small inlets on Cape Cod Bay.
 Virginicas come in thousands of variations. Grow two virginicas in different parts of a bay and they will taste different. If the water is particularly salty, the oyster will be, too. Many people growing oysters will start them in one part of a bay, then move them two or three times to achieve a balance of flavors.
 The amount of food in the water and the water's temperature can affect whether the meat will be lean or plump and how fast it will grow.
 An oyster grown on a sea bottom with lots of tidal action will develop stronger muscles and a deeper cup as it burrows down into the sand than one grown in a basket suspended in the ocean. 
 Seasons affect New York oysters, too. The local virginica begins to taste its best in late September, when it is taking in as much food as it can to get through a long, cold winter. For much of the late winter and early spring, oysters become watery and lean. Much past June, most hard-core localists won't eat local oysters because of the gamy taste a spawning oyster takes on, and concerns -- however unfounded -- about the safety of an oyster grown in warmer waters.
 But in between comes the secret second season of the Northeast virginica. 
 Starting as early as April and into June, local oysters start eating so that they can spawn in the summer. Their bodies become opaque with lipids, creating plump meat that can sometimes have buttery or fruity notes.
 David Pasternack, the chef at Esca, grew up fishing the waters around Long Island and still does, but this time of year, especially, he looks to oysters from the cold waters of Maine or Nova Scotia.
 Still, like many chefs, Mr. Pasternack does have an appreciation for the Widow's Hole oyster grown in Greenport Harbor off Long Island's North Fork. He can even appreciate Cape May Salts from New Jersey, a new farm that grows especially well-manicured oysters in racks stretched out into Delaware Bay.
 Karen and Gregg Rivara, Long Island's unofficial oyster queen and king, like their oysters any time of year, but Ms. Rivara has a certain appreciation for the spring oysters.
 Since the 1980s, she has worked with the Shinnecocks and other oyster farmers, and now runs one of the few hatcheries on Long Island, near Southold on the Peconic Bay. She also grows and sells oysters under the name Mystic. Chefs like their sweet-to-salt ratio and slightly metallic finish. 
 She also works with a co-op of oyster growers in the Peconic Bay. By fall they hope to glean their best oysters and sell them as Peconic Pearls.
 Her husband works for the Cornell University Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County. Together, they have been largely responsible for getting small, part-time oyster ''gardeners'' to become commercial growers, and for helping to convince baymen that seeding Long Island waters with cultured oysters is a good thing, both environmentally and financially.
 ''A lot of these baymen didn't realize how hard it was to grow oysters,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''They thought it would be like watching grass grow.''
 They also did not realize that they would not be paid for up to two years, about the time it takes to grow an oyster to market size, or that much of their crop could be demolished by storms, disease, natural predators or theft.
 Overcoming the odds is what Ms. Rogers and her crew of six tribe members have on their minds right now. Every day in good weather tribe members wade into the water and pull plastic bags and trays of oysters onto the shore and check their crop. 
 They drive the biggest ones to an old hatchery left over from a tribal effort to make a go of oystering in the 1970s and early 1980s. Brown tide and management conflicts shut it down.
 In 2004 the tribe began a revival. A $300,000 grant from the Administration for Native Americans, a federal agency, helped pay salaries and buy oyster seed and equipment. A new stainless steel mesh tumbler spins the oysters and breaks off the feathery lips of the shells, forcing the oysters to put more effort into growing deeper cups, stronger shells and better meat.
 On a recent cold afternoon, the crew was tired. No one knew how many oysters were floating in the bay, let alone how many might be ready to stand the scrutiny of Manhattan restaurant buyers. Even if they did have a steady supply, no one even knew who they would call to make the deal.
 But that didn't really trouble anyone. They knew they could interest East End restaurants and retailers. And neighbors call to pick up a few dozen here and there for potlucks and parties.
 This summer they will probably set up a stand on the highway and sell them for 75 cents to a dollar apiece, trying to catch people as they travel to their weekend getaways. 
 You can't get more local than that.

HEADLINE: Quick Fix Versus Solid Foundation

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''Don't brag about your lightning pace, for Slow and Steady won the race!''
 -- from Aesop's ''The Tortoise and The Hare''
 Shortly before the Eastern Conference finals began, a reporter wanted to make a comparison between Joe Dumars, the Pistons' president for basketball operations and Danny Ainge, the Celtics' executive director for basketball operations. 
 Dumars, ever the diplomat, was polite and spoke in general terms about his approach to building the Pistons into a successful franchise. 
 But there really is no comparison. Since taking over in June 2000, Dumars transformed a franchise that won 32 games in the 2000-1 season into one that has made six consecutive trips to the Eastern Conference finals. Detroit, much like San Antonio, is a tortoise in the N.B.A.. With wise draft picks and timely acquisitions of free agents, the Pistons and the Spurs have built strong structures, brick by brick. 
 Ainge, on the other hand, hammered out two off-season trades, and no one is sure how sound the Celtics' house is or how enduring it will be. Celtics fans just know that it's still standing, and for too many organizations these days, this defines the approach to ''building.''
 Ainge became the Celtics' executive director for basketball operations on May 9, 2003. When he took over, he outlined a five-year rebuilding plan. 
 Ainge's tenure has resulted in a series of first-round eliminations and so-so draft picks. The Celtics reached the playoffs in 2003-4 but were eliminated in the first round. Ainge then hired Doc Rivers as coach in April 2004. The Celtics were once again eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs in 2004-5. The next two seasons, the Celtics missed the playoffs, and Rivers and Ainge looked as if they were headed for the unemployment line.
 Last season, Boston compiled the N.B.A.'s second-worst record and Paul Pierce, the Celtics' 10-year veteran, openly pressed Ainge to scrap his five-year plan and bring in championship-caliber talent. Now.
 With the fans and the news media hot on his trail, Ainge was forced to become a hare.
 First, the Celtics acquired Ray Allen from Seattle along with the draft rights to Glen Davis in exchange for Wally Szczerbiak, Delonte West and the draft rights to Jeff Green on June 28, 2007. 
 A month later, Boston made the trade that had teams taking notice: Kevin Garnett was acquired from Minnesota for Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair and two future first-round draft choices. 
 At the very least the trade looked like a sweetheart deal between Ainge and the Timberwolves vice president for basketball operations, Kevin McHale, two desperate basketball executives, good friends and former Celtic teammates, whose jobs were on the line. 
 The Bulls reportedly offered a better package in Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas and P. J. Brown, but Minnesota was dragging its heels waiting for the best possible deal. 
 In any event, the trade helped Boston go from a team that missed the playoffs to a team that is two victories away from the N.B.A. finals for the first time since 1986-87. 
 ''It's a definite snapshot of two different ways to get there,'' Dumars said of comparing Detroit with Boston. 
 The Lakers were similarly, if not as dramatically, gifted by a trade last February when Memphis sent Pau Gasol to the Lakers, essentially for a song. A month earlier, the emerging center Andrew Bynum injured his knee. Without Bynum, the Lakers struggled and there was a chance they might even have missed the playoffs. 
 Then, as if by magic, the Lakers acquired Gasol without giving up any of their top talent. Memphis received Kwame Brown (and his $9 million, expiring contract), first-round picks, and a couple of young players in Javaris Crittenton and Marc Gasol, Pau's younger brother.
 In all fairness to Los Angeles and its general manager, Mitch Kupchak, it's not fair to compare the Lakers to Boston, beyond the sweetheart deal that gave each of them the missing link they desperately needed this season.
 The gift to the re-tooled Celtics may backfire if Boston's newly acquired fleet squad doesn't race past Detroit and reach the finals. Fans can legitimately ask: If you can't reach the N.B.A. Finals with this ''dream team,'' can you ever?
 This was an all-or-nothing trade for Boston; the Pistons, regardless of the outcome, will be back. 
 ''There's no one, by-the-book way to build a contender,'' Dumars said. ''You have two totally different ways of how these two teams got to where they are right now. Danny was fortunate to get a couple of All Stars -- maybe future Hall of Famers.''
 No team in these N.B.A. conference finals has laid claim to being America's Team, although the N.B.A. may be pulling for a Los Angeles-Boston final because of nostalgic value, not to mention of market share.
 But in a culture ruled by the nanosecond, slow and steady certainly has its charm.

HEADLINE: Major San Francisco Development Faces a Ballot Test

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
It is difficult to imagine a tougher place to undertake a major redevelopment than the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard here.
 Opened in 1941 and closed in 1974, the nearly mile-square complex, which once employed 17,000 people, is a Mad Max industrial landscape of empty gray buildings full of asbestos, dust-covered piers, rusting metal and acres of fields where the military dumped chemical wastes.
 Bordering the shipyard is Bayview, a mostly minority and working-class community with high rates of crime, joblessness and illness. Some residents believe that all of these problems are linked in some way to the neighborhood's proximity to the base. 
 But San Francisco, whose total area is just 49 square miles, needs the space for housing and offices for an expanding population and business sector. And for all of its difficulties, Hunters Point overlooks the porcelain blue waters of San Francisco Bay and has rousing views of the downtown office towers about five miles north. 
 In March 2005, the city's Board of Supervisors approved the first phase of a redevelopment plan for the old base; this allowed 1,600 condominium apartments and town homes on 63 acres, a project being built by the Miami-based Lennar Corporation.
 Now, after years of planning, negotiation and public meetings, voters will pass judgment June 3 on competing ballot initiatives that will decide whether the city and Lennar can embark on a mammoth $8 billion second phase. 
 A city-sponsored measure called Proposition G asks residents to give the go-ahead to turn 496 acres in the shipyard and the adjoining 276-acre Candlestick Point, where the 49ers of the National Football League play, into a neighborhood of 10,000 homes, 2 million square feet of research and office buildings, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a new stadium.
 The development plan includes more than 300 acres of new parks; a seven-mile network of walking and biking trails; modern water, sewer and street infrastructure; a bus rapid transit system to link the development to a light rail line; and a separate heavy commuter rail line about two miles away. 
 The city and Lennar, one of the nation's largest home builders, agreed to make 25 percent of the homes available for sale at below-market rates. Lennar says it has hired minority contractors and has reached out to the Bayview community for labor. The company also agreed to rebuild and expand a neighboring housing project without having to relocate any of its residents.
 ''This project brings to life big parcels of land that have languished for decades,'' said Michael Cohen, director of the city's Office of Economic and Work Force Development, who has been involved in the project's planning for 12 years. ''It opens a whole new part of the city to new housing, businesses and recreation.'' 
 But a competing ballot initiative, Proposition F, sponsored by a maverick city supervisor, Chris Daly, and supported by some Bayview residents, might end the project with the completion of the first phase, city officials say. 
 Proposition F reflects worries that residents will be cut off from the jobs and wealth generated by the development, and that rising property values might force them out of their homes.
 The proposition expresses this fear most pointedly with a requirement that half of the housing built in the new Hunters Point-Bayview project be offered for sale to working families at below-market rates. Buyers who earn 80 percent or less of the median annual income for the region -- $64,000 for a family of four in San Francisco -- could qualify for subsidies and steep discounts. 
 ''We know that affordability is our top housing issue, and the guarantees provided by Prop F are right on time,'' Mr. Daly said this month on his Daly Blog (www.chrisdaly.org/).
 Both propositions could pass, though Mayor Gavin Newsom said in an interview he hoped Proposition F would fail. ''It would make it impossible to build the project the way we've planned, with parks, and open space, and rapid transit, and all of the public assets,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''If F passes, all this land and all that it promises will sit idle another 25 years.'' 
 Mayor Newsom and a number of other prominent leaders, including Senator Dianne Feinstein and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, are counting on the Hunters Point-Bayview project to anchor the transformation of San Francisco's industrial southeast sector into modern shoreline urban neighborhoods that put housing, schools, jobs, recreation and retailing close together.
 The reconstruction of rugged south San Francisco is the largest urban redevelopment project here since the 1906 earthquake and fire, and may be the largest in the nation in size and value, city officials said.
 But it is not the only far-reaching development under way in the city. Just a few miles north of Hunters Point is Mission Bay, a new 303-acre section of south San Francisco that is rising from an old shoreline rail yard and industrial area. Work started on the $7 billion project in 1998, and it is about 45 percent completed.
 It includes a 2.65 million-square-foot campus for the University of California, San Francisco, a 6 million-square-foot biomedical and biotech research center, new restaurants, shops, a public library and 6,000 housing units. Mission Bay is served by a light rail line on Third Street, which opened last year. 
 San Francisco's population, estimated by the California Department of Finance at 824,000, has grown by an average of 7,000 residents annually since 2000. But the city added just 2,500 new units of housing last year, and less than that in 2006. In the next 17 years, it is expected to add 56,000 residents and 83,000 jobs. 
 The competition for housing within the city limits has forestalled the foreclosure crisis that has caused housing values to plummet by 40 percent and more in San Francisco's suburbs. Housing prices have ticked up about 1 percent in the last 12 months in the city, the only municipality in the Bay Area that has had a price increase in that time, according to regional realty figures. The median home price in San Francisco reached $790,000 this month. 
 ''The demand for housing is strong and has been for years,'' said Michael A. Covarrubias, the chairman and chief executive of TMG Partners, a prominent development company here. ''We have a limited supply. It's what developers love and hate about the city. It's very hard to get a project entitled here. But once you do, the demand makes it easier to market.''
 It is not clear which side will prevail on June 3. The pressure from Mr. Daly and his supporters, though, is having an effect. 
 On May 16, Lennar reached agreement with a coalition of neighborhood groups and labor unions to sell 32 percent of the Hunters Point-Bayview project's housing at below-market rates. 
 Tim Paulson, executive director of the San Francisco Labor Council, who helped negotiate the agreement, said in a statement that Proposition F would ''repel progress'' and called the new housing agreement ''the best deal for working families, for the Bayview community and for the city of San Francisco.''
 Kofi Bonner, regional vice president of Lennar Urban, the unit overseeing the Hunters Point-Bayview project, said that Lennar was prepared to invest $1.6 billion in infrastructure for the project and that increasing the percentage of affordable homes was possible. ''You make your money on the homes that are sold at the market rate,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Truth or Consequences

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Imagine for a minute, just a minute, that someone running for president was able to actually tell the truth, the real truth, to the American people about what would be the best -- I mean really the best -- energy policy for the long-term economic health and security of our country. I realize this is a fantasy, but play along with me for a minute. What would this mythical, totally imaginary, truth-telling candidate say?
 For starters, he or she would explain that there is no short-term fix for gasoline prices. Prices are what they are as a result of rising global oil demand from India, China and a rapidly growing Middle East on top of our own increasing consumption, a shortage of ''sweet'' crude that is used for the diesel fuel that Europe is highly dependent upon and our own neglect of effective energy policy for 30 years. 
 Cynical ideas, like the McCain-Clinton summertime gas-tax holiday, would only make the problem worse, and reckless initiatives like the Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep offer to subsidize gasoline for three years for people who buy its gas guzzlers are the moral equivalent of tobacco companies offering discounted cigarettes to teenagers. 
 I can't say it better than my friend Tim Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics, did in a Memorial Day essay in The Washington Post: ''So Dodge wants to sell you a car you don't really want to buy, that is not fuel-efficient, will further damage our environment, and will further subsidize oil states, some of which are on the other side of the wars we're currently fighting. ... The planet be damned, the troops be forgotten, the economy be ignored: buy a Dodge.''
 No, our mythical candidate would say the long-term answer is to go exactly the other way: guarantee people a high price of gasoline -- forever.
 This candidate would note that $4-a-gallon gasoline is really starting to impact driving behavior and buying behavior in way that $3-a-gallon gas did not. The first time we got such a strong price signal, after the 1973 oil shock, we responded as a country by demanding and producing more fuel-efficient cars. But as soon as oil prices started falling in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we let Detroit get us readdicted to gas guzzlers, and the price steadily crept back up to where it is today. 
 We must not make that mistake again. Therefore, what our mythical candidate would be proposing, argues the energy economist Philip Verleger Jr., is a ''price floor'' for gasoline: $4 a gallon for regular unleaded, which is still half the going rate in Europe today. Washington would declare that it would never let the price fall below that level. If it does, it would increase the federal gasoline tax on a monthly basis to make up the difference between the pump price and the market price. 
 To ease the burden on the less well-off, ''anyone earning under $80,000 a year would be compensated with a reduction in the payroll taxes,'' said Verleger. Or, he suggested, the government could use the gasoline tax to buy back gas guzzlers from the public and ''crush them.'' 
 But the message going forward to every car buyer and carmaker would be this: The price of gasoline is never going back down. Therefore, if you buy a big gas guzzler today, you are locking yourself into perpetually high gasoline bills. You are buying a pig that will eat you out of house and home. At the same time, if you, a manufacturer, continue building fleets of nonhybrid gas guzzlers, you are condemning yourself, your employees and shareholders to oblivion.
 What a cruel thing for a candidate to say? I disagree. Every decade we look back and say: ''If only we had done the right thing then, we would be in a different position today.'' 
 But no politician dared to do so. When gasoline was $2 a gallon, the government never would have imposed a $2 tax. Now that it is $4 a gallon, the government should at least keep it there, since it is really having the right effect.
 I was visiting my local Toyota dealer in Bethesda, Md., last week to trade in one hybrid car for another. There is now a two-month wait to buy a Prius, which gets close to 50 miles per gallon. The dealer told me I was lucky. My hybrid was going up in value every day, so I didn't have to worry about waiting a while for my new car. But if it were not a hybrid, he said, he would deduct each day $200 from the trade-in price for every $1-a-barrel increase in the OPEC price of crude oil. When I saw the rows and rows of unsold S.U.V.'s parked in his lot, I understood why.
 We need to make a structural shift in our energy economy. Ultimately, we need to move our entire fleet to plug-in electric cars. The only way to get from here to there is to start now with a price signal that will force the change. 
 Barack Obama had the courage to tell voters that the McCain-Clinton summer gas-giveaway plan was a fraud. Wouldn't it be amazing if he took the next step and put the right plan before the American people? Wouldn't that just be amazing?

HEADLINE: Warrior for Al Qaeda Rallies Recruits With Her Online Fury

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO and SOUAD MEKHENNET; Basil Katz contributed research from Paris.. 
Basil Katz contributed research from Paris.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
On the street, Malika El Aroud is anonymous in an Islamic black veil covering all but her eyes.
 In her living room, Ms. El Aroud, a 48-year-old Belgian, wears the ordinary look of middle age: a plain black T-shirt and pants and curly brown hair. The only adornment is a pair of powder-blue slippers monogrammed in gold with the letters SEXY.
 But it is on the Internet where Ms. El Aroud has distinguished herself. Writing in French under the name ''Oum Obeyda,'' she has transformed herself into one of the most prominent Internet jihadists in Europe. 
 She calls herself a female holy warrior for Al Qaeda. She insists that she does not disseminate instructions on bomb-making and has no intention of taking up arms herself. Rather, she bullies Muslim men to go and fight and rallies women to join the cause. 
 ''It's not my role to set off bombs -- that's ridiculous,'' she said in a rare interview. ''I have a weapon. It's to write. It's to speak out. That's my jihad. You can do many things with words. Writing is also a bomb.''
 Ms. El Aroud has not only made a name for herself among devotees of radical forums where she broadcasts her message of hatred toward the West. She also is well known to intelligence officials throughout Europe as simply ''Malika'' -- an Islamist who is at the forefront of the movement by women to take a larger role in the male-dominated global jihad.
 The authorities have noted an increase in suicide bombings carried out by women -- the American military reports that 18 women have conducted suicide missions in Iraq so far this year, compared with 8 all of last year -- but they say there is also a less violent yet potentially more insidious army of women organizers, proselytizers, teachers, translators and fund-raisers, who either join their husbands in the fight or step into the breach as men are jailed or killed.
 ''Women are coming of age in jihad and are entering a world once reserved for men,'' said Claude Moniquet, president of the Brussels-based European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center. ''Malika is a role model, an icon who is bold enough to identify herself. She plays a very important strategic role as a source of inspiration. She's very clever -- and extremely dangerous.''
 Ms. El Aroud began her rise to prominence because of a man in her life. Two days before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, her husband carried out a bombing in Afghanistan that killed the anti-Taliban resistance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud at the behest of Osama bin Laden. Her husband was killed, and she took to the Internet as the widow of a martyr.
 She remarried, and in 2007 she and her new husband were convicted in Switzerland for operating pro-Qaeda Web sites. Now, according to the Belgium authorities, she is a suspect in what the authorities say they believe is a plot to carry out attacks in Belgium.
 ''Vietnam is nothing compared to what awaits you on our lands,'' she wrote to a supposed Western audience in March about wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ''Ask your mothers, your wives to order your coffins.'' To her followers she added: ''Victory is appearing on the horizon, my brothers and sisters. Let's intensify our prayers.''
 Her prolific writing and presence in chat rooms, coupled with her background, makes her a magnet for praise and sympathy. ''Sister Oum Obeyda is virtuous among the virtuous; her life is dedicated to the good on this earth,'' a man named Juba wrote late last year. 
 Changing Role of Women
 The rise of women comes against a backdrop of discrimination that has permeated radical Islam. Mohamed Atta, the Sept. 11 hijacker, wrote in his will that ''women must not be present at my funeral or go to my grave at any later date.''
 Last month, Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda's second in command, said in an online question-and-answer session that women could not join Al Qaeda. In response, a woman wrote on a password-protected radical Web site that ''the answer that we heard was not what we had hoped,'' according to the SITE monitoring group, adding, ''I swear to God I will never leave the path and will not give up this course.''
 The changing role of women in the movement is particularly apparent in Western countries, where Muslim women have been educated to demand their rights and Muslim men are more accustomed to treating them as equals.
 Ms. El Aroud reflects that trend. ''Normally in Islam the men are stronger than the women, but I prove that it is important to fear God -- and no one else,'' she said. ''It is important that I am a woman. There are men who don't want to speak out because they are afraid of getting into trouble. Even when I get into trouble, I speak out.''
 After all, she said, she knows the rules. ''I write in a legal way,'' she said. ''I know what I'm doing. I'm Belgian. I know the system.''
 That system often has been lenient toward her. She was detained last December with 13 others in what the authorities suspected was a plot to free a convicted terrorist from prison and to launch an attack in Brussels. But Belgian law required that they be released within 24 hours, because no charges were brought and searches failed to turn up weapons, explosives or incriminating documents. 
 Now, even as Ms. El Aroud remains under constant surveillance, she is back home rallying militants on her main Internet forum and collecting more than $1,100 a month in government unemployment benefits.
 ''Her jihad is not to lead an operation but to inspire other people to wage jihad,'' said Glenn Audenaert, the director of Belgium's federal police force, in an interview. ''She enjoys the protection that Belgium offers. At the same time, she is a potential threat.''
 Embracing a Strict Islam
 Born in Morocco, reared from a young age in Belgium, Ms. El Aroud did not seem destined for the jihad. 
 Growing up, she rebelled against her Muslim upbringing, she wrote in a memoir. Her first marriage, at 18, was unhappy and brief; she later bore a daughter out of wedlock. 
 Unable to read Arabic, it was her discovery of the Koran in French that led her to embrace a strict version of Islam and eventually to marry Abdessater Dahmane, a Tunisian loyal to Mr. bin Laden.
 Eager to be a battlefield warrior, she said she hoped to fight alongside her husband in Chechnya. But the Chechens ''wanted experienced men, super-well trained,'' she said. ''They wanted women even less.'' 
 In 2001, she followed her husband to Afghanistan. As he trained at a Qaeda camp, she was installed in a camp for foreign women in Jalalabad. 
 For her, the Taliban was a model Islamic government and reports of its mistreatment of women were untrue. ''Women didn't have problems under the Taliban,'' she insisted. ''They had security.''
 Her only rebellion was against the burqa, the restrictive garment the Taliban forced on women, which she called ''a plastic bag.'' As a foreigner, she was allowed to wear a long black veil instead. 
 After her husband's mission, Ms. El Aroud was briefly detained by Mr. Massoud's followers. Frightened, she was put in contact with Belgian authorities, who arranged for her safe passage home. 
 ''We got her out and thought she'd cooperate with us,'' said one senior Belgian intelligence official. ''We were deceived.''
 Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, who was France's senior counterterrorism magistrate at the time, said he had interviewed Ms. El Aroud because investigators suspected that she had shipped electronic equipment to her husband that was used in the killing. ''She is very radical, very sly and very dangerous,'' he said.
 Ms. El Aroud was tried with 22 others in Belgium for complicity in the Massoud killing. As a grieving widow in a black veil, she persuaded the court that she had been doing humanitarian work and knew nothing of her husband's plans. She was acquitted for lack of evidence. 
 Her husband's death, though, propelled her into a new life. ''The widow of a martyr is very important for Muslims,'' she said.
 She used her enhanced status to meet her new ''brothers and sisters'' on the Web. One of them was Moez Garsalloui, a Tunisian several years her junior who had political refugee status in Switzerland. They married and moved to a small Swiss village. There, they ran several pro-Qaeda Web sites and Internet forums that were monitored by Swiss authorities as part of the country' first Internet-related criminal case.
 After the police raided their home and arrested them at dawn in April 2005, Ms. El Aroud extensively described what she called their abuse. 
 ''See what this country that calls us neutral made us suffer,'' she wrote, claiming that the Swiss police beat and blindfolded her husband and manhandled her while she was sleeping unveiled. 
 Convicted last June of promoting violence and supporting a criminal organization, she received a six-month suspended sentence; Mr. Garsalloui, who was convicted of more serious charges, was released after 23 days. Despite Ms. El Aroud's prominence, it is once again her husband whom the authorities view as a bigger threat. They suspect he was recruiting to carry out attacks last December and that he has connections to terrorist groups operating in the tribal areas of Pakistan.
 The authorities say that they lost track of him after he was released from jail last year in Switzerland. ''He is on a trip,'' Ms. El Aroud said cryptically when asked about her husband's whereabouts. ''On a trip.''
 A 'Holy Warrior'
 Meanwhile, her stature has risen higher with her claims of victimization by the Swiss. The Voice of the Oppressed Web site described her as ''our female holy warrior of the 21st century.''
 Her latest tangle with the law hints at a deeper involvement of women in terrorist activities. When she was detained last December in connection with the suspected plot to free Nizar Trabelsi, a convicted terrorist and a onetime professional soccer player, and to attack a target in Brussels, Ms. El Aroud was one of three women taken in for questioning.
 Although the identities of those detained were not released, the Belgian authorities and others familiar with the case said that among those detained were Mr. Trabelsi's wife and Fatima Aberkan, 47, a friend of Ms. El Aroud and a mother of seven.
 ''Malika is a source of inspiration for women because she is telling women to stop sleeping and open their eyes,'' Ms. Aberkan said. 
 Ms. El Aroud operates from her three-room apartment that sits above a clothing shop in a working-class Brussels neighborhood where she spends her time communicating with supporters, mainly on her own forum, Minbar-SOS. 
 Although Ms. El Aroud insists that she is not breaking the law, she knows that the police are watching. And if the authorities find way to put her in prison, she said: ''That would be great. They would make me a living martyr.''

HEADLINE: In Housing, The Strong Turn Weak

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Christine Haughney contributed reporting.

 BODY:
America's home-buying season, when for-sale signs sprout like dandelions, is shaping up to be even worse than expected this year, with prices falling, sales slowing and few signs of a turnaround emerging.
 Two reports released on Tuesday captured the bleak picture. One showed that home prices nationally fell 14.1 percent in March from a year earlier. The other showed sales of new homes, although up slightly in April, remained mired near their lowest levels since 1991.
 While Wall Street is growing hopeful that the economy may dodge a recession, many economists warn that the pain in the housing market may last for several years. 
 Even markets that once seemed immune to the slump, like Seattle, are weakening. Prices nationwide might fall as much as 10 percent more before a recovery takes hold, economists said. 
 As the home-buying season enters what is traditionally its busiest period, there are simply too many homes in many parts of the country, and too few people with the means to buy them. 
 The situation is likely to get worse because a rising tide of foreclosures is flooding the market with even more homes, while a slack economy and tight mortgage market are reducing the pool of potential buyers.
 ''It's like eating beyond your stomach's capacity,'' said Ronald J. Peltier, the chief executive of Home Services of America, which owns real estate brokerage firms across the country. ''We have huge indigestion.'' 
 Sellers confront a sober reality: There are more than 4.5 million homes on the market nationwide. The way houses are selling, it would take nearly 11 months to clear the market. The last time so many homes were for sale was in the early 1980s, when the economy was in a deep recession and interest rates were two to four times as high as they are today.
 The inventory is not spread out evenly across the country. Manhattan and choice neighborhoods in San Francisco and downtown Boston, for example, do not appear to be suffering from the kind of glut that is hurting suburban Phoenix, southern Florida and inland areas of California.
 In Manhattan, prices do not seem to be falling, even though sales dropped 23 percent in April and the first half of May, compared with the same period a year ago, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. The number of units available for sale has risen by 11 percent, to 6,859. 
 Some other cities, like Dallas, Houston and Charlotte, N.C., where home prices did not surge this decade, are not hurting as much either. Charlotte and Dallas were the only areas out of 20 key markets that registered higher prices in March than February.
 In all, however, sales of existing single family homes tumbled 20 percent in the first four months of the year from the comparable period a year ago and are running at their lowest levels since 1998. Sales of new homes have fallen 42 percent over the last year. 
 The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that sales increased 3.3 percent in April from March, when sales tumbled 11 percent, although the increase largely reflected a statistical revision to the earlier figures. 
 In Seattle, where housing had held up better than much of the rest of the country in the last two years, home sales have slowed sharply. Sales in King County, which includes Seattle, fell more than 33 percent in April from the same month a year earlier while the number of homes for sale is up 55 percent. 
 Prices of single-family homes have fallen about 6.5 percent from their peak in July 2007 to February, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index, which tracks prices nationwide.
 As in other regions, the slowdown is hitting outlying areas first and hardest. Sales and prices are still robust in Seattle and affluent suburbs like Bellevue because they are more desirable and closer to big employers.
 ''We are still getting multiple offers on properties there,'' Phil Rodocker, a Seattle-based real estate agent, said about the downtown area and Bellevue. But ''as you move south, every 10 miles south you go, you see more and more short sales and repossessed houses.''
 Builders are having trouble selling units in some newer condominium buildings. Mr. Rodocker got an e-mail message from one developer last week who a few months ago had quickly sold 251 units in a project under construction. Now, investors who had signed contracts to buy 40 of those units had reneged. 
 The units in the Belltown section of Seattle are now being resold for as little as $225,950 for a one-bedroom apartment with one bathroom, prices that Mr. Rodocker said were so low as to be ''ridiculous.'' Last fall, one-bedroom condos in the neighborhood were selling for $260,000 to $290,000, he said. 
 Seeing the number of homes on the market rise and prices fall, buyers are becoming more picky and negotiating harder, he and other agents said. Lower prices usually spur demand, but many buyers are waiting because they think prices will fall farther. 
 One of Mr. Rodocker's clients, Dennis Humphrey, lives south of Seattle in Tukwila and has been looking to buy a home with three or four bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. Parents of 10-year-old twin boys, Mr. Humphrey and his wife live in a rental home and want a bigger place.
 Mr. Humphrey, who works in the home improvement division of Sears, has made offers on two homes, but the sellers have refused to negotiate. He is willing to spend up to $300,000 and has enough money to put 20 percent down, but Mr. Humphrey said he was worried prices were going to fall farther and could wipe out any money he puts into a home.
 ''I am not afraid of the monthly mortgage payment, and I am not afraid of taxes, but I am afraid of losing the value I am putting in,'' he said. ''I believe the right deal will come along, and I am in no rush,'' He added
 About 35 miles south, outside Tacoma, Irene Foster-Worthy and her husband have received no offers on their three-bedroom, two-bath ranch home since they put it on the market a month ago. The couple plan to retire to a home they are buying on an island near the Canadian border to be closer to their children.
 ''Only about four people have come to see it, which makes it difficult to sell,'' she said. 
 While some buyers seem to be waiting, many others have been locked out of the market.
 Since early 2007, lenders have sharply scaled back the easy-lending policies that powered the boom. Most lenders are now making only loans that conform to the standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration, which all require either a substantial down payments or mortgage insurance. 
 ''Once the credit pendulum starts swinging from too easy, it never stops at neutral -- it goes to too tight,'' said Lou Barnes, a mortgage broker in Boulder, Colo., who said he was turning down about two applicants a week. During the boom, he rarely had to turn down borrowers.
 Some analysts say the scrutiny is well deserved even if it slows borrowing and home sales because it will assure better loans are made. Compared with standards over a long period of time, these people say, lending guidelines are not all that conservative; it is just that the nation became accustomed to credit at easy terms. 
 ''One could say there is less money available,'' said Marc McGree, a real estate consultant outside Washington. ''But today's standards really aren't so different from eight years ago or so, before the market overheated.''
 Better lending and cheaper prices should eventually restore balance to the market, economists say. From their peak, prices have already fallen 16 percent, more than half the way to the 25 percent drop that the economists at Lehman Brothers expect, for instance.
 In recent months, sales have increased in some areas with high foreclosure rates like Las Vegas. The increase reflects a rise in the sales of repossessed homes by lenders at lowered prices.
 Some real estate officials say places like Boston, which led the national downturn, may be approaching a bottom. Home prices there appear to be falling more slowly than before, and the number of homes for sale declined in the first quarter. J. Patrick Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty, the real estate brokerage firm, says his agents are seeing more buyers shopping for homes.
 Places ''that did not have huge run-ups or were very early are doing well,'' he said. ''Boston is one of those.''
 Still, sales of single-family homes and condos fell by more than a third in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2007, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors. 
 Edward E. Leamer, a professor of economics and statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles, said this real estate downturn was playing out differently than the one in the early 1990s, when prices fell gradually over several years in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere. The sharper and more rapid decline now probably reflects the impact of easy lending during the recent boom. As a result, it might also augur for a somewhat faster recovery, but Mr. Leamer is not ready to predict when that will be.
 ''You will eventually get to the point where you will find a market equilibrium,'' he said. But ''the economist's model for supply and demand doesn't tell you how long it will take to get there.''

HEADLINE: Iran and the Inspectors

 BODY:
Amid all of the White House's saber-rattling, it is tempting to discount Iran's genuine misbehavior. The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency is a grim reminder that Tehran is pressing ahead with its nuclear program, and the United States and its allies don't have a strategy for containing it. 
 For the last five years, Iran has been playing cat-and-mouse with nuclear inspectors. The I.A.E.A. turns up worrying hints of illicit activities, and Iran's leaders insist they are trying to produce nuclear energy, not a bomb. Iranian officials then balk at answering critical questions, providing essential documents or access to related sites, leaving the world no choice but to suspect the worst. The I.A.E.A. often couches its findings in soothing diplomatese. But the latest report makes clear that its experts are deeply frustrated.
 The report says that Iran continues to defy the United Nations Security Council by enriching uranium -- usable for reactors, or with a little more work, a weapon -- and is building ever-more-powerful centrifuges. It also expresses serious concerns about evidence (outlined in 18 documents accompanying the report) that Iran is working on programs with clear military applications: developing high-voltage detonators, underground testing and redesigning the Shahab-3 missile, possibly to accommodate a nuclear warhead. 
 And why, as the report asks, is Iran's military involved in ''procurement activities'' for the program if it is intended only for nuclear power? Why indeed.
 This latest report is alarming, but it must not be used as an excuse by Washington hard-liners to launch another war. There are no good military options.
 The United States and the other major powers -- Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- have yet to put together a serious package of incentives and sanctions that might persuade Iran to change course. 
 That must include a credible American offer of security guarantees and normalized relations if Tehran abandons any nuclear weapons ambitions. If Iran persists, it must face sanctions with a lot more bite than Russia and China have been willing to consider, including a broader ban on doing business with Iranian banks and bans on arms sales and new investments in Iran. 
 Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, is scheduled to visit Tehran next month and present an enhanced incentives package. Insiders say it differs little from one proposed in 2006. We hope they are wrong. Before Mr. Solana goes, the major powers need to come up with a more compelling list of rewards and punishments. Too much time has already been wasted.

HEADLINE: The Rich Get Hungrier

BYLINE: By AMARTYA SEN. 
Amartya Sen, who teaches economics and philosophy at Harvard, received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1998 and is the author, most recently, of ''Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny.''

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 WILL the food crisis that is menacing the lives of millions ease up -- or grow worse over time? The answer may be both. The recent rise in food prices has largely been caused by temporary problems like drought in Australia, Ukraine and elsewhere. Though the need for huge rescue operations is urgent, the present acute crisis will eventually end. But underlying it is a basic problem that will only intensify unless we recognize it and try to remedy it. 
 It is a tale of two peoples. In one version of the story, a country with a lot of poor people suddenly experiences fast economic expansion, but only half of the people share in the new prosperity. The favored ones spend a lot of their new income on food, and unless supply expands very quickly, prices shoot up. The rest of the poor now face higher food prices but no greater income, and begin to starve. Tragedies like this happen repeatedly in the world. 
 A stark example is the Bengal famine of 1943, during the last days of the British rule in India. The poor who lived in cities experienced rapidly rising incomes, especially in Calcutta, where huge expenditures for the war against Japan caused a boom that quadrupled food prices. The rural poor faced these skyrocketing prices with little increase in income. 
 Misdirected government policy worsened the division. The British rulers were determined to prevent urban discontent during the war, so the government bought food in the villages and sold it, heavily subsidized, in the cities, a move that increased rural food prices even further. Low earners in the villages starved. Two million to three million people died in that famine and its aftermath.
 Much discussion is rightly devoted to the division between haves and have-nots in the global economy, but the world's poor are themselves divided between those who are experiencing high growth and those who are not. The rapid economic expansion in countries like China, India and Vietnam tends to sharply increase the demand for food. This is, of course, an excellent thing in itself, and if these countries could manage to reduce their unequal internal sharing of growth, even those left behind there would eat much better. 
 But the same growth also puts pressure on global food markets -- sometimes through increased imports, but also through restrictions or bans on exports to moderate the rise in food prices at home, as has happened recently in countries like India, China, Vietnam and Argentina. Those hit particularly hard have been the poor, especially in Africa.
 There is also a high-tech version of the tale of two peoples. Agricultural crops like corn and soybeans can be used for making ethanol for motor fuel. So the stomachs of the hungry must also compete with fuel tanks. 
 Misdirected government policy plays a part here, too. In 2005, the United States Congress began to require widespread use of ethanol in motor fuels. This law combined with a subsidy for this use has created a flourishing corn market in the United States, but has also diverted agricultural resources from food to fuel. This makes it even harder for the hungry stomachs to compete.
 Ethanol use does little to prevent global warming and environmental deterioration, and clear-headed policy reforms could be urgently carried out, if American politics would permit it. Ethanol use could be curtailed, rather than being subsidized and enforced. 
 The global food problem is not being caused by a falling trend in world production, or for that matter in food output per person (this is often asserted without much evidence). It is the result of accelerating demand. However, a demand-induced problem also calls for rapid expansion in food production, which can be done through more global cooperation. 
 While population growth accounts for only a modest part of the growing demand for food, it can contribute to global warming, and long-term climate change can threaten agriculture. Happily, population growth is already slowing and there is overwhelming evidence that women's empowerment (including expansion of schooling for girls) can rapidly reduce it even further.
 What is most challenging is to find effective policies to deal with the consequences of extremely asymmetric expansion of the global economy. Domestic economic reforms are badly needed in many slow-growth countries, but there is also a big need for more global cooperation and assistance. The first task is to understand the nature of the problem.

 TWO FORMER EUROPEAN RIVALS
 Learn to Feel the Love
 Journalists and experts in Germany and Poland see a thaw in relations between the two nations. Theirs is a shared history marked by armed conflict and a shifting border until the end of World War II. But many say the two countries have realized that they are stronger -- politically and economically -- working in concert than when they are at odds. PAGE A8 
 AID WORKERS TRICKLE INTO MYANMAR
 The junta that controls the government of Myanmar promised the United Nations that it would open the country to aid workers aiming to provide relief to the areas hit by the May 3 cyclone. And while relief agencies say workers are reaching some of the country's remote areas, the workers number fewer than 20. As many as 135,000 people are dead or missing, and the U.N. estimates that 1.5 million survivors have yet to receive any aid. PAGE A7 
 MULLING BAN ON FAR-RIGHT GROUP
 Germany's National Democratic Party is facing tough competition from the nation's growing left, and some of the xenophobic, anti-European group's leaders are under criminal investigation. Authorities in Germany are trying to decide whether to ban the country's floundering extreme-right party or to allow it to self-destruct. But many worry that banning the party could result in a political backlash that would only strengthen it and embolden its supporters. PAGE A9 
 AN EX-LOVER SPURS A RESIGNATION
 The end of Maxime Bernier's tenure as Canada's minister of foreign affairs was hastened by an assertion made by a former lover that Mr. Bernier left confidential government documents in her suburban Montreal apartment. For weeks, many opposition politicians have argued that his former lover's ties to organized crime figures threatened the nation's national security. Prime Minister Stephen Harper initially dismissed the hullabaloo as the concerns of ''gossipy old busybodies,'' but Mr. Bernier's romance could spell trouble for his Conservative Party. PAGE A11

 MCCAIN, CLINTON AND OBAMA
 Sign Darfur Pledge
 Senators John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama agreed to a rare joint statement accusing the Sudanese government of atrocities against civilians. Though the statement is chiefly ceremonial -- it does not call for any government action to be taken against the Sudanese government -- the three said it was to send a message to President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan that the next American president will continue to sound an alarm on Darfur. PAGE A17 
 POST-KATRINA HOMELESSNESS
 Homelessness has become a much more visible problem in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, especially along a bleak stretch near Canal Street that is home to a tent city. Many of its inhabitants are looking for aid with housing and health care, but it isn't coming fast enough. ''Two outreach workers have tested positive for tuberculosis,'' one aid worker said. ''There's hepatitis C, there's AIDS, there's H.I.V. Everyone out there's had an eye infection of some sort. I got one.'' PAGE A14 
 WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS ON CLIMATE
 A new report by the federal government says that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities is altering climate patterns and vegetation across the country. The highly detailed report contained some sobering information about the next 25 to 50 years -- and the signature of three cabinet secretaries, which reflects a big shift by the Bush administration on climate science. PAGE A14 
 IMAGINING THE NEXT COURT
 Though the general election is months away, it seems it's never too early to begin handicapping what the federal courts would look like under the administration of the three major party candidates. Senator John McCain has employed the language of the conservative faithful, notably inveighing against ''activist judges.'' A Democratic administration, however, could see the naming of the nation's first Asian-American or Hispanic Supreme Court justice. PAGE A17

 TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY:
 That Is the Question for Renters
 The case for renting has been simple enough. House prices rose so high in the first half of this decade that you could often get more for your money by renting. You could also avoid having a large part of your net worth tied up in a speculative bubble. But with the burst of the bubble, David Leonhardt began a search, he writes in his column -- one that ended with signing a contract to buy a house. A conversion story. PAGE C1 
 THE IPHONE'S SECOND ACT
 After almost a year of strong sales that have made it one of the dominant products in the U.S. smartphone category, iPhone sales have settled to roughly 600,000 units a month, according to Apple. The company needs to sell 4.5 million phones by the end of the year to reach Mr. Jobs's publicly stated goal of 10 million for the handheld's first 18 months in the market, an objective it hopes to reach with the help of an updated version of the phone, rumored to be set for release next month.

 AGING VERMONT PLANT STIRS DEBATE
 After part of a cooling tower collapsed at Vermont's only nuclear power plant, the company that runs it blamed rotting wooden timbers that it had failed to inspect properly. The uproar that followed rekindled environmental groups' hopes of shutting down the aging plant. The proposed closing gained some support this year among Vermont politicians, and the resulting debate is bringing into sharp relief a conflict between two objectives long held by environmental advocates: combating nuclear power and stopping global warming. PAGE C1 
 CHIEF OF VODAFONE RESIGNS
 The chief executive of Vodafone, Arun Sarin, who steered the cellphone operator in a sometimes tempestuous five-year pursuit of growth, will resign at the end of July, the company said. The timing of the announcement surprised some analysts, because Mr. Sarin had recently solidified his leadership after a rough start. ''This was the right time to leave. We are now well-positioned strategically,'' Mr. Sarin said. PAGE C3 
 INVESTORS CRITICIZE FRENCH BANK
 Shareholders at the French bank Societe Generale were given their first chance to challenge management on a loss of 4.9 billion euros ($7.1 billion) since a trader made unauthorized bets worth nearly 50 billion euros ($79 billion) for more than two years. At the bank's annual meeting, several investors, accusing management of transforming the bank into a casino, called for the resignation of the chairman and asked why the head of the investment banking division was still in his job.

 NEW YORK REPORT 
 AN UNWELCOME REMINDER
 Of Harlem's Bloody Past
 Residents and police continued to try to sort out what led to the gunfire that erupted and wounded six teenagers after a blue-sky Memorial Day in Marcus Garvey Park, in Central Harlem, where hundreds had gathered for barbecues. Some said a dispute over a girl had spread wildly; others vaguely cited a turf war. The shootings caused widespread confusion in the neighborhood and a creeping fear that the violence that had once defined life in Harlem was making an unwelcome return. ''It was like the Wild West,'' said one witness. PAGE B1 
 THE ADIRONDACKS' ELUSIVE MASCOT
 For sale in the sachet-scented gift shops of Lake Placid are moose-inspired cookie jars, moose-shaped soaps, moose-head lollipops and moose-emblazoned kitchen mitts. But while it may be the overworked symbol of the Adirondacks, the moose, which has returned to northern New York over the last quarter-century, remains a mystery. Wildlife biologists are unsure whether the area's small population is on the verge of an explosion or headed for an eventual decline because of global warming. PAGE B1

 REVISITING THE WORK
 Of Sydney Pollack
 A.O. Scott writes that Sydney Pollack, the movie director who died Monday at the age of 73, was not the kind of Hollywood auteur whose work was full of familiar flourishes that made it immediately identifiable. The director of ''Tootsie'' and ''Out of Africa,'' however, was adept at giving his big-name actors room to shine, and ''turning out high-quality commercial entertainments that did not shy away from ethical and political engagement.''

 PLAYING WITH FIRE (AND GLASS)
 ''Who knew you could knit and crochet in glass?'' Tom Scott asked. And surely, it may be the first time anyone has crocheted with safety goggles. He is one of the designers experimenting with the boundaries of glass in the Corning GlassLab, a mobile hot-glass studio which is currently at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. ''A big part of this process was an exploration in boundaries and how far you can push them, and knowing what your restrictions as a designer might be,'' one designer said. PAGE E1 
 BOND. JAMES BOND. AGAIN.
 Ian Fleming may be long gone, but his enduring work -- James Bond -- has been resuscitated countless times.

And we finally learn how the dashing man of mystery likes his black pepper: cracked, not ground. PAGE E1 
 NETWORKS TEAM UP FOR TELETHON
 ABC, CBS and NBC have all agreed to set aside the same hour of prime-time television on the first Friday night in September for a live, joint telethon benefiting cancer research. The event means the hosts of the three network nightly news broadcasts -- Charles Gibson of ABC, Katie Couric of CBS, and Brian Williams of NBC -- had to shelve their competitive instincts, at least temporarily. Each of the three anchors has had a member of their immediate family die of the disease. PAGE E3

 Though he grew up in a sod-roofed log cabin and dropped out of school at 14, he went on to become one of the richest men in the United States largely on the strength of a novel idea: the frozen french fry. He was almost ostentatiously modest despite his means, wearing the same pair of eyeglasses for thirty years, and driving a Lincoln Town Car whose license plate read ''Mr. Spud.'' PAGE B6

 NEW YORK'S OYSTER RENAISSANCE HAS ITS ROOTS IN SMALL SOURCES
 New York's love of food is legendary, capricious and varied. So is its romance with the oyster, which has seen more ups and downs than the stock market.

Small farms have switched from hobbyists to serious providers, supplying everybody from restaurants to locals picking up for a potluck dinner. Page F1

 In true, dry British fashion, they've dubbed their basic bitter ale ordinary.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Chance on Warming

 BODY:
For seven long years, President Bush has refused to confront the challenge of climate change and provide the leadership that this country and the world needs to reduce greenhouse gases and avoid the destructive consequences of global warming. 
 The Senate, and all three presidential candidates, have a chance to provide that leadership. Next week, the Senate is scheduled to take up a bill sponsored by John Warner, the Virginia Republican, and Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut independent, that seeks aggressively to reduce emissions from all sectors of the economy. 
 Mr. Bush, predictably, opposes the bill. Add that to the slim Democratic majority and the complexity of the bill itself, and the chances of getting 60 filibuster-proof votes are modest at best. Even so, a majority vote would create positive momentum for the next Congress and send a strong signal to the country and the world that help on this issue is on the way. 
 For that reason, it is crucial for John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton to show up and vote for this bill. All are on record as supporting mandatory cuts in greenhouse gases. A pressing campaign schedule is no excuse for not being counted on an issue this important to the nation's future. 
 The Senate last addressed climate change in 2003 when it cast 43 votes in favor of a bill sponsored by Mr. McCain and Mr. Lieberman. This bill is even more ambitious. It calls for a 70 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- requiring, in turn, a huge change in the way the country creates, delivers and uses energy. It imposes a price on carbon to make sure that happens. It also creates a compelling array of incentives for new and cleaner technologies and offers ways to combat long-neglected problems like deforestation.
 Since that 2003 vote, the arguments for action have only gotten stronger. Mr. Bush has left a deep-seated impression that mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide would bankrupt the country or at the very least severely damage it by driving energy prices through the roof. 
 Every serious study shows that this is simply not true and that a well-designed, market-based program could yield positive economic gains -- greater energy efficiency, technological innovation and reduced reliance on foreign oil. The same studies also make clear that the costs of inaction will dwarf the costs of acting now. The bill's proponents must make sure that the economics of this debate are framed in a positive way.
 The scientific case for action, strong five years ago, is even more persuasive now. Authoritative assessments from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, among other studies, have left little doubt that the world is heating up, that man-made emissions are largely responsible and that swift action is necessary to avoid widespread environmental damage. 
 Mr. Bush can no longer plausibly deny the science. What he continues to resist is the need for a full-throated response. The Senate can usher in a new era of American leadership when it convenes next week.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 31, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Wednesday about climate change cited the wrong year for the most recent Senate vote on the McCain-Lieberman bill. The Senate last voted on the proposal in 2005, not 2003.

HEADLINE: Can He Take A Frisk?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
After ''Rahmbo'' Emanuel, the Illinois congressman dubbed ''the hostage negotiator'' by the Obama forces, fails to talk Hillary down, Barack Obama knows that he is left with one final roll of the dice. He sets up a secret meeting with Bill Clinton in neutral territory at Rahm's hideaway office in the Capitol.
 Bill arrives two hours late, red-faced and truculent. 
 ''If you brought me over here to cry uncle, shame on you, Barack Obama. You and your press lackeys are engaged in a cover-up even though Hillary's winnin' the popular vote and the general election.''
 ''Hey, Bill, please, stop wagging your finger at me. Call off Harold Ickes and the Hillaryland Huns. You're right. I can't win without her. The two of us can clean McCain's grandfather clock.''
 ''Goshalmighty. You could knock me over with a hair on a biscuit, Barack. Smart move, everybody wins. Now Hillary won't be the skunk at your Denver garden party.''
 ''That's why they call me: No Drama Obama.''
 ''You're a natural, like me. I was for hope; you are for hope. I was for change; you are for change. I took the Camelot sword from J.F.K.; you took it from Teddy. I would have been with you from the beginning except for that little deal I had with Hillary. She's going to be so relieved that she doesn't have to return to the back rows of the Senate with everybody there snickering that she flopped. And if something happens to you, God forbid, she's right there in the Situation Room, ready to go at 3 a.m. on her Day One.''
 ''Yeah. I really want to announce this quickly, so let's clear up a few niggling details.''
 ''Thank goodness you've got Jim Johnson frisking me. He's the guy who missed all the baggage weighing down Geraldine Ferraro's husband.''
 ''Mr. President, I'm going to run a very transparent administration, everything on C-Span. So I'll need a full accounting of your foundation donors.''
 ''Oh, sure thing, buddy, from this day forward.''
 ''No, Bill, we'll need full disclosure of your business dealings for the last eight years. And you can no longer accept Arab millions -- not if I'm going to talk tough to them about oil. I can't send Hillary on diplomatic missions to the Middle East if you're taking money from Dubai and Kuwait. And no more trips to Kazakhstan. I wouldn't want to have to put a Geiger-counter bracelet on you to check that you're not involved in another shady uranium deal.''
 ''Ha, ha.''
 ''We need to know where that $11 million came from that you guys loaned your campaign. And the $15 million from Ron Burkle at Yucaipa and the $3 million from Vinod Gupta. And you must spill about any offshore accounts in the Caymans. And no more big-money speeches, Bill. You guys have already cashed in for more than $100 million.''
 ''You're right, Barack, no more speeches. Just conversations. If a C.E.O. interviews me in front of a small audience, that's fine. But no speeches.''
 ''I'm not debating the meaning of the word 'speech,' Bill. We're going to have an administration so squeaky clean that it makes Jimmy Carter look like Marc Rich. All your trips abroad will have to be authorized by a higher authority.''
 ''The State Department? Fine, I'll check with them.''
 ''Higher.''
 ''Oh, no. Not that.''
 ''Yes, Michelle. She'll have you on a much shorter leash, Bill, and it's not so fun. There'll be no more Ron Air, no Burkling and Binging. Eight long years of Michelle watching your every move. No eruptions of any kind. And that big telescope in the Naval Observatory is off limits. We're going to be a family-values administration. And in the campaign, we'll use you the way Al Gore did: Not at all. No more Bill YouTube meltdowns.''
 ''You know, Barack, the more I'm seein' what you've got in mind for me, the more I'm worryin' that Hillary's just not cut out for this job. You don't want her glomming on to everythin'. Since she's almost even with the delegates, she'll want to go halfsies in the government. She'll want to run foreign policy, cause you know nothin' about that. And legal stuff, because you never practiced real law. And economic policy, 'cause she connected better with working-class voters. And everything to do with white people, of course. I've got to level with you, man. Hillary's a lot of work. And that Kathleen Sebelius is terrific and has those twinkly eyes.''
 ''So, Bill, you're not wedded to Hillary being vice president? You won't sabotage my campaign if I pick somebody I like, I mean, like, if I pick somebody else?''
 ''Nah. Now that I see the big picture, the idea of Hillary as your No. 2 was always a fairy tale.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Miss Marks To Finance Convention

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The Democratic Party is struggling to raise money for its convention in Denver on Aug. 25-28, with fund-raising by the host committee falling far short of the party's goals and lagging behind the Republicans' efforts for their convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul. 
 So far, the Denver host committee is about $15 million short of the $40.6 million it must raise by June 16. With only $25 million raised so far, the committee is scrambling to offer a new round of special deals for corporate underwriters, as well as to devise a backup plan should the fund-raising fall short and plans for the convention need to be scaled down. 
 ''We will raise the money,'' Chris Lopez, a spokesman for the host committee, said. ''We are working every day to get it done. We are in a situation where we have to get it done and we will. We can't make any excuses.'' 
 There are many reasons that have been floated for the money woes faced by the Denver committee. It is not uncommon for host committees to lag in fund-raising, only to see large donations arrive in the month before the convention. And some are concerned that the protracted nominating fight between Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has made fund-raising more difficult. 
 The Democrats' situation contrasts markedly with that of the Republicans, whose committee is on budget in its $39 million fund-raising drive for the Republican National Convention, to be held in Minneapolis-St. Paul on Sept. 1-4. Teresa McFarland, a spokeswoman for the host committee, said it expected to meet its June 15 target of having 80 percent of the money raised by that date. 
 In fact, the Twin Cities committee has budgeted $58 million for the convention, nearly $20 million more than it is contracted with the Republican National Committee to raise. Half of that $58 million is to be raised from Minnesota companies, and half from national fund-raising, according to the committee's marketing material. 
 Ms. McFarland said that her committee had been aided by the fact that 19 Fortune 500 companies are located in the region and that ''we have been thrilled with the generous support of the local community.'' 
 Mr. Lopez cited a lagging economy in explaining the Democrats' fund-raising problems. Since the bulk of the money is raised from major corporations, corporate financial restraints are affecting all charitable contributions, the Denver committee included. 
 ''We've got to deal with the fact that there is belt-tightening all across corporate America,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''They are reducing spending, and that has had a big impact. We are no different than others trying to raise money in this environment. Everyone is facing it.'' 
 Even so, Mr. Lopez says Denver is ahead of where Boston was in 2004 at this time.
 The Boston host committee was far behind in fund-raising before the Democratic convention, but made it up in a last-minute blitz headed by Senator John Kerry, the party's nominee, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the committee's co-chairman.
 Denver's mayor, John W. Hickenlooper, has suggested that the Democrats' long nominating battle has distracted potential donors. But, no matter the obstacles, the Denver host committee is aggressively packaging corporate sponsorships that promise corporate executives access to key politicians in return for writing a check to the host committee. 
 In addition, the Denver committee is appealing to civic pride. 
 ''This is a historic event for Denver,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''It's the first national convention in the interior West. It gives Denver a chance to demonstrate that it can host a national convention and show that Denver has the wherewithal to raise money and be the place where you want to be.'' 
 In addition to the millions in corporate donations to the host committees, each party will get $16.3 million in federal dollars to pay for convention expenses, generally the salaries and travel expenses of party officials who work on the convention. On top of that, each city will also get $50 million in federal antiterrorism money to pay for security at the conventions. 
 Over the years, the price of the conventions has continued to rise, causing many campaign finance experts to raise questions about whether the host committees are really civic boosters or have become yet another venue for special interest groups to gain access to politicians. 
 The money raised by the host committees goes to build the podium, buy the balloons, build the skyboxes and the news media centers, rent the arena, and make all the internal changes to the structures where the conventions will be held. While the money is raised by the host committee, it is spent by the party. 
 Clearly, Denver is marketing political access to corporations. One big selling point is that host committee donors will be able to come into contact with 232 members of Congress, 51 senators and 28 governors, according to the committee's promotional literature. 
 Big ticket corporate donors -- at the presidential level ($1 million), the platinum level ($500,000) and gold ($250,000) -- are promised invitations to private events sponsored by Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado and Ken Salazar, the Democratic senator from the state, according to the literature. 
 Companies that have already donated to the Denver committee and whose logos appear on the committee's Web site include the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Merck, Lilly, Allstate, Travelers, Lehman Brothers, A.T.& T., Visa, Target and Western Union. 
 Even though the Denver Host Committee has missed its fund-raising targets, the Democratic Party does not appear to be concerned. 
 ''We remain focused on planning and executing a world-class convention that showcases our nominee, our party and the best of Denver and the Rocky Mountain West,'' Natalie Wyeth, press secretary for the party's convention committee, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Using the President, but Carefully Going Only So Far

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Las Vegas.

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
The last time the two met -- 83 days ago -- President Bush promised that he would do whatever Senator John McCain asked him to do to help elect him the 44th president. 
 ''You know, if he wants me to show up, I will,'' Mr. Bush said in the Rose Garden. ''If he wants me to say, 'You know, I'm not for him,' I will.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush's role became much clearer when he held his first event for Mr. McCain. He will show up to raise money (thank you very much), and he will say and do as little as possible, at least in public view. 
 A large, and presumably public, fund-raiser at the Convention Center here was hastily rescheduled for the seclusion of a private home on Tuesday evening in Scottsdale. Mr. McCain's main public appearance of the day was a foreign policy speech in Denver, not the visit by the president to his home state.
 Mr. McCain used the speech, like others in recent weeks, to draw differences between his policies and Mr. Bush's, even as Democrats redoubled their efforts to lash them together into an inextricable McBush '08.
 The senator and Mr. Bush avoided any meaningful public appearance together, planning just the briefest of photo opportunities at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in the evening. Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush emerged from opposite sides of their limousine at the airport. They shook hands and waved, and Mr. Bush got on his plane without making a public statement. The joint appearance lasted less than a minute.
 For all the McCain campaign's efforts to exploit the president's trip and then minimize it, the question of Mr. Bush's role as the head of the Republican Party for the last seven years hovered -- like the elephant in the room, say --and will almost certainly do so until Election Day.
 Senator Barack Obama, inching closer to the Democratic nomination, seized on the occasion while speaking about the mortgage crisis in Nevada. 
 ''John McCain is having a different kind of meeting,'' Mr. Obama said after meeting a family in Las Vegas on the verge of losing its house to foreclosure. ''He's holding a fund-raiser with George Bush behind closed doors in Arizona. No cameras, no reporters. And we all know why. 
 ''Senator McCain doesn't want to be seen, hat in hand, with the president whose failed policies he promises to continue for another four years.''
 The politicking seemed far removed from the sunny day at the White House in March when Mr. McCain, still flush from his triumph over a crowded primary field, and Mr. Bush appeared like two old friends. Despite a bitterness attached to the 2000 primaries, Mr. McCain promised ''to have as much possible campaigning events together.'' 
 More than once, though, he alluded to Mr. Bush's ''heavy'' or ''busy'' schedule, which in hindsight perhaps had more significance than it might have seemed.
 Mr. Bush made an early fund-raising stop in New Mexico on Tuesday, but his ''heavy schedule'' otherwise included a visit to Silverado Cable, a company in Mesa, Ariz., that makes electrical wiring for aircraft.
 He did not mention Mr. McCain, nor did Mr. McCain mention him in Denver. 
 For Mr. Bush, with seemingly irreversible public disapproval in the polls, the start of his campaign to help elect a Republican successor could hardly have seemed more humbling, though the White House maintained its typical enthusiasm and optimism.
 ''He's not bothered in the slightest,'' the White House press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said. ''He fully understands how campaigns for presidents work, and he's comfortable in his own skin.''
 Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who wrote ''Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy,'' said core supporters possessed a hardened realism about Mr. McCain's prospects, understanding the challenges but not yielding to them.
 ''Even diehard Bush supporters know he's an albatross around the neck of the nominee,'' Mr. Bartlett said in an interview.
 At the same time, he noted the president's fund-raising prowess. Despite the efforts by the McCain camp to keep at arm's length a president with an approval rating stalled at 28 percent, it is worth remembering that that 28 percent can be fiercely loyal and often wealthy.
 Even before Tuesday, Mr. Bush had raised $36 million for Republican candidates and committees in 19 fund-raisers this year, or nearly one a week. In addition to the fund-raisers on Tuesday, Mr. Bush has three more this week. 
 ''He is very popular with high-dollar donors,'' Mr. Bartlett said of the president. 
 Mr. McCain's campaign has made clear its satisfaction with that arrangement, but it could be difficult to sustain through a year of campaigning. On the horizon is Mr. Bush's role in the Republican convention in September.

HEADLINE: WITH BOLD STEPS, FED CHIEF QUIETS SOME CRITICISM

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Over a frantic weekend in mid-March, Ben S. Bernanke rewrote the rule book as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Like a military commander applying overwhelming force, he took steps then and over the next two months that some at the central bank are now calling the Bernanke Doctrine. 
 Today, Mr. Bernanke appears to have quieted many critics, especially on Wall Street, who earlier said he was overly academic and slow to react to market conditions. 
 But at the same time, new criticisms have surfaced that Mr. Bernanke has fanned inflation and contributed to the decline of the dollar by aggressively cutting interest rates. Some say he has put at risk billions in public funds by accepting devalued assets like mortgages and auto loans as collateral for loans to financial institutions. And by thrusting the Fed into new realms of intervention and regulation, he has raised questions about whether he is threatening the Fed's independence. 
 ''It has been a really head-spinning range of unprecedented and bold actions,'' said Charles W. Calomiris, professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School, referring to the Fed's lending activities. ''That is exactly as it should be. But I'm not saying that it's without some cost and without some risk.''
 Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a close Bernanke ally, defines the Fed chief's ''doctrine'' as the overpowering use of monetary policies and lending to avert an economic collapse. ''Ben has, in very consequential ways, altered the framework for how central banks operate in crises,'' he said. ''Some will criticize it and some will praise it, and it will certainly be examined for decades.''
 Mr. Bernanke's actions have transformed his image as a self-effacing former economics professor.
 ''I am tempted to think of him as somewhat Buddha-like,'' said Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. ''He's developed a serenity based on a growing understanding of the hardball ways the system actually works. You can see that it's no longer an academic or theoretical exercise for him.''
 Within the Bush administration, Mr. Bernanke's willingness to work with Democrats in Congress on measures to prevent mortgage foreclosures has stirred unease. ''The fact that he, an appointee of George Bush, has come very close to advocating -- though he hasn't quite advocated it -- a piece of legislation that George Bush threatened to veto is an illustration of his willingness to put his head on the chopping block,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton and friend of the Fed chief. 
 One reason Mr. Bernanke is sticking his neck out is that he believes the broader economy's recovery depends on the housing sector, which remains in a serious slump. Plenty of new evidence surfaced on Tuesday that this year's spring home-buying season will be dismal, with one report showing that prices fell 14.1 percent in March from a year earlier and another that new-home sales are down 42 percent over the last year. 
 Among Democrats, Mr. Bernanke, a Republican, had previously been criticized by such party luminaries as the two former Clinton administration Treasury secretaries, Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence E. Summers, who worried that he was downplaying the dangers of a recession. But that view has changed.
 ''I think in the last few months they've handled themselves very sure-footedly,'' Mr. Rubin said of the Fed. Many Democrats in Congress agree.
 ''They say that crisis makes the man,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. ''He's made believers out of people who were just not sure about him before.''
 To lessen the chances of a financial collapse, Mr. Bernanke engineered the takeover of one investment bank, Bear Stearns, and tossed credit lifelines to others with exotic new lending facilities -- the Fed now has seven such lending windows, some of them for investment banks as well as commercial banks.
 He also allowed the Fed to accept assets of debatable value -- mortgage-backed securities, car loans and credit card debt -- as collateral for some Fed loans. For the first time ever, he installed Fed regulators inside investment banks to inspect their books. 
 Much to the dismay of conservative economists, Mr. Bernanke has also presided over an extraordinarily aggressive series of interest rate cuts, lowering the fed funds rate seven times, to 2 percent from 5.75 percent, since last September, though it has signaled a pause in further rate-cutting barring a further crisis.
 That performance has brought outside criticism as well as dissent within the Fed. Economists who played prominent roles in past Republican administrations, John B. Taylor at Stanford and Martin Feldstein at Harvard, are among the critics. Mr. Taylor, author of the so-called Taylor rule, which calls for a careful alignment of interest rates and inflation expectations, said the Fed's rate-cutting was ''risky with respect to inflation and the dollar.'' 
 His criticism, and the fact that other economists cite the Taylor rule, has made the Fed somewhat defensive. In a recent speech, Kevin M. Warsh, a Bernanke ally and Fed governor, said that while the Taylor rule provided a ''reasonable description'' of the last 20 years, it failed to account for recent conditions.
 Mr. Feldstein, also in an interview, said the lower interest rates made him nervous as do the new lending windows and acceptance of questionable collateral. These steps, he added, are not likely to help an economy that needs time digesting the housing crisis and lack of confidence among consumers.
 ''I frankly don't think there is more that the Fed can do to deal with the fundamental problems of the economy right now,'' he said. ''They have done at least as much as they needed to do. They may have done too much.''
 Also warning against Fed overreaching has been Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman who battled inflation in the 1980s. In speeches and testimony, Mr. Volcker suggested that the central bank's interventions, particularly its direct role in the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in March, could compromise its independence.
 Another friend of Mr. Bernanke, Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist, said the Fed chairman was taking the central bank into a new era in which it could be difficult to ward off political pressures in the future.
 ''The Fed has been spectacularly successful at maintaining its independence,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''That's going to be much tougher if they take on a lot of new regulatory responsibilities.'' 
 The Bush administration has proposed that, in the future, the Fed be given an expanded regulatory role. But Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., in presenting a blueprint for reform, has left unclear what powers the Fed would have.
 By all accounts, the recent actions under Mr. Bernanke have been taken in an atmosphere of debate and even anguish.
 The policy of lowering interest rates was especially hotly debated within the Fed, according to the minutes of the last meeting of policymakers.
 ''The Fed has worked hard for 30 years to develop credibility with the public that we will deliver on low and stable inflation,'' said Charles I. Plosser, who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia voted against the two recent interest cuts. ''That credibility is hard to earn, but easy to lose if you're not careful.''
 But both Mr. Plosser and the other dissenter on interest rates last month, Mr. Fisher of the Dallas Fed, said in interviews that they appreciated Mr. Bernanke's efforts at listening to dissent and his creativity.
 ''These new facilities are Ben's initiatives,'' Mr. Plosser said in an interview. ''He has been willing to take a fresh look at how the system works and press the boundaries in a thoughtful way.''
 Mr. Bernanke has impressed many colleagues and lawmakers with his political skills, gently conveying his views behind the scenes to both Democrats and Republicans.
 For example, in the last month, he and his staff have worked with Democrats in Congress to produce housing legislation to prevent more mortgage foreclosures, getting well out in front of the Bush administration, which was threatening to veto one version of the legislation.
 On another occasion, when the Fed chairman called for banks to write down the principal of delinquent mortgages, his pre-emptive move rankled some in the Bush administration. The Fed chief called Mr. Paulson to apologize for not giving the administration an advance warning of his position.
 Mr. Bernanke, on the other hand, pleased the Bush administration by pressing reluctant Democrats to seek more drastic changes in the governance and capitalization of the two big federal mortgage-finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. ''You're never going to have two people with an identical approach,'' Mr. Paulson said of himself and the chairman. ''But not only have our goals been the same, I think the way we've come together has been similar. Ben is smart, creative, open to new ideas and always looking around the next corner.''
 Other associates of the Fed chief say the extraordinary crisis atmosphere of the last year has stiffened Mr. Bernanke's resolve, but also caused him anguish.
 ''Ben is one of these guys who is outwardly calm and has inner stomachaches,'' Professor Blinder said. ''He's under a tremendous amount of strain.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman misattributed comments about the Fed's new lending programs for financial institutions. The quotations -- ''These new facilities are Ben's initiatives'' and ''He has been willing to take a fresh look at how the system works and press the boundaries in a thoughtful way'' -- were by Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank -- not by Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.
 The article also misstated the interest rate in September, when the Fed began lowering the rate it sets for overnight loans between banks, known as the federal funds rate. It was 5.25 percent, not 5.75 percent. (It is now 2 percent.)

HEADLINE: Measure of Consumer Mood Declines to a 16-Year Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Soaring gas prices and weakening job prospects left shoppers gloomier about the economy in May, sending a major barometer of consumer sentiment to its lowest level in almost 16 years. 
 The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dropped to 57.2, down from a revised 62.8 in April. Economists surveyed by Thomson Financial/IFR expected a reading of 60.
 The May reading marks the fifth consecutive month of decline and is the lowest since the index registered 54.6 in October 1992 when the economy was coming out of a recession.
 Economists closely watch sentiment readings because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
 ''Weakening business and job conditions coupled with growing pessimism about the short-term future have further depleted consumers' confidence in the overall state of the economy,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, said in a statement.
 Ms. Franco said the worries of consumers about inflation, aggravated by increasing prices at the gas pump, were at an ''all-time high'' and were likely to rise further in the months ahead. She added that based on consumers' outlook on the economy, she believes there is little likelihood of a quick turnaround.
 Mark Vitner, senior economist with the Wachovia Corporation, agreed, saying that he does not believe that confidence has bottomed out yet, an ominous sign for consumer spending. ''Higher gasoline is of immediate concern,'' Mr. Vitner said. ''A lot of the extra money is going toward gas and food.'' And he does not expect consumer sentiment to improve until gas prices start receding.
 The consumer confidence report, derived from responses received through May 20 of a representative sample of 5,000 American households, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Three Remain in Running For Newark Schools Post

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
After nearly four dozen job applications over the past six months, the search for a new superintendent in Newark, New Jersey's largest school system, has been narrowed to three candidates.
 The change in leadership comes as the long-struggling, 42,000-student Newark district is poised to return to local control for the first time since a takeover by the state in 1995.
 The process of selecting a new superintendent has been closely followed by educators, parents and advocates here who see an acute need for a viable school system in Newark -- a city plagued with high crime and unemployment -- as it struggles to revive itself. 
 ''With its location and resources, Newark could be so much more than what it is,'' said Derrell Bradford, deputy director of Excellent Education for Everyone, an advocacy group for school choice here that had Mayor Cory A. Booker among its founders. ''The only way it will realize that dream is by fixing its schools.''
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine met this month with each candidate and is soon expected to announce his choice to lead the school system to the State Board of Education, which has final approval over the appointment. The 13-member board, which is appointed by the governor, sets the state's education policies.
 The candidates are Clifford B. Janey, a former superintendent in Washington and Rochester, N.Y., who is said by some Newark educators to be the front-runner; Donnie W. Evans, the superintendent in Providence, R.I.; and Ross Danis, education program director for the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and a former assistant superintendent in Randolph, N.J.
 The new superintendent will succeed Marion A. Bolden, a longtime Newark math teacher who rose to become the head of the system. She will retire from her $270,000-a-year post at the end of the school year in June. 
 ''We have definitely moved the district forward,'' said Dr. Bolden, who pointed out that the district's graduation rate rose to 79 percent last year from 47 percent when she took over in 1999. ''We're hoping that my successor will continue the trend. The quality of life for our young people is very much enhanced, but there's still a lot to do.'' 
 State education officials, who also oversee the school districts in Paterson and Jersey City, announced in July that Newark had improved enough to be given control over day-to-day operations like maintaining its buildings and addressing student conduct, health and safety issues. 
 In December, Mr. Corzine appointed a 17-member search committee that included Newark educators and parents as well as business, religious and community leaders. The committee interviewed about 10 candidates in April before recommending the finalists to the governor, according to people familiar with the search process.
 Richard Cammarieri, a community development specialist who is a member of the search committee, said that he looked for someone who not only had experience running a large urban school district, but had also raised student performance, engaged parents and community members, addressed the minority achievement gap and demonstrated sound fiscal management. 
 Mr. Cammarieri said his top choice was Dr. Janey, who headed the 55,000-student school system in Washington for nearly three years. ''This is an extremely important decision, given the impact public schools have on the quality of life and on the future of the young people we're trying to educate,'' Mr. Cammarieri said. ''We can just hope that the governor makes a thoughtful decision that reflects his pledge to be guided by the hard work of the search committee.''
 Joseph Del Grosso, president of the politically powerful Newark Teachers Union, said the schools needed a leader who could gain the trust and cooperation of its stakeholders. ''Newark has a long history and tradition, for good or bad, of unions and political and community groups who are either with a superintendent or against,'' he said. 
 Mr. Del Grosso added that the new superintendent would have to move quickly to address such looming issues as repairs to the district's aging school buildings and the escalating cost of special education. He said the union also planned to open negotiations in October on a new teachers' contract; the current three-year agreement expires in June 2009.
 ''It's not a lot of down time,'' he said. ''You have to be up to speed almost immediately, because it's not that long of a summer.''
 Mr. Bradford said that although he would have preferred a candidate with a less traditional school background and more expertise in business, he believed the search had included a lot of community involvement and represented a wide range of interests.
 He said the new superintendent would have to work closely with Mayor Booker, who made school reform a campaign issue and is likely to seek more influence as the schools are returned to local control. 
 ''I think that a mayor is going to be much more hands-on than Trenton,'' Mr. Bradford said. ''Historically, Trenton has been laissez-faire about school districts whether or not they're paying for the school costs.''
 Mr. Bradford added that he would like to see a relationship evolve in Newark that is similar to the one that the schools chancellor in New York City, Joel I. Klein, has with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

HEADLINE: In an Uncertain Market, Hotels May Be Ripe Buys

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
A $200 million resort hotel does not exactly resemble a suburban home. But scratch the surface of the sales market for each property category, and they look remarkably similar today.
The number of hotel deals in the United States during the first quarter plummeted by more than 40 percent, to 127. There is a gaping spread between what sellers are asking for hotels and what buyers are willing to pay. And lenders are writing much smaller mortgages at higher interest rates than they were a year ago.
And yet several private equity firms have quietly managed to raise cash to buy hotels in recent months, said Warren Marr, a hotel consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''It may take a bit longer than it did two years ago, but the money is there,'' he said. 
Some hotel industry experts contend that this is an excellent time to raise cash, because they see fire sales on the horizon. Mr. Marr said that some investors who bought hotels a year ago, at the peak of the market, and used financing to cover as much as 85 percent or 90 percent of the purchase price, might be forced to sell soon. ''You could call these distressed assets -- not physically distressed, but financially distressed,'' he said.
HEI Hotels and Resorts, based in Norwalk, Conn., is the latest company to raise cash for a new private equity fund. This is the third fund raised by the company, which also manages the hotels in its portfolio. The new fund has more than $500 million to invest in hotel properties.
Gary Mendell, chief executive of HEI Hotels and Resorts, said that across the industry, it is harder to raise capital now than it was a year or two ago. But he attributed his ability to raise $500 million now to the number of repeat investors. The company focuses exclusively on raising money from university endowments, and six of the 16 investors in the new fund also invested in both of HEI's earlier funds, which closed in 2004 and 2006.
There is little doubt that hotel sales have plummeted since the credit squeeze took hold late last summer. For example, buyers spent $4.1 billion on hotels in this year's first quarter, less than half of the $8.6 billion spent in the first quarter of 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics.
There are also far fewer big spenders. Only eight investors bought more than $100 million worth of hotels in the United States in the first quarter, down from 27 buyers who did so a year earlier, the firm reported.
Buyers are also starting to demand a little better return on their investment. Capitalization rates -- or the initial rate of return on a property, expressed as a ratio of the current income relative to the purchase price -- are rising for all types of commercial real estate.
But Dan Fasulo, the director of market analysis at Real Capital Analytics, wrote in a report about hotel sales last week that the ''large gap between asking prices and current bids indicates that buyers think cap rates should be even higher.'' Mr. Fasulo said the average cap rate for all United States hotel deals in the first quarter was around 8 percent.
Mr. Mendell said the HEI fund would probably buy fewer hotels than it might have two years ago, simply because lenders are demanding more equity.
Experts say that until last year, a fund like this could have financed 75 percent or more of the cost of the hotels in its portfolio, while today it is more likely to finance 60 percent to 65 percent. In this new credit environment, a $500 million fund might acquire around $1.5 billion of real estate, rather than the $2 billion it might have bought a year ago.
Mr. Mendell, who started the company with his brother, Steve, in 2002, said this would not alter the type of properties that HEI invests in, which tend to be upscale full-service hotels. Instead, he said the new fund would probably purchase fewer hotels. While a year ago the fund might have bought 28 full-service hotels, he said this fund was more likely to buy 20 or 21 hotels.
Noble Investment Group, which is based in Atlanta and owns and operates hotels through similar private equity funds, raised its latest fund in early 2007. Mit Shah, the chief executive, said the company had invested about 40 percent of this $310 million fund so far and was focused on investing the rest, rather than on raising capital for a new fund.
Mr. Shah said he thought the main reason so few hotels were on the market today was that most sellers were unwilling to part with their properties at current prices. ''If you don't have to sell, you won't sell in this market,'' he said.
But he added that the pool of buyers was much shallower than it was a year ago, so he hoped to pick up some good deals soon. ''There is a significant amount of capital on the sidelines,'' he said.
David Loeb, a hotel analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, an investment bank in Milwaukee, predicted that the fundamentals of the hotel business would worsen over the next two years.
He said this was only partly because of the lagging economy. He said a significant amount of new hotel construction was in the works, which had been financed before the credit markets soured. He estimated that the number of hotel rooms in the United States would increase 2.5 percent this year, and possibly another 2 percent to 2.5 percent next year.
Mr. Loeb said he thought this was a smart time to be raising money to buy hotels. ''There will be owners who can't afford to keep their hotels anymore,'' he said, because they bought them in highly leveraged deals a year or so ago.
He added that some trophy properties might even change hands. ''Luxury properties do not come on the market often,'' he said. ''But in this market, you will absolutely see some of them sell.''

HEADLINE: Uzbeks Bury '05 Crackdown, but It Lives for West

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: ANDIJON, Uzbekistan 

 BODY:
The theater that burned has a fresh coat of paint. Bullet holes have been plastered over. Newspapers talk of cattle farming, tennis courts and World War II victories.
 Three years ago this month, the government in this eastern Uzbek city turned its guns on its own citizens, killing hundreds and drawing condemnation and sanctions from the West for what was the bloodiest repression since Tiananmen Square.
 In a Soviet sleight of hand, however, the Uzbek government has deleted the event from this city's past and in recent months has taken some unusual steps: It allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross back into its prisons; released a number of human rights advocates; and enacted laws canceling the death penalty and introducing habeas corpus. 
 But this is Uzbekistan, a repressive country where laws mean little, rights are relative and torture is endemic, human rights advocates say. They argue that the government's gestures are intended to distract attention from the fact that it never allowed an independent review of the killings in Andijon. 
 ''Saying everything is O.K. in Uzbekistan is like saying it's peaceful in Baghdad,'' said Vasila Innoyatova, a human rights worker in Tashkent, the capital.
 But Western governments say further ostracizing Uzbekistan by extending sanctions -- America's come up for consideration in June -- will cause it to close back up, increasing instability in a region of vital energy transportation routes and strategic proximity to the war in Afghanistan. 
 A newly softened tone has already paid political dividends. After Andijon and a volley of criticism from Washington, Uzbekistan ejected the United States from a military base that was supplying the war effort in Afghanistan. Though there are not yet plans for the base to reopen, the Uzbeks have allowed the Americans limited access to a German base at Termez, and Uzbekistan recently offered NATO the use of its railway to ship goods to Afghanistan.
 That highlights the difficult questions that relations with Uzbekistan raise for American foreign policy: How much influence should the United States try to exercise -- if any at all -- over another country's behavior? And will that country be receptive, given the abuse, indefinite detentions and closed tribunals that have been part of the United States' record in recent years?
 As the gateway to Afghanistan and Iran, and an area where both China and Russia vie for influence, the five Muslim countries of Central Asia -- the other four are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -- have a strategic importance to the United States well out of proportion to their size. Uzbekistan is the region's heart, with its most religious population, and also, at 28 million, its largest. 
 The killings in Andijon tested that strategic bond for the United States. The government of President Islam Karimov acknowledged 187 deaths but dealt so viciously with those who gave information about it -- a gravedigger who spoke to an Uzbek journalist was stabbed to death shortly after publication, and the journalist fled the country -- that the true figure was impossible to establish. Human rights groups put the toll around 750. 
 Western nations pressed the government to allow an independent investigation. The European Union imposed a visa ban on officials involved in the crackdown, and the United States resettled a large number of refugees and is considering a visa ban of its own. Yet, three years later, the Uzbeks have not budged. In a five-part report in 2006 it said perpetrators of the uprising -- ''terrorists'' and ''bandits'' -- were responsible for the deaths of the 62 ''civilians,'' or nonparticipants, who it acknowledged were killed. 
 A spokesman for the Uzbek Foreign Ministry said there had been no response to a request for comment sent two weeks ago.
 So when European and American attitudes toward Mr. Karimov began easing late last year -- the European Union partly suspended the visa ban in October, and in January, Adm. William J. Fallon, the most senior American military commander in the region, visited Tashkent, the first high-level visit in two years -- many human rights advocates were bitterly disappointed. 
 ''To be honest, they abandoned us,'' said one, a former ecologist who fled Uzbekistan in April because he believed that a criminal case was being prepared against him. He has not been identified for safety reasons.
 Supporters of engagement with the Karimov government argue that punishing the country with sanctions leads only to less leverage over its policies. 
 ''Uzbekistan is simply too important to ignore,'' said one Western official who said diplomatic rules forbade him to use his name. ''People on the ground want contact with foreigners. They value it. Once you go into isolation mode, you lose the ability to engage with the rest of the population.''
 Mr. Karimov, 70, who has been in power since the Soviet Union collapsed, is not known for his democratic instincts, and many analysts are skeptical that any policy will encourage him to open up. He won a third term in a tainted election in December, though under Uzbek law, only two terms are allowed. Some say Mr. Karimov has not chosen a successor for fear that the president-in-waiting would kill him.
 ''He is totally fixated on remaining in power,'' said Paul Quinn Judge, an analyst at the International Crisis Group and a former journalist, who has observed Mr. Karimov since the 1980s. ''He is not the kind of person who would allow things to seriously open up.''
 Indeed, some Uzbek human rights advocates say that Mr. Karimov has increased the pressure on them since the warming with the West began. In December the authorities arrested a poet, Yusuf Juma, on what human rights advocates and family members say were trumped-up charges, after he and his sons held up hand-lettered signs in a one-family protest against Mr. Karimov's candidacy. In April, Mr. Juma was sentenced to five years in prison.
 In March the authorities broke up a small group of protesters who had been gathering for weekly demonstrations since last year. The government then seized the offices of the group, Human Rights Movement of Uzbekistan. Two members fled.
 ''The silence of the West gave a good opening to Karimov to arrest my father,'' said Alisher Yusufjon Ugli, the poet's son. 
 Andrea Berg, an expert on Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, said that without the threat of sanctions, ''Tashkent has no incentive to improve human rights.''
 But at a time when the United States is fighting an increasingly complicated war right next door in Afghanistan, some analysts argue that realpolitik must prevail.
 ''It's a really bad set of choices that the U.S. faces,'' said Martha Brill Olcott, a Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''If we didn't have a war in Afghanistan we might have the luxury to take a moral stance.'' 
 Nor is Uzbekistan quite the prison colony it is reputed to be. Despite the political arrests and brutality in prisons, the overwhelming majority of citizens are more concerned with making ends meet than with fears that the secret police will knock down their door. 
 ''You can't compare Uzbekistan and North Korea,'' said a European who has lived in Tashkent for years, and who was not identified for safety reasons. ''Not every right is violated all the time. It's not that systematic.''
 In Tashkent, a glittering city of clipped lawns and fountains, an Uzbek in his 20s, who is expanding his fashionable nightclub in central Tashkent, noted that there were long lines of Uzbeks in banks to apply for credit cards, and construction was booming. He said he did not read newspapers, but believed that Uzbekistan had press freedom because ''there are fresh newspapers every day and they seem to be writing something.''
 But good mojitos are far easier to come by than independent political articles. By the end of 2007, after Andijon and the ensuing crackdown on civil society, a large portion of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news outlets were forced to stop their work. Ms. Innoyatova, the human rights worker, estimates about 900 organizations closed. In an Orwellian twist, government-controlled nongovernmental organizations sprang up.
 Yet, with the economy outside the capital stagnating, wages below subsistence level and millions of people migrating to Russia and Kazakhstan for work, most Uzbeks do not count freedom of expression among their top concerns. ''None of this will work until there's a critical mass of people who feel they have rights and are ready to protect them,'' said the ecologist turned human rights advocate, making the point that, under Soviet rule, no one had rights.
 Even the plight of the poet, Mr. Juma, left some residents from his southern town, Karakul, unmoved. ''He had money. Why did he do it?'' asked one young unemployed man. 
 Uzbeks have become poorer, less educated and more isolated in the 17 years since the Soviet Union collapsed. At the same time, the most religious parts of society have been brutalized by the government. It is a combination that has proved poisonous in other countries, including Iraq. 
 Ms. Olcott argues that Uzbek society is much less inclined toward secular values than it was 10 years ago, a shift that could eventually lead to Uzbekistan's becoming a religious state. ''There's a lot riding on transition,'' said Ms. Olcott, who has researched the role of religion in Uzbekistan. ''I think you're going to get another Islamic state down the road. The question is whether it's going to be tolerant or intolerant.''
 The Bush administration's counterterrorism practices since 2001 have eroded its moral authority with countries like Uzbekistan, analysts said. ''The U.S. doesn't have the kind of leverage it had,'' said Sarah Mendelson, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''We've got this elephant in the room.'' 
 In Andijon, the policy of forgetting is rigorously enforced. On the anniversary, newspapers ran headlines about sports competitions and the grain harvest. Even those who took part in the uprising seemed to have rehearsed the government line.
 ''The past is in the past,'' said one participant, who lived in Baltimore as a refugee but returned to Uzbekistan in 2006. ''People don't want to remember.''

HEADLINE: Dress for Less and Less

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
SINCE 1998, the price of a ''Speedy'' handbag -- the entry-level style at Louis Vuitton -- has more than doubled, to $685, indicative of a precipitous price increase throughout the luxury goods market. The price of Joe Boxer's ''licky face'' underwear, meanwhile, has dropped by nearly half, to $8.99, representing just as seismic a shift at the other end of the fashion continuum, where the majority of American consumers do their shopping.
 As luxury fashion has become more expensive, mainstream apparel has become markedly less so. Today, shoppers pay the same price for a basic Brooks Brothers men's suit, $598, as they did in 1998. The suggested retail price of a pair of Levi's 501 jeans, $46, is about $4 less than it was a decade ago. A three-pack of Calvin Klein men's briefs costs $21.50, only $3.50 more than in 1998. Which is the better buy? 
 Factoring for inflation, each of these examples is actually less expensive today. In current dollars, the 1998 suit would cost $788, the jeans would be $66 and the underwear would be nearly $24. As consumers adjust to soaring prices for gasoline, food, education and medical care, just about the only thing that seems a bargain today is clothes -- mainstream clothes, anyway. 
 Clothing is one of the few categories in the federal Consumer Price Index in which overall prices have declined -- about 10 percent -- since 1998 (the cost of communication is another). That news may be of solace to anyone whose budget has been stretched just to drive to work or to stop at the supermarket; in fashion, at least, there are still deals to be had. 
 An anecdotal price comparison by Thursday Styles for 31 name-brand clothing items -- such as Calvin Klein underwear, a Chanel tweed cardigan, a pair of L'eggs pantyhose, Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses and a wool crepe jacket from Anne Klein -- would seem to demonstrate that while luxury prices have outpaced inflation, lower-priced clothes have generally experienced deflation. Even some items that may seem more expensive today, like a $75 Ralph Lauren polo shirt (which cost $62.50 in 1998), are really not, because their prices have risen more slowly than inflation. 
 Anyone who has spent time walking along 34th Street in Manhattan recently, from Kmart to Macy's to Forever 21 and H&M, would think that the economic outlook is rosy. Shoppers there are still laden with bags from Payless and Victoria's Secret, and several said they perceived fashion to be a better buy, with more variety and style at lower prices, than a decade ago.
 ''You can buy a lot more with your money today than before,'' said Joanna Eliza, a recent graduate from the Fashion Institute of Technology, shopping on 34th Street on Tuesday. ''Stores like H&M and Forever 21 make it more affordable for people who want to be fashionable, and that makes me feel really good.''
 Over all, apparel prices have gone down primarily because of two factors: the overwhelming movement of manufacturing to countries with cheaper labor, where the clothes are made, and increased competition between traditional retailers and discounters, where the clothes are sold. 
 In some cases, the low prices today seem almost ridiculous. Steve & Barry's sells celebrity-branded shoes and dresses for $8.98 or less. Target offers a silk faille ball gown from Isaac Mizrahi on sale for $129.99. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, promotes an Op T-shirt for 97 cents.
 But how low can prices go? While fashion deflation may be good news for consumers, it is not necessarily so for stores. Such prices at the low end and, conversely, such high prices at the luxury end, where $1,300 handbags are piled up like tomatoes at Saks Fifth Avenue, are beginning to cause concern among retailers and analysts, because they are having a profound impact on the way people shop.
 ''Everything we pick up today has to pass a test,'' said Candace Corlett, the president of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting group. During a survey of shoppers in November, 60 percent of the respondents said they had recently begun to stop and reconsider clothing purchases before buying. ''To me, that is the scariest thing for retail going forward, because that is a new habit,'' Ms. Corlett said. ''It's not like in 2000, when we were just buying so much stuff. We are learning now what we call the cautious pause.''
 The fashion and retail industry fear that the appeal of price, for consumers of both mass and luxury goods, is becoming a more important factor in decisions about what to buy than desire, which has been the driving mechanism behind the growth of fashion and luxury for decades. 
 ''We as a business cannot afford to have a customer take a second look and ask, 'Do I need this?' '' said Bud Konheim, the chief executive of Nicole Miller. ''That is the kiss of death. We're finished, because nobody really needs anything we make as a total industry.''
 The divergence of price extremes has become so striking that some fashion executives, including Mr. Konheim, are openly asking whether prices have reached both their nadir and apex at the same moment. ''As far as bottom costs go, we're there,'' Mr. Konheim said. ''I think we've exploited all the countries on earth for people who really want to work for nothing.''
 But at fashion's high end, it may be consumers who think they are being exploited. Of the name-brand items that Thursday Styles ran a 10-year comparative price check for, the highest gain, 104 percent, was for the Speedy bag, followed by a $1,900 Lady Dior bag (73 percent higher) and a $325 Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress (71 percent higher). These prices were not adjusted for inflation, which has run 32 percent cumulatively since 1998. 
 Of nine items that declined in price, those that dropped the most were basics like underwear and T-shirts, by as much as 60 percent for Joe Boxer's three-pack of basic briefs, 32 percent for capri pants from Liz & Company, and 21 percent for a Lacoste polo shirt. Prices for the remaining five items stayed the same or changed within 1 percent of their 1998 prices, including styles sold by L.L. Bean and Lands' End, which are frequently touted in catalogs for maintaining their original prices. 
 Price differences for products that have remained consistent in image and design can also be affected by sales and competition among stores. The suggested retail price of a pair of Levi's 501 jeans, for example, has declined $4 since 1998, to $46, but stores like J. C. Penney and Kmart have often sold them for much less.
 The cost of materials -- all the denim is produced in the United States -- has remained constant. But the cost of production has fluctuated as production has moved overseas, a factor that could now lead to price increases.
 ''As we see gas prices going up, and the shipping going up with that, that will certainly affect what the end price will be,'' said Erica Archambault, a Levi's spokeswoman.
 It is becoming harder to compete with price alone, said Stephen Donnelly, the general merchandise manager for women's apparel at Kmart, where shoppers, he said, are increasingly value minded. They are often more informed and more interested in fashion that is affordable, rather than basics that are cheap, and increasingly, less profitable. 
 ''Just like everyone else,'' Mr. Donnelly said, ''we've definitely had some cost increases and a lot of that has to do with transportation, for getting the goods from the manufacturers to our warehouses and off to the stores, as well as increases in the price of raw materials. But we are trying to minimize increasing the costs to our customers.''
 HOW the potential for higher prices will sit with consumers may depend on the how many companies find themselves in the same boat, unable to withstand further cuts without sinking.
 ''Clothing has been incredibly cheap,'' said Sarah Maxwell, a professor of marketing at Fordham University and the author of ''The Price is Wrong'' (Wiley, 2008), which looks at how price affects consumer behavior. In the book, she describes buying the same pair of sneakers for 15 years, during which time the price ranged from $19.95 to $29.95. When she recently went to buy a new pair, they cost $34.95, so she rejected them. 
 ''There is room to move up,'' she said. ''If the entire market moves up at the same time, there isn't any problem. It's when one person moves up that the market notices.''

HEADLINE: In Economic Terms, Recycling Almost Pays

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DEPALMA

 BODY:
It still costs more to recycle paper, plastic, metal and glass in New York City than to simply chuck everything into the trash. But the cost difference has narrowed, and if the trend continues, recycling could end up being cheaper than trash disposal within five years, according to an analysis released on Wednesday by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. 
 Recycling costs the city $284 a ton, while curbside trash disposal comes to $267 a ton, according to the analysis, which was prepared for the environmental group by DSM Environmental, an independent consulting firm in Vermont. The $17 per ton difference comes to about 6 percent, and is significantly less than it was a few years ago. When the city's Independent Budget Office looked at recycling costs in 2004, it found that the city spent $34 to $48 a ton more to recycle than to send garbage to landfills. 
 ''Here is proof positive that recycling is cost-competitive with other waste disposal methods, to say nothing of cutting the city's contribution to global warming,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer at the environmental group. According to the report, New York's recycling programs provide the same environmental benefit as taking roughly 338,000 cars off the road each year. 
 Officials at the Department of Sanitation have long argued that recycling does not necessarily pay for itself. During a fiscal crisis in 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg cut back the recycling program to save money. 
 A year later, the administration reluctantly reversed itself and resumed a weekly recycling schedule. Before the disruption, recycling rates reached a high of 20 percent of the waste stream, but fell sharply afterward. They have recovered somewhat but remain lower, about 18 percent. Department officials said that could reflect a change to lighter packaging materials. 
 The study found that recycling costs more in large part because sanitation crews have to travel farther and spend more time picking up recyclable material than when they are collecting garbage. 
 Vito A. Turso, a deputy sanitation commissioner, said that a work crew can fill a regular garbage truck with 10 to 12 tons of trash during a seven-hour shift and have time to take the load to a transfer station. But the same crew on recycling duty will pick up only 3 to 5 tons of recyclables, because residents do not put out everything that can be recycled. ''There are plenty of other things on the metal, plastic, paper and glass side that can be recycled, and if people were more ambitious about recycling those materials, there would be less in the waste stream.'' Mr. Turso said. 
 Previous analyses of recycling costs have been challenged by either advocates of recycling or city officials because of disputes over the way the Sanitation Department accounts for costs. Lorenzo N. Cipollina, the department's deputy commissioner for financial management, worked with the DSM consultants as they prepared their analysis. ''We have no big disagreement with how they want to look at the numbers,'' he said. 
 The DSM analysis excludes labor costs not explicitly related to picking up recyclables that the department has traditionally included in its calculations about recycling. They include leaf composting, curbside pickup of household appliances and even workers sometimes assigned to snowplowing. Mr. Cipollina said that as the cost of shipping garbage to out-of-state landfills rises, and as the price the city can get for recycled material increases, recycling will make more sense. 
 ''The message here is that every ton of paper not put into the refuse stream yields us 7 to 10 dollars a ton, as opposed to paying a $100 per ton disposal fee on the other end,'' he said. ''We are in full agreement that recycling at the curb is a good program.''

HEADLINE: Letter; Truly Thanking Those Who Serve

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mr. Bush and the G.I. Bill'' (editorial, May 26):
 The G.I. Bill needs expansion. Men and women in the military, focused on serving their country and dealing with long deployments in combat, see the G.I. Bill as it has been sold to us -- a fair chance for a future through education. 
 I've re-enlisted five fellow sailors, but I have been equally honored to watch sailors depart admirably to go to college. Many can do this only with the G.I. Bill, which currently does not cover all expenses. 
 Far from a handout, the G.I. Bill is a reward for unquestioned service and dedication. Sometimes rewards come in other forms -- orders to redeploy, strained families, even wounds and death. Those serving should not be coerced into re-enlisting because there are no other options.
 How ungrateful to withhold the promise of a college education from those who have given so much because of fear that they will not re-enlist if the government honors its promises.
 Jeremy Brandon Wilgus
 Brampton, England, May 26, 2008
 The writer is a lieutenant in the United States Navy currently serving with NATO in Britain in support of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.
 To the Editor: 
 As we celebrate Memorial Day, I could not help notice the contrast between your editorial ''Mr. Bush and the G.I. Bill'' and William Kristol's May 26 column, ''Remember to Remember.''
 The editorial takes issue with President Bush's (and Senator John McCain's) opposition to the new G.I. Bill of Rights, and his unwillingness to support generous financing of a college education for returning veterans. It's almost unfathomable that the president would oppose this bill, and even worse that he would do it because of concerns it will discourage soldiers from re-enlisting. 
 Mr. Kristol doesn't address any of these pressing issues, but he asks us to thank the troops when we see them. Well, I agree with him on thanking soldiers and in fact told one last night how much I appreciate his service to our country. But that said, the way to really thank these brave men and women who have made great sacrifices for this country is to provide them the benefits they deserve upon their return home. 
 Robert Kelter
 Chicago, May 27, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Did I understand the logical implications of this correctly? The Bush administration -- and the Pentagon -- oppose the new G.I. Bill because it would entice and encourage soldiers to leave the military early. These are the same people who purport to support the troops and espouse to no end their selfless sacrifice and pure patriotism in the service of their country, then insult them and that concept of patriotism by saying outright that they can be bought off it?
 Lyndon Dodds
 San Antonio, May 26, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 In your editorial you describe the war in Iraq as being ''unwinnable.'' Clearly, as your news articles regularly report, by many measures trends are moving in a very positive direction in Iraq today: numbers of daily attacks, ground gained and stabilized, success against sectarian militias, progress on the benchmarks, strength and competence of the Iraqi Army.
 Yes, the war has exceeded the length of the American involvement in World War II, but our casualties in Iraq, though certainly tragic, have been a tiny fraction of our losses in that war. And yes, last year American soldiers suffered more combat deaths than in any other year of the war, but our generals had predicted higher casualties as their change of strategy worked to reverse the setbacks suffered under what had been a failing policy.
 Of course, in World War II, United States casualty rates greatly increased from 1944 on as Allied forces encountered ferocious resistance as they approached the Japanese mainland and fought their way through Europe. 
 Steven L. Weiss
 Princeton, N.J., May 26, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 You refer to the fiasco in Iraq as ''Mr. Bush's Iraq misadventure.'' But this is not his misadventure; it is our misadventure.
 The war in Iraq could have never begun or continued this long without the acquiescence of the American people and their Congressional representatives. I propose the Bush corollary to President Lincoln's famous statement: You can't fool all of the people all of the time, but you can fool enough of the people enough of the time. 
 Bruce R. Parker
 Houston, May 26, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Fear of Troop Exodus Fuels Debate on G.I. Bill'' (news article, May 22):
 Neither President Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney has served in war -- yet they will determine the benefits of returning veterans. I know better.
 During World War II, I served with the Ninth Air Force Fighter Group in England, France and Germany. I know what war is. Veterans of my generation also saw the Great Depression. We were poor. At age 24 with almost no money, I returned from war fearful of my future.
 War scars and traumas don't disappear under civilian clothes. The G.I. Bill gave me the education to become a successful lawyer. I repaid that debt through income taxes -- at a much higher rate than I would have as an ''uneducated'' veteran. 
 The cost over 10 years is minuscule compared with our total economy. Returning veterans will have improved outlook and opportunities with a generous G.I. Bill. They will be better business participants, pay higher income tax, and repay their ''debt.''

HEADLINE: Change in a Progressive City Spurs Racial Shift, and Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Not every neighborhood in this city is one of those Northwest destinations where passion for espresso, the environment and plenty of exercise define the cultural common ground. A few places are still described as frontiers, where pioneers move because prices are relatively reasonable, the location is convenient and, they say, they ''want the diversity.''
 Yet one person's frontier, it turns out, is often another's front porch. It has been true across the country: gentrification, which increases housing prices and tension, sometimes has racial overtones and can seem like a dirty word. Now Portland is encouraging black and white residents to talk about it, but even here in Sincere City, the conversation has been difficult. 
 ''I've been really upset by what I perceive to be Portland's blind spot in its progressivism,'' said Khaela Maricich, a local artist and musician. ''They think they live in the best city in the country, but it's all about saving the environment and things like that. It's not really about social issues. It's upper-middle-class progressivism, really.'' 
 Ms. Maricich, 33, who is white, spoke after attending this month's meeting of Portland's Restorative Listening Project. 
 The goal of the project, which is sponsored by the city's Office of Neighborhood Involvement, is to have white people better understand the effect gentrification can have on the city's longtime black and other-minority neighborhoods by having minority residents tell what it is like to be on the receiving end.
 Once armed with a broader perspective, said Judith Mowry, the project's leader, whites should ''make the commitment that the harm stops with us.'' That might mean that whites appeal to the city to help black businesses or complain to companies that put fliers on the doors of black property owners encouraging them to sell. 
 Yet what has been clear from the meetings this month and last is that talking about the impact of gentrification is easier than finding ways to reduce it. For some minority residents, the notion that white Portland now says it feels their pain is cold comfort.
 ''That's been our history,'' Norma Trimble, who is Native American, said during the question-and-answer session this month. ''They take all you've got. They take your land. Now they want your stories.''
 Oregon has always had a complicated relationship with race. When Oregon became a state in 1859, its Constitution specifically prevented blacks from becoming residents, a law that remained on the books for more than 60 years.
 Today, Oregon is just 2 percent black, and Portland is about 7 percent black. On May 18, an estimated 75,000 people turned out to hear Senator Barack Obama at a rally, and most were white. For some, that was evidence that Portland's liberal mind-set transcends race. For others, it just meant Portland prefers its diversity in fresh packaging.
 Portland's black population grew significantly during World War II, when blacks surged in to work the shipyards. At the time, real estate restrictions largely confined black families to a neighborhood called Vanport. But when the Columbia River flooded 60 years ago, the residents of Vanport were dispersed, and many blacks moved to the city's Northeast neighborhood. Freeway construction later leveled other black areas. A new hospital took out still more. Now, in the name of economic development, Portland has been improving streets, sidewalks and transportation and offered grants and loans in minority neighborhoods. While the improvements are welcome, many blacks said in interviews that they do not seem designed for them, but more to raise housing prices and lure in newcomers. Blacks who have lived in the Northeast most of their lives say they no longer recognize their old neighborhood, much less feel comfortable there. 
 On Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in Northeast, white cyclists in sleek helmets pedal past groups of young black men whose faces are hidden beneath hoodies. Buses rumble by, too, the only transportation alternative for some residents, not just a green alternative.
 ''It's not drug infested, but then you say, 'Well, what happened to all the black people that were in this area?' '' said Margaret Solomon, 84, who is black and has lived in the neighborhood for more than 40 years. ''You don't see any.'' 
 It is a white world now, Ms. Solomon said: ''They're sitting around with their bikes and out on the sidewalks and all that. It's rough to imagine.''
 Though the black population has declined in some black areas, including Northeast, it has increased somewhat in the city as a whole. Some blacks have left Northeast by choice, moving to other neighborhoods or the suburbs, and some bought and sold property in the area to their advantage. Neighborhoods change for many reasons, and Northeast was white before the Vanport flood. Still, many black residents said they felt they were not the preferred demographic.
 Floyd Booker, who spoke during the April meeting of the Restorative Listening Project, was one of several black residents who told of being unable to get bank loans or city grants even as whites, in their view, seemed to have no trouble. Mr. Booker's business, Courtesy Janitorial Service, is one of the few black-owned businesses left on Alberta Street, now a collage of trendy shops and strollers more likely being pushed by white mothers. 
 ''Where's this meeting going?'' Mr. Booker, 85, said in an interview days later. ''No place. People get there and vent their frustrations, but who hears it?''
 Several blacks echoed that concern in interviews after the meetings, while many whites -- and the audiences were overwhelmingly white -- said the meetings had been invaluable in helping them see another point of view. Whites often nodded sympathetically, even gasping at times, as they heard blacks tell stories of discrimination and of feeling betrayed by the city in its quest for economic development. 
 Ms. Mowry, the project's leader, describes it as being rooted in restorative justice, similar to the type applied in the truth and reconciliation commission after the end of apartheid in South Africa.
 The meetings have had awkward and tense moments, too. Last month, Joan Laufer, who is white and who moved into a house in Northeast in 2006, stood up to express gratitude to a black minister for describing how hard it was for blacks to get home improvement loans and for addressing some sensitive stereotypes.
 ''I've learned two things about all you guys already -- why the houses aren't fixed up and why you guys are riding around in all these big flashy cars,'' Ms. Laufer, 55, a nurse practitioner, said.
 At one point, she also asked blacks what she should call them -- blacks or African-Americans.
 An older black woman in the front replied, ''People.''
 Another black woman, toward the back, said, ''Donna.''
 Ms. Laufer offended some, but she said in an interview a few days later that she had meant well, that she felt enlightened by what she heard at the meeting and hoped to be able to discuss her feelings about race honestly with blacks. Unlike some other whites new to the area, she was not aware of the city's history when she moved there. The price was right, that is all, and Mrs. Laufer loved the front porch.
 ''I've chewed on that meeting like I've never chewed on a church sermon or anything my entire life,'' she said. ''I just want to be in a nice neighborhood, and so do all these other people.''

HEADLINE: Penny Pinching Looks Great

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, people promenading along the super-fashionable Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village were surprised to come upon a decidedly low-rent window display announcing an army-navy surplus store within. Wasn't that a Marc Jacobs store just last week? Could Bleecker be going downscale as fast as it had gone up?
 As it turned out, the window was the dryly funny brainchild of Robert Duffy, the president of Marc Jacobs. Mr. Duffy had found a trove of vintage military coats in Copenhagen and decided to sell them in the store -- for a mere $59 each. And if that sounds like a unlikely fashion statement from the man who in the 1990s had men coughing up $600 for thermal long johns in cashmere, well, talk to Mr. Duffy. 
 ''No one wants to pay $500 for a pair of flip-flops,'' Mr. Duffy said, sounding more like a consumer advocate than a luxury-brand kingpin. ''Sometimes I'll walk past a store and see that, or see rubber boots for $500, and it disgusts me. I know what it costs to make them.''
 With fast-fashion stores as diverse as American Apparel, H & M, Uniqlo and Club Monaco having become fun fashion brands, Mr. Duffy has been adding less-expensive merchandise to the Marc by Marc Jacobs stores, which are turning into 20-something fashion scenes, with whimsical inexpensive accessories, T-shirts, swimsuits and shoes.
 ''I've always said I want this brand to be recession-proof,'' he said.
 With no relief in sight at the gas pump, there is plenty of bad news in fashion these days. In this month's results from a continuing consumer attitude study by the NPD Group, a market research firm, 51 percent of consumers said they plan to spend less on apparel, up from an already bleak 45 percent in April. A May survey by the Yankelovich polling group found that the percentage of American consumers reporting ''severe anxiety'' about their personal finances more than doubled, to 30 percent from 14 percent.
 But the good news is that fast fashion, as its name suggests, has excellent timing. The men's style landscape, which has been transformed over the last few years by a generation of youthful dandies and the designers they love, has reached a price point that is, even for the overdrawn 2008 wallet, affordable. And men are responding.
 ''I definitely feel like I've traded down in the last year or so,'' said Robert Pini, 47, a film industry executive in New York, who has discovered, among other things, the $99 cashmere sweaters at the Uniqlo store in SoHo.
 ''A lot of these clothes are great now,'' Mr. Pini said. ''You wear them into the office and people ask you where you got it, and they're expecting you to say Prada. I used to be more into the whole label thing, but I don't think guys are into it as much now.''
 The easy availability of fashion-forward clothes is part of the reason brands like Diesel, American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch have actually posted sales gains this year. At Diesel, the fast-fashion trailblazer that sparked the vogue in premium denim more than a decade ago, first-quarter sales were up more than 20 percent over the same period in 2007, according to Steven Birkhold, the chief executive of Diesel USA. First-quarter sales at American Apparel soared 51.9 percent. 
 ''There's no question that priorities have shifted dramatically,'' said Marshal Cohen, the chief analyst for the NPD Group. But, he noted, that does not mean men have given up on clothes, just that they are looking for, and finding, cheaper options. ''The least vulnerable brands now are the ones at the lower end of the luxury market and the upper end of the midtier market,'' he said. ''There's a lot more affordable luxury out there now.''
 Looking for a cool-graphic, superthin cotton T-shirt that not everyone has? Try the Vans Web site, where they are $20. Looking for a cheap pair of jeans? Try the bright-colored Levi's 511s or American Apparel's new jeans line. 
 Or just go right to J. Crew, where there are trendy items like skinny ties, wool vests, Japanese selvedge denim and prewashed oxford-cloth button-downs almost as neatly tailored as the ones that Band of Outsiders makes. If you want the neckwear of the moment -- a gauzy summer scarf that suggests you are an artsy, entitled (if not actually titled) European -- and you don't want to go to Dolce & Gabbana for the top-drawer version, head over to H & M or Urban Outfitters and pick up a good facsimile for a fraction of the price.
 ''This kind of stuff wasn't available 10 years ago,'' said John Cafarelli, 28, a private equity investor in the retail and consumer sector, and like many young men today, an unrepentant clotheshorse. ''The market is a lot more democratic now.''
 His own strategy is simple: he buys basic, sharply cut shirts from J. Crew and Urban Outfitters and tricks them out with personality-rich accessories from Paul Smith and Hermes. 
 Coincidentally, the May issue of GQ uses a similar formula in a feature on how to buy and wear a $500 suit. 
 ''You have to do it with something that's a little higher end, like a good pair of shoes, or putting an extra $50 into tailoring it right,'' said Jim Moore, GQ's creative director. ''What I love about places like H & M and Uniqlo is that the quality has gotten better and better. And whereas I think some of these inexpensive lines used to look like knockoffs of designer brands, a lot of them now have their own look, and have even become kind of status-y on their own.''
 If there is one thing fashion loves, it's a reversal -- of fortune, a trend, a hemline. Next thing you know, Prada will be knocking off H & M.

HEADLINE: Fed Governor to Leave in August

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that a governor, Frederic S. Mishkin, was resigning effective Aug. 31.
 Mr. Mishkin said in his letter of resignation that he would return to his teaching post at Columbia Business School in New York. 
 He joined the Fed board in September 2006 to a term ending in January 2014.
 Mr. Mishkin's departure will leave the Fed board with three of its seven seats vacant. President Bush has nominated two people to fill vacant seats and has named Randall S. Kroszner to serve a full 14-year term, but the Senate has not confirmed the nominations in an election-year standoff.
 Mr. Mishkin has argued, like the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that Fed policy could be bolstered by a stated numerical inflation target.
 The Fed announced last November that it would issue quarterly forecasts instead of two forecasts a year and would make projections three years into the future instead of two, but it stopped short of setting explicit inflation targets.

HEADLINE: 5 Countries Agree to Talk, Not Compete, Over the Arctic

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Diplomats from the five countries bordering the Arctic Ocean adopted a declaration on Wednesday aimed at defusing tensions over the likelihood that global warming will open northern waters to shipping, energy extraction and other activities. 
 The agreement, reached after a daylong meeting in Ilulissat, Greenland, said the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark saw no need for new accords on Arctic matters and would use existing international laws like the Law of the Sea Treaty to resolve disputes. Greenland belongs to Denmark. 
 The countries also agreed to work more cooperatively to limit environmental risks attending more Arctic shipping and commerce and to coordinate potential rescue operations given the rising number of tourists heading north as sea ice increasingly retreats in the summer.
 The meeting capped a frenetic year of Arctic activity as countries vied to demonstrate their polar hegemony with a mix of rhetoric, military maneuvers and, in the case of Russia, a submarine voyage to the seabed at the North Pole. 
 One of the two participating minisubmarines left a titanium national flag on the bottom, 14,000 feet beneath the shifting sea ice.
 In a statement, Per Stig Moller, Denmark's foreign minister, alluded to that voyage and the media blitz that followed. ''We have politically committed ourselves to resolve all differences through negotiations,'' he said. ''And thus we have hopefully, once and for all, killed all the myths of a 'race to the North Pole.' The rules are in place. And the five states have now declared that they will abide by them.''
 European environmental groups have expressed concern recently about a looming Arctic rush for resources and potential environmental harms. 
 Indigenous peoples in the region have been divided over the prospect of more economic activity, but many Inuit leaders have expressed strong concern about the threat to their traditions as open water expands.

HEADLINE: Urban Areas on West Coast Produce Least Emissions Per Capita, Researchers Find

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The West Coast's metropolitan areas had among the lowest carbon emissions per capita in the country in 2005, according to a new ranking of 100 urban areas.
 The region's mild climates, hydropower and aggressive energy-reduction policies give its residents smaller carbon footprints, on average, than those of their counterparts in the East and Midwest. 
 The Honolulu area ranked No. 1 in the study, from the Brookings Institution, followed by the area including Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, the Portland-Vancouver area in the Northwest and the New York metropolitan area. A cluster of Rust Belt urban areas were at the bottom of the rankings, including Toledo, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Lexington, Ky., which ranked last. 
 The authors offer a partial portrait of overall emissions, concentrating on residential electricity and fuel use and the mileage traveled by cars and trucks -- factors that contribute about half of overall carbon emissions. The calculations do not include industrial emissions, those from commercial or government structures and those from air, rail or sea transportation. But they provide a new look at metropolitan areas. 
 The report was accompanied by policy recommendations, including federal legislation setting a price on carbon emissions, increasing financing for energy research and development, revising federal policies that reward states with high levels of travel and fuel use and providing more, and more predictable, financial support of mass transit.
 While the report did not go into the precise causes of each ranking, it provided hints at the factors that correlated with higher or lower scores. Population density and the availability of rail transportation were associated with lower per capita carbon emissions; the Los Angeles area is the most densely populated in the country, according to Brookings figures. 
 Other metropolitan areas in the top 25 included Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, New Haven, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Rochester. 
 Also associated with high rankings were government policies that promoted energy efficiency, particularly electricity rate-setting policies. Rate-setting by state regulators has traditionally been geared to make more money for a utility if it sells more electricity. While rates may remain relatively low, pleasing customers, utilities have little incentive to encourage energy conservation. 
 ''The worst footprints are in the traditionally regulated states,'' said Marilyn A. Brown, a professor of energy policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who is one of the report's three authors. ''Utilities are reacting to what turns a profit for their shareholders,'' and get no economic benefit from conservation, Dr. Brown said. 
 The Washington metropolitan area ranked No. 100 in per capita residential carbon emissions and No. 89 on the overall list; also in the bottom 25 over all were the Augusta, Ga., Birmingham, Ala., Knoxville, Tenn., Nashville, Oklahoma City and St. Louis metropolitan areas. 
 ''The Washington, D.C., metro area's residential electricity footprint was 10 times larger than Seattle's footprint in 2005,'' the report said. ''The mix of fuels used to generate electricity in Washington includes high-carbon sources like coal while Seattle draws its energy primarily from essentially carbon-free hydropower.''
 By contrast, California set extensive energy efficiency requirements for home appliances; per capita energy use has remained largely flat in the state for 30 years. This factor, combined with its low-carbon electricity and warmer climate, were the most likely reasons that 8 of 10 California metropolitan areas ranked in the top 25 on the Brookings list.
 Among the report's recommendations was a change in federal law that would require home sellers to disclose the annual energy costs of the dwelling in the years before the sale.
 The combination of transportation and residential emissions data sometimes masked the forces driving a region's per capita carbon emissions up or down.
 For instance, the proximity of a port, with its related freight traffic, depressed the overall scores of some areas, including Jacksonville (No. 80 over all) and Sarasota, Fla. (No. 81) and the Riverside-San Bernardino area east of Los Angeles (No. 32).
 Considering only residential emissions, Jacksonville and Sarasota ranked Nos. 42 and 46, respectively; the Riverside area ranked No. 4. But both Florida areas have ports, and the Riverside area is the destination of many trucks carrying freight from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. All three ranked near the bottom on the list of transportation-related carbon emissions per capita.
 The measurement system was created by three Brookings authors -- Dr. Brown, Frank Southworth, who is on the senior research staff at Oakridge National Laboratory, and Andrea Sarzynski of the Brookings Institution.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Show a Smaller Dip Than Was Forecast

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A crucial measure of business spending declined less than expected in April, a sign that businesses might be breathing easier about the economy, although orders for cars and computer equipment still dipped, the government said Wednesday. 
 Over all, manufacturing orders fell 0.5 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $214.4 billion, after slipping 0.3 percent in March, the agency said. Although it was the third decline this year, the dip was less severe than economists had forecast. 
 The Commerce Department report measures orders of durable goods, those intended to last three years or more, which provide a sense of willingness among businesses to make long-term investments in capital equipment.
 The April report sent signals that some domestic companies think the worst may be over for the economy. Stripping out transportation goods, new orders rose 2.5 percent last month. And a closely watched indicator of business spending, which measures orders of nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, jumped 4.2 percent, its biggest monthly increase since December. That measure dipped 1 percent in March. 
 The durable goods report is considered relatively volatile from month to month. 
 In April, big increases came in orders of electronic equipment, which surged nearly 28 percent, and large-scale machinery, up 4.2 percent. Demand for communications equipment and precious metals also rose. 
 Motor vehicle orders fell 3.3 percent and civilian aircraft slipped about 25 percent. 
 Though American companies still enjoy strong export sales, a slackening in domestic demand has weighed on bottom lines. Fears of a prolonged economic slowdown damped durable goods orders in the first quarter, though the April report suggested a few bright spots for the summer.

HEADLINE: Ostensibly Independent, a Charity Is U.S. Sugar's Swing-Vote Shareholder

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
For the Mott Children's Health Center, a corporate takeover offer to buy U.S. Sugar for $293 a share could have meant a payday of $125 million -- enough to care for 12,000 children a year for more than 14 years. 
 But the medical center, a charity in Flint, Mich., did not get a chance to cash in. 
 Last year, the offer was taken off the table. Then this spring, U.S. Sugar suspended its dividend. That has left the charity with a big block of paper that, for the purpose of financing its operations, is essentially worthless. There is no market for the stock in U.S. Sugar, a private company, and the medical center cannot make the company buy back the shares. 
 Angry former employees of U.S. Sugar say that the needy children of Flint are the victims of the same financial maneuvers that have undercut the workers' retirement plan. The Children's Health Center was carrying the U.S. Sugar stock on its books at $153 a share in 2005, they say, when the offer emerged for $293 a share. 
 The ''offer thus presented the opportunity to receive 91 percent more,'' the former employees say in a lawsuit against the company and some other shareholders. A no-brainer, they say: The children of Flint would have been much better off, had the health center sold its shares. 
 On the surface, the Mott Children's Health Center appears to hold a pivotal stake in U.S. Sugar. As the second-largest shareholder, if it voted with the employees (the largest group of shareholders), they could control the company; if it voted with the heirs of Charles Stewart Mott, the family foundation and other groups, they would retain control.
 The employees contend, though, that the medical center has an ''unlawful agreement'' linking its holdings to those of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and the descendants of Mr. Mott, and thwarting any change of control. The Mott Foundation denied that it was party to any unlawful agreement.
 A lawyer for the Children's Health Center, Walter Griffin, said he could not confirm whether the charity had been informed of the offer or discuss why the charity had not responded to it. 
 The Children's Health Center has been asked to produce documents for the lawsuit and some are under seal, Mr. Griffin said, preventing him from discussing the matter. 
 He confirmed, however, that the charity had been relying on U.S. Sugar's dividends, about 2 percent. In 2006, the center spent about $8.8 million to provide medical, dental and behavioral care to about 12,000 children, according to a tax filing.
 Spending has been declining. Still, the need is rising. Flint was knocked flat by the mass closings of automotive plants in the 1980s, chronicled by the filmmaker Michael Moore in ''Roger and Me.'' Flint's unemployment rate is well above the national level and rising, and tens of thousands of children there live below the poverty line.
 The Mott Children's Health Center, founded in 1939, received big blocks of U.S. Sugar stock after a law was passed in 1969 limiting how much stock wealthy families could control through their private foundations. 
 By giving U.S. Sugar stock to the Children's Health Center, the Mott heirs and the foundation reduced their holdings to less than the allowable limit, in their case about 35 percent. The center, with about 22 percent of the company, is deemed independent of the family group under federal law. 
 But the former employees of U.S. Sugar point to the secret agreement and say that independence is an illusion.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas in Pause Mode

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: CAMERON PARISH, La. 

 BODY:
The cost of a gallon of gas gets all the headlines, but the natural gas that will heat many American homes next winter is going up in price as fast or faster.
 That fact makes the scene in the languid, alligator-infested marshland here in coastal Louisiana all the more remarkable. 
 Only a month after Cheniere Energy inaugurated its $1.4 billion liquefied natural gas terminal here, an empty supertanker sat in its berth with no place to go while workers painted empty storage tanks.
 The nearly idle terminal is a monument to a stalled experiment, one that was supposed to import so much L.N.G. from around the world that homes would be heated and factories humming at bargain prices. 
 But now L.N.G. shipments to the United States are slowing to a trickle, and Cheniere and other companies have dropped plans to build more terminals. 
 A longstanding assumption of American energy policy has been that natural gas would be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America, where many fields are tapped out. 
 But some experts are starting to question that idea, saying natural gas could be subject to the same explosion in overseas demand that has made oil so expensive.
 As it is, the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead, pushing up gas prices and depleting the nation's stockpiles as the hurricane season approaches. 
 ''A few years ago people looked at L.N.G. as a solution to North America's gas needs,'' said Nikos Tsafos, an analyst with PCF Energy, a consulting firm. ''But today we see that there is less L.N.G. around than people expected, and there is more competition for that L.N.G. from markets that are willing to pay more than the United States.''
 Not long ago, Cheniere was a darling of Wall Street. It was widely praised for having the vision to plan four new liquefied gas terminals around the Gulf of Mexico to connect the country with supplies of natural gas from places like Nigeria and Egypt, gas once considered so worthless it was burned off.
 Now the company's stock price has sunk from $40 to just over $5 since last fall.
 ''The question that people ask is if L.N.G. doesn't come to the United States for another year or two or three, what is going to happen to Cheniere,'' acknowledged Charif Souki, the chief executive officer of the company. 
 While natural gas prices in the United States have spiked to over $11.80 per thousand cubic feet from $7.50 at the beginning of the year, the price that gas producers can draw in many other countries in the world is several dollars higher. All they need are terminals in producing countries that can chill natural gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit for shipping across oceans and terminals in consuming countries that can regasify cargoes. 
 Just about the only place where demand for L.N.G. seems not to be growing is the United States, an abrupt shift from expectations as little as one year ago. 
 The Sabine Pass terminal was part of an estimated $7 billion construction of eight new L.N.G. receiving terminals being built around the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Coast over the last five years to guarantee plentiful domestic supplies. With imports about 40 percent of the level of a year ago, and national receiving terminal capacity poised to double this year, the excess construction of import capacity has alarmed industry executives. 
 However the executives predict that it is only a matter of time before the white elephants begin to look like a more robust breed. They say American gas suppliers will eventually be willing to pay the higher world prices on the spot market, especially if a gas shortage ensues after a punishing hurricane season or frigid winter.
 They also predict future American consumption of natural gas is poised to increase because of hardening opposition to building new coal-fired electricity generating plants and delays in new nuclear plants. ''Over time, we will need to start importing more gas,'' said Darcel L. Hulse, president of Sempra LNGE, a division of Sempra Energy, which is building receiving terminals in Mexico and Louisiana. ''We will not have enough.'' 
 That was the thinking that spurred the L.N.G. expansion in the United States in the first place. At the beginning of the decade, government officials and energy experts predicted a decline in domestic natural gas production as conventional fields on-shore and in the Gulf of Mexico declined. Companies like Cheniere, Sempra Energy and Exxon Mobil began snapping up coastal land and requesting regulatory approval for scores of terminals. Several other terminals were taken out of mothballs and expanded.
 But recently domestic natural gas production has been stronger than expected and events abroad have drawn L.N.G. from the United States to countries that needed it more. 
 Last July an earthquake in Japan forced the closing of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, which in turn has forced Japanese utilities to import huge amounts of L.N.G. 
 World L.N.G. supplies grew even more scarce because of a persistent drought in Spain that has crimped that country's hydroelectric capacity, forcing the Spanish to increase L.N.G. imports. 
 Prices in Asia and Europe have soared, as producers have sold more supply on the spot market where prices are higher than those in traditional long term contracts. 
 World demand for natural gas has grown about 2.6 percent a year over the last decade, but in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa it has averaged 7 percent over the same period, according to a recent UBS report. Growth in the developing world is expected to be supported in the years ahead by a construction boom in refineries and power and petrochemical plants. 
 Supplies of L.N.G. are going to grow in the next few years, but experts say they will not be enough to satisfy the growing demand. Liquefaction plant projects that prepare the gas for shipping in producing nations like Nigeria and Russia are being delayed and even shelved because of political turbulence, cost overruns and increasing domestic demand for gas in their own countries. Production in one major terminal in Indonesia is sliding because of a declining field, and production in another in Norway is facing mechanical difficulties.
 With L.N.G. providing only about 3 percent of total American natural gas consumption in recent years, the fall in L.N.G. imports has made few headlines. But some experts say those responsible for importing gas are making a mistake by not buying more L.N.G. at current prices.
 They warn that the failure to import more L.N.G. is leaving natural gas reserves precariously low should the country be hit by a harsh hurricane season or cold winter. They say low L.N.G. imports have helped push American natural prices higher, just not high enough to match the prices of Europe and Asia whose ability to produce and store gas is far inferior to the United States. 
 Andrew D. Grams, head of North American power and gas trading at Deutsche Bank, said the United States may eventually pay dearly for not importing more L.N.G. now. He calculated that given the reduced L.N.G. imports and expected energy use through the summer, the country will have only 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas in storage at the end of October -- almost 1 trillion cubic feet below full storage.
 ''Under a normal scenario, that's just barely enough to get through winter,'' Mr. Grams said. ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that we may not get enough L.N.G. supply in the United States unless our pricing structure becomes more competitive with the rest of the world.''
 Natural gas, unlike oil, is still a regional commodity and its price is only loosely connected to world oil benchmark prices. But L.N.G. has tied regional markets closer, and the arc of natural gas prices appears to be following close behind oil in recent months because of tightening L.N.G. supplies.
 The same increases in the prices of steel and other materials and shortages in labor that are making to more expensive to explore for oil are making L.N.G. development more costly too. Meanwhile, countries that produce oil and gas like Libya and Algeria are replacing their oil-powered electricity plants with natural gas-burning plants. That way, they are able to export more oil, which costs less to ship than L.N.G.
 ''The value of gas to you is what people are willing to pay for the oil you are exporting,'' said Don Hertzmark, a consultant who has advised several oil companies on L.N.G. projects. ''At that point, the gas is worth a lot of money.'' 
 Nevertheless hopes for L.N.G. still survive here. The secretary of energy, Samuel W. Bodman, and a Cajun zydeco band came last month to celebrate the opening of the Sabine Pass terminal, and a tanker delivered L.N.G. from Nigeria for testing purposes. 
 Workers are testing generators and painting and building five huge storage tanks, each capable of providing a full day's supply of gas for Louisiana. Tugboat crews are practicing for any future cargo arrivals. 
 ''I know the L.N.G. will come and we'll make a profit on this,'' said Darron Granger, a Cheniere senior vice president. ''I just can't say when.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about the difficulties of importing natural gas misstated the name of a company that builds import facilities. It is Sempra LNG, a division of Sempra Energy -- not Sempra LNGE.
An article on May 29 about a decline in liquefied natural gas imports misstated the name of the energy consulting firm that employs Nikos Tsafos, an analyst who commented on shrinking supplies. It is PFC Energy, not PCF Energy.

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS; Increase in Oil Prices Lifts Energy Sector

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a second day as a rebound in oil prices set off a late-day rally in energy shares, and a better-than-forecast report on durable goods orders lifted industrial companies.
 Exxon Mobil, the nation's largest oil company, led gains in 34 of 36 energy companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after oil erased a decline of more than $2 a barrel. Caterpillar and Alcoa helped send the Dow Jones industrial average higher after the government said durable goods orders, excluding transportation, unexpectedly increased in April. 
 The S.& P. 500-banks index erased half its retreat after falling below its lowest closing level since 2000 on forecasts of more charges from bad debts at KeyCorp. 
 The S.& P. 500 added 5.49 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,390.84. The Dow climbed 45.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,594.03. The Nasdaq composite index increased 5.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,486.70.
 ''People want to put money in things that can at least track inflation and hopefully stay ahead of it,'' said David H. M. Baker, the chief investment officer at the North American Management Corporation in Boston.
 Exxon Mobil climbed 63 cents to $90.43, leading the S.& P. 500 energy index to a 1.5 percent advance, the group's first gain in five days. Crude for July delivery rose $2.18 to $131.03 a barrel after Morgan Stanley said Brent oil from the North Sea may easily reach $150 a barrel.
 Monsanto, the world's biggest seed producer, led materials companies to a 2.8 percent advance. Alcoa, the world's third-biggest aluminum producer, rallied 3 percent to $41.57. Caterpillar, the largest maker of bulldozers, added 1.5 percent to $83.19. 
 Orders for durable goods, excluding cars and planes, rose 2.5 percent in April, the most since July, the Commerce Department said. Total orders fell a less-than-forecast 0.5 percent.
 Deere, the world's largest maker of tractors and combines, raised its quarterly dividend 12 percent to 28 cents a share and authorized the repurchase of as much as $5 billion in additional common stock. Its shares climbed $2.72 to $82.58.
 KeyCorp, the Ohio bank, fell the most in the S.& P. 500, sliding $2.29, or 10 percent, to $19.66, its steepest tumble since 1987. KeyCorp said net loan charge-offs would be higher than it estimated less than six weeks ago as it ''deals aggressively with reducing exposures in the residential home builder portfolio.''
 American International Group, the world's largest insurer, lost $1.71, or 4.7 percent, to $34.91, for the biggest decline in the Dow average. The insurer may seek $5 billion to $10 billion rather than let its credit rating be cut again, Citigroup wrote. 
 ''The recovery for financial stocks clearly is going to be an elongated process,'' said Dan T. Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management, which oversees about $3 billion in Fort Lee, N.J. ''The unwinding of badly designed financial instruments is going to take a long time. That's clearly what keeps the market in check right now.''
 Interest rates were higher, with the 10-year Treasury note falling 22/32, to 98 31/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, at 4 percent, up from 3.92 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Faulting Europe for Tariffs, U.S. Takes Its Case to World Trade Organization

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The United States has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over European tariffs on technology goods like computer monitors and printers.
 The duties, which are as high as 14 percent, make American technology goods less competitive in Europe, according to the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association. The group's members include Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Cisco Systems. 
 The complaint reflects the Bush administration's view that the European duties violate a 1996 W.T.O. agreement that eliminated tariffs on information technology equipment.
 ''The E.U. is effectively taxing innovation,'' the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, said in a statement. ''We wanted to make sure that the commitments to give duty-free treatment to these products would be maintained in the face of the evolution of technology.''
 The European Union has said it can charge duties on the goods, which include cable and satellite boxes for using the Internet and printers that can also scan, fax and copy, because they incorporate new technologies.
 Total worldwide exports of the products included in the complaint totaled $70 billion in 2007.
 The W.T.O. confirmed Wednesday that it had received the complaint, which begins a 60-day consultation period with the European Union. After that, the United States may ask a W.T.O. panel to rule on the dispute.
 The European Commission said in a statement that it was willing to renegotiate the 1996 Information Technology Agreement to cover new products, but the United States had refused to do so.
 ''Both the spirit and explicit provisions in the I.T.A. make it clear that extension to new products to reflect technological change would not be automatic, but based on periodic review by signatories,'' the commission said.
 Europe said that the flat-panel screens cited by the United States, for example, are capable of working with DVD players, not just computers, and are therefore properly classified as video monitors, which are not covered by the agreement.
 American trade officials have raised their concerns about the tariffs several times with European officials in the last 20 months, the trade representative's office said.
 Japan has also filed a similar complaint, the trade office said.

PERSON: David Gahr 

HEADLINE: David Gahr, Photographer of Musicians, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
David Gahr, who turned his back on a promising career as a scholar to take pictures and listen to music and who as a result landed among the pre-eminent photographers of American folk, blues, jazz and rock musicians of the 1960s and beyond, died on Sunday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 85.
 His daughter, Carla, announced his death. 
 Mr. Gahr's prodigious output included posed photos and reportorial documents. Popular among his subjects for what they saw as a desire to elevate rather than merely capture them, he had a four-decade relationship with Bob Dylan, famously depicting him, gangly and youthful, at the Newport Folk Festivals of the early 1960s and taking studio photographs for the 2001 album ''Love and Theft.'' His portrait of Janis Joplin in full-throated performance appeared in 1988, two decades after it was taken, on the cover of Time magazine's 20-year retrospective on 1968 as the year that shaped a generation. 
 He captured an athletic and fiercely arch-backed Miles Davis, trumpet to his lips, for the cover of the 1970 album ''A Tribute to Jack Johnson'' and a pensive Bruce Springsteen for the cover of the 1973 album ''The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle.'' He shot dozens of album covers for Folkways Records.
 Mr. Gahr's book-length collaboration with the writer Robert Shelton, ''The Face of Folk Music'' (Citadel Press, 1968), is an exhaustive chronicle of the rise of ''the folk movement'' of the 1960s, as Mr. Shelton called it, containing hundreds of black-and-white photographs of musicians on and off stage, including Mr. Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Phil Ochs, Mary Travers, Johnny Cash and Sonny Terry. The book remains a testament to a world that Mr. Gahr not only documented but lived in.
 ''I remember once when I was a girl Janis Joplin wanted a lift back from Newport,'' Ms. Gahr said in a telephone interview this week. ''But my mom thought she wouldn't be a good influence.''
 David Gahr was born in Sept. 18, 1922, in Milwaukee, where, he said in published interviews, he grew up in a largely black neighborhood and was first exposed to blues and jazz. His parents, Max and Yetta, were immigrants from Russia; his father was a street peddler. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from the University of Wisconsin in Madison. He served in the infantry in Europe in World War II and on his return became a doctoral candidate at Columbia. He was married, and to maintain his family he worked at a Sam Goody record store, where he photographed the famous musicians who came in as customers. He was invited to join the staff of The New Republic magazine in Washington, writing on economic issues, but stayed put and opted for the simpler economics of survival. 
 ''I became a professional photographer on the morning my son, Seth, was born,'' he told the magazine F.Y.I., the in-house publication of Time-Life, where he completed more than 2,000 assignments.
 His wife, Ruth, died in 1993. In addition to his daughter, of Manhattan, and his son, of Stratham, N.H., he is survived by a brother, Samuel, of Milwaukee, and two grandchildren.
 Mr. Gahr's portfolio was not restricted to music. He spent much of a decade from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s on assignments for Time magazine, many on art-related subjects with the writer Robert Hughes. He also worked for Life and later People. He photographed Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Salvador Dali, Willem de Kooning and Georgia O'Keeffe. He took book-jacket photos of John Cheever and Arthur Miller.
 Asked why her father gave up the intellectual life so abruptly, Ms. Gahr said: ''He didn't want to move to Washington, D.C. And I think he found the whole idea a little boring. I remember him answering that question once. He said, 'Economics? Yuk.' He loved music.''

HEADLINE: As Star Power Leaves, Residents Start Recovery

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: CANNES, France 

 BODY:
On the last day of the Cannes Film Festival, the streets were awash with pale, red-eyed critics and journalists in wrinkled clothes, their credentials slung around their necks, crawling to the end of the two-week marathon of movie-watching.
 By 7 a.m. on Monday, barely two hours after the last drunken scream penetrated hotel windows from the all-night bars, the rainy streets filled with muscular guys in T-shirts packing away the festival for another year.
 It was a population switch worthy of a science fiction movie -- the kind of film, with existential and political pretensions, that might easily be shown at Cannes.
 Trucks from dozens of moving companies blocked the streets -- pulling out chairs and tables, sophisticated lighting and sound equipment, hundreds of potted palms. The posters were winched down, the covered beach restaurants dismantled, the out-of-town limousines driven away in black convoys of Audis and Mercedeses. 
 The employees of Cannes's most famous hotels staggered to get the last large suitcases into the last massive cars, and the festival souvenir shop was closing, its temporary staff members, like Lili Brun, 22, a student from Paris here for the wages, desperate to finish and flee.
 The staff of the decor department of the Palais des Festivals et des Congrees was pulling up the famous red carpet -- 2,153 square feet of thin, synthetic stuff -- to change it for a last time. 
 And slowly, with ''les stars'' and their entourages now gone, the Cannois began to re-emerge on the streets of their own city, blinking a little, as if seeing the place for the first time. 
 Monday is the ''Day of the Cannois,'' and as a gesture to the residents, who rarely venture out during the festival unless they work in service industries, the Palais shows the prize-winning film on Monday to all who can prove, with their electricity bill, that they live here.
 By Tuesday, the judgments were in. There was pride that a French film had won the Palme d'Or for the first time in 21 years. But there was concern that the market was soft, and that the film, ''Entre les Murs,'' or ''Within the Walls,'' a documentary-like treatment that follows a teacher and his class for a year in a tough, mixed Parisian neighborhood, would not travel very far.
 More important, business was off -- at least 10 percent this year for local shops and restaurants, which depend more on visitors than on the stars. One reason, everyone agreed, was the uncertain global economy and the sorry state of the American dollar, which meant that fewer Americans came to Cannes, throwing fewer lavish parties. But the other main reason was less a question of seasonal or fiscal trends -- the pervasive rings of security that seal the town.
 ''It's sad, but security has taken over the festival, and it's becoming antiseptic,'' said Noel di Giovanni, 49, who leads the local association of some 500 restaurants and brasseries. ''The richness of the festival is in the people, and the people of 'La France Profonde,' '' the real France of the heartland, ''want to see the stars, to get a photo and maybe an autograph. And because they can't, fewer people come.''
 Now the celebrities ''go from the hotel to the car to the private party,'' Mr. di Giovanni said. ''The stars fail us in Cannes.''
 He runs one of the oldest restaurants here, Auberge Provencale, started in 1860 by the Bouttau family of his wife, Sophie. The lore is that the idea of the film festival was hatched at one of the restaurant's tables, just after World War II, and there are plaques on the wall indicating the favorite seats of notables like Picasso and Sean Connery. 
 But now, few stars venture into public places, Mr. di Giovanni said. ''Our gold book'' -- the guest book -- ''is dusty.''
 Mrs. di Giovanni shrugged and said that this year, when some of the best-known celebrities were Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Sharon Stone and Harrison Ford, ''even the stars were tired.''
 At the elegant Hotel Martinez, where many of them stay, business was fine. The hotel receives 12 percent of its yearly profit from the festival, said the hotel manager, Alessandro Cresta. With the private parties and company receptions, more than 2,000 bottles of Champagne were sold at $128 a bottle, and more than 40,000 bottles of mineral water.
 Hotel Martinez takes on 300 extra people to handle the demands of its special guests. One regular, Mr. Cresta said, insisted on eating at a restaurant closed for a private party. But Fabrizio Bozzolan, chief concierge since 1991, got it done.
 Mr. Bozzolan, 51, both amusing and discreet, said that ''the stress is really a bit much, like life 10 times faster.'' This festival was marginally calmer, he said. ''With the dollar, and a sense that the world economy is not going so well, they're not so confident, so they don't feel so much like celebrating.''
 The festival has changed. ''The stars now have 20 people around them, and sometimes they all think he wants something different,'' Mr. Bozzolan said. ''Before, they walked on the Croisette to dinner, and now no one does.'' 
 The hotel, like most, sells fixed festival packages, but given the economy now, bosses often leave earlier and then hand the grand rooms on to deputies, who hand them to assistants at the end. ''Now anywhere from two to seven people will use a room,'' Mr. Bozzolan said. 
 Once the festival ends, the collapse is ''brutal,'' said Olivier Pillon, 45, the chief day bartender for the hotel, where many seats at the wooden bar have polished brass name tags for regular customers. ''We prepare mentally and physically,'' he said. ''It's like being caught in a whirlpool. I eat and sleep festival, I talk festival to my wife. When it stops, it's shocking.''
 As important as the film festival has become, Cannes profits more from less glamorous gatherings. The real estate convention in March brings in more than 28,000 people -- easily more than twice the number at the film festival -- and in mid-June, there is the international festival of film advertising, when the Hotel Martinez sells more liquor in a week than during the two weeks of the film festival.
 Pierre Rissient, a film veteran who has worked with Godard, Bertrand Tavernier, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood and many others, is now 72, the subject of a documentary last year called ''Man of Cinema.'' He's been coming to the festival since 1964, when actors and directors walked the streets and ate at La Mere Besson and drank at the Blue Bar.
 ''It was a family of 300 people who stayed in touch,'' he said. ''Now, all that has disappeared. There are too many locations, too many pictures to be seen, too many entourages, and the system of security grows every year.''
 In 1972, he remembered, when he worked in Cannes with Mr. Redford and Sydney Pollack on ''Jeremiah Johnson,'' ''Pollack came alone and Redford came with his wife and that was it -- no security, no bodyguards. I admit it,'' he said. ''I'm a nostalgic.''

HEADLINE: Keeping Chlorine Out of the Pool

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
WHEN Pam Glazer, a 53-year-old architect and self-described ''granola-head from way back,'' began planning a pool for her home in Southampton, N.Y., she searched for a way to keep it sanitary without using chlorine.
 Ms. Glazer has been a swimmer for 30 years and was tired of dipping into chemically treated water. ''I'd get out and my sinuses would be inflamed,'' she said. ''If I swam on a lunch break, I'd walk into the office smelling like chlorine.'' 
 Several pool experts she consulted told her that chlorine was the only option; others suggested a saline system, which uses sodium chloride, but because that produces chlorine in the pool, it did not address her concerns.
 Ms. Glazer eventually learned of a system that eliminates the need for chlorine and other chemicals, using a combination of ozone and copper and silver ions. That system can be added on to existing pools, at a cost ranging from $10,000 to $20,000. Because Ms. Glazer was starting fresh, she spent $60,000 to build her pool, which has a panoramic view of the ocean, roughly $20,000 more than if she'd built a chlorinated model. 
 There are several ways to eliminate chlorine or significantly reduce the use of it, although the pool industry remains skeptical of their effectiveness and it is often difficult to find builders to install them. 
 TechnoPure, a company based in Uxbridge, Mass., makes a system that pumps pool water through a chamber containing coated titanium plates which oxidize and burn off organic waste. Copper and zinc ions sanitize the water, resulting in a pool that's ''virtually maintenance free in terms of chemicals,'' said Chris Capozzoli, who founded the company seven years ago. He said the system costs around $5,500 for an average-size residential pool and can be installed during construction or added to an existing pool. 
 Another company, DEL Ozone, based in San Luis Obispo, Calif., makes generators that inject ozone gas into the water as it recirculates, oxidizing bacteria and killing microorganisms. The generators are usually employed as a supplemental sanitizer to reduce reliance on chlorine, but according to Beth Hamil, vice president for corporate compliance and market development at DEL, it's possible to rely solely on ozone by using a larger generator and running the recirculating pump continuously. (Energy efficient pumps are available.)
 The so-called natural swimming pools that have slowly migrated to America from Europe are another option. The chlorine-free pools, which resemble ponds and must be built from scratch, circulate water through aquatic plants that act as organic cleansers. 
 Alternative technologies aren't new (DEL began to sell ozone systems for pools and spas in 1980), but they have grown in popularity in recent years as people who dislike swimming in chlorinated water become aware of their options. 
 ''Our target audience is the person who shops at Whole Foods,'' said Mr. Capozzoli, who expects to install about 700 residential systems this year, up from about 300 two years ago. Gus Paul, the owner of Gus Paul Pools in Port Washington, N.Y., said that although heater and filter sales are down due to the slowing economy, he has seen no drop in interest in the ozone units he carries. 
 Ms. Glazer chose a treatment system by Wailani, a company based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., that uses both ozone gas and copper and silver ions to oxidize and sanitize pool water. But she had trouble persuading builders to install it. 
 ''They all said, it's not going to work,'' Ms. Glazer recalled, admitting that she had doubts herself. ''I was taking a leap of faith. But you have to. How many toxins do you want in your body?'' Finally, the founder of Wailani, Tito Ignacio, flew to New York and supervised the installation. 
 Neil Gross, a retired Wall Street futures trader who lives in Great Neck, N.Y., hired Mr. Paul three years ago to convert his backyard pool to an ozone system by DEL. Mr. Gross and his wife spent in the neighborhood of $10,000 on a chlorine-free system because, he said, ''we don't like inhaling that chlorine smell.'' He added, ''if an organic will clean just as well, why not use it?''
 One reason: many in the pool industry still believe that chlorine is the best option, and as Ms. Glazer discovered, it's hard to find someone to build a pool that uses another system. ''To my way of thinking, and the industry's, no one has come up with as effective a sanitation method as chlorine,'' said Gene Fields, chairman of the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals.
 Mr. Fields, who said he had been in the pool business ''since shortly after God invented water,'' said he was skeptical of the effectiveness of systems that do not rely on at least small amounts of chlorine to kill bacteria. 
 Donald Lapa, who runs Mister Poolman, a maintenance service in Los Angeles, also expressed doubts. ''I think it's a fad, personally,'' he said of systems that rely on ozone or ion generators. ''People think it's softer on your skin. In my opinion, it isn't superior over the tried-and-true technique of chlorine and acid.'' (Even Mr. Ignacio of Wailani admitted that if a pool gets severely out of balance, he sometimes uses chlorine to shock it before returning to the chemical-free method.) 
 Mr. Lapa's skepticism reveals a potential problem with using a nonchlorine system: finding someone to maintain the pool. 
 ''If the maintenance people see a problem, their instinct is to throw chlorine in,'' said Ms. Glazer, who went through four pool service companies until she found one willing to learn the Wailani system. The TechnoPure unit eliminates the need for a local pool maintenance company altogether: an on-site computer communicates with the company's headquarters, alerting technicians to problems and allowing them to make corrections to the water chemistry remotely. 
 Some pool owners simply want to reduce their chlorine use, which is a much less expensive option. Sean Trotter, for instance, an air-conditioning business owner in Plano, Tex., installed an ozone generator by DEL to minimize chlorine use after his wife and daughter had reactions to chlorine. 
 Mr. Ignacio, who said he spent two decades perfecting his nonchlorine system, mentioned common complaints of swimming in a chlorinated pool, like red eyes, dry skin and brittle hair. But Mr. Fields said those problems could be caused by factors other than chlorine, such as pH imbalance or chemicals like bromine or dry acid that may be added to the pool. ''A lot of people blame chlorine because it's so present,'' Mr. Fields said, ''but that's not entirely accurate.''
 Penny Burley, a retired television producer who lives near Mr. Ignacio in Thousand Oaks, said she and her husband swam happily in their chlorinated pool for 16 years. Then she became hypersensitive to chemicals and spent $12,000 to retrofit the pool with a Wailani system. 
 ''I was very worried about bacteria,'' Ms. Burley said, but added that her fears have so far been unfounded. ''If you open your eyes underwater it doesn't sting. If you swallow water you don't gag. Your skin feels like a baby's rear end. I don't think my skin would feel that good if the water was treated with chemicals or was dirty.''
 Despite the added cost and the complications she experienced in installing her nonchlorinated pool, Ms. Glazer is also pleased with the results. Asked to describe the physical sensation of dipping into pool free of chemicals, Ms. Glazer offered a compelling analogy. ''It's like swimming in bottled water,'' she said.
 Minimizing the Chemicals and the Spending
 FOR pool owners who don'twant to spend thousands to go chemical-free, there are more affordable ways to at least reduce chlorine use. Sean Trotter, who owns an air-conditioning business in Plano, Tex., spent $900 for an ozone generator from DEL Ozone after his wife and daughter said that the chlorine in their pool irritated their skin. The system works this way: ozone kills microorganisms and keeps chlorine in its ''free'' state rather than turning into chloramine, the odorous compound chlorine becomes after it attaches to organics in the water. Beth Hamil, vice president for corporate compliance and market development at DEL, said the system allows chlorine use to be cut by 60 to 90 percent.
 Mr. Trotter says he no longer has to shock the pool with a high dose of chlorine, something he used to do once a week in the summer, and expects to save money in the long run by buying less chlorine. And he describes the water in terms similar to those used by owners of chlorine-free pools: ''No more burning eyes. No more dry hair. My wife says it feels better than the shower water in the house.'' 
 Another inexpensive option is Nature2, a system that delivers trace amounts of silver to kill bacteria and trace amounts of copper to fight algae. The unit is housed in a plastic cartridge and, according to Buzz Robinson, a training manager with Zodiac Pool Care, the Vista, Calif.-based company that manufactures the system, chlorine consumption can be reduced by 50 to 80 percent. A Nature2 unit for a pool with up to 25,000 gallons of water would run a homeowner about $180 for one swimming season, according to Mr. Robinson. Cartridges last six months.

HEADLINE: It's No Act, I Need a Job

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
THE posting jumped out from the thousands of others in the resume section of Craigslist/New York City.
 ''I will give you more than a million dollars for a well-paid sales job,'' it all but screamed. I clicked on that and read more. ''If you are willing to employ me in a position in Manhattan with a strong salary, I am willing to draw up a legal document making you my sole heir when I die.''
 The writer (who turns out to be a real estate salesman named James Kellogg) told me that he owns an Upper East Side apartment worth ''slightly more than $1 million'' in addition to ''more than $800,000 in cash.'' And suppose the taker of this deal dies first? No worries. ''If I outlive you,'' Mr. Kellogg explained reassuringly, ''my assets can be left to your family.''
 Desperate times make for creative measures, and in the current job market a melee of electronic job boards, resumes sent by e-mail and lots of applicants for limited openings, work comes to those who scream loudest. 
 ''The name of the game is to look like a vanilla chocolate twist with rainbow sprinkles on top rather than just vanilla,'' said David Perry, an executive recruiter and an author of ''Guerrilla Marketing for Job Hunters'' (Wiley, 2005). ''Do you still have a black and white TV?'' he asked. ''No, because it's dull and boring. We live in an HDTV world.''
 One of Mr. Perry's favorite tales is of an applicant (given the pseudonym George Brown in his book) who, after being laid off, knew exactly which company he wanted to work for next. His only problem was making the personnel office understand that this was meant to be. After phone calls got him nowhere, he printed business cards, rounder and larger than the norm. On the front was a photograph of a pizza and on the back was his name, phone and e-mail address along with the promise of a pizza for the first person to get him an interview.
 Dressed in a suit and tie, Mr. Brown stood outside the company headquarters and handed the cards to anyone who would take them. It took a few days, but eventually one manager decided that anyone who would go to so much effort deserved at least to be heard.
 One size does not fit all in the job interview scramble. What worked for Mr. Brown (yes, he got the job) would not have worked for Yutaka Tsujino, a copywriter who began looking for work at the start of this year. He spent the first three and a half decades of his life in Japan before coming to the United States last year for a six-month exchange program at an American advertising firm. While his written English is excellent, he worries that his spoken English is more difficult to understand.
 In addition, he said in an interview (where, despite his concern, I understood him perfectly) ''Japanese culture tells you not to brag; in the U.S., interviewing for a job means bragging about yourself and I am not comfortable doing that.''
 To make headway, he turned to the Web. He created a send-up of sites that applicants use to showcase themselves. The testimonials on his sites say things like ''he might be funny in Japan, but unfortunately not here in the U.S.'' Each put-down is accompanied by an example of Mr. Tsujino's work, which was impressive enough to land him a job with Creature, an advertising agency in Seattle.
 ''Not everyone thought the Web site was funny,'' Mr. Tsujino said. (He sent links to about a dozen potential employers, drawing responses from about half.) ''But that is my sense of humor, and if you don't get it then you aren't a place I should work anyway.''
 Allison Brinkman, a public relations executive, also used humor to stand out from the crowd, though less aggressively than Mr. Tsujino. After being unemployed for months, she sent a resume last fall to the president of the Eisen Management Group in Cincinnati, who replied with this question in an e-mail message: ''What can you bring to EMG and its clients?'' Loathe to give ''the generic 'I'm responsible and energetic' response,'' she said, she sent him a David Letterman-style Top 10 list, ending with: ''No. 1: I won't leave you alone until I've proved myself to be an interview-worthy candidate.'' 
 She got the interview and the job.
 It may be because I have a son who is a high school junior, but all this need to stand out from the crowd sounds a lot like what guidance counselors have been telling college applicants with increasing urgency over the last few years. As admission to elite schools becomes frenzied, students have taken to writing novels, creating documentaries and building schools in Cambodia to stand out. So it would follow that the competitive creativity that worked for college admission would resurface once those applicants graduate and look for jobs.
 Not so fast, warned D. A. Hayden and Michael Wilder, the authors of ''From B.A. to Payday,'' which is to be published in August. The market for new graduates is tougher than ever before. The number of entry-level jobs is down 10 percent this year, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, whose membership includes college counselors and human resource professionals.
 And it is now tougher to get a start at a Fortune 100 company than it is to get into Harvard (one in 10 for the school, one in 100 or more for the job, Ms. Hayden and Mr. Wilder said). But what looks creative and gutsy in an adult with a working track record can look juvenile in a green applicant, they said. 
 ''Stand out and differentiate yourself, absolutely,'' Mr. Wilder said. ''But be outrageous just to stand out from the crowd? No.''
 He and Ms. Hayden used to work together at an advertising agency in Boston, but left to form Hayden-Wilder, a counseling business for new graduates looking for work. They, too, are a sign of the times. For as much as $3,250, they walk first-time applicants through the process, teaching them how to write a resume and perform in an interview.
 ''If you want to be different, then for this group just knowing what the interviewer wants to hear will distinguish you from the crowd,'' Ms. Hayden said. ''You don't need stunts that make you look like a fraternity boy.''
 They definitely would not recommend that one offer an employer $1 million upon his death?
 ''Not advice we've ever given,'' Mr. Wilder said. 
 Mr. Kellogg is not a first-time applicant. He is 49 and well-established in real estate sales. But he said he was at a point in his life, where he would like a job that was largely salary (''at least $75,000 or $80,000'') not commission, and those are rare in his field. He thought a bounty might help unearth a few.
 ''The economics behind it isn't crazy,'' he said. ''Say you were interviewing several employees, and I was one and I was fine for the job. If you chose me you would essentially have a free employee.''
 He said he was past the point of thinking he will have heirs, and he doesn't care what happens to his money in what he hopes is the distant future. ''I'll be dead,'' he said. ''I won't need it.''
 Mr. Kellogg has had several inquiries about the ad. ''None of which peaked my interest,'' he said. But he believes his plan will work. ''Sales is about initiative,'' he said. ''This shows I can sell.''

HEADLINE: Charity Gala Feels Chill Of Wall St.

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Giving away $56.5 million in a night would strike most people as extravagant. But to the tycoons of modern finance, it seems a bit low key.
 At the 2008 Robin Hood Foundation benefit this week, auctiongoers donated that much money to charity. But many of the market wizards are making less these days -- and they are giving away less, too. Robin Hood's haul was down 21 percent from last year.
 After years of jaw-dropping excess fueled by the hyper-wealth of Wall Street, the gala, held Tuesday night at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, reflected the somber mood on Wall Street. 
 ''It was more subdued,'' said Jamie Niven, a vice chairman at Sotheby's who runs the auction every year. ''It was remarkable how much money was raised considering the horrendous problems people are having in these different markets.'' 
 The 2007 benefit, which raised $71 million, was a celebration of good times on Wall Street. But this year, the bidding for the super-luxurious items up for sale was less aggressive. The green neon glow sticks used to signal Mr. Niven seemed to be concentrated among a smaller group of bidders, participants said. 
 And yet by any measure, or at least any measure outside the wealthy world of hedge funds, the evening was a spectacle of extravagance. More than 3,700 people packed into the convention center. Financiers like Henry Kravis rubbed shoulders with media darlings like Tom Brokaw and Diane Sawyer and hedge fund managers like Art Samberg. 
 The tables were decorated with 800 XO laptop computers from the One Laptop Per Child project, which were to be donated, along with roughly 50,000 other items, to programs supported by Robin Hood. All of the proceeds from the evening go to antipoverty efforts.
 Mr. Niven raised more than $28.5 million in minutes to help repair homeless shelters, foster homes and housing. Donors gave in increments of $1 million (golden brick builders) or $250,000 (silver brick builders) for the program, called ''Real Estate for Real Change.''
 Guests were entertained by the pop star Shakira, who was joined by ''surprise'' guests including John Legend, Wyclef Jean and Sheryl Crow, who played the piano and sang ''Lean on Me'' with the Kipp School orchestra. 
 Not everyone was subdued. Paul Tudor Jones, the hedge fund manager who founded Robin Hood, dressed up as Indiana Jones -- whip included -- and rallied the guests, who paid at least $3,000 for a ticket.
 ''You're down, but it's not that bad,'' one guest quoted Mr. Jones as saying. ''Your worst day is certainly a dream day for most people.'' 
 Once again, the scale of everything from funds to guests to caliber of entertainment was outsized.
 ''Usually at an auction if I can get $10,000 for something, it's great,'' Mr. Niven said. ''Here I do it in increments of $10,000 to get to $200,000 or $300,000. It seems I can't count fast enough.'' 
 But the climate weighed on those helping to organize the event. From 65,000 to 85,000 jobs have been cut on Wall Street and heavy layoffs are expected to continue throughout the year.
 ''I was worried about the climate going into it,'' said Barry Sternlicht, a co-chairman of the event and chairman and chief executive of the Starwood Capital Group. ''This is a New York-based kind of recession and it's not a good year for the hedge fund industry. But we were blown away by the response.'' 
 There were, of course, stark contrasts to the benefit in 2007, a year in which the top 50 hedge fund managers made $29 billion, Wall Street posted big profits and flaunting wealth seemed more in vogue. 
 For example, in 2007, dinner for 10 with the chef Mario Batali fetched $1.3 million. An all-expenses-paid trip to the Olympics in China that included hanging out with the ''Today'' host Matt Lauer and meeting a member of the United States women's soccer team went for $2.2 million. More than $30 million was raised in a matter of minutes to build libraries in poor New York City schools (with an additional $7.5 million fund set up). Larry Robbins, a hedge fund manager known for his philanthropic work, set the tone by giving $10 million with his wife, Amy. 
 This year, the packages were equally lavish but the bidding simply did not climb as high. One package, called ''Universally Entertaining,'' included a walk-on role on the television show ''The Office,'' a walk down the red carpet at the Golden Globes and Super Bowl tickets, among other things. The package sold for about $500,000. Another package, ''Experience Australia in Five-Star Luxury,'' included a flight on the ''world's largest and most technologically advanced aircraft'' and fetched $420,000. 
 ''It felt quieter -- I can't explain it,'' a former hedge fund executive said. ''People are losing their jobs on Wall Street, and hedge fund guys are not making 30 percent this year.''
 Conan O'Brien, host of NBC's ''Late Night,'' hosted the event and gleefully roasted the guests. He suggested the crowd look for millions of dollars in the ''pillow cushions'' of John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made $3.7 billion last year. ''I don't even know who that guy is,'' Mr. O'Brien joked, one guest recalled. 
 For Wall Street, it may not have been 2007, but it was a night of its own particular -- generous -- excess. ''It's no longer chic to flaunt it,'' Mr. Sternlicht, the event's co-chairman, said. ''It's always chic to be charitable, especially if you can afford it.''

HEADLINE: Sect Mothers Say Separation Endangers Children

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN and DAN FROSCH; Gretel C. Kovach contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Ruth Edna Fischer was first allowed to see her 2-year-old daughter, from whom she had been separated after the raid on their polygamist ranch in Texas, at the child's hospital room. The child had been taken there because of severe dehydration and malnutrition, Ms. Fischer said.
 ''Hannah looked like a little orphan sitting on the couch,'' Ms. Fischer said. ''Her hair was stringy and she was in a diaper, a pair of dirty socks and a hospital gown.'' 
 The second visit two weeks later at a state office in Angleton, Tex., was worse. The girl would not even meet her mother's gaze. ''It was like she hardly remembered me,'' said Ms. Fischer, who has four children in state custody. 
 As they await a ruling by the highest court in Texas on whether child-welfare authorities had the right to take 468 children from the ranch early last month, the mothers have started speaking out more forcefully about what they think the separation has already done to their children.
 The mothers and their lawyers are undoubtedly trying to make their best pitch for public sympathy as the Supreme Court of Texas deliberates on the fate of their children. Last Thursday, an appeals court in Austin found that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services had illegally removed the children without sufficient evidence that they were in immediate danger. 
 On Friday, state officials asked the higher court for an emergency order that would allow them to keep all but a dozen children in their custody. The dozen children were returned to their parents under the condition that they have continuing supervision. The Supreme Court denied the stay on Friday, but said it would consider the case over the weekend. No decision has been issued yet.
 Many child-welfare experts across the nation, who have as a group watched the high-profile Texas case closely, say the raid on the polygamist ranch diverged sharply from the recommended practices both in Texas and elsewhere in the country. 
 They say a growing body of research supports the contention of the mothers that forceful removal can have both significant short-term and long-lasting harm, particularly for younger children. Some studies have found that the wide-ranging effects include anxiety, extreme distrust of strangers and, in the future, higher rates of teenage pregnancy and juvenile incarceration.
 Through their lawyers and in personal interviews, the mothers have been spilling tales of toddlers who have forgotten toilet training and 3-year-olds who cling to them frantically during visits. Ms. Fischer's child became dehydrated as a result of a fever. 
 It is because of the growing national consensus about the scarring effect of removal on children, even if only temporarily, that federal law -- to which all state law must defer -- demands that children be removed only if ''reasonable efforts'' to keep them at home have been made. 
 Many states, like Oregon and Tennessee, have gone even further to protect children from the trauma of removal by giving families intensive in-home services first, and then, if the child is taken, having conferences with the parents, kin and friends from the community within 48 hours to help smooth the transition.
 Some experts in Texas state law and procedure say the state not only violated minimum national standards, which are written into the Texas Family Code, but they also violated due process considerations. These were essentially the findings of the appeals court. 
 ''They made no effort to keep the children there at the ranch,'' said Johana Scot, executive director of the Parent Guidance Center in Austin, which helps advocate for the rights of parents who have had their children taken into foster care. 
 ''And even worse, they did not give the families individual hearings, which they are also required to do by the code,'' Ms. Scot said. ''They've really botched this.''
 Marleigh Meisner, a public information officer for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said she could not discuss any particulars of this case. But in the filing to the Texas Supreme Court last Friday, the state held that because the parents had declined to identify which children belonged to whom, they could not at first be treated individually.
 Further, the state asserted that all children were at risk because they were being indoctrinated into a pattern of sexual abuse -- the young girls as victims, and the boys as predators.
 Last Friday, to bolster its case, the state made public a picture of what it said was the now-imprisoned leader of the church, Warren S. Jeffs, kissing a 12-year female child on the lips.
 The state's raid on the Yearning for Zion ranch of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or F.L.D.S., came on April 3 after someone called an abuse hot line and said that she was a 16-year-old child bride being abused by her older husband at the ranch in Eldorado, Tex., which is about 45 miles south of San Angelo. 
 The state raided the ranch and conducted an extensive investigation of the sect's files and found that numerous girls under the age of 16, some as young as 13, had been impregnated by older men. The caller has not been found.
 Lawyers for the families say Texas officials overstepped the law in removing the children from their families; some three-quarters of the children were under age 10 and presumably not at ''imminent risk'' of abuse, which is the standard, according to federal law. Less draconian options, which the state did not employ, could have included removing all the men from the ranch or only the teenage girls, the lawyers have argued.
 Steven D. Cohen, a senior associate at the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation, a national child-advocacy organization, said that while he could not say whether Texas officials acted improperly in taking the children from their mothers, he did think that they had violated numerous standards of best practice widely used elsewhere.
 ''Breaking all of the ties to several parental figures and siblings, and taking them to a remote and unfamiliar place raises many red flags about trauma and its effect on children,'' Mr. Cohen said
 Experts say younger children, who often do not have a sense of the passage of time, can be particularly hard hit by such separations. About 100 of the children removed from the sect were 2 years old or younger. 
 Shelly Greco, a court-appointed lawyer for a 14-month-old girl removed from the ranch, says the child had been up crying uncontrollably many nights because she was so abruptly weaned.
 Numerous studies in recent years show that the effects of removal can be long lasting, often not showing up fully for a decade of more. In one study, Joseph J. Doyle, an economist with the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., found that children removed from their parents and taken into foster care, even for a relatively short period, were three times as likely to grow up to be juvenile offenders or have a teenage pregnancy than were children from similarly troubled homes who had been left with their parents.
 Professor Doyle said Texas was far from alone in erring on the side of removal. ''From the caseworker's point of view, the incentive is to take the kid,'' he said. ''That's the safer choice, because it is unlikely that if something terrible happens in foster care they would be blamed. Whereas if something were to happen at home, the caseworker would be blamed.'' 
 But Lori Jessop, one of a few mothers from the ranch who were reunited with their children in a court-brokered agreement last Friday, said she had already seen the impact of this situation. Ms. Jessop said her three children were suffering from night terrors and a fear of strangers, among other problems. She said that when her 4-year-old daughter recently saw a picture of a bus, like the one used to transport the children when they were in foster care, she started to cry. 
 ''It's affected her a lot,'' Ms. Jessop said. ''Everybody that she sees, especially adult men, she calls them policemen.''

HEADLINE: Sony Taps Into Photo Archive as a Resource During Hard Times

BYLINE: By ROBERT LEVINE

 BODY:
Some of Sony's music executives believe there is a gold mine under the company's New York headquarters on Madison Avenue. It doesn't look like much: just a small room, three floors below ground level, with a wall full of the sliding shelves you'd find in a law firm or university library.
 But the shelves hold decades of music history as captured by Columbia Records staff photographers: Miles Davis recording ''Kind of Blue'' in 1959 at the company's old 30th Street Studio; Bob Dylan standing with then-girlfriend Suze Rotolo on a slushy Greenwich Village street in 1963; Bruce Springsteen proudly holding a copy of his first record in 1973. 
 Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, but for decades the images in the archives have been used mostly for box sets and other historical projects. But in another sign that the major labels are looking for new sources of revenue wherever they can find them, Sony BMG Music Entertainment is trying to tap into the treasures that its labels have locked away.
 Last year the company started Icon Collectibles, a boutique business that sells art-quality reproductions of these photos online, for prices from $300 to $1,700, and through various partners (including the News Services Division of The New York Times). Now it is expected to announce Thursday that it has made a deal to sell its photos through the Morrison Hotel Gallery, which specializes in rock imagery. In mid-July the gallery will open an exhibition of photos from Columbia's 30th Street Studio in its gallery on 124 Prince Street in SoHo, with plans for an exhibition of Miles Davis images in November. 
 ''We're looking to take advantage of all the assets of the company, not just the audio recordings,'' said John Ingrassia, president of Sony BMG Music Entertainment's commercial music group, which manages the company's catalog. ''We have the content, and we found a way to tap into it.'' 
 Some images in the archive may be familiar to music fans: Johnny Cash deep in thought with a guitar on his lap in 1959, Mr. Dylan sitting at a piano wearing his Ray-Ban sunglasses in 1965. Others have rarely been seen, including an image of Sly Stone in front of a reel-to-reel tape player in 1973 and dramatic photos of Muhammad Ali, then still known as Cassius Clay, recording the 1963 spoken-word album ''I Am the Greatest!'' 
 The Morrison Hotel Gallery mostly sells images owned by prominent music photographers like Jim Marshall, who shot groups like the Rolling Stones and the Who in the '60s, and Mick Rock, whose images of David Bowie helped define the glam-rock aesthetic. 
 ''A good record company exploits its catalog,'' said Peter Blachley, who founded the Morrison Hotel Gallery in 2002 with Rich Horowitz and the photographer Henry Diltz. The gallery now has branches in SoHo and the Bowery, as well as Los Angeles and San Diego. 
 To sell photos from the archive, Sony BMG gets the permission of the artists or their estates and gives them a cut of sales. Since photos do not interfere with the mainstream merchandising business, most musicians have given the company their blessing. 
 ''When Sony came to us, we figured if fans wanted to buy something different, as long as it's respectful, why not?'' said Lou Robin, Johnny Cash's longtime manager, who handles some of the Cash estate's business affairs. 
 Besides the high-priced photographs Icon also plans to sell mass-market products with imagery from the archive, Mr. Ingrassia said. (BMG labels like RCA and Arista also have archives with potentially valuable imagery.) He added that he hoped Icon could eventually grow into ''a seven-figure business.'' That's far less than a hit album earns, but in this economic climate, perhaps every million counts.
 Essentially Icon enables Sony BMG to make money from the popularity of music without actually selling songs. As revenue from album sales has slipped, labels are looking for new ways to capitalize on the music experience. 
 ''We have a remarkable archive at Warner,'' said Gregg Goldman, executive vice president of Rhino Entertainment, the division of the Warner Music Group that handles the company's catalog, ''and we're looking at various ways to turn that into a business, along with the cooperation of our artists.''
 Although Sony BMG owns all the images in its archive that were taken by staff photographers, it is giving a royalty to those who make new prints of their work or autograph it. Among those is Don Hunstein, who worked at Columbia from 1956 to 1979, shooting hundreds of acts that recorded at the company's 30th Street Studio, including Davis, Count Basie and Julie Andrews.
 ''I was just doing my job,'' said Mr. Hunstein, whose work will be featured in the Morrison Hotel Gallery exhibition in July. But he still remembers taking the photo of Mr. Dylan that was used as the cover of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.'' After shooting a few rolls of film in Mr. Dylan's Greenwich Village apartment, Mr. Hunstein took him and Ms. Rotolo outside.
 ''It was February, it was a gloomy day, and there was slush in the streets,'' he recalled. (In her new memoir Ms. Rotolo remembers this event happening on Jones Street; such are recollections about rock's legendary moments.) ''I told them to go up a bit away from me on Cornelia Street and walk toward me. But the light was fading, so we called it quits after two rolls of film.''
 Many fans will be eager to see the other images from that shoot, even though the impetus to sell them came at least partly out of the desperate situation in which the labels find themselves. ''I'm not unaware that some people might look at this cynically, but as a fan, I like that it's available,'' Mr. Ingrassia said. ''The difficulties in the business have opened people's eyes to things we didn't consider doing.''

HEADLINE: Big Chains Benefit From City Tax Incentives but Don't Create Jobs, a Report Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In 1976, when New York was fighting to stem an exodus of high-paying jobs to the suburbs and beyond, the city created a program of property tax breaks aimed at retaining industrial companies and other employers. 
 But in the last three decades, as the city's economy has evolved, those incentives have been put to some very different uses. According to a report to be released on Thursday by Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, those tax breaks are going to fast-food restaurants, gas stations and national chain stores. 
 In many cases, those businesses have not used the incentives to create jobs, but have simply displaced independent enterprises, Mr. Stringer said. What's more, he said, many of them are ''at odds'' with the Bloomberg administration's public health initiatives. 
 Several Burger King and McDonald's restaurants in Upper Manhattan receive the breaks, as does the giant Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square, said Mr. Stringer, who is calling for state lawmakers to revamp the program.
 The subsidies were granted through the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which is now the city's second-largest property tax expenditure, according to Mr. Stringer's report. The $409.5 million dedicated to the program last year exceeded the $390 million expenditure for the New York City Housing Authority properties, the report states.
 About 40 percent of that total goes to businesses in Manhattan, with developers of office buildings and retail centers like Chelsea Market receiving the largest benefits, Mr. Stringer's office said.
 ''This program must be radically reformed and scaled back,'' said Mr. Stringer, who added that he was trying to rally support for a legislative overhaul of the program in Albany before the current session ends next month. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation also has proposed revamping the program. In a 2007 report, the corporation recommended eliminating all retail businesses other than hotels from the program. Doing so would erase more than $2.1 billion in subsidies over the next two decades, the report said.
 Mr. Stringer, who released the development corporation report on Wednesday, said he would not go that far. He said he would prefer to continue offering subsidies to locally owned retail businesses, but would stop granting them to fast-food restaurants, chain drug stores and profitable national retailers. 
 Chain stores in Manhattan will receive more than $7.5 million in the subsidies this year, the largest share being $2.4 million for the Toys ''R'' Us store in Times Square, one of the more valuable pieces of commercial property in the world. 
 ''At the same time that everybody is praising home-grown enterprises in the city, I.C.I.P. is subsidizing chain retail stores like Rite-Aid and CVS,'' Mr. Stringer said, referring to the incentive program by its initials. ''The last thing we need is Rite-Aid and CVS.''
 A spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, Janel Patterson, declined to discuss details of the city's proposals before a bill is introduced in Albany. But she said in a statement that city officials ''have put forth a comprehensive reform package that we believe ensures that the program does not unnecessarily subsidize development projects, while simultaneously ensuring that it continues to encourage growth in uncertain economic times.''
 State Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican from Queens, sponsored a bill last year that would have made the changes sought by the Economic Development Corporation, but it did not pass. With the legislation that enabled the program set to expire last June 30, lawmakers extended it for a year.
 Brian Gorman, a spokesman for Senator Padavan, said he did not know the details of the development corporation's latest set of proposals but added that city officials were scheduled to brief the senator's staff on Thursday.
 ''We'll be working with the city on this,'' Mr. Gorman said. He added that he was unaware of any organized opposition to the changes that were proposed last year.
 Mr. Stringer said that providing subsidies to fast-food restaurants and gas stations ran counter to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's initiatives to fight obesity and asthma among children in poorer neighborhoods. In Manhattan, some of the incentives are confined to the areas above 96th Street and below Murray Street downtown.
 This year, 11 gas stations in Washington Heights, Inwood, Harlem and East Harlem will receive more than $480,000 in tax breaks through the program, according to Mr. Stringer's report. Two others on the Far West Side will receive an additional $30,000, the report says.

HEADLINE: Strike Settled, American Axle Details Layoff Plans

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Fewer than half of the hourly employees at American Axle and Manufacturing who are returning to work this week for the first time since going on strike in February will still have jobs in a year, company executives said Wednesday.
 The parts supplier said Wednesday that it expected to save about $300 million a year under its new contract with the United Automobile Workers union, largely by eliminating about 2,000 of the 3,650 jobs now held by U.A.W. members in Michigan and New York, along with an unspecified number of salaried positions. 
 Workers can leave voluntarily by accepting a buyout package worth either $85,000 or $140,000, depending on how long they have been there. Those who stay will earn considerably lower wages, which will be tempered by three annual ''buydown'' payments totaling as much as $105,000.
 American Axle said its hourly labor rate, including wages and benefits, would be cut at least in half by the new contract, which had the support of 78 percent of the U.A.W. members who voted last week. Workers will earn an all-in rate of $30 to $45 an hour, or $26.54 for new hires, down from $73.48 under the previous contract. (During negotiations, the U.A.W. disputed the company's calculation of the old numbers as too high.)
 But reaching the agreement was costly. American Axle on Wednesday said it had lost $370 million in sales and $125 million to $130 million, or $1.60 a share, in earnings during the 87-day strike, which lasted from Feb. 26 to May 22.
 Shares of American Axle fell 5.8 percent, to $17.92, Wednesday. The stock has lost 20 percent of its value since May 16, when negotiators reached a tentative settlement.
 The chief executive, Richard E. Dauch, said the cost reductions and flexibility were needed to keep factories open in the United States. Mr. Dauch founded American Axle in 1994 from former General Motors parts plants in Detroit and Three Rivers in Michigan, and near Buffalo.
 ''The recent and rapidly accelerating deterioration in the domestic light truck market is having a negative impact on A.A.M.'s U.S. operations,'' Mr. Dauch said in a conference call. ''While this is unfortunate, it is a market reality that A.A.M. and the international U.A.W. have jointly addressed in this new set of agreements.''
 Two of the company's five factories -- forging plants in Detroit and Tonawanda, N.Y. -- will close.
 The chief financial officer, Michael K. Simonte, said the three remaining plants now have the potential to be profitable for the first time since 2004. Operations in Mexico and overseas helped the company earn $37 million in 2007.
 ''The cost savings we expect to derive from the new labor agreement will go a long way to improve the economic viability and sustainability of these facilities, and that will save jobs,'' Mr. Simonte said.
 But most new work will be going outside the United States. American Axle said it had lined up $1.4 billion in new and incremental business for the next five years, and that 85 percent of it would be sourced abroad.
 The company said buyouts and buydowns would cost $400 million to $450 million. G.M., which had to shut many truck, sport utility vehicle and component factories during the strike after running out of parts made by American Axle, agreed to contribute $215 million toward those costs.
 G.M. said last week in a regulatory filing that the strike had reduced its earnings in the first half of this year by $2.6 billion.

HEADLINE: Deals Fade, And Airlines Look to Cut

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
As the likelihood of additional mergers in the airline industry dims, big United States carriers face a bleak future of making further cuts on their own to survive in an era of soaring jet fuel prices.
 Consolidation had been seen as the most palatable way to shrink the industry -- by grounding planes, eliminating routes and cutting staffs -- to ensure profitability. 
 The prospect of further mergers, beyond the already-announced Delta Air Lines deal with Northwest Airlines, would have also offered airline executives a ready explanation of why cutbacks in service and staff were needed. 
 United Airlines and US Airways have long been considered merger candidates. The chief executives of each airline are scheduled to meet Thursday, but there has been little to no recent contact between teams of executives at both companies in talks that began weeks ago. 
 Outside bankers and lawyers assigned to the project have put it on ''permanent hold,'' waiting for instructions, one person involved in the talks said. Officials at United and US Airways declined to comment.
 The talks could be revived. But in addition to the usual obstacles to an airline deal -- like winning the support of labor unions -- there is growing time pressure. The Delta-Northwest merger could be the only one that will take place in time for Bush administration scrutiny. Any other combinations would most likely face the uncertainty of a new administration.
 If United, US Airways and other airlines are forced to cut costs on their own, the pain could be magnified since it will be their own doing, not the result of a strategic step accompanied by pronouncements of a stronger future.
 ''Nothing is equivalent to the lightning strike that comes with a merger,'' said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 High fuel prices, the force driving the airlines' difficult actions, provide less drama, of course. And the rise in jet fuel costs, up 82.5 percent over last year, has come incrementally. 
 Airline industry losses could top $7.2 billion this year, Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, estimated recently. Some analysts estimate that airlines will have to raise fares on all routes by about $60 to offset the impact of rising fuel prices. 
 But they have already pushed through many fare increases, and have resorted to a number of fees and surcharges to bring in more revenue.
 The current situation is not what analysts expected when Delta and Northwest announced their deal on April 14. The agreement jump-started United's efforts to seek its own deal, and fed predictions that other airlines might combine.
 But United failed to reach an agreement with Continental Airlines. And its discussions with US Airways have bogged down. United's chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, and his counterpart at US Airways, W. Douglas Parker, were scheduled to meet Thursday to review whether to continue exploring an arrangement, people with direct knowledge of the meeting said.
 Mr. Tilton and members of the United board recently raised concerns about the risks involved in the transaction, although both sides had agreed the deal could provide value to each airline, these people said.
 Delta and Northwest could benefit from their merger's status as the lone deal, if no others occur. The chief executives of those airlines have been grilled by members of Congress about the arrangement. Both companies have pledged not to make deep cuts, a concern for lawmakers who fear mergers might hurt airports and customers in their districts.
 Yet, the cuts might happen any way, said Philip A. Baggaley, a senior credit analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. ''The near-term task for all the airlines is the same, whether they're planning to merge or not. That is to cut nonfuel costs where possible, trim flying in the domestic market and try to raise fares even more,'' he said. ''It's really back to basics.''
 The airlines' dilemma is in contrast to early 2007, when US Airways made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Delta. Carriers were generally profitable back then because of extensive cost-cutting under bankruptcy protection or through reorganization efforts. 
 Fuel prices were modest compared with today, and airlines were able to push through modest fare increases. But this year, the industry expects a decline in summer travel, accompanied by layoffs and rising airfares. 
 ''It's the speed of the increase in fuel prices and the fact that it's occurring in a weak economy which have created such problems for the airlines,'' Mr. Baggaley said. Last week, S.& P. placed nine more airlines on credit watch with negative implications, meaning it was likely to cut their debt ratings. 
 They include the biggest carrier, American Airlines, which has begun announcing details of how it will cut 11 to 12 percent of its flights this year.
 On Wednesday, it said it would eliminate its daily flight between Kennedy Airport in New York and London Stansted Airport, effective July 2. On Tuesday, American said it would discontinue flights between Chicago and Buenos Aires as well as Boston and San Diego. Both are halting on Sept. 3.
 Even the steps American has announced will not make things much easier. ''It looks like American will be flying into a headwind, no matter what it does for the rest of the year,'' Vicki Bryan, an analyst with Gimme Credit, wrote in a research report on Wednesday. 
 Such prospects are why airlines may still view mergers as the ultimate solution to their problems, Professor Useem said. ''Consolidation has such a well-worn proven history'' in other industries, he said. ''I can't imagine the discussion will end.''

The Dow Chemical Company, the chemical giant, said Wednesday that it would raise its prices by up to 20 percent almost immediately to offset the soaring cost of energy, and the company's chief executive criticized Washington for failing to develop a sound energy policy. 
 ''For years, Washington has failed to address the issue of rising energy costs and, as a result, the country now faces a true energy crisis, one that is causing serious harm to America's manufacturing sector and all consumers of energy,'' Andrew N. Liveris, Dow Chemical's chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.
 Dow Chemical's spiraling costs are ''forcing difficult discussions with customers,'' he said.
 The company, based in Midland, Mich., supplies a broad swath of industries, from agriculture to health care, and any sizable price jumps would likely affect almost all of them.
 The price increases will take effect Sunday and will be based on a product's exposure to rising costs. Dow Chemical said it spent $8 billion on energy and hydrocarbon-based feedstock, or raw materials, in 2002 and that could climb fourfold to $32 billion this year.
 Dow Chemical makes products ranging from the propylene glycols used in antifreeze, coolants, solvents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to acrylic acid-based products used in detergents, wastewater-treatment and disposable diapers.
 It makes crucial ingredients used in paints, textiles, glass, packaging and cars.
 The company, whose products are sold in 160 countries, last month reported a 3 percent decline in quarterly earnings amid a 42 percent increase in energy and raw materials costs.
 Its profit margins shrank to 7.6 percent in 2006, from 9.8 percent in 2005, and to 5.4 percent last year. During the 12-month period that ended March 31, the margin narrowed to 5.1 percent, according to Capital IQ.
 Crude oil prices surpassed $135 a barrel last week, more than double the price from a year ago. Rising energy and transportation costs have been blamed for higher food prices, which rose 5 percent last year, the highest gain in 17 years.
 Kevin McCarthy, a Banc of America Securities analyst, said in a note to investors there was ''a growing unwillingness among chemical producers to function as an energy shock absorber.''
 ''To be sure, cost inflation is not new; it has been an ongoing battle for Dow and others in recent years,'' he wrote. ''However, we are seeing a new sense of urgency at Dow, and its competitors, to pass along escalating and volatile costs in an environment of decelerating demand.''
 Price increases from major suppliers significantly affect the cost of manufacturing, said Angie Chaplin, a spokeswoman for the Solo Cup Company. The company, based in Highland Park, Ill., is a customer of Dow Chemical.
 ''We absorb as much of these increases as we can through greater efficiency in our own operations, but we have no choice other than to pass on some of the increased cost to our customers,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Ruling Near on Boeing-Airbus Dispute

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Airbus and Boeing have packed a decade's worth of drama into the nearly four years since the United States and Europe began a battle over state aid for their aircraft industries.
 Now, with the World Trade Organization expected to hand down a ruling soon, European officials have revived the issue of subsidies, suggesting this week that their governments would chip in for the development of the Airbus A350, the rival to the Boeing 787.
 Boeing quickly criticized Airbus, demonstrating that however much has changed in the relative fortunes of the two companies, they have not budged in their dispute over how to pay for their planes. 
 ''Airbus should fund its operations in the commercial market,'' Ted Austell, Boeing's vice president for international policy, said during an interview while on a swing through Europe to discuss the legal case.
 Mr. Austell said he expected an interim ruling from the World Trade Organization on the American case against the European Union in the next few weeks. A decision on Europe's tit-for-tat suit against the United States could come four to six months after that, he said.
 These confidential findings could set the stage for a negotiated settlement, Mr. Austell said, particularly if the trade organization sent a clear signal that subsidies for civil aircraft were illegal.
 The ripples may extend beyond the United States and Europe -- to Brazil, China, Japan and other countries that are seeking to build their aircraft industry as more of their residents can afford to travel.
 ''With other countries aspiring to build large civil aircraft,'' he said, ''these cases are even more important to the future of the industry than they were when they were filed.''
 Other specialists, though, argue that whatever the W.T.O. decides, governments will always find ways to funnel money to expensive, but politically popular, civil aircraft programs.
 ''They can reconfigure aid packages in different ways,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''The W.T.O. only rules on a specific configuration.''
 The discussions of support for the A350 already reflect this reality. Speaking at an air show in Berlin on Tuesday, the German deputy economics minister, Peter Hintze, said the state backers of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the corporate parent of Airbus, had agreed to provide financial aid for the A350 within the confines of the impending legal decision.
 ''We granted such loans for the development of the A380,'' Mr. Hintze said, according to Bloomberg News. ''We agree in principle that we will also do so with the A350, clearly complying with the rules of the World Trade Organization.''
 On Wednesday, Airbus sought to clarify its position, saying it had not formally requested financing.
 ''There is no request whatsoever,'' a spokeswoman, Barbara Kracht, said. ''What was discussed was that in order to achieve a level playing field, we should look into possibilities of W.T.O.-compliant means.''
 Lawyers for Boeing said they would be curious to see what form this takes, though in fact, there are many ways to finance planes.
 The European Union, for example, contends that Boeing has received $23 billion in aid since 1992 in the form of Pentagon research and development grants, tax incentives from states like Washington, and subsidies to suppliers of aircraft parts from the Japanese government.
 The state backers of Airbus -- Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- typically financed a third of the development costs of planes through low-cost loans known as launch aid. The United States argues that this aid -- more than $15 billion -- gave Airbus an unfair advantage over Boeing.
 As a practical matter, few analysts believe Airbus can afford the 11.6 billion euro, or $18.1 billion, in development costs for the A350 without some kind of help. Although Airbus has accumulated a lot of cash from record sales of its airplanes, that boom is likely to be coming to an end.
 Mr. Aboulafia said he figured that the heaviest expenditures at Airbus for the A350 -- around 2013, when the plane is scheduled to be introduced -- would coincide with the low ebb in its production cycle. By then, he predicted, Boeing will turn out 447 planes a year, compared with 296 for Airbus.
 The W.T.O. is unlikely to be moved by the ups and downs of Boeing or Airbus, lawyers said.
 Boeing has won hundreds of orders for the 787, putting the A350 at a disadvantage. On the other hand, EADS and its American partner, Northrop Grumman, stung Boeing by winning a $35 billion contract from the Air Force to supply aerial refueling tankers. And both Boeing and Airbus have suffered embarrassing production delays with their newest planes.
 What may follow this long-awaited ruling, lawyers said, is an even longer debate over what constitutes improper support.
 ''Even offers of W.T.O.-consistent financing could be a concern,'' Mr. Austell of Boeing said, ''since the European Commission and Airbus have argued that launch aid is W.T.O.-consistent.''

OLMERT AIMS TO STAY IN PLACE
Despite Call for Resignation
More straws landed upon the back of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel as Ehud Barak, the Minister of Defense called for him to step down pending the outcome of his corruption inquest. Mr. Olmert refused, saying that he did not believe that he should step down simply because of an investigation. An official close to him said that Mr. Olmert did not want the political machine to trump the legal one, and believed it would become clear during the inquest that he had done nothing wrong. Page A10
THE GERMAN MILK PARTY?
The Federation of European Dairy Farmers estimates that, on Wednesday alone, 10.6 million gallons of milk were dumped in a boycott by European dairy farmers. Why? While food prices have soared, the price of milk has not, in part because the European Union has raised quotas but not prices. As the price of milk fell, prices of fuel and feed rose. But cows keep producing and will sicken if not milked, so dairy farmers will keep working, and dumping, as long as the boycott lasts. Page A6 
THE LAST DAYS OF NEPAL'S MONARCHY
Nepal's 239-year-long monarchy neared its end, as a newly elected assembly told Gyanendra, king of Nepal, to step down from his throne in 15 days. The assembly is led by former Maoist guerrillas who emerged from the jungle after 10 years of war and traded gunplay for politics. They also demanded an end to the monarchy. Winning more than a third of Parliament's 601 seats, they hold a majority position and the party's leader is expected to take over as prime minister. Those suspected of remaining loyal to the monarchy have spoken by detonating small bombs in Katmandu. Page A8
SOUTH AFRICA WEIGHS SHELTER PLAN
Waves of xenophobic violence have been visited against immigrants in South Africa, leading them to flee the impoverished squatter areas they had been living in. Relief organizations have proposed shelters intended as a temporary solution that could house as many as 70,000, but have been delayed pending a government decision. Doubts have been raised about South Africa's ability to run them, and international agencies fear that the camps could become rife with conflicts and sexual violence. Page A12

A PARTIAL PICTURE
Of Carbon Footprints
A new study by the Brookings Institution rating energy use showed, in general, smaller carbon footprints for the West Coast, with the Honolulu area ranked No. 1 followed by the area including Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, the Portland-Vancouver area in the Northwest and the New York metropolitan area. At the bottom: a cluster of rust-belt urban areas including Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Lexington, Ky.; and Toledo, Ohio. PAGE A21
A PLAN FOR THE OCEANS
With numerous projects being proposed for the waters off its shores, Massachusetts is now the first state to have a framework for a protection plan for its ocean waters. It sets ground rules for all offshore projects and businesses, including energy ventures and conservation areas that lie within three miles of the coast. PAGE A15
FINDING THE TABLES TURNED
As President Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan was part of the apparatus used by the White House to take on Mr. Bush's critics. Having departed that job, and with a new book that now casts him as one of those critics, Mr. McClellan is learning that the apparatus still functions without him. PAGE A14
CARE FOR THOSE WHO GIVE CARE
The Army has begun to recognize that the war in Iraq is taking a toll not only on the troops, but also on those who counsel those troops, the chaplains. None have been killed, but some have been wounded, some in ways that cannot be seen. ''I've been really pushed to my limits and beyond,'' one said. ''At times, I've really wondered if I could get through.'' PAGE A19
SECT MOTHERS SPEAK OUT
As the highest court in Texas prepares to rule on whether child welfare authorities had the right to take 468 children from a ranch early last month, the mothers are trying to make their case with the public by speaking out more forcefully about the harm they think the separation has already done to their children.

BUSINESS
WITH FURTHER MERGERS UNLIKELY,
Airlines Face Making Own Cuts
Mergers other than the already-announced deal between Delta and Northwest seem unlikely, so airlines seeking to offset rising fuel prices are likely to cut costs, cut routes and park planes without the camouflage that a merger would have provided. And that means that the grumbling will come through unfiltered. PAGE C1
EXXON CHALLENGE DEFEATED
Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, defeated a shareholder effort supported by many members of the Rockefeller family that would have divided the chairman and chief executive positions. The vote was at an annual meeting punctuated by a debate of the company's policy toward renewable energy and global warming and, though nonbinding, would have been a serious rebuke. PAGE C3
NATURAL GAS RISING LIKE GASOLINE
A longstanding assumption of American energy policy -- that natural gas will be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America -- is being challenged as the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead.

Christopher Carter, who was two bikes down, took issue with the noises. Now a trial in Manhattan Criminal Court is to determine whether what Mr. Carter did to stop Mr. Sugarman from making those noises qualifies as assault. PAGE A25
DEFENDING A PERK
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York says giving members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board free E-ZPasses to drive across its bridges and tunnels without paying tolls, as well as passes to ride the subways, buses and commuter railroads without paying, violates a state law requiring that members serve without compensation. The authority disagrees, and plans to go to court to fight for the perk. PAGE A24

STILL TURNING A PROFIT
In Fashion's Fast Lane
One survey this month found more than half the respondents saying they planned to spend less on apparel; another found almost a third of people reporting ''severe anxiety'' about their personal finances. All of which can be good news, it seems, if you happen to be in the fast-fashion business. ''The least vulnerable brands now are the ones at the lower end of the luxury market and the upper end of the midtier market,'' one analyst said. PAGE E1
YOGA FOR THE MASSES
The explosion in popularity of yoga has been good news for novices looking for classes -- there is seemingly one on every corner, and maybe another upstairs. But for the advanced student looking for something a little -- or a lot -- more challenging, the result is not so good. In seeking to be accessible to the many, classes become less desirable for the few. PAGE E10
FEEL THE STRETCH, AVOID THE MARK
Various concoctions are marketing as being able to prevent stretch marks resulting from pregnancy. Can they? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says no. But the American Pregnancy Association suggests that women can reduce the probability of stretch marks (the key word being ''probability''). But be aware that genetics and race play a role in stretch marks, too. skin PAGE E3
NO ORDINARY JOE
This sort of thing used to be reserved for wines, but beers have gotten into the act, along with single malt scotches.

Take along a sophisticated palate if you want to pick up the hints of basil and jasmine. PAGE E6

WHEN IT WENT TO THE WIRE
The occasion of this year's run at horse racing's Triple Crown cannot help calling forth memories of the last one, 30 years ago, when two outstanding horses not only faced off in each of the three races but also finished 1-2 in each of them. ''Seen through the current prism of fragile, transient champions, Affirmed and Alydar seem from another planet, another age, another breed,'' George Vecsey writes in Sports of The Times. PAGE C14

For those who want -- or have -- a swimming pool, but do not want the smell and possible other side effects of a chlorine sanitation system, other options exist. Pool installers may not tell you about them, and they are not cheap, but for some people they are a must. ''Our target audience is the person who shops at Whole Foods,'' said one installer. PAGE F1
PUTTING DOWN (SHALLOW) ROOTS
Move often enough, Peter Moore says, and ''you realize quickly how you are burdened by your past, and so you become a ruthless editor.'' And Mr. Moore, an architect and developer, and his wife, Kathryn Lynch, a painter, have moved often enough. But they've been in the same place for three years now: the top floor of an 1890s brick warehouse on Washington Street. ''Our semipermanent home,'' he calls it. PAGE F5

HEADLINE: Foodies on the Hudson

BYLINE: By KATHRYN MATTHEWS

 BODY:
BEFORE the post-9/11 influx of second-home owners to the Hudson Valley, sophisticated restaurants taking advantage of the region's bounty were scarce. Christine Jones and Bert Goldfinger, New Yorkers who have owned a farmhouse in bucolic Ghent, N.Y., in Columbia County, since 1993, remember the way it was. 
 When they ventured out to eat, Ms. Jones said, they found ''old-fashioned food from the 'Joy of Cooking' era.'' Veal Parmesan. Pasta salads. Turkey tetrazzini. ''Honey-stung'' chicken -- frozen, breaded, honey-injected chicken that, once thawed, was deep-fried. 
 Salad dressings came out of a bottle. Packaged hamburger patties and French fries, purchased in bulk, lurked in restaurant freezers. The main source for ingredients seemed to be multinational food companies. It was convenient, and prices could be kept low. But this wasn't the kind of fare the couple sought. 
 ''Ironically, most restaurants in the country used very little farm-fresh food,'' Dr. Goldfinger, 56, a Manhattan dentist said, adding only half-jokingly, ''Christine and I had to open our own restaurant.''
 And so they did. 
 In 1996, while maintaining a daytime practice, Dr. Goldfinger enrolled in the evening professional chef program at the French Culinary Institute in SoHo and then worked part time at Aureole and Le Cirque for three years. Ms. Jones, 59, a former marketing executive at a SoHo design firm, honed her dessert-making skills by taking a bread-baking program at the institute. In 2001, the couple opened the Red Barn, a 60-seat American bistro, in Ghent. ''We pattern ourselves after Balthazar in Manhattan,'' Ms. Jones said. 
 About 80 percent of their clientele consists of second-home owners, who appreciate the style and range of the Red Barn menu -- from a raw bar and whole grilled fish to sweetbreads, octopus and hanger steak frites -- and its well-edited wine list, and who are willing to pay for quality. ''Many of our customers eat at Le Cirque and Daniel during the week,'' Dr. Goldfinger said.
 The epicurean standards of second-home owners, many of whom are from New York, have raised the bar for restaurants in the Hudson Valley. You'll never quite have Manhattan. But these days, you can come closer. 
 Hilary and Brian Weisfeld are typical of the new breed of country-restaurant patrons. Even with a toddler and newborn in tow, the Weisfelds, who live on the Upper West Side and own a weekend house in Rhinebeck, N.Y., remain discerning diners. 
 ''Regardless of the location or price, I won't settle for a mediocre restaurant meal,'' emphasized Ms. Weisfeld, 35, a former network marketing executive who is now a full-time mother. They were delighted to discover Mercato, a 36-seat osteria owned by Francesco Buitoni and his partner, Michele Platt, in Red Hook, just north of Rhinebeck. 
 Ms. Weisfeld raved about the ''authentic Italian food that is very upscale in a low-key way.'' Since its opening last year, Mercato has become their regular go-to restaurant. 
 Mr. Buitoni, 39, a seventh-generation member of the Italian pasta family and a veteran of such Manhattan restaurants as San Domenico, Teodora and Gemelli, said that serving the second-home crowd from the city enables him to cook the way he grew up eating in Italy. Many of his customers are well traveled, knowledgeable about Italian food, and appreciative of his market-driven menu that changes weekly and his rotating Italian wine list. 
 They're also familiar with the economics of procuring local, organic or specialty foods: a $20 entree doesn't raise eyebrows, and a $38 red snapper from New Zealand will sell. ''Quality sources cost more, and our customers understand that,'' he said. 
 The artist Brice Marden, who owns a country estate in Tivoli, north of Red Hook, has become a regular patron of Madalin's Table, in the village's restored 1909 landmark Madalin Hotel. Mr. Marden, who describes his wife, Helen, as a ''very good cook,'' resisted dining out upstate until this restaurant opened two years ago. 
 The appeal, he said, is that the chef, Brian Kaywork, trained at the Culinary Institute of America, delivers reliably well-executed food, from a simple roast chicken to seasonal specials like roasted bone marrow from grass-fed cattle. Another draw is the professionalism of the amiable staff members, who know what Mr. Marden likes and give it to him when he comes in: a tucked-away table in the bar and minimal intrusion.
 SECOND-HOME owners don't necessarily want an exact facsimile of a Manhattan dining experience. ''In the country, I want a great meal without a trendy scene, a three-month wait for a reservation or a pretentious attitude,'' said Bob Kaus, a SoHo-based music industry public relations executive. 
 And the food doesn't have to be fancy. When he and his girlfriend, Juliet Dominguez, go to his weekend house in Millbrook, they ritually dine at Cafe Les Baux there, which serves their favorite French comfort foods, like moules frites and grilled salmon, in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. The staff is always accommodating. ''If we're running late, we call in our dinner orders from the car, and when we arrive, we're seated and served,'' Mr. Kaus said.
 A restaurant owner or chef who makes weekenders feel comfortable and welcome often earns their loyalty. For Jean Wardle, a retired film editor, and her husband, Ray Mortenson, a photographer, who own a second home in Germantown, north of Tivoli, Joe Cicileo, 44, the gregarious front man at Madalin's Table, is a big part of the reason to return there again and again. ''Going there is like having dinner at Joe's house,'' said Ms. Wardle.
 Mr. Cicileo, who owns the restaurant with his partner, Domenic Scarpulla, offers what he once sought as a weekend-home owner himself: social connection. He frequently introduces patrons to one another, and table-hopping is common on Friday and Saturday nights. 
 ''Living on a secluded weekend property, where neighbors are invisible, you can feel isolated,'' he said. ''Madalin's is conducive to friendly social contact.''
 Some restaurants have undergone complete transformations. Dan Glubizzi, an Upper East Side artist who owns a weekend home in Millbrook with his wife, Holly Burguieres, an interior designer and owner of a property management company, praises the Stissing House in Pine Plains for its muted lighting, architectural details, layout and what Ms. Burguieres described as ''beautifully presented food.'' It wasn't always this way.
 In 1989, when Patricia and Michel Jean, bought a weekend home in Pine Plains, the Stissing House, a tavern built in the late 1700s, had deteriorated into a rough biker hangout. Fifteen years ago, the building was restored, and in 2006, the Jeans sold their SoHo restaurant, Provence, and moved to the country full time to run Stissing House. 
 ''We wanted to create a cozy ambience because you really have to entice weekenders out of their houses,'' Mrs. Jean said. They stripped the pink-painted hardwood floors, brightened the walls in warm yellows and replaced contemporary art with Hudson River paintings. They also upgraded the basic macaroni-and-cheese and fried calamari offerings to a refined tavern menu featuring local foods, like Coach Farm goat cheese and a Herondale Farm pork chop. Mrs. Jean estimates that 75 percent of their customers own second homes nearby.
 THE influx of weekend-home owners has created more opportunities for chefs trained at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, itself a Hudson Valley institution. While many graduates still head for the bright lights of Manhattan, others, especially older career-changers, now inquire about openings nearby. Since 9/11, restaurants owned or run by the school's alumni in the mid-Hudson Valley have increased by 45 percent, estimated Steve Swofford, the C.I.A.'s executive director of alumni relations. 
 Chefs from elsewhere are also attracted to the Hudson Valley. In 2005, Daniel Nilsson was working at a Manhattan property management firm when his sister, a Dutchess County weekend-home owner, alerted him to a former restaurant for sale in Hudson, a bit north in Columbia County. Mr. Nilsson, 29, a former private chef, had dreamed of opening his own restaurant. 
 He bought the building and recruited Ola Svedman, a childhood friend from summers spent in Sweden, as executive chef. Together, they opened DA/BA, a 75-seat Scandinavian-influenced fine-dining restaurant, in June 2006.
 His customers, 80 percent of whom are second-home owners, have welcomed the sophisticated, creative fare, like foie gras brulee and scallops with white chocolate potato puree served with an orange-fennel sauce. Entree prices average $25, but, Mr. Nilsson said, many weekenders are willing to spend that and more for fine dining. He also offers a bar menu, featuring soup, sandwiches and fries, as a casual alternative, with items priced at $4 to $7. 
 Ten years ago, when people were leery of venturing into Hudson after dark, it would have been difficult to imagine a restaurant like DA/BA, packed with weekenders sipping $13 glasses of gewurztraminer and nibbling on $12 cheese plates. Mr. Nilsson sees the change as an encouraging sign of the times.
 ''Everything we do is quality-based,'' he said. ''Some second-home owners who come here have told me I don't charge enough for my beef burgers.''

HEADLINE: Irate Europeans Protest the Soaring Price of Gasoline

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD; Reporting was contributed by James Kanter from Brussels, Judy Dempsey from Berlin, Eamon Quinn from Dublin, Julia Werdigier from London, Michael Schwirtz from Moscow, Carter Dougherty from Warsaw, Eric Sylvers from Milan, Dan Bilefsky from Paris and Dale Fuchs from Madrid.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Marie Schneberger has always been thrifty about gasoline. The high price of filling up made it prohibitively expensive for Ms. Schneberger, a middle-income airline employee, to own anything bigger than a Fiat subcompact. 
 But with prices surging past 1.40 euro a liter in France (about $8.20 a gallon), Ms. Schneberger's old economies have proved insufficient. So, she recently started taking the Metro to work and splitting the use of her car with two other women, to share fuel costs. 
 Gas prices that make drivers queasy at the pump are a relatively new occurrence in the United States, but persistently high prices forced Europeans to curtail their fuel consumption long ago. (In many countries, government taxes account for more than half the price.)
 Highways are filled with fuel-efficient Smart cars and Minis, most cities have highly developed public transportation systems, and green-minded policies have spawned everything from special bicycle lanes to downtown congestion charges. Now the current surge in the price of oil has many Europeans asking how much leaner they can become. 
 ''This concerns everyone who drives,'' Ms. Schneberger said. ''And that makes a lot of angry people.'' Indeed, protests broke out across the Continent this week as irate port workers clashed with the riot police in Marseille and truckers stopped traffic in London to demand government fuel rebates. On Thursday, the protests spread to truckers in the Netherlands and French farmers blocked the entrance to oil depots. Italian and Spanish fishermen were planning strikes for Friday. 
 Less audible, but no less angry, are French nurses fretting about the cost of making home visits in their cars, Italian travel agents worried about fueling tour buses, and families from Madrid to Moscow who are leaving their cars at home or reducing spending in other areas. 
 European governments, already under pressure from slowing economic growth and falling tax revenue, are increasingly concerned the anger could grow. On Tuesday, faced with furious truckers, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for the European Union to cap fuel taxes -- a proposal immediately rejected by other countries that count on the income to bolster their budgets. 
 The problem in Europe is that the upsurge has come faster and harder than in previous cycles. For instance, the cost of a liter of unleaded gasoline surged 17 percent in the last 12 months in Britain, 15 percent in Austria and 8 percent in France.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, a major opponent of the Sarkozy proposal, warned that the world was facing an oil shock. His solution was to persuade governments around the world to take coordinated global action to mitigate price increases.
 Britain, which has Europe's highest fuel consumption taxes, granted licenses Wednesday for two new North Sea oil fields. 
 But as protesters and industry groups press for immediate tax breaks, analysts, European officials and consumer groups are concerned that artificially lowering prices would only engrain a consumption pattern that is not sustainable. 
 Instead, they say, politicians should provide long-term incentives to reduce fuel use and increase energy efficiency. The European Commission said Thursday that short-term relief should be narrowly focused on the poorest families, and warned European Union states not to provide tax relief to interest groups. 
 In Germany, Europe's largest economy, the Federation of German Consumer Organizations is lobbying the government to invest 5 billion euros in public transportation and to allocate 10 billion euros in subsidies to households that install energy saving devices. 
 ''Dealing with the issue through taxes is not the solution,'' Holger Krawinkel, director of the federation's energy department, said Thursday. ''We need a serious commitment to investing in energy saving schemes.'' 
 Such incentives to reduce consumption have worked in the past. Fuel taxes imposed after an oil shock in the 1980s are the main reason Europe has a vastly more fuel-efficient car fleet than the United States, said Lawrence Eagles, chief market analyst at the International Energy Agency. 
 But greater energy efficiency in Europe has also made it harder for Europeans to make further substantial improvements, analysts say. 
 Yet, the latest price shock has reignited the trend. Moshiur Rahman, a 28-year-old newspaper vendor in London, said higher fuel prices meant that he could no longer afford to drive to work. He now travels more than an hour by train every day. 
 ''I have been sharing a car with a friend but it has just become too much money,'' he said. 
 In Warsaw, where gas prices are nearing 5 zloty ($2.31), a liter, Leszek Tumkiewicz tries to leave his Polonez -- a fuel-intensive communist-era car -- at home. ''I drive a lot but I also try to be fond of the Warsaw Metro,'' said Mr. Tumkiewicz, 50, a business consultant who lives 12 miles from the city center. 
 Higher gas prices have prompted motorists to look for the best possible deal around. Drivers in Northern Ireland are making the trip south to fill their tanks in the Republic of Ireland, where fuel duties are considerably lower. 
 Not everyone is able to find cheaper fuel or reduce their driving. In Milan, Marco Germani, a self-employed salesman who is constantly on the road, said he had no choice but to pay up. ''Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it because I need to use the car for work,'' he said. 
 Particularly in rural areas, where public transport is more limited, high energy costs take their toll elsewhere. Analysts call it the ''Starbucks effect'' -- a decline in discretionary consumption in response to higher fuel bills. 
 The effect is hard to measure, especially because many products have increased in price as a result of rising transportation costs. In Spain, for example, where gasoline costs 1 to 1.25 euros a liter, many consumers are grumbling more about the accompanying rise in grocery bills than the price at the pump. 
 Even in Russia, one of the world's largest oil producers, consumers have cut back spending and demonstrations by disgruntled drivers have erupted after prices at the pump rose by more than 7 percent from a year ago. 
 ''The prices are nightmarish,'' said Arutsun Hachaturyan, the manager of a jewelry business, who said he pumps about $1,200 in gas a month into his black Range Rover. ''This is Russia,'' he said, while filling his tank at a Moscow gas station. ''We live on oil.'' 
 The only solution, said Ms. Schneberger, the airline worker in Paris, is to ''become less dependent on oil.'' 
 But as fears of high energy costs merge with broader concerns about slipping standards of living, the calls for tax cuts are growing louder, suggesting that farmers, truckers and fishermen may end up with broader support in the general public. 
 In London, for instance, expectations of government tax cuts are high. Julian Popa, the manager of a hauling company, said he had not yet raised the prices he charges customers because ''we're waiting for the government to do something like reducing the levy or subsidize'' oil.

HEADLINE: Charges of Insider Trading For a Wall Street Luminary

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
John F. Marshall spent decades teaching at business schools and watching his students parlay his lessons into fortunes on Wall Street. But when he and another professor reached for some of those riches themselves, events took a startling turn, the authorities say. 
 Dr. Marshall, a retired professor at St. John's University and a fixture on the Wall Street lecture circuit, was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission in March of passing inside information about a multibillion-dollar corporate takeover to a professor at Pace University. The Pace professor, Alan L. Tucker, made more than $1 million trading on the tips in 2007, according to the S.E.C. The Justice Department has filed criminal charges. 
 The developments have stunned Dr. Marshall's former colleagues and students, who describe him as a meticulous scholar and a generous, unassuming teacher. The accusations have also jolted Wall Street, where Dr. Marshall is considered one of the wise men of financial engineering. 
 ''I am just shocked beyond belief,'' said Jennifer Kim, a St. John's graduate who was taught by Dr. Marshall. ''If he wanted to, he could have made money -- lots of money -- years ago.''
 Suspicious trading has set off alarms at the S.E.C. during the record rush of corporate takeovers in recent years. Since 2006, the agency has filed more lawsuits related to insider trading than during the entire decade of the 1990s. 
 But the usual suspects are bankers, analysts and executives -- not academicians like Dr. Marshall, the author of books like ''Financial Engineering: A Complete Guide to Financial Innovation.'' 
 Yet, like many business school professors, Dr. Marshall, 56, and Dr. Tucker, 47, built twin careers by hopscotching from teaching to consulting. Dr. Marshall's stature in the field of finance eventually lead a board position at a fledgling electronic exchange for stock options -- a position the S.E.C. said he had used to pass illegal tips to Dr. Tucker, a friend and business associate. The men declined to comment for this article. 
 It's a remarkable turnabout for Dr. Marshall, who co-founded the leading professional society for practitioners of financial engineering, the International Association of Financial Engineering, the math-heavy discipline that revolutionized Wall Street in recent years. 
 Ms. Kim recalled how her former professor gave away complex computer software to his students. Dr. Marshall helped establish a graduate program in financial engineering at Polytechnic University in Manhattan and fostered the explosive growth of financial derivatives. He also became a popular lecturer at banks like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch. 
 Few people on or off Wall Street moved in such rarefied financial circles. During a long, distinguished career, Dr. Marshall mixed with Nobel laureates like Myron S. Scholes, Fischer Black and Franco Modigliani -- whose pioneering theories transformed the world of finance -- while he himself lived modestly on Long Island. 
 ''Everybody loves Jack Marshall'' said David F. DeRosa, president of DeRosa Research and Trading and a former Wall Street trader. ''He is like the uncle of derivatives.''
 In an essay published in the 2007 book, ''How I Became a Quant,'' Dr. Marshall wrote that his work on Wall Street had informed his academic research. 
 ''What I was seeing during the day in the Street was growing increasingly at odds with what I saw being taught in business schools,'' Dr. Marshall wrote. ''Most of academia was missing the great transformation that was taking place in finance.''
 He recruited Dr. Tucker to help edit the financial engineering society's journal, and together they proposed new types of options that companies might use to protect themselves from economic downturns. The pair also opened a small consulting firm in Port Jefferson, N.Y.
 Their work was notable for its real-world applications, professional colleagues said.
 ''A lot of academics publish papers that have very little to do with practical applications,'' said Anthony Herbst, a retired finance professor at the University of Texas in El Paso. ''Jack Marshall bridges the gap.''
 Dr. Marshall retired from St. John's in 2000 and went on to help form the International Securities Exchange, the electronic options exchange. He later became a member of its board and the chairman of its finance and audit committee. 
 The trouble began in late 2006, when Eurex, a German exchange, expressed interest in buying the I.S.E. According to the S.E.C., Dr. Marshall tipped off Dr. Tucker about the deal, sharing insider details of the proposed transaction through multiple phone calls. 
 Dr. Tucker later bought options giving him the right to buy I.S.E. stock, as well as shares in the American exchange, through an Ameritrade account, the S.E.C. said in its complaint. In e-mail exchanges, Dr. Tucker referred to the scheme as ''the program,'' according to the S.E.C. Dr. Marshall's brother-in-law, Mark R. Larson, 45, bought shares of I.S.E. stock based on the tips, S.E.C. says.
 When Eurex agreed to buy I.S.E. for $67.50 a share in 2007, the value of the I.S.E. stock and options soared, producing a profit of $1.1 million. It is unclear if Dr. Marshall profited personally. But the options trades set off alarms with market regulators because Dr. Tucker was the only person buying some of the instruments just before the takeover. 
 Since the S.E.C. filed its complaint in March, the men have fallen out of touch with friends and colleagues, longtime acquaintances said. Dr. Tucker finished out the spring term teaching at Pace but did not turn up at a recent finance conference he was scheduled to attend in China. Dr. Marshall has resigned from the I.S.E.'s board. Recent calls placed to his consulting firm on Long Island were unanswered. 
 At universities and on Wall Street, people who know Dr. Marshall are dumbfounded. 
 Manuchehr Shahrokhi, a finance professor at California State University at Fresno, said he was so surprised to hear about the allegations that he looked up the S.E.C. complaint to double-check. He could not reconcile the accusations with the man knew -- someone he once heard speak on ethics in the derivatives markets. 
 ''You know, sometimes greed takes over your knowledge and your skills and everything else. But he is not a greedy man,'' Dr. Shahrokhi said. ''Really, the only conclusion I can come up with is it must have been an accident. I do not believe that a person of his stature would do this.''

HEADLINE: Taking Questions About Fighting Poverty

 BODY:
Q Should the emphasis be on mitigating the high cost of living -- especially housing costs -- or on measures to increase wages, like living wage laws? -- Posted by JP 
 A In my opinion, there is very little that can be done to stem the high cost of living in New York; however, increased wages is one of the most significant ways to address this issue. 
 It is tough enough in periods of relative economic stability, but when there is a downturn, like we are presently experiencing, we begin to see the fallout. Clearly, more must be done to preserve affordable housing and create new, affordable rental units. More and more we are seeing the displacement of renters from units that are being converted to market rate units. The distance between job and home is important, so we should not be surprised when our local economy suffers as workers are pushed to the outer edges of the region in search of affordable housing.
 Improved wages and workplace benefits, like paid sick leave and health care, are also necessary if we are serious about creating more humane conditions for poor New Yorkers. A perfect example is the plight of private security guards, a group we studied at the behest of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. 
 We were shocked when we learned of the meager wages being paid to individuals who protect some of the most valuable real estate in the world and who, in this post-9/11 environment, are the first line of defense against possible terrorist attacks on commercial and residential buildings. Most of these individuals are without health care and cannot take a day off with pay, meaning they often work while sick, though they are expected to protect property and human life. Our efforts on behalf of private security guards have reinforced my belief that, for many occupations, unions are a conduit to a more equitable labor market.
 Q Do you think that the poor have a ''right'' to live in New York City? In other words, why does the government spend so much money trying to keep poor people in New York City, as opposed to letting market forces decide who lives here? 
 -- Posted by Camilo Ortiz
 A The city needs the entire range of residents, from wealthy to the working poor, to maintain its position as the leading world city. 
 The reason middle-class and upper-income people and businesses are attracted to New York City is its restaurants, services, hotels, health care -- the list goes on, all built on the hard labor of millions of the working poor, from dishwashers, child care workers, to those who act as nurses' aides in our hospitals, all are vital to making New York what it is for all of us.
 One of the main mistakes people make is assuming that the poor aren't working. Our statistics show that the overwhelming number of the poor are working, either full-time or part-time. Of the remainder, the largest cohort is the elderly poor or persons who are not working because of serious physical disability.

Some of the biggest losers in the real estate slump are not purchasers of mansions they could not afford. They are buyers of second homes -- or third ones, for that matter -- who are sitting on a tax time bomb.
 Many of these people will lose their properties in foreclosure and then stagger into bankruptcy under the weight of a sizable tax bill. While Congress has granted some tax relief to people who lose their primary homes, there is no such aid for those who fall behind on payments on a getaway condo in Las Vegas, a retirement home on the Florida coast or an old house that they are renting out for income. 
 Bankruptcy lawyers say they are seeing a wave of foreclosures among owners of second homes in such a position, owners who thought they had found sound advice for financial security.
 Two years ago, Lilia Garcia and her husband, Jesus, bought their dream house in Linden, Calif., for $535,000 and financed it in part by taking out a bigger loan backed by their previous house in nearby Stockton. They decided to hang onto the Stockton house and rent it out, believing that it would more than pay for itself and could be sold years in the future to help pay for college for their two children. 
 ''We wanted to make it an investment,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''I should've sold it.''
 But the Garcias, who earn about $65,000 a year, fell behind on their payments after their tenant moved out and the interest rate on their mortgage rose, bringing their monthly payments on the rental home to nearly $2,700 a month, from less than $1,000. They view foreclosure as inevitable; they have not paid the mortgages on either house for months and now rent a home in Linden. 
 Then they discovered that they could expect a painful tax on the rental house. 
 Like many others, the Garcias borrowed more than their homes are now worth. The difference between the amount they borrowed and the rental home's sale price in foreclosure will ultimately be considered taxable income as forgiven debt.
 If the rental house sells for $160,000, which is about what they paid for it in 2003, they may still owe tax on $120,000 -- the difference between the sale price and the $280,000 they borrowed against it over the years. That could mean a tax bill of more than $30,000.
 ''I just thought we would file for bankruptcy and everything would be clear. We'd start all over again,'' said Ms. Garcia, who is a medical assistant in a doctor's office in Stockton. Now she and her husband are waiting to see what price the house brings before seeking bankruptcy. ''It's bad.''
 J. Scott Bovitz, a bankruptcy lawyer in Los Angeles, says the problem is widespread. ''I've seen people not just buying properties to live in, they're buying properties to become mini-Donald Trumps.''
 Even if the condition of the economy generally improves, borrowers will face the double problem of foreclosure and then taxes, unless home prices begin to climb rapidly. And no one sees that as likely.
 ''My suspicion is most lawyers, even bankruptcy lawyers, aren't focused on this issue,'' said Charles Hastings, a bankruptcy lawyer in Stockton who is advising the Garcias on the tax ramifications. 
 Congress, deciding the tax impact was just too much for the nation's already distressed homeowners, passed limited relief at the end of last year. Under the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which is effective from Jan. 1, 2007, through Dec. 31, 2009, a homeowner does not have to pay tax on debt forgiven by a lender -- if the loan is backed by the property the homeowner lives in. 
 The boom in real estate in recent years prompted a great many people -- though no one seems to know exactly how many -- to jump into the market with additional real estate. Some did so a few times, buying multiple properties with the hope of selling them for a quick profit. Several bankruptcy lawyers, who say they are busier than ever, compare the real estate frenzy of recent years to the California gold rush of the 1850s.
 According to the National Association of Realtors, there are about 7.5 million vacation homes in the country, about 10 percent of the number of owner-occupied homes. According to the association, from 2002 to 2007, the number of vacation homes rose 18 percent, more than three times the growth in the number of owner-occupied homes and the growth in investor-owned units. 
 The financial distress wrought by ownership of second homes and investment properties is hard to quantify but significant, according to the association. It ripples through markets that have a lot of second homes as the full-time residents there find their home values falling in tandem. 
 While 60 percent of the foreclosures in Las Vegas last year involved properties held by nonresidents, in the first three months of this year the proportion has reversed: 60 percent involve owner-occupied houses, according to Applied Analysis, an economic and fiscal policy research firm in Nevada.
 ''Investors are easy in and easier out, and who's left holding the bag are the individual homeowners,'' said Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at the company. 
 Buyers of second homes seem to have thought that if they did not borrow against these homes, they were wasting equity, said Cathleen C. Moran, a bankruptcy lawyer in Mountain View, Calif. ''It comes from looking at your house as a piggy bank,'' Ms. Moran said. People borrowed against homes without realizing that the debts would become ''a bombshell that's going to go off under you at some point,'' she said.
 For owners with a potential tax bill, there is one way to minimize the damage. Alan J. Fisher, a bankruptcy lawyer in Boca Raton, Fla., said that negotiating with a lender could prove beneficial. In one of his cases, he said, a lender agreed that foreclosure ''fully satisfies all obligations under the loan.'' With that statement, he hoped, there would be no outstanding unpaid debt reported by the bank that the Internal Revenue Service could treat as income. 
 But Mr. Fisher said he was not sure how the tactic would hold up in court. ''I sure don't want to be the one litigating it.''

HEADLINE: NATO Chief in Afghanistan Says Pakistan's Tack on Militants Is Not as Expected

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL; Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The departing American commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Dan K. McNeill, raised concerns on Thursday that Pakistan had not followed through on promises to tackle militancy on its side of the border, and in recent months had even stopped its cooperation with NATO and Afghan counterparts on border issues. 
 General McNeill said Pakistan's failure to act against militants in its tribal areas and its decision to hold talks with the militants without putting pressure on them had led to an increase in insurgent attacks against United States and NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan. 
 ''We have not seen the actions that we had expected late last year; we have seen a different approach,'' he said before a news briefing in Kabul. ''That is different from what most of us thought last year we were going to get.'' 
 Militancy rose last year in Pakistan, where officials indicated that tougher measures against the militants were planned. Instead, the government has sued for peace, a policy tried in 2005 and 2006 that led directly to a rise in attacks across the border, as is happening now. 
 ''Over time, when there has been dialogue, or peace deals, the incidents have gone up,'' General McNeill told journalists in Kabul and others in Brussels listening via videoconferencing. ''What you see right now is the effects of no pressure on the extremists and insurgents on the other side of the border.''
 As if to underscore his point, a suicide car bomb exploded Thursday near a convoy of international forces on the eastern side of Kabul, killing four civilian bystanders and wounding 14 others, police officials said. 
 The attack was the first in the capital in weeks, but came amid a new rash of attacks around Afghanistan. On Tuesday, 24 people, including 13 policemen, were killed in suicide attacks and roadside bombings. Two suicide attacks on Wednesday in Khost and Kandahar killed one person and wounded several others. 
 General McNeill said that Pakistan had stopped the high-level meetings among Pakistani, Afghan and NATO counterparts that were the main conduit for resolving border issues and coordinating operations to combat cross-border infiltration. 
 The meetings are usually attended by the top generals on all sides, but Pakistan has postponed the last three, he said. 
 ''We have had some difficulty here,'' he said, adding that he did not expect to hold another meeting before handing over command in early June. But General McNeill expressed hope that his successor, Gen. David D. McKiernan of the United States, would be able to resume the meetings. 
 General McNeill called the problem a ''dysfunction'' that he attributed to political changes in Pakistan since the election of a new government in February. 
 General McNeill said last year was ''a very difficult year'' for Pakistan and cited episodes of militancy including ''a huge spike in suicide bombers, the Red Mosque events, some 250 Pakistani soldiers captured by about 20 militants, some forts laid siege to.'' His reference to the Red Mosque was to a raid last summer by Pakistani forces after militants holed up inside.
 ''My connection is military to military,'' the general said, ''and I think they know in the Pakistani military this is an issue they have to take on, and they have to do it in a way that is consistent with counterinsurgency doctrine. 
 ''But they have also just gone through some rather huge changes within their government and, I think, are still trying to find their way to get something coalesced, to get it congealed to where there is a forward movement in the business of governance,'' he said. 
 Pakistan's government has made clear it wants to break with the tactics Mr. Musharraf has used against militants and instead try dialogue, political engagement and economic development of the tribal regions. 
 Yet there has been increasingly urgent criticism from Afghan and NATO officials here since attacks rose 50 percent in April over last year in eastern Afghanistan, where American forces were claiming success against insurgents. 
 The Defense Ministry claimed that Afghan forces had killed dozens of insurgents in an operation in the southwestern province of Farah on Wednesday. The United States military, which was also involved in the fighting, confirmed only that several insurgents were killed after several hours of fighting and airstrikes.
 The suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday occurred on the main road leading east toward Jalalabad Province, where there are several military bases. The bomber targeted two sport utility vehicles carrying soldiers from the American-led coalition. None were seriously hurt, a United States military spokesman said. 
 Allah Mohammad, police chief of the district, said four civilians were killed and 14 others wounded. Most of the victims were schoolchildren, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Regulators Push to Strengthen Oversight of Energy Markets

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Faced with enormous political pressure to tighten the oversight of energy trading, federal regulators said Thursday that they have been investigating oil and derivative markets for six months to look into potential price manipulation. 
 The revelation came as the agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also announced a series of measures intended to heighten regulatory supervision of energy trading and bring ''greater sunshine'' into the commodities markets. 
 The commission, which does not typically disclose ongoing investigations, said that since December 2007 it had been conducting a nationwide inquiry of ''practices surrounding the purchase, transportation, storage and trading'' of oil contracts. It did not say whom it was investigating, nor did it say when it expected the investigation to be completed. 
 The commission seems keen to address concerns raised in Congress this year that oil prices have been somehow artificially lifted by investors' enthusiasm for energy commodities. 
 Oil futures have risen 32 percent this year and have more than quadrupled since 2003. On Thursday, oil futures fell $4.41 a barrel to $126.62 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gasoline prices touched a national average of $3.95 a gallon, up from about $3.20 a gallon a year ago.
 The commission said the new measures would ''improve oversight of the energy futures markets to ensure they reflect fundamental economic forces of supply and demand, free of manipulation and fraud.'' 
 But some analysts said the rules would do little to reduce volatility in the oil market, or lead to lower prices. The new measures include, for example, an extended agreement with the commission's British counterpart to expand the surveillance of energy futures contracts with delivery points in the United States. 
 The commission's second set of measures would require institutional investors who manage so-called commodity index funds, which are meant to mimic oil prices, to provide monthly reports on their activities, a rule that so far applied only to farm commodities. The measure should help the commission determine whether adjustments to trader reporting or classification are required, it said.
 The commission said it would also review trading practices for index traders to ensure they are not ''adversely impacting the price discovery process, and to determine whether different practices should be employed.'' 
 But John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House committee on energy and commerce, said the commission had failed to address specific mechanisms that allow commodity-linked funds to invest in energy markets with minimal amounts of money. Such practices have caused ''rampant speculation,'' he said. 
 ''For too long, C.F.T.C. has been operating in the dark,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''Unfortunately, the C.F.T.C. has not proposed how to close off the loopholes that allow commodity index funds and others to take such massive positions that they possibly distort oil futures markets.'' 
 In recent testimony to Congress, Jeffrey Harris, the commission's chief economist, said that a weak dollar, strong demand from the emerging world economies, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, supply disruptions, and unfavorable weather had contributed to the rise in the price of oil, not market manipulation.

HEADLINE: Notebook Sales Help Dell to Surpass Forecasts

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Dell delivered the goods on Thursday.
 Dell, the second-largest computer maker, beat analysts' forecast for its first quarter on strong notebook sales and lower costs, sending a strong signal that the company's year-old turnaround plan is working. 
 The company's first-quarter revenue was $16.08 billion, up 9 percent from $14.72 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Net income was $784 million, or 38 cents a share, up from $756 million, or 34 cents, in the period a year ago. 
 Analysts forecast an average profit of 34 cents a share on sales of $15.68 billion, according to Thomson Financial.
 ''We are executing on all points of our strategy to drive growth in every product category and in every part of the world,'' said Michael S. Dell, the company's founder, who returned as chief executive to lead its turnaround effort in January 2007. Since his return, Mr. Dell has instituted a broad plan aimed at cutting costs, improving customer relations and revamping the product line.
 At the same time, the company also warned that businesses appear cautious about technology spending, and that the caution is spreading to smaller companies from large ones. 
 ''We are seeing conservatism in I.T. spending in the U.S.,'' said Donald J. Carty Jr., Dell's chief financial officer. ''We expect that to continue in the summer.'' 
 Mr. Carty, who will be succeeded this quarter by Brian Gladden, said the company was seeing the caution mostly in the desktop market, while servers and storage products were strong. Sales in the United States commercial division, which accounts for 45 percent of Dell's business, remained roughly flat.
 Wall Street analysts have been concerned that an economic slowdown in the United States, along with lower average selling prices that have resulted from a price war with competitors, could further hurt the company. But Mr. Dell said companies appeared to see the value in updating their computer systems even in difficult times.
 ''Even companies in the most dire situations have to upgrade their productivity tools,'' Mr. Dell said.
 Dell shares rose 12 cents to close at $21.81 before the report, which was released after the end of regular trading. Shares rose as high as $23.97 in after-hours trading, or nearly 10 percent.
 Dell's unit sales were up sharply during the quarter, with most categories growing faster than the industry. Overall product shipments increased 22 percent during the quarter, the biggest increase in two years, with servers growing 21 percent. Notebook unit growth, a priority for the company, was 43 percent.
 ''It was pretty impressive. They were able to do better than expected,'' said Shaw Wu, an industry analyst at American Technology Research. ''They did a better job of translating strong unit growth into actual results.'' He noted, however, that Wall Street's expectations for the quarter were low. The company did not provide specific guidance for the second quarter.
 Dell, of Round Rock, Tex., has been struggling to stage a comeback after losing its lead in the personal computer market last year and has spent more than a year making fundamental changes to try to return to consistent profitability and profit margins. The company has been focusing on its notebook computer line, with its higher margins, and on increasing sales to emerging markets. 
 Dell's revenue from international sales grew more than revenue from United States sales for the first time. Brazil, Russia, India and China led the growth with a 58 percent revenue increase, accounting for 9 percent of Dell's sales during the quarter. 
 Mr. Carty said the company had cut 7,000 jobs during the last 12 months, while adding about 2,700 employees through acquisitions. Dell executives said they saw opportunities for further job reduction but did not elaborate.
 ''We are cutting costs every day for the life of this company,'' Mr. Carty said.

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Economic Growth Stronger Than Estimated

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The economy grew at a faster pace than originally estimated in the first quarter, the government said Thursday, but the nation remained mired in its most stagnant period of growth in five years. 
 Gross domestic product, a measure of overall economic growth, expanded at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the first three months, according to a Commerce Department report. That was higher than the initial estimate, released a month ago, which had put the growth rate at 0.6 percent.
 The government revised its figures because imports dipped more than expected in the first quarter, narrowing the trade deficit. Weaker demand for imports meant less money flowed out of American businesses into foreign countries, pushing up domestic bottom lines and, in turn, the overall growth rate.
 But demand for imports fell because Americans were buying less. The bleak economic outlook has made many Americans more hesitant to spend, especially on large-scale purchases like cars and kitchen appliances. Though this trend helped nudge the G.D.P. estimate up in the first quarter, it was likely to lead to a retrenchment in the business sector in the coming months. 
 Despite the nominal increase in the G.D.P. figure, the revised report still showed an economy struggling to tread water as the housing slump and a crisis of confidence in the credit markets weighed on investments and buying.
 Inventories slipped slightly, signaling that businesses were producing fewer goods in anticipation of slack consumer demand. Imports dipped 2.6 percent, revised down from an initial estimate of a 2.5 percent increase. A measure of consumer spending, known as real final sales growth, was revised up from last month's estimate of a decline of 0.2 percent, but only to the still-anemic pace of 0.7 percent.
 ''There is no end in sight to the economic slump,'' Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note to clients.
 The Commerce Department also provides data on inflation, almost all of which remained unchanged from last month's initial estimate. Prices rose at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, after a 2.4 percent increase in the final quarter of 2007.
 Over all, gross domestic product expanded 0.6 percent at the end of last year, and 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
 Data on the G.D.P. is regularly revised; the Commerce Department's final first-quarter estimates will be released June 26.
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number of new applications for unemployment insurance rose to 372,000 last week, seasonally adjusted. The increase, of 4,000 claims, was slightly more than economists had anticipated.

HEADLINE: Best Is the New Worst

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY. 
Susan Jacoby is the author of ''The Age of American Unreason.''

 BODY:
PITY the poor word ''elite,'' which simply means ''the best'' as an adjective and ''the best of a group'' as a noun. What was once an accolade has turned poisonous in American public life over the past 40 years, as both the left and the right have twisted it into a code word meaning ''not one of us.'' But the newest and most ominous wrinkle in the denigration of all things elite is that the slur is being applied to knowledge itself. 
 Senator Hillary Clinton's use of the phrase ''elite opinion'' to dismiss the near unanimous opposition of economists to her proposal for a gas tax holiday was a landmark in the use of elite to attack expertise supposedly beyond the comprehension of average Americans. One might as well say that there is no point in consulting musicians about music or ichthyologists about fish. 
 The assault on ''elite'' did not begin with politicians, although it does have political antecedents in sneers directed at ''eggheads'' during the anti-Communist crusades of the 1950s. The broader cultural perversion of its meaning dates from the late 1960s, when the academic left pinned the label on faculty members who resisted the establishment of separate departments for what were then called ''minority studies.'' In this case, two distinct faculty groups were tarred with elitism -- those who wanted to incorporate black and women's studies into the core curriculum, and those who thought that blacks and women had produced nothing worthy of study. Instead of elitist, the former group should have been described as ''inclusionary'' and the latter as ''bigoted.'' 
 The second stage of elite-bashing was conceived by the cultural and political right. Conservative intellectuals who rose to prominence during the Reagan administration managed the neat trick of reversing the '60s usage of ''elite'' by applying it as a slur to the left alone. ''Elite,'' often rendered in the plural, became synonymous with ''limousine liberals'' who opposed supposedly normative American values. That the right-wing intellectual establishment also constituted a powerful elite was somehow obscured. 
 ''Elite'' and ''elitist'' do not, in a dictionary sense, mean the same thing. An elitist is someone who does believe in government by an elite few -- an anti-democratic philosophy that has nothing to do with elite achievement. But the terms have become so conflated that Americans have come to consider both elite and elitist synonyms for snobbish. 
 All the older forms of elite-bashing have now devolved into a kind of aggressive denial of the threat to American democracy posed by public ignorance. 
 During the past few months, I have received hundreds of e-mail messages calling me an elitist for drawing attention to America's knowledge deficit. One of the most memorable came from a man who objected to my citation of a statistic, from a 2006 National Geographic-Roper survey, indicating that nearly two-thirds of Americans age 18 to 24 cannot find Iraq on a map. ''Why should I care whether my mechanic knows where Iraq is, as long as he knows how to fix my car?'' the man asked.
 But what could be more elitist than the idea that a mechanic cannot be expected to know the location of a country where thousands of Americans of his own generation are fighting and dying? 
 Another peculiar new use of ''elitist'' (often coupled with ''Luddite'') is its application to any caveats about the Internet as a source of knowledge. After listening to one of my lectures, a college student told me that it was elitist to express alarm that one in four Americans, according to the National Constitution Center, cannot name any First Amendment rights or that 62 percent cannot name the three branches of government. ''You don't need to have that in your head,'' the student said, ''because you can just look it up on the Web.'' 
 True, but how can an information-seeker know what to look for if he or she does not know that the Bill of Rights exists? There is no point-and-click formula for accumulating a body of knowledge needed to make sense of isolated facts. 
 It is past time to retire the sliming of elite knowledge and education from public discourse. Do we want mediocre schools or the best education for our children? If we need an operation, do we want an ordinary surgeon or the best, most elite surgeon available? 
 America was never imagined as a democracy of dumbness. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were written by an elite group of leaders, and although their dream was limited to white men, it held the seeds of a future in which anyone might aspire to the highest -- let us say it out loud, elite -- level of achievement.

 PRESSURE BUILDS FOR OLMERT 
 To Resign Pending Investigation
 The pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel to resign pending a corruption investigation is growing, and now coming from closer to home. Tzipi Livni, Israel's foreign minister and Mr. Olmert's top deputy, suggested that their ruling party hold primaries and prepare for all eventualities, including early elections. She is the first senior member of Mr. Olmert's party to do so. PAGE A8

 Raises Development Fears
 A planning commission's preliminary approval of a $250 million visitor center and conference facilities on privately owned land within Valley Forge National Historical Park has opponents worried about an increased risk of commercial development in other scenic and historic national parks. PAGE A17
 MIXING GUNS AND PARKS
 A proposal to allow visitors to carry loaded, concealed weapons in some national parks, wildlife refuges and monuments has brought a divided response. The National Rifle Association says it would help keep down crime and protect visitors from wildlife. Opponents say crime is already low and that safety -- and the family-friendly atmosphere -- would suffer. PAGE A12
 CLUES TO ANCIENT MIGRATION
 DNA from an ancient swatch of hair found in Greenland has provided clues indicating a previously unknown migration from Siberia to the New World. An expert on circumpolar populations at the University of Kansas said it was not yet known whether there was a single migration or many, but that ''this finding may turn things around.'' PAGE A16
 GLOBAL WARMING EFFECTS
 The Bush administration, bowing to a court order, released a fresh summary of federal and independent research pointing to large, and mainly harmful, effects in the United States from human-caused global warming. Not all of the information was new, or surprising: more illness and death from heat waves, especially among the young, elderly, frail and poor; fewer deaths from cold. PAGE A16
 DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR COMMITMENTS
 The two top Democrats in Congress said they were pressing superdelegates who had yet to declare a preference in the presidential race to make their choice public by the middle of next week, an effort to close out the nomination process. The push would appear to work to the benefit of Senator Barack Obama. PAGE A15
 JOURNALISTS AS WAR ENABLERS?
 In his new memoir, the former White House press secretary calls reporters for the national news media ''complicit enablers'' of the Bush administration's push for war in Iraq, saying they neglected the media's watchdog role. Some high-profile journalists, including Katie Couric, have agreed, saying that she had felt pressure from government officials and corporate executives to cast the war in a positive light. PAGE A17

 They are women living in the same metropolis portrayed in ''Sex and the City,'' though the resemblance between the two worlds may be minimal. Does that matter? Maybe not.

 HOW ABOUT $8 A GALLON?
 Europeans, who are long accustomed to paying higher prices for gasoline, drive fuel-efficient cars, support public transportation, ride bicycles and generally act green.

 BOOK SALES STAGNATING
 An annual report analyzing book sales in the United States found that publishers barely sold more books last year than they did in 2006 -- and projected sales would be down this year with growth out to 2012 flat or less than 1 percent each year. Publishers say consumers are cautious because of the economy -- unless, of course, Harry Potter is involved. PAGE C8

 EXPLORING A NATIONAL PARK
 And Its Hidden Attractions
 It's one of the older national parks, but not one of the more famous. Its 80 square miles in central Kentucky feature no old-growth forests or sprawling canyons. Facilities are spartan, and the main activities are hiking and biking. The main above-ground activities, that is. Below ground, Mammoth Cave National Park's 367 miles of tunnels and chambers serve up a spelunking feast. PAGE D4 
 GOING THE DISTANCE
 This time of year, Northern California offers bicyclists a century -- a 100-mile ride, usually with a shorter 100-kilometer option -- pretty much every weekend. There are even double-centuries, for those with higher athletic (or pain) thresholds. But be advised, not all of those miles are what you would call horizontal. PAGE D1 
 RAISING THE BAR
 The influx of second-home owners to the Hudson Valley has carried with it an appetite for dining that raised the bar for restaurants in the area. A $20 entree doesn't raise eyebrows, and a $38 red snapper from New Zealand will sell. But the food doesn't have to be fancy. A chef or owner who makes weekenders feel comfortable can earn their loyalty. PAGE D1

The trek, which includes 62 scheduled games in 23 states, is intended to lead to the team's fourth consecutive gold medal. And if so, quite probably the last: The International Olympic Committee decided that the 2008 Summer Games would be the last for softball, citing lack of interest worldwide. PAGE C11

HEADLINE: Food Report Criticizes Biofuel Policies

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Edward T. Schafer is preparing to walk into a buzzsaw of criticism over American biofuels policy when he meets with world leaders to discuss the global food crisis next week.
 Mr. Schafer took the offensive at a press conference on Thursday that discussed the food summit, planned for Rome. He said an analysis by the Agriculture Department had determined that biofuel production was responsible for only 2 to 3 percent of the increase in global food prices, while biofuels had reduced consumption of crude oil by a million barrels a day.
 ''We think that policy-wise in the United States of America -- and certainly in the rest of the world -- as we see the price of oil and petroleum escalate dramatically beyond anyone's imagination, that one of the ways to deal with that is to produce biofuels which are renewables, better for the environment and help lower that cost,'' he said. 
 Mr. Schafer's remarks came as ethanol and biofuels are coming under increasing criticism from foreign leaders and members of Congress, as grocery prices climb in the developed world and malnutrition and hunger threaten to spread in the poorest nations. 
 Just hours before his comments, a major report was released in Paris that urged countries to reconsider biofuels policies in the wake of soaring food prices.
 ''The energy security, environmental and economic benefits of biofuels production based on agricultural commodity feed stocks are at best modest, and sometimes even negative,'' says the report, prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ''Alternative approaches may be considered that offer potentially greater benefits with less of the unintended market impact.''
 The Agriculture Department's own longtime chief economist, Keith Collins, who retired in January, said that ethanol was the ''foot on the accelerator'' of corn demand -- an essential feed for animals, as well as a part of many diets -- and merited renewed debate. He said Congressional mandates for ethanol would require farmers to grow more corn for conversion to biofuel, at the expense of feed corn and other food crops.
 ''You're building in tremendous increase in demand,'' said Mr. Collins, who emphasized that he was not necessarily against ethanol. ''It's an increase that is going to feed into food prices.''
 The United Nations report, the global agriculture outlook through 2017, said prices for farm crops will remain substantially higher over the next decade because of fundamental changes in demand, though they will gradually decline from current highs.
 Because the recent spike in crop and food prices has been caused in part by temporary factors like drought, the report predicted that prices should decrease as weather conditions return to normal and crop yields improve.
 ''At least we hope they are temporary,'' said Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the O.E.C.D., alluding to the potential impact of lasting climate change on agricultural production. 
 In addition to reviewing ethanol policies, the report said governments should reconsider trade policies like export bans that do not allow farmers to take advantage of higher global prices for agriculture commodities.
 The report also encouraged countries that have balked at allowing genetically modified crops to reconsider their use as a way to improve yields.
 The expected causes of higher-than-average prices during the next decade include a doubling of biofuel production, higher fuel costs that increase the cost of producing crops and transporting food, and greater demand for food and animal feed in richer developing countries where incomes are rising, the report says.
 Prices for vegetable oils are expected to remain the highest, 80 percent above the average from 1998 to 2007; wheat, corn and skim milk powder are anticipated to be 40 to 60 percent higher; sugar, 30 percent; and beef and pork, about 20 percent. Biofuel production should account for about a third of the expected increases in prices for vegetable oils and grains.
 But the authors of the report cautioned that crop prices may be more volatile because of less predictable weather patterns, speculators in agricultural futures markets and low levels of stockpiles of grains.
 The projected increases in crop prices would have the most serious impact in poor countries.
 The authors of the report encouraged increased investment in agriculture research and outreach programs in the least developed countries after years of declining support.
 ''Agricultural development was not given sufficient priority over the last decades, and its importance was underestimated,'' said Jacques Diouf, secretary-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
 In a related matter, the World Bank on Thursday announced that it would increase spending on agriculture and food programs to $6 billion in the coming fiscal year, which begins on July 1, up from $4 billion.
 The funds include $800 million that has already been earmarked for Africa and an additional $1.2 billion that will be spent on such things as nutrition programs for schoolchildren and pregnant women, and seeds and fertilizer for small-scale farmers to improve harvests.
 ''These initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the 2 billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices,'' the president of the World Bank Group, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a statement.
 Mr. Zoellick said $200 million of the $1.2 billion would be used as grants for countries most vulnerable to the food crisis.

HEADLINE: Potter Was Still Magical, But Not All Books Rose

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
J. K. Rowling may have given a much needed jolt to the publishing industry last July when the final installment in her celebrated series about the boy wizard, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' sold 8.3 million copies in the United States in 24 hours, but publishers still struggled to sell more books overall than they did in 2006, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a publishing trade association.
 Publishers sold 3.13 billion books last year, compared with 3.1 billion in 2006, an increase of just 0.9 percent, according to Book Industry Trends 2008, an annual report that analyzes sales in the United States. Higher retail prices helped net revenue increase 4.4 percent, to $37.3 billion, from $35.7 billion. 
 The news is unlikely to surprise publishers as they gather in Los Angeles Friday for the second day of BookExpo America, the industry's yearly convention. Booksellers, librarians, authors, agents and reporters are bouncing through a whirl of parties, celebrity appearances (the artist now known again as Prince, Alec Baldwin and Ted Turner are among those showing up) and author book-signings while being bombarded with advance copies and marketing for books slated for the fall season.
 ''It's a time of uncertainty and of overall economic concern,'' said David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster, who nevertheless said he was, as ever, optimistic about the books he and others have planned for the coming months. 
 He cited ''Champlain's Dream,'' by David Hackett Fischer, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian, and ''Promise of the Wolves,'' by Dorothy Hearst, a debut novel in what Mr. Rosenthal hopes will be a long-running series. ''It's a Jean Auel type of thing,'' he said, referring to the popular ''The Clan of the Cave Bear'' series about a woman growing up in the time of cave dwellers. 
 In recent months, several large publishers have reported weak results. Random House, the book publishing unit of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, showed a 4.9 percent decline in operating profit last year. This month, Random House said that its chief executive, Peter W. Olson, would step down and be replaced by Markus Dohle, who had been the head of Bertelsmann's printing unit. 
 Simon & Schuster, part of CBS, reported a 32 percent decline in operating income in the first quarter, saying that despite bestsellers like ''Duma Key'' by Stephen King and ''Change of Heart'' by Jodi Picoult, it could not match the runaway success of Rhonda Byrne's ''The Secret'' in previous years. 
 The data from Book Industry Trends was as striking for its projections as for what it showed about sales last year. According to the report, the number of copies of books sold this year is likely to fall by 0.7 percent, and growth projected to 2012 will be flat or less than 1 percent each year.
 ''There is an economic malaise that's hitting this business,'' said Al Greco, a senior researcher at the nonprofit Institute for Publishing Research and a professor at Fordham's graduate school of business who analyzed the study. ''Basically what we're seeing when we look at the entire retail sector is that consumers are obviously very cautious.''
 Harry Potter, as expected, helped juvenile hardcovers post a 10.5 percent increase in sales, to 301.6 million copies last year.
 Juvenile books overall, including paperbacks, were up 3.1 percent, to 900.9 million copies. Net revenue in the juvenile segment, the largest of all categories in terms of copies sold, increased to $3.66 billion, from $3.4 billion.
 Perhaps surprisingly, sales of children's books, which includes the rapidly growing young adult segment, are not expected to rise strongly over the next few years. ''If it weren't for Y. A., this sector would be in worse shape than it is,'' Mr. Greco said.
 Religious books had another strong growth year, selling 274.5 million copies, up 4.2 percent from 263.4 million a year earlier. This niche of books, which last year included ''Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day,'' a new book from Joel Osteen, the TV evangelist based in Houston, increased net revenue by 6.3 percent, to $2.58 billion.
 Sales of adult trade books (fiction and nonfiction for the general market, in hardback and paperback), the second-largest segment in terms of copies sold, increased 1.8 percent, to 839 million copies. Net revenue increased 4.3 percent, to $9.58 billion from $9.18 billion. But going forward, the picture looked rather static: the report projects a slight dip in sales this year, down 0.4 percent, with growth of 0.5 percent or less out to 2012.
 Nevertheless, publishers continue to hope for hits, or even just to sell several books steadily. Stephen Rubin, publisher of Doubleday Publishing Group, a Random House division, was feeling good about several books his group will be pushing at BookExpo, including ''The Gargoyle,'' a debut novel by Andrew Davidson about a romance spanning the centuries, between a burn victim and a sculptress; ''The Road of Lost Innocence,'' a nonfiction book about child prostitution in Southeast Asia, by Somaly Mam; and ''A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity,'' a memoir by Bill O'Reilly, the host of a show on Fox News Channel.
 ''I think if you've got the goods you can still sell them,'' Mr. Rubin said. 
 Sales of mass market books, the smaller-size paperback format in which thrillers and romances are typically published, fell 5.8 percent, to 541.8 million copies, down from 575.1 million a year earlier. These once-popular books seem to have fallen out of favor, even in the romance segment, whose readers are typically very loyal.
 One segment where the numbers do not tell the complete story, Mr. Greco said, was the professional category, which includes books about business, law, medicine and technology. Although sales were up just 1.7 percent last year and projections are for essentially flat growth over the next few years, Mr. Greco said that publishers and consumers in this market were converting to digital editions much faster than in other books.

HEADLINE: Health's Gain May Be Army's Loss

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Call it the law of unintended consequences. When you fix one thing, it messes up other things.
 If the Democrats win the election this year, and are able to enact a health care plan that extends adequate coverage to all Americans, the loser could be the Army. Getting enough people to enlist could become a major problem for the next president.
 Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican candidate, has already pointed out that Senator Barack Obama, the likely Democratic candidate, never served in the military. It remains to be seen how potent that will be as an issue, given the fact that the last four presidential elections have been won by the candidate with the less impressive military resume. 
 But there is something else that distinguishes Mr. Obama from all recent candidates for the presidency. He would be the first presidential nominee to come of age after the draft was abolished in the administration of Richard M. Nixon. He never had to decide how to deal with the draft, and legally was under no more pressure to enlist than he was to go to medical school or become a bus driver. Joining the military was a career option like any other.
 And that has made it harder to put the Army together. Government polls show that the proportion of young people who think they might enlist is roughly half what it was in the late 1980s. The military has responded with more recruiters and higher cash enlistment bonuses, and has met its goals. A significant factor for many recruits, it turns out, is the military's generous health benefits for dependants.
 Michael Massing, writing in the April 3 issue of The New York Review of Books, tells the story of one part-time college student from Brooklyn, who was holding down two jobs but still going into debt. ''Meanwhile, he got married, his wife got pregnant, and he had no health care. From a brother in the military, he had learned of the Army's many benefits, and, visiting a recruiter, he heard about Tricare, the military's generous health plan.'' He enlisted.
 It seems a bit perverse that the incentives for a young person with children to join are greater than the incentives for his childless friend. But that is the way it is. All that could change if the push for some kind of national health insurance program were to be successful.
 It is true, of course, that Democrats have been talking about such things for generations. The failure of health care legislation during Bill Clinton's first two years in office left some viewing the issue as political dynamite -- good for a campaign but fatal to anyone who tries to pass a specific program. It is quite unclear how the government would pay for a comprehensive program, and no candidates seem eager to discuss ways to hold down health care spending.
 But if such a program were adopted, it seems likely that the military, and particularly the Army, would feel the immediate effect. To expand the Army, as all the candidates say they want to do, would require some other incentive for enlistment, particularly when the economy recovers.
 In the near term, it is possible that a recession will improve the military's recruiting success. The official unemployment rate is still low, but the proportion of Americans who expect the job picture to improve is at its lowest level in a quarter century, according to the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey. That survey shows that younger people are still more confident than older ones, but the confidence of both groups has fallen sharply this year.
 One partial solution to the negative effect on enlistment of a health care plan for all could be a new G.I. education benefit. Both the House and Senate have approved such a plan, but as part of the Iraq funding bill on which there are major differences. President Bush is opposed to the legislation, which its sponsors say would cost $50 billion over 10 years, and it is far from clear it will be enacted.
 The bill approved by the Congress would give enhanced education benefits to all veterans who spent three years in the military after Sept. 11, 2001. They would be eligible for full tuition at a public university, and about $1,000 a month for living expenses and more for books. 
 Senator Jim Webb, a freshman Democrat and Vietnam veteran, is the principal Senate sponsor of the legislation. He argued -- with something less than precise data -- that passage of the bill would increase enlistment by 16 percent, and bring in more high-quality recruits who valued the education benefit. Both Senator Obama and his Democratic rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, support that bill.
 Senator McCain has proposed a less costly alternative that would provide better benefits to those who stay in the military longer. He may have a point. Last year about three-quarters of Army volunteers who completed their first term of enlistment, and nearly as many marines, chose not to re-enlist. Offering better education benefits after three years could encourage enlistment and discourage re-enlistment.
 If we get a real health care plan for all Americans, it might require something like the Webb bill -- or a very unpopular revival of the draft -- just to keep fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The backers of health care legislation do not want to hurt the Army, but that is what could happen.

HEADLINE: The Reality Situation

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Dear Senators Obama and McCain,
 You are now engaged in a campaign debate over whether to talk with Iran. As I'm sure you both know, this is a political exercise that will have little relevance should you actually take office. 
 In the White House, you will find yourself spending more time on Iran than any other foreign policy issue. You'll be reminded that the 1979 Iranian revolution is one of the signature events of modern history, akin to the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the U.S. has never figured out how to deal with it. 
 You'll gather your intelligence experts to help you understand the Iranian threat. They will tell you what they have told the current administration: We don't know much about how the Iranian regime operates. There are at least four internal factions that seem to regulate each other, but we have little idea how.
 We don't understand the Iranians because the Iranians don't understand themselves. The regime isn't sure whether it is an ideological movement championing global jihad or whether it is merely regional power seeking Middle East hegemony. Until the Iranians resolve this internal ambiguity, you can talk to them all you want, but they won't be able to make a strategic shift or follow a more amenable path.
 As you sit in the Oval Office contemplating how to engage Iran, you won't be reliving the campaign debate about when to negotiate. You'll be thinking about how to exert pressure.
 You will develop newfound sympathy for your predecessors in the Bush administration. There are a hundred things they could have done differently, but the primary fault for the failure to contain Iran does not lie in Washington.
 It lies first with the feckless international community. The United Nations has passed resolutions demanding an end to Iranian nuclear enrichment. Iran ignores them. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 forbids the rearmament of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran rearmed them without consequence. Fault also lies with the terrified but nearly immobile Sunni world. It lies, too, with the axis of the avaricious.
 The U.S. and Europe try to organize economic sanctions against Iran, but the oil-rich Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was welcomed in Indonesia, and Iran signed a pipeline deal with India. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security group headed by Russia and China, granted Iran observer status, while denying the U.S. the same status in 2005.
 This is the problem with multipolarity. When everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible. A rich rogue nation can flaunt the will of a disparate majority.
 When you enter the Oval Office, Iran will still be on the march. Forget campaign declarations. You'll try anything. If the Saudis want to launch talks with Tehran as they did in secret 18 months ago, you'll quietly support them. If the Arab League wants to engage, you'll spend weeks in the middle of it. If the Israelis think they can flip Syria away from Iran with new peace talks, you'll accept their efforts. You won't believe that any of it can work. But nobody knows what will.
 You'll spend most of your time not challenging Iran but merely trying to contain its arc of influence. You'll spend hours, as the Bush administration has, wondering whether Syria's Bashar al-Assad can be turned in a more Western direction. Nobody can make an educated guess about that because no outsider understands Assad's mind.
 You'll enforce Executive Orders 13338 and 13441, which restrict the movement and financial transactions of top Syrian officials, but it's not clear you can squeeze the Syrians more than the Iranians, who play a more violent game.
 You'll work ceaselessly, as the Bush administration has, to make sure the Lebanese government doesn't dissolve. But Hezbollah's military power is so formidable you won't be able to negate its veto power over national policy.
 You'll find yourself consumed against your wishes by a multifront ideological war, with Iran pulling strings on one side and you scrambling to gather a moderate coalition on the other. You'll feel constrained in every theater, and you'll realize that you are not destined to play the victorious role.
 Your job is to restrain Iran's momentum until the fundamental correlation of forces can shift. For amid all the doleful news, there is a hopeful tide. Opinion is turning slowly against extremism. The uber-analyst Dennis Ross says that he has noted it among the Palestinians. Michael Young writes that opinion is shifting against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Peter Bergen, Paul Cruickshank and Lawrence Wright have in their different ways written about the intellectual crisis afflicting Al Qaeda. It may not happen over the next four years, but as Ross has noted, where Islamists rule, they wear out their welcome.
 Your job may be to wage rear-guard political battles until the ideological tide can turn. It's not glamorous work, but governing isn't campaigning. You volunteered for this.

HEADLINE: It's Easier to Be Green If It Also Saves Money

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
PRICE matters, and suddenly Americans are seeking to conserve energy in ways forgotten since the early 1980s.
 One quick way to save gasoline is to drive less. 
 In normal times, the number of miles driven in the United States rises each year, as more people drive more cars and as rising housing costs force some commuters to move farther and farther from their jobs. 
 But the Federal Highway Administration estimates that in March -- the most recent month for which data is available -- vehicles traveled 246 billion miles. That is a lot of driving, but the figure is down 4.3 percent from the previous March.
 Monthly comparisons can be volatile, since changing holidays and weather can have substantial impacts that have nothing to do with decisions to drive less or more. But the trend seems to have begun last winter. In the 12 months through March, the total miles driven -- 2.99 trillion -- were nearly 1 percent below the figure for the 12 months before.
 MasterCard SpendingPulse, which samples data from gas stations, reports that on the Friday before Memorial Day the amount of gasoline purchased was 7.6 percent lower than on the Friday before Memorial Day in 2007.
 The reasons for the decline seem clear. A slowing economy may be part of the story, but the larger part is that more Americans are staying home when gasoline is over $4 a gallon. 
 The Conference Board asked consumers in April about their vacation plans over the next six months, and found a record low percentage planned to take driving vacations. Gasoline prices were lower then, so it may be that the number will be even lower when the question is asked again in June.
 As the accompanying charts show, declines in driving tend to occur when oil prices are rising rapidly. Even adjusted for inflation, oil prices are now far higher than they ever were.
 Environmentalists, who have been urging conservation for years, are suddenly being heeded.
 ''Al Gore came out with a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth' in 2006, when Hummer sales were still good,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''The inconvenient truth, in fact, is that prices are what matter. With gas prices soaring, Gore is going to get his collapse in Hummer sales, not because people went green, but because they wouldn't spend the extra green to buy the gas.''
 There are other ways to save gasoline, like moving closer to work or buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle. Used-car prices for gas guzzlers are sagging, while small hybrid vehicles are in high demand. But it will be a while before the old guzzlers are retired, so the overall gas economy of cars on the road will rise only slowly.
 In the long run, higher prices are likely to lead to additional supplies, to alternative energy sources and to a lot of additional conservation, as happened a generation ago. But in the immediate future, soaring oil prices act as a tax on consumers -- with much of the money going to Middle Eastern nations that have little immediate use for it. That makes an American recession even more likely as demand for many products falls, while rising inflation limits the Federal Reserve's options.

HEADLINE: The Huge Hybrid: a New Twist On S.U.V.'s Finds Few Takers

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
They've been criticized as gas hogs, dinosaurs and land yachts.
 Now Detroit is hoping to cast its biggest sport utility vehicles in a new light: green.
 General Motors and Chrysler are betting that their 5,500-pound, eight-seat S.U.V.'s -- long the scourge of environmentalists -- can be reformed as hybrid models, albeit ones getting 20 miles to the gallon.
 Consumers have been slow to embrace the first two models from G.M., which are relatively new to the market. 
 G.M. has sold about 1,100 of its Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon hybrids since their introduction in January, according to company sales briefings. That pace is well behind its goal of 12,000 sales a year, and a fraction of the more than 100,000 hybrids sold so far in the United States this year.
 ''To this point, the G.M. hybrids aren't getting any traction at all,'' said Mike Omotoso, a senior manager with the research firm J. D. Power & Associates.
 Giving a four-wheel drive Tahoe a gas-electric hybrid engine raises fuel economy for city driving to 20 miles a gallon from 14.
 But to get the better mileage, consumers pay a high price: $53,000, at least $4,000 more than a conventional Tahoe.
 Environmentalists see the jumbo hybrids as a small step forward in the effort to reduce America's fuel consumption. 
 ''Is this a green vehicle? I think it could be a lot greener,'' said David Friedman, research director of the vehicles program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group in Washington that focuses on the environment. ''The question is whether the improvement in fuel economy is worth the cost.''
 Hybrid or not, large S.U.V.'s are fading fast in a market that is shifting quickly to smaller cars and crossovers, S.U.V.-like vehicles built on a car chassis.
 Last year, traditional, truck-based S.U.V.'s -- once the king of Detroit's fleets and a huge source of profits -- accounted for 8 percent of the nation's market. But recently sales have dropped to 4 percent, according to the research firm R. L. Polk.
 With gas prices surging to $4 a gallon, Americans are downsizing their cars drastically. One in five vehicles sold now is a compact car, and the move to smaller vehicles is accelerating.
 G.M. plans to follow the Tahoe and Yukon with hybrid versions of the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Chrysler is planning hybrids of its Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen sport utilities and the Dodge Ram pickup.
 But the behemoth hybrids seem out of step in a marketplace dominated by smaller hybrid models that can get more than 40 miles to the gallon.
 Toyota sold 64,000 Priuses through April, a 23 percent increase over 2007. It now ranks as the ninth-best-selling car in the United States.
 And while G.M. and Chrysler are converting their biggest vehicles into hybrids, other automakers are going in the other direction. Honda, for example, recently said it would build a hybrid version of its Fit subcompact.
 Hybrid technology pairs an electric motor with a gas engine, allowing the vehicle to run on electricity when idling and at slow speeds.
 The benefits in fuel economy are significant, particularly in city driving. The hybrid version of the Toyota Camry gets 33 miles a gallon in city traffic, compared with 21 for a conventional Camry.
 Despite the slow start for the Yukon and Tahoe hybrids, G.M. officials said they are pleased with the initial market reaction.
 At Chrysler, sales of big S.U.V.'s have plunged 22 percent this year. But a spokesman for the automaker, Nick Cappa, said adding hybrids, which will be available this fall, reflected the company's commitment to the full-size sport utility market.
 ''Why shouldn't people with large S.U.V.'s, who need that kind of utility, be able to get a hybrid?'' said Mr. Cappa.
 The third Detroit automaker, the Ford Motor Company, has no plans to convert its full-size S.U.V.'s to hybrids.
 A Ford spokesman, Jim Cain, said the company expected customers needing a fuel-efficient, larger vehicle to choose the new Flex crossover, a seven-passenger model with a V-6 engine that gets 24 miles to the gallon. 
 The advent of S.U.V.'s and pickup hybrids fills in two of the remaining gaps in the spectrum of hybrid models.
 With the exception of sports cars and minivans, hybrids are now represented in most of the major automotive segments in the United States. Toyota's Lexus luxury division sells hybrids at the upper end of the market with its LS 600h sedan and its RX 400h crossover, neither of which has sold in big numbers.
 G.M. is hedging its bet with the Tahoe and Yukon hybrids. Most of its dealers do not even carry the vehicles in stock. Instead, they order from a central pool.
 ''You have to wonder if G.M. is really committed to this, or just using them for public relations purposes,'' said Mr. Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
 The high cost of the hybrid S.U.V.'s could limit their sales more than any other factor.
 Glenn Galvan of Reno, Nev., was hoping to replace his Honda pickup with one of the G.M. hybrids until he saw the prices. ''I don't mind paying the extra cost for environmental reasons, but it doesn't have near enough fuel savings to justify it,'' he said.
 But a couple in Longview, Tex., Michael and Cindy Pittmon, have found that their Yukon hybrid was worth the investment. ''I'm getting 20.8 miles to the gallon compared to 13 on my old Yukon,'' Mrs. Pittmon said. ''It costs $75 to fill it up, and that's lasting me two weeks instead of one.''
 She said that the big hybrid generates quite a bit of attention at stoplights and in shopping malls, particularly because of multiple ''hybrid'' badges and decals that G.M. put on the exterior.
 ''People are always saying, oh, they didn't realize that hybrids came this big,'' she said. ''But I'm thinking about taking some of the badges off so it doesn't stand out as much.''

HEADLINE: A Slowdown in Both Spending and Personal Income

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Consumer spending barely budged in April and growth in personal income slowed sharply, even though the government started sending out billions of dollars in economic stimulus payments.
 The Commerce Department reported Friday that consumer spending rose 0.2 percent, and income growth was just as weak, also increasing 0.2 percent.
 The growth in incomes, held back by four straight months of jobs losses, would have been just 0.1 percent had it not been for the first wave of economic stimulus payments that the government started sending out April 28. 
 The impact on incomes should be even larger in the May and June reports, reflecting the bulk of the payments. The Treasury Department reported Friday that so far 57.4 million payments have been made totaling $50.04 billion, nearly half of the $106.7 billion that will be disbursed this year to 130 million households.
 The checks are the centerpiece of a $169 billion stimulus package that Congress passed at President Bush's urging in February to jump-start the stalled economy. Analysts say whether they keep the economy out of a recession will depend on how fast people spend the money.
 ''It will be impressive if consumers can manage to hold on given all the headwinds they are facing,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''Nothing is going right. Jobs are down, the stock market is wobbly, home prices are plunging and gasoline prices are at record highs.''
 All the problems have pushed consumer confidence to recessionary levels. The Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment dropped for a fourth straight month in May, hitting a 28-year low of 59.8, down from a reading of 62.6 in April. The May level was the lowest since June 1980, when Jimmy Carter was in the White House and consumers were being battered by a recession and soaring gasoline prices.
 Despite worries that consumers may end up using their stimulus checks to pay off credit card debt rather than spending the money to give the economy a boost, analysts said they believed that about two-thirds of the money will be spent this year, enough to keep the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, in positive territory.
 The government on Thursday revised its estimate of first quarter G.D.P. growth up to a rate of 0.9 percent, from its original forecast of 0.6 percent. While many economists believed that the economy would slip into negative territory during the April-June quarter, the modest growth in consumer spending in April and hopes of better figures going forward are causing analysts to revise their estimates upward.
 The 0.2 percent rise in personal incomes in April was the weakest gain since a 0.2 percent rise in January.
 Private wages and salaries fell at an annual rate of $18.2 billion in April, the biggest drop in a year. Businesses have cut jobs for four straight months, with analysts forecasting a fifth month of job declines when the government reports next Friday on labor market conditions in May.
 The 0.2 percent rise in consumer spending followed a 0.4 percent increase in March. Increases in recent months have largely reflected the big surge in energy costs and, to a lesser extent, higher food prices. Excluding inflation, consumer spending would have been flat in April.
 Consumer prices, measured by an inflation gauge tied to spending, rose by 0.2 percent, down from a 0.3 percent rise in March.
 The personal savings rate, the amount of spending compared with after-tax incomes, held steady at 0.7 percent in April, the same level as in February and March.

HEADLINE: Judge Tells Police Dept. to Release Stop-and-Frisk Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A state judge in Manhattan has ordered the Police Department to release its database on hundreds of thousands of civilians stopped by officers. 
 The decision, by Justice Marylin G. Diamond of State Supreme Court, was released on Friday in response to a lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union that asked the department to make public its electronic database on 756,514 stops from the beginning of 2006 through the first half of 2007.
 The suit was filed in November 2007 so the civil liberties group could determine whether racial profiling had played a role in the street stops and whether they were justified. The New York Times, the City Bar Association and a group of 21 academic figures filed papers in January in support of the suit. 
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has said that officers do not practice racial profiling in making the stops. Last year, the civil liberties group sought access to the database through the Freedom of Information Law, but the Police Department argued against it, saying that it included private information about officers and civilians.
 But Justice Diamond wrote that since the department had previously turned over the stop-and-frisk database to the RAND Corporation and to a University of Michigan research group, it could do so again, omitting the personal information.
 ''The N.Y.P.D. has not offered any reason why the petitioner should be denied access to the same database which it has already shared with other outside organizations,'' the order said. 
 The judge ordered the department to redact the names and addresses of the people who had been stopped, and the names, addresses and tax identification numbers of the officers, before turning over the database.
 The civil liberties union applauded the decision. ''With the release of this database and the public scrutiny that will follow, the police will finally be held accountable to New Yorkers who want to know if the N.Y.P.D. is targeting people because of the color of their skin,'' said the group's executive director, Donna Lieberman.
 The Police Department's chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said on Friday that the data ''parallels descriptions provided by crime victims, and it is consistent with the fact that the police respond frequently to calls for service from areas of higher crime.''
 ''Such stops have always been an important ingredient in crime-fighting,'' he said. ''They've just never been as thoroughly documented as they are today.'' He added that department lawyers were reviewing the decision to see exactly what material would be considered sensitive. 
 Jesse I. Levine, a senior counsel in the city's Law Department, said it, too, was reviewing the decision. ''We are disappointed in the judge's view of the law enforcement privileges asserted regarding this sensitive database,'' he said in a statement.
 Under police guidelines, officers stop people in the street when they have reasonable suspicion that the person has committed a crime or is about to. They then fill out what is known in police parlance as a ''stop question and frisk'' form, although not all of the street stops lead to an officer frisking or searching a suspect; some people are merely questioned.
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Levine said the city was concerned that access to the database could expose law enforcement techniques. ''It might give away information about specific policing methods, such as location, frequency of stops, and patterns,'' he said. 
 The civil liberties group said that the database included information about 850,000 police stops of civilians from Jan. 1, 2006, through September 2007, gleaned from reports that officers are required to file with details like the race and sex of the person and the reason for the stop. In the subsequent two quarters, through March of this year, there were 254,953 stops, the N.Y.C.L.U. said. 
 Blacks made up more than half of the 469,000 stops in 2007, even though they make up only one-quarter of the city's population, and Latinos, 30 percent, according to the civil liberties group. It said 88 percent of the people stopped that year did not get summonses or were not arrested. 
 In a report issued in November, the RAND Corporation, a private nonprofit organization, said that it had found ''small racial differences in the rates of frisk, search, use of force and arrest.'' 
 Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said it would look into whether there was legal justification for the stops. ''The single most common reason in a majority of the stops was that the person was in a high-crime area,'' he said. 
 ''We plan to make it publicly available to anyone who wants to have access to it,'' Mr. Dunn said of the study. ''And we are going to have an independent review of the stop-and-frisk practices.'' He said the group would now seek the release of the figures updated through March 2008 as well.
 A lawyer for The Times, David E. McCraw, said the information would help uncover any bias. ''Everybody should have a chance to decide for themselves,'' he said. 
 Andrew G. Celli Jr. a lawyer for the 21 scholars, said, ''This is the first time that data will be made available to scholars on an independent and autonomous basis to determine whether racial profiling is occurring.''

HEADLINE: British Banker Group to Strengthen Libor Oversight

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The British Bankers' Association said on Friday that it planned to strengthen the oversight of the London interbank offered rate after questions arose about the veracity of the 22-year-old benchmark used to set borrowing costs around the world. 
 The group rejected calls by some analysts and investors to change the way it calculates the rate, known as Libor, after accusations that it may be based on inaccurate information. But the group said it would give more details soon about how it planned to improve supervision of the process.
 ''The committee will be strengthening the oversight of B.B.A. Libor,'' it said in a statement on its Web site. ''The details will be published in due course.''
 Libor moved into the spotlight in August when the subprime mortgage crisis made banks more cautious about lending and many preferred to hold on to their money. As a result, Libor, or the cost of borrowing among banks, spiked and treasurers and central bankers have struggled to bring the rate back down.
 The credibility of the rate, used to price more than $360 trillion in financial products, came under threat in April when the dollar rate shot up after the bankers association said it would ban any bank from its panel that deliberately misstated rates.
 Every morning, the London-based association asks a panel of 16 banks to say at what rate each would be able to borrow a reasonable amount and then calculates a single rate for different currencies and borrowing periods. The British Bankers' Association brought forward its annual review of the Libor process by a month after claims that some banks had quoted lower rates to make it cheaper to borrow or dispel concerns that it was difficult for them to borrow.
 T. J. Marta, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said that the problem concerning Libor was not unusual in times of financial turmoil and that it was just one of many generated by ''huge dislocations in the financial markets as a result of the credit crisis.''
 ''I would have preferred that the issue had been handled more discreetly because it caused some disruption to an already dislocated market,'' Mr. Marta said. ''But now that we are having the discussion, the best thing they could have done is to make it anonymous for banks to quote a rate.''
 The association publishes each bank's quote on its Web site, meaning anyone can see which bank would have to pay most to borrow from rivals. Other analysts suggested adding more American banks to the panel that determines the dollar Libor rate, saying the group is skewed toward European banks. But the association said on Friday that there has been no change in the composition of the dollar panel.

HEADLINE: Politics and Judges: A Matter of Elections

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Rendering Justice, With One Eye on Re-election'' (''American Exception'' series, front page, May 25) provides an excellent summary of both the pros and cons of judicial elections. 
 Like many discussions about the merits of judicial elections, though, the article did not distinguish between partisan and nonpartisan elections. 
 Our recent research on judicial elections, published in The Cato Journal, suggests that most of the negative consequences of judicial elections are due to their partisan nature. 
 That is, the 8 states with partisan elections have legal system rankings significantly lower than the 13 states using nonpartisan elections to select their judges.
 Joshua Hall Russell Sobel Beloit, Wis., May 27, 2008
 The writers are, respectively, an assistant professor of economics at Beloit College and a professor of economics at West Virginia University.
 To the Editor:
 While it is indeed difficult to measure judicial quality, in New York the elected judiciary has the dubious distinction of far surpassing the appointed judiciary on the variable of reported findings of judicial misconduct. 
 In addition, judicial elections have resulted in a state judiciary that is overwhelmingly and disproportionately white and male. 
 While many espouse the value of citizen input and accountability, the truth is that virtually no one votes in judicial elections. Typically, only 15 to 20 percent of registered voters actually cast a vote for a judicial candidate.
 What system would we create if unencumbered by our history of elections and appointments? Perhaps we need look no further than the vigorous judicial training and certification programs we're exporting to Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries seeking to build their judiciary.

HEADLINE: The Old Family Tea Business Gets a New-Media Spin

BYLINE: By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

 BODY:
TEA is the second most popular beverage among consumers around the world after water, according to the Tea Association of the United States of America, and is found in almost 80 percent of American homes. Sales of tea have increased every year for more than 15 years and show no signs of slowing. R. C. Bigelow, a family-owned company in Fairfield, Conn., is one of the country's biggest tea producers. Cindi Bigelow is the third generation of the family to take the reins. 
 She recently talked about Bigelow's alliance with another big name in the industry, the company's foray into new media and its international thrust. 
 Q. How is Bigelow doing in this economy? If coffee drinkers cut back on Starbucks when money is tight, do tea drinkers cut back on specialty tea as well?
 A. The specialty tea category is only doing O.K., but we're doing extremely well. We're up at least 5 percent for the year ending June 30, and I don't take that lightly. We're not affected like Starbucks because people have to drive to Starbucks. You don't need to make a special trip to buy our product. Bigelow Tea is still a premium brand that you can buy in a grocery store for about $3 a box. That's about 13 cents for a luxury cup of tea. 
 We've always prided ourselves on the fact that we don't spend a lot of money on advertising. We put it all into the tea and the packaging so that we protect the tea. So we're still reasonably priced for a specialty tea.
 Q.Many companies are flocking to new media for advertising. Are you following their lead?
 A. We are. That's a fun thing about a company our size -- we had more than $110 million in revenue in 2007 -- and the fact that we're family-owned. We don't have a lot of red tape. We've been involved in blogging and social networking and online videos for a couple of years, and we're having a ball. I'm young, 47, and it's fun for me to do videos so that people can put a face and personality to Bigelow Tea. There are not a lot of family-owned companies that are national. It's great that we have this opportunity to let the consumer get to know us, and it's another way we can get to know them.
 I've always called consumers personally if they had a problem. So using the new media is an extension of a philosophy we already knew -- take care of your customers, talk to them. I create videos for YouTube and young people respond with their own. I watch a few every week and laugh. It's so great to see a 23-year-old from the middle of the country holding up her box of Bigelow Tea. How great is it to be able to see all kinds of people, with their own styles, wanting to talk about Bigelow Tea on the Internet? 
 Q.Two years ago you teamed up with Arizona Beverage Company. How is that working?
 A. We have a wonderful alliance. We make their tea bags and distribute and market them, and they make our ready-to-drink beverages. From October to the end of April, Bigelow sold over 10 million cups of Arizona tea. They make ready-to-drink vanilla chai and mocha chai for us and distribute them on the East Coast. They are working with us on some other projects as well that have not yet been announced. 
 They're also a family company and like to have fun like we do. They're quality-minded and have a great business model. There's never a time I meet with them that I don't walk out saying, ''Holy cow.'' Some people congratulated me on buying Arizona. Buy Arizona? Not so. It's a billion-dollar company. 
 Q.If you don't have to worry about shareholders, what are the pressures on a family-owned business?
 A. I can't even imagine the pressures on a publicly owned company. One of our competitors, with whom we have a good relationship, is the publicly owned Celestial Seasonings. Celestial has the pressure of financial reports, closing statements and the like. We don't have that. The pressure I feel is to be successful for the families of our 330 employees. And, of course, we have to take care of the consumer. You have to do due diligence on consumer safety day in and day out so you don't have any problems in that area. You don't worry about safety after you have a problem, you worry about it when you have none.
 Q.Researchers occasionally reverse themselves on the health benefits of certain foods. Do the health benefits of your product still hold true?
 A. I've been lecturing on the benefits of tea for 15 years, and the research has been consistent. It's not a new phenomenon. What you have to realize is that you're drinking the brew of a vegetable, and it's loaded with antioxidants. It doesn't matter if it's green or black. In March, a study reported that drinking tea while taking antibiotics boosted or enhanced the benefit of the antibiotic and is helpful in fighting bacteria that is not normally receptive to antibiotics.
 Q.Have you not directed your efforts toward the international market over the years because of the difficulty of competing with countries that produce tea, like China, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Turkey?
 A. Years ago we did not place much emphasis in this area, but we changed that about three years ago. Today it is a business that is bringing us much growth. In the last few years, that segment of our company has grown in triple digits.

HEADLINE: As Job Surplus Grows, Iowa Workers Are Calling the Shots

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
On a recent evening here, Greg Tew, 28, considered the question: What is it like to work in a state that is creating more jobs than workers? He was sitting in the lobby of a new hotel in downtown Des Moines, part of an extensive redevelopment investment to attract workers to Iowa. 
 ''It is noticeable,'' Mr. Tew, a computer programmer at EMC Insurance Companies, said of the jobs surplus. ''You're a hot commodity. Salaries go up just because companies are fighting to retain the talent they have.''
 His friend Stacy Berenguel, 28, a financial advisor at Citi Smith Barney, said that while she was very conscious of talk of a national recession, some of her friends in Iowa were switching jobs over company amenities, like fitness centers. ''Even when I've had friends laid off, they had no problem finding jobs,'' she said. ''So I'm willing to take financial risks, like splurging. Last weekend I went to Chicago and shopped for clothes and shoes. It was great. There were sales everywhere.'' 
 Are these the voices of a nation looking at recession?
 As rising unemployment and layoffs beset workers around the country, Iowa faces a different problem: a surplus of jobs. Or to put it another way: a shortage of workers. A survey of companies by Iowa Workforce Development, a state agency, found as many as 48,000 job vacancies, in industries including financial services -- Des Moines trails only Hartford as the nation's insurance capital -- health care and skilled manufacturing. One estimate projects the job surplus to reach 198,000 by 2014, with vacancies increasingly in professional positions. Greater Des Moines alone faces a shortfall of 60,000 workers in the next decade. 
 The state provides a small, advance view of what some economists predict will be a broader shortage of skilled workers in the next 20 or 30 years, as tens of millions of baby boomers retire from the workplace, and the economy produces more new jobs than workers. Potential consequences include slower economic growth and competitiveness, as well as higher wages for skilled workers and greater inequality. 
 Estimates of the national shortage run as high as 14 million skilled workers by 2020, according to widely cited projections by the labor economists Anthony P. Carnevale and Donna M. Desrochers. 
 But other economists believe the number will be lower, as the labor market adjusts to changes in the economy and advancements in technology. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics does not make projections about a labor shortage, but such estimates are often hotly contested because they are often used to support positions on immigration policy.
 Iowa's surplus arises from colliding trends: the exodus of young college graduates, a state economy that adds 2,000 jobs a month, low immigration and birth rates, and an image problem that makes it difficult to recruit workers from out of state. Iowans' median age is nearly two years above the national figure, and the state is near the top in the rates of women in the workforce and workers with multiple jobs -- further shrinking the pool of people who might be drawn into the market.
 ''It's really a perfect storm,'' said Elisabeth Buck, director of Iowa Workforce Development. Over the next decade, more than 70,000 workers a year will become eligible for retirement, with school enrollment -- potential replacement workers -- dropping by 20,000 since 1998, while the nationwide housing crisis makes it harder for companies to recruit from out of state, because potential employees cannot sell their homes. 
 Last year, the state added nearly 13,000 nonfarm jobs, in part because of growth in ethanol and wind energy, and lost 3,300 people from the workforce. With statewide unemployment at 3.5 percent, compared to a national rate of 5 percent, nearly everyone who wants to work and can work has a job. ''We're looking for ways to grow our population,'' Ms. Buck said.
 For workers like Brando Guerrero, 25, a sales analyst at Nationwide Insurance in Des Moines, the jobs shortage means companies ''have to sell themselves to potential employees, because there are so many opportunities here.''
 ''Do they have a free gym, dry cleaning, Starbucks on site?'' he said. ''What are they doing to make the community better? And once you're there, companies know they have to promote you to keep you. We're a little spoiled in our opportunities here.''
 But for the state economy, a worker shortage can slow growth, said Benjamin Allen, president of the University of Northern Iowa. ''It's a much better problem to have than high unemployment,'' he said. ''But if companies think they can't find a workforce here, it might deter them from coming out or expanding.''
 Remedies are not simple. Companies want to be in Iowa because wages are lower than elsewhere in the nation or region, except South Dakota. But low wages also drive young college graduates out of the state, especially as student debt loads have risen, and they discourage workers from other states from moving to Iowa. Some, like Mr. Tew, accept relatively low wages in exchange for Iowa's low cost of living. Companies compete on amenities and benefits more than salary, said Craig Jackman, president of Paragon IT Professionals, a recruiter and consultant firm. 
 Steven Smith, who runs a small technology company called GCommerce, was not deterred. After starting the company in the New York suburbs, he moved to downtown Des Moines in 2004, and expects to expand to 50 employees by the end of the year, from the mid-30s now. He said the costs of business were less than half what they were in New York, primarily because salaries and real estate prices are lower.
 But he said it was difficult to hire people for advanced technical positions. ''I plan a certain amount of my time during the week, 5 to 10 hours, recruiting. You've got to work at it. They're not just going to come to you.'' 
 Like many executives here, he has adopted programs to lure recent retirees back to work part time. 
 To retain staff, he provides stock options, flex time and short Fridays in the summer. And he has had to be flexible on salary. ''People who have a real marketable skill, they know they can call their shots,'' he said. 
 Several companies are starting to reach into the high schools, identifying students and promising to pay their community college costs, with the guarantee of a job after graduation. Others are looking to the prison system. Forty employers recently participated in a job fair for about 300 inmates in the downtown convention center.
 The community college system is at the center of many efforts to address the jobs surplus. The state and private employers like Wells Fargo and Principal Financial, which are both based in Des Moines, have made $23 million available for students to take courses to prepare them for specific jobs, with promises at the end of tuition reimbursement and positions starting at $30,000 to $40,000 for graduates with a two-year degree. 
 But programs for the jobs in highest demand, including nurses and welders, have long waiting lists. ''Employers come to us, asking, 'Do you have any graduates coming up in this field?' '' said Scott Ocken, dean of industry and technology. ''A lot of times we have to say, 'We do, but they're already hired.' '' 
 Robert Anderson, executive chef at the college's culinary institute, said he had two or three job offers for every student.
 For Michael LeVere, 38, a database administrator at Wells Fargo who recently accepted a newly created position at Federal Home Loan Bank, the jobs surplus has been both a balm and a chore. On a recent afternoon, he was struggling to find someone to replace him. The only applicant from Iowa was already working at Wells Fargo. 
 As for his new job, he said, ''If this doesn't work out, in a year there'll be opportunities.'' 
 To try to keep young professionals, the government and industries have poured nearly $2.8 billion into development projects in downtown Des Moines, including a new neighborhood of shops and lofts that wears its ambitions in its name: the East Village. On a recent weekend, a few restaurants had hour-plus waits for tables, and bar traffic was brisk. Mr. Tew, who lives and works downtown, said that until a few years ago, the neighborhood emptied after business hours. ''Now I'm out till 12:30 or 1 in the morning,'' he said. ''I don't leave the downtown area if I can help it.'' 
 China Wong, who runs Salon W in the East Village, said her business was expanding. She recently signed a lease on a bigger space and hired two new stylists. Being out of sync with the national economy has its advantages, she said. ''We have extra income for stocks that are undervalued right now,'' said Ms. Wong, who previously worked for an investment research firm. ''I've increased my stock purchases by 20 percent.'' 
 For Jessica Miller, 23, the changes in downtown Des Moines were enough to draw her back after college in Chicago. She found her job -- in marketing and advertising at a magazine group -- by the city's extensive networking channels. She said networking added to her sense of security, because she always hears of openings. ''We decided at work, we're not participating in this economic downturn,'' she said. 
 But the state remains a tough sell with young Iowans. For Jessamyn Thomas, 18, a high school senior who hopes to move to Chicago after she graduates from Iowa State University, life in an economic bubble is not enough. ''There's opportunities here,'' she said. ''But it's also the same place you've lived all your life, and it's Iowa, so it's not very exciting.''
 Her classmate Tucker Slauson, 17, agreed. ''There's jobs here,'' he said, ''because everybody leaves.''

HEADLINE: Gunman Kills 8 Worshipers At Mosque In Yemen

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Khaled al-Hammadi contributed reporting from Amran Province, Yemen.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
A gunman opened fire in a mosque in northern Yemen on Friday, killing at least eight people as they knelt for prayer and wounding dozens of others in the latest of a string of violent episodes across the country.
 The mosque attack took place in the town of Kohal, in Amran Province, 50 miles north of the Yemeni capital, Sana. 
 In recent weeks an escalating war between northern rebels and the Yemeni military has spread southward to the Amran area and even to the suburbs of the capital, where government bombing raids can be heard and armored vehicles now roam the streets. It was not clear whether the mosque attack on Friday was related to the rebellion. 
 Yemen, a desperately poor country of 22 million on the southern edge of the Arabian peninsula, faces security threats on several fronts. 
 Attacks on civilians have been rare in the war between the government and the Houthi rebels, which started in 2004 in the remote mountainous province of Sada, northwest of the capital near the border with Saudi Arabia.
 But on May 2, a bomb rigged to a motorcycle exploded outside another mosque in the north, killing at least 12 worshipers. The Houthi rebels denied government accusations that they planned that attack, but it seems to have spurred more fighting between the sides.
 After Friday's attack, Yemeni security officials said they had captured the killer and identified him as Abdullah Saleh al-Gahali, 55, a local man. A local tribal leader, Mujahid al-Kohali, said the attack appeared to be related to a personal dispute. 
 Yemen is awash in weapons, and violence is relatively common in tribal areas like Amran, where the central government has little control. 
 Also on Friday, two Katyusha rockets were fired at an oil installation in the southern port of Aden, officials said, though there was no word of casualties. 
 The rocket attack was the latest of a series, and the Yemeni wing of Al Qaeda claimed it was responsible for the previous ones. On Thursday, Yemeni officials said they had arrested 11 Qaeda members in the capital. 
 Foreign embassies and the United Nations have reduced their staffs in the capital after mortar attacks in March and April near a residential compound where Westerners lived, and the United States Embassy and the Italian Embassy. Al Qaeda in Yemen, a branch of Osama bin Laden's network, has claimed credit for the attacks in Internet postings.
 The recent Qaeda attacks appear to mark a resurgence of the group. Although Yemen has long been viewed as a haven for jihadists, the government began cooperating with the United States on terrorism issues after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and terrorist violence dropped off for several years. 
 There has also been unrest in the south, where a series of demonstrations fueled by unemployment have turned into riots, with some southerners flying the old flag of South Yemen for the first time since the unification of the north and south in 1990.
 But the most serious threat seems to be the Houthi rebellion in northern Yemen. The Houthis belong to the Zaydi sect of Shiite Islam, which makes up about 25 percent of Yemen's population but is a majority in the northwest. 
 The rebels and the Yemeni government signed a truce in February in Qatar, the latest of several in the intermittent war. But fighting resumed in April.
 In recent weeks the rebellion spread southward to Amran and the Bani Hushaish district, just outside the capital, where rebel fighters briefly gained control of Jamima Mountain, which overlooks Sana's international airport.
 On Wednesday Yemen's Defense Ministry announced that government forces had pushed the rebels off the mountain, but fighting continued in other suburbs of the capital and in areas farther north.

HEADLINE: Paying Off The Debts That Seem Unshakeable

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY. 
M. P. Dunleavey is the author of ''Money Can Buy Happiness'' (Broadway Books, 2007).

 BODY:
 TRYING to shed the last few thousand dollars in credit card debt can be as frustrating as losing those last five pounds.
 You have tried everything, or so it seems. You have cut back as far as you can. And while you're still making progress, the needle never seems to move on the amount you owe.
 So my husband and I have decided to attack these last few pounds of debt in a way that can best be described with a phrase from the movie ''Pulp Fiction'': We're going to get medieval on it. 
 Just so you know what we have been through: When my husband and I were married five years ago, we had a horrific amount of debt left over from various relationships, one divorce, two cross-country moves and a trip to Hawaii I never should have taken. About $24,000.
 The situation was daunting, but we threw ourselves into our antidebt crusade with grim determination. At one point we even took on a roommate in our two-bedroom apartment, a move that made some of our friends think we were crazy -- and maybe we were. But I'm convinced that a certain insanity is what gets you into debt; digging yourself out likewise requires going to extremes.
 Now here we are, finally down to about $4,800 in credit card debt. Unfortunately, in the last year we also accumulated about $1,200 in medical bills that were not covered by insurance. 
 Compared with what many people owe these days, this is Cracker Jack. But that's not the point. Most people have a threshold of debt tolerance, whether it's an amount they are willing to owe or the length of time they can stand to owe it. Mine just hit zero on both fronts.If we had stuck to schedule -- paying $300 to $400 a month toward the card balance, which is accruing about 6 percent interest, and $120 toward medical bills, which are interest-free -- we would have demolished our debt in about 17 months. But here is another theory of mine about being in the hole: the longer you're in it, the less chance there is of getting out. As time rolls on, the odds are greater that life will sneak up and thwonk you over the head with other unforeseen expenses.
 I was desperate enough to consider one road we had not yet taken. By slicing off a big chunk of what we were setting aside each month for retirement and personal savings, we could add $620 to our regular payments and use the combined force like a cudgel to smash our debt to bits in about six months.
 Maybe that doesn't sound terribly medieval, but surrendering so much of our monthly savings felt like torture to me. Developing savings know-how is one of the hardest financial tasks in life. It has taken me years to meet my goal of stashing away 20 percent of our gross income. 
 Moreover, I wasn't entirely sure that a saving hiatus, even for a few months, would be the smartest move financially. By not putting the money into our I.R.A.'s, for example, we would forfeit a tax break, and we'd give up the long-term, sheltered returns on that money. 
 OF course, by paying off the debt, we would save on interest payments, and resume our savings after we became debt-free. 
 There are a dozen ways to crunch the numbers, but the ultimate gain wasn't financial, it was peace of mind.
 Is peace of mind worth that much? At this point, for me, you bet it is. During these last five years we've let thousands of dollars come and go, spending it on things we deemed more important than debt. Were they? Opportunity costs are hard to calculate. 
 All I know is that my age, my time of life and the crummy economy have kicked getting out of debt to the top of my to-do list. 
 On the accelerated plan, we could be debt-free by Thanksgiving and putting more of our money toward living life, which is what money is for. 
 By then gas may be $16 a gallon, and we won't be able to leave the house. But at least I will be able to save for those big-picture goals, like going to the A.& P.

HEADLINE: Negotiating for a House? Start With 'Dear Seller'

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER; Send your versions of the letters to rlieber@nytimes.com.. 
Send your versions of the letters to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A few years ago, when multiple bidders would show up at a real estate open house, the truly desperate resorted to writing love letters to the sellers. 
 Their plaintive scribblings painted a picture of first-time buyers chasing the American dream or growing families hungry for more space. The letters dripped with compliments for the property and ended with a plea for mercy (and a signed contract). 
 Today's real estate market, however, calls for a different kind of letter, less a fuzzy valentine and more like a cold splash of water. It's what you write to accompany a bid that is so far below the listing price that it cries out for explanation. 
 Inspired by the success of a friend who used this tactic, I drafted a sample letter that buyers who fear overpaying might send to homeowners. Then, I crafted a reply that confident sellers could fire back. 
 No seller would be happy to get a letter like this. The most powerful missives stoke doubt and create fear. Sellers who get them may be tempted to write off the bidders as lowballers. But it makes little sense not to at least reply, given the number of competing properties in most places and the difficulty lately in getting mortgages. 
 The sample letters on Page B6, which I wrote after conversations with representatives of the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents, don't mention local economic conditions, comparable sales or other such data. You'll want to fill in those details yourself. But the templates below should work as a starting point. 
 One caveat is that you'll generally be relying on real estate agents to deliver your letter. Ask them point blank whether they intend to do so. 
 Dear Seller:
 I'm writing to let you know that I would like to make a bid on your property. I love the area and am committed to buying a house nearby. And your home fits my needs. 
 But given that my offer is well below your asking price, I also feel I owe you an explanation. 
 First, consider the big picture. Nationwide, home prices in the first quarter of 2008 fell 14.1 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. 
 That's the biggest decline in the 20-year history of the data. And just in case you're wondering, during the housing downturn of the early 1990s, the decline was never worse than 2.8 percent. 
 Not only that, earlier this month, the National Association of Realtors pointed to the huge number of existing homes on the market. As of the end of April, the total number was 4.55 million. At the rate people are buying right now, that represents an 11.2-month supply. 
 So buyers have options right now. A lot of them. I'm no different. Your home is great, but it isn't unique. Few homes are. I know this may be hard to hear, since you've spent years creating memories here. But you may be waiting a long time if you hope to find a buyer with the same emotional connection that you have. 
 My mindset is hardly unique. We've all been reading the headlines. The accompanying articles appear prominently in major newspapers and sit on the Web pages where people check their e-mail every day. Everyone sees them, and the psychological impact is real.
 Has your real estate agent laid any of this out for you? Maybe so, and you didn't want to believe it. But it's also possible that your agent, afraid of offending you and losing the listing, simply doesn't want to initiate that sort of discussion. It may be worth sitting down for a candid reassessment. 
 It will be tempting to view my low bid as an insult. Please don't make that mistake. Your home is genuinely appealing, and I wouldn't have written this note unless I was serious about buying it. Getting a firm offer in this market is an accomplishment. So congratulations!
 Oh, and one more thing. You presumably need someplace to move. My guess is that you'll find these same points compelling when it's your turn to buy. You just might succeed in buying for a better price, too.
 I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 Yours Truly, 
 The Realist
 Dear Bidder: 
 Thanks so much for your note. I'm truly glad that you like our home as much as we do. You're right that my family and I have many great memories of this place, and we hope someday you will, too.
 And I just want you to know that I'm not insulted in any way by your offer. The fact is, none of us are very good at buying and selling homes. We don't do it often, and as much as we know we're not supposed to let emotions get in the way, it's hard not to. After all, few people buy or sell anything else as expensive as a home in their lifetimes. 
 That said, your offer disappointed me. You seem to believe that I'm not aware of how bad things are out there or that I'm in denial. But I do read the headlines, and I priced the house accordingly. I knew I might have to wait awhile to sell it. 
 I should point out that your data draws on what has already happened in the housing market. Instead, I'd ask you to consider what's about to happen. 
 One big reason for the falling prices is that it's harder to get mortgages. Lenders went from giving money to anyone with a pulse to demanding higher credit scores and larger down payments. All sorts of buyers simply couldn't make the numbers work anymore. 
 That may now change. Starting June 1, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders and help make it possible for them to lend more money, are loosening restrictions on the sorts of loans they'll buy in many markets. That is supposed to make it easier for people to buy a home with a down payment of 5 percent, or even less. Many more qualified buyers should mean more bids, and I'm willing to wait to see if it turns out that way. 
 I know you talked about having choices, but presumably we wouldn't be engaging in this correspondence unless you liked my home best. Given that, I'd ask you to think about something: How often do you find a place that you can actually imagine living in? Sure, there are a lot of other properties out there. But an increasing number are in foreclosure and probably have problems lurking within the walls. So don't let fear of a falling market keep you out of a home that you truly want.
 It's probably obvious by now that I'm not going to counter with a particular number. This doesn't mean that I do not want to negotiate. I'd just like you to consider what I've said and see if you find it convincing. In the meantime, other shoppers who are interested in my home now have a price to beat. So thanks for helping me out with that. 
 Just one more thing. Please take another look at whatever mortgage calculator you're using and see how your monthly payment will change if you brought your price up a bit. It almost certainly is not going to be enough to break you. But it may be enough to get us to a deal.
 I look forward to your reply. 
 Yours, 
 The Undaunted

HEADLINE: Positive Week Ends With Mixed Session

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street closed out a winning week with a narrowly mixed performance Friday after the government reported that Americans' spending rose in April to keep pace with rising costs.
 Investors who sent stocks higher for three straight sessions turned cautious after the Commerce Department said personal spending rose 0.2 percent last month and personal income rose 0.2 percent. The department also said inflation at the personal spending level, after stripping out food and energy costs, ticked up in April by 0.1 percent.
 The readings were in line with the market's expectations and supported the notion that high commodities costs are not yet causing a sharp pullback in spending or lifting prices for other goods. Meanwhile, the technology sector got a lift after the computer maker Dell and the chip maker Marvell Technology Group posted stronger than expected quarterly results. 
 But Wall Street's concerns about the economy and inflation are far from erased, despite the stock market's gain this week. Although the government estimated Thursday that first-quarter gross domestic product grew by nearly 1 percent, Americans still face rising costs for necessities such as groceries and gasoline. And crude oil remains near record highs, weighing on consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economy.
 Investors will get a clearer picture with economic reports set to be released next week on job growth and manufacturing.
 ''It is now all about the economy, and I think we're going to get numbers that might be a requiem for the recession forecasters,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, a broker in New York. ''Not to say the numbers will be great, but not as bad as people might have anticipated. That will give the market a lift.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.90 points, or 0.06 percent, to 12,638.32. Broader stock indicators edged higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stocks index added 2.12 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,400.38, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 14.34 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,522.66.
 All three indexes finished higher for the week, recovering from the previous week's sharp losses. The dollar stabilized and oil prices pulled back from record highs during the last four sessions, giving investors some relief as they parsed data suggesting that the economy is weak but not technically in recession.
 The Dow rose 1.27 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.78 percent and the Nasdaq picked up 3.19 percent.
 Government bonds edged up Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 98 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.06 percent from 4.07 percent late Thursday.
 The energy markets continued to weigh on investors, however, with oil prices down from record levels but threatening to surge again. Crude oil futures settled up 73 cents at $127.35 a barrel in erratic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The dollar fell against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.
 Wall Street will look for signs of how rising inflation is affecting the economy in several reports due next week. The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to release an index of conditions in the manufacturing sector on Monday and its services sector report on Wednesday.
 The Labor Department's May employment report, one of the most closely watched indicators of economic health, is set for release on Friday.

HEADLINE: Farewell, Fair Weather

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
We are now firmly ensconced in the Age of Extreme Weather. 
 According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, there have been more than four times as many weather-related disasters in the last 30 years than in the previous 75 years. The United States has experienced more of those disasters than any other country. 
 Just this month, a swarm of tornadoes shredded the central states. California and Florida have been scorched by wildfires, and a crippling drought in the Southeast has forced Georgia to authorize plans for new reservoirs. 
 Who do we have to thank for all this? Probably ourselves.
 Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued reports concluding that ''human influences'' (read greenhouse-gas emissions) have ''more likely than not'' contributed to this increase. The United States is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse-gas emissions.
 Furthermore, a White House report about the effect of global climate change on the United States issued Thursday (years late and under court order) reaffirmed that the situation will probably get worse: In addition to temperature extremes, ''precipitation is likely to be less frequent but more intense. It is also likely that future hurricanes will become more intense, with higher peak speeds and more heavy precipitation ... .''
 This increase is deadly and disruptive -- and could become economically unbearable. 
 According to the National Hurricane Center, 10 of the 30 costliest American hurricanes have struck since 2000, even after adjusting the figures for inflation and the cost of construction. 
 In 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina, the estimated damage from storms in the United States was $121 billion. That is $39 billion more than the 2005 supplemental spending bill to fight the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 About $3 billion has been allocated to assist farmers who suffer losses because of droughts, floods and tornadoes among other things.
 And, a recent report in The Denver Post said the Forest Service plans to spend 45 percent, or $1.9 billion, of its budget this year fighting forest fires.
 This surge in disasters and attendant costs is yet another reason we need to declare a coordinated war on climate change akin to the wars on drugs and terror. It's a matter of national security.
 By the way, hurricane season begins Sunday.

HEADLINE: Loss of a Backer Grounds a Business-Class Airline

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Silverjet, the business-class-only airline, on Friday became the third such carrier to cease operations in the last six months, unable to cope with rising fuel costs or to attract new financing.
 The British airline, one of four independent carriers that focused on flying business travelers across the Atlantic, suspended its service after 18 months. Its last flight touched down in London on Friday afternoon. 
 Silverjet, which flew from London to New York and Dubai, failed to receive a $5 million payment from the investment fund Viceroy Holdings, based in the United Arab Emirates, as part of a loan agreement, forcing about 9,500 people to rebook flights with other airlines. 
 In a letter to Silverjet customers, chief executive Lawrence Hunt apologized and said he was ''working actively with new investors'' to restart the service.
 But Geoff Van Klaveren, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, said, ''It will be difficult to secure new funding before the oil price comes down.''
 He added: ''Even airlines with the strongest balance sheets find their cash flow under pressure these days.'' 
 But the appointed administrator for Silverjet, Begbies Traynor, said Friday that ''a number of interested parties have already been in contact,'' making the company confident that it can find a buyer.
 Small business-class-only airlines mushroomed over the last two years, pledging to change the face of air travel by catering to a growing market of business passengers. But competition from larger network carriers and a record oil price that increased more than 40 percent over the last six months meant that airlines without strong financing started to run out of cash. 
 One Silverjet rival, Maxjet Airways, stopped flying in December and another, Eos Airlines, grounded its planes last month. L'Avion, a French privately owned airline, still flies between Paris and New York. 
 Andrew Fitchie, an airline analyst at Collins Stewart in London, said it was just a matter of time for the smaller business-class-only carriers to close down because they lack the economy of scale. 
 ''It's very difficult for the stand-alone operator without a large portfolio of offerings and a strong franchise to pull it off,'' Mr. Fitchie said. ''The high oil price has just precipitated their problems.''
 That does not mean that the business-class-only concept is doomed, he said. Atlantic business class travel is the most lucrative for larger airlines, and as the likes of Silverjet dwindle, larger carriers started to adopt the all-business-class idea. British Airways, one of Europe's biggest airlines, announced plans in February to start its own business-class-only flight from London to New York next year. Singapore Airlines started a similar service on May 17, and Deutsche Lufthansa operates such flights through a subsidiary. 
 Larger airlines are not immune to the increase of fuel prices, and some analysts predicted more companies would go out of business. British Airways said this month that higher oil prices were expected to contribute to a ''particularly difficult'' first quarter, and several carriers announced plans to eliminate routes, retire aircraft and raise fares. American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, plans to cut thousands of jobs and added a $15 fee to check one bag.
 Rising fuel costs also squeezed independent low-cost airlines. Oasis Hong Kong Airlines left thousands of passengers stranded when it ran out of money last month, and American carriers ATA Airlines, Aloha and Skybus Airlines also stopped flying. 
 Silverjet, based in London's Luton airport, never made a profit and struggled to stay in business. The company had to suspend its shares from trading a week ago when the money did not arrive. 
 Mr. Hunt set up Silverjet with the help of his cousin Christopher Foyles of the British bookstore family empire after he had a string of disappointing experiences flying across the Atlantic. With money from an initial public offering, the airline started flying Boeing 767s with 100 flat-bed seats between Newark and London Luton airport in 2007 and added a route to Dubai in December.

HEADLINE: 2 Campaigns Flare Up Over Iraq Troop Levels

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and SARAH WHEATON; Michael Luo reported from Milwaukee, and Sarah Wheaton from New York.

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE 

 BODY:
A fierce debate erupted on Friday between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama over whether Mr. McCain misspoke at a town-hall-style meeting the previous day when he said that American troops in Iraq had been reduced to ''pre-surge levels.''
 Mr. McCain has been hammering Mr. Obama on his judgment on national security and his comprehension of the situation in Iraq, noting that the Democrat last visited Iraq two and a half years ago. 
 The Obama campaign pounced Friday on Mr. McCain's statement on troop levels, arguing that the Republican candidate was the one who was out of touch with the facts in Iraq. In a conference call, Obama aides reviewed a series of what they said were gaffes Mr. McCain had made talking about the war.
 At a news conference here on Friday, however, Mr. McCain asserted that he had not misspoken on Thursday.
 The Obama campaign focused on what Mr. McCain said that day in Greenville, Wis., in response to a woman in the audience who pressed him on whether the conflict in Iraq was damaging the American economy.
 Mr. McCain listened patiently to the woman and then pushed back vigorously, arguing that President Bush's troop escalation was yielding results.
 ''I can tell you it is succeeding,'' he said. ''I can look you in the eye and tell you it is succeeding. We have drawn down to pre-surge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr City are quiet.''
 Mr. McCain's remarks, however, differ from the numbers available. There were 132,000 troops in Iraq before Mr. Bush dispatched an additional 21,500 combat troops early last year, including five Army brigades, making up what is commonly referred to as the surge. In addition, some 8,000 support forces were sent to Iraq as part of the buildup.
 Three of the five Army brigades have left Iraq, along with some marines sent as part of the escalation, leaving about 155,000 troops. The remaining two brigades are scheduled to leave by the end of July, at which point Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American commander in Iraq, has recommended a pause in troop drawdowns to reassess the situation.
 Even then, the Pentagon has said that the troop level in Iraq is expected to be 140,000, about 8,000 more than before the surge, because some of the support troops sent to Iraq in the buildup are still needed.
 In a conference call, Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain's senior national security and foreign policy adviser, and Senator Jon Kyl, a fellow Arizona Republican and a McCain supporter, offered explanations defending the accuracy of Mr. McCain's statement, before essentially conceding that he had erred at least in part.
 They characterized the attacks by the Obama campaign as nitpicking over ''verb tenses,'' saying the examination distracted from the broader issue -- their contention that Mr. Obama was willfully ignoring evidence of progress in Iraq.
 ''Take the worst possibility here, which is Senator McCain misspoke,'' Mr. Kyl said. ''And that because of the specific words used, what he said was not entirely accurate. O.K., so what?''
 But in a news conference here, in response to separate questions, Mr. McCain twice denied that he had misspoken, even as he admitted that the drawdown from the troop escalation had not yet been completed.
 ''We have drawn down from the surge,'' he said, ''and we will complete that drawdown at the end of July. That's just a factual statement, and it's clear.''
 The Obama campaign later released remarks that Mr. Obama planned to deliver Friday night in Montana, in which he said that ''anyone running for commander in chief should know better'' what the troop levels were. 
 ''Just like George Bush, when he was presented with the truth, he just dug in and refused to admit his mistake,'' according to the prepared remarks. ''His campaign said it amounts to 'nitpicking.' Well, I don't think tens of thousands of American troops amounts to nitpicking.'' 
 Also on Friday, Mr. McCain admitted to making an error in using a photograph of General Petraeus for fund-raising.
 ''It won't happen again,'' he said at the news conference, after Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and an Obama supporter, criticized him for ''using a picture of General Petraeus in uniform to raise money and launch negative attacks.'' 
 Mr. Kerry pointed out that Mr. McCain's fund-raising appeal, which circulated as an e-mail message, came on the heels of an open letter by Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying, ''The U.S. military must remain apolitical at all times and in all ways.''
 A spokesman for General Petraeus, Lt. Col. Joseph M. Yoswa, said: ''The McCain campaign did not ask for permission to use the photo. General Petraeus is aware of the photo being used. By no means does the use of his photo mean he has endorsed anybody. He has not. He won't. He remains apolitical.''

 PACT FOR FUTURE OF U.S. IN IRAQ MEETS GROWING OPPOSITION
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq is facing growing opposition to a proposed security agreement that would set out how long American forces and military bases stayed in Iraq. Some leaders have concerns on central issues, like what sort of military operations American troops could carry out and what the Iraqi officials characterized as demands for a long-term American military presence. They also question the merit of negotiating with a lame-duck American administration. PAGE A5 
 MUSHARRAF DENIES HE WILL RESIGN
 President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan insisted that rumors circulating around the country suggesting that he was about to be ousted were untrue. The rumors were fueled, in part, by the chief of army staff's decision to remove a loyalist to Mr. Musharraf as the leader of the ''coup brigade,'' the brigade in charge of the president's security. PAGE A5 
 GUNMAN KILLS EIGHT IN YEMEN
 At least eight people were killed, and dozens more wounded, when a gunman opened fire in a mosque in northern Yemen. It was not clear whether the shooting was related to the escalating war between northern rebels and the Yemeni military. A local tribal leader said the attack appeared to be related to a personal dispute. PAGE A6

 TONY BLAIR'S FAITH INITIATIVE
 Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, announced plans for a new charity that he hopes will use religion as a force for economic development and conflict resolution. Mr. Blair said that one of his main goals was to support religious leaders who are working to counter extremism within their faiths. PAGE A11
 RESTRICTING LITTLE CIGARS
 Health officials in Baltimore are alarmed by the growing popularity, especially among black urban teenagers and young adults, of cigarillos, little cigars that are often sweetly flavored and filtered. So the city wants to bar shops from breaking open packs and selling them individually, a practice that makes them more accessible. PAGE A9
 SUPPORT FOR FORMER GOVERNOR
 Fifty-four former state attorneys general have filed a brief supporting the appeal of former Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama, convicted two years ago on bribery and corruption charges in a prosecution depicted by supporters as politically motivated. Robert Abrams, a former New York attorney general and one of the authors, said the brief reflected ''strong feelings'' that an injustice had been done to Mr. Siegelman. PAGE A11
 HUMOR AS CHANGE AGENT
 So, a Jewish guy, then a Muslim guy, then an evangelical Christian guy walk onto a college stage. Each one of them tells jokes for a half-hour, with a goal of -- making people laugh. But who knows whether that laughter just might begin to break down grievances and mistrust? ''There is a holiness to humor,'' the Jewish guy says. PAGE A17

 PROSPECTS FOR NEW GRADUATES
 Are Better Than Expected
 Job prospects are proving to be better than career counselors and recent graduates had expected. They are not as good as last year, and lower-achieving students may find themselves having a harder time finding work than the top graduates. Hiring by employers concerned by the impending exodus of baby boomers from the work force seems to be helping. PAGE B1
 PLACED IN THE SPOTLIGHT
 With the administration and Democrats in Congress counting on the Federal Housing Administration to lead efforts to rescue homeowners at risk of foreclosure, questions are being asked about the abilities of the agency -- and of the longtime Bush loyalist who came to the job of running it with little housing experience.

 FORD OFFER IS CALLED FIRM
 The investor Kirk Kerkorian said falling stock prices would not affect his offer to buy up to 20 million more shares of the Ford Motor Company at $8.50 each. It was good news for Ford, which started May on a high after a surprise first-quarter profit and Mr. Kerkorian announced that he had bought a 4.7 percent stake. Since then, rising gasoline prices have stoked worries. Shares closed at $6.75 on Friday. PAGE B3
 SILVERJET STOPS SERVICE
 Silverjet, the business-class-only airline, became the third such carrier to cease operations in the last six months, unable to cope with rising fuel costs or to attract new financing.

 Nowadays, most tales of longstanding and beloved family businesses in New York seem to end with a sniff and a final mop of the floor.

 BOOK REVIEW
 As anyone who's ever been stranded in an airport can attest, the interminable wait in the seating area becomes its own kind of drably carpeted existential purgatory. This is the predicament in which we find Benjamin R. Ford, the protagonist of Jonathan Miles's humorous ''Dear American Airlines,'' as a trip to his daughter's wedding comes to a halt en route. Which causes him to wonder: just what did I do to end up in this place? PAGE 1

 ARTS & LEISURE
 Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, would have turned 100 this month. In addition to the 12 Bond novels he actually wrote, there are almost twice as many that he didn't. Charles McGrath says the latest literary installment winks and nods at all the Bond lore before it. But the James Bond on the page -- melancholy, misogynistic, casually racist -- is a long cry from the suave Bond of the screen, even though the success and familiarity of the latter is what drives the continued publication of the former.

 Patricia Leigh Brown's neighbors in Oakland, Calif., have been celebrating a potluck dinner on the First Wednesday of every month for almost two decades. It's the kind of strange-people-in-one's-personal-space moment that makes New Yorkers like Ms. Brown squirm at first. She was eventually won over by the food and, improbably, the company of her neighbors. ''But soon, like the crescent shaped avenue we live on, the sheer predictability and endurance of First Wednesday began to feel like an embrace,'' she writes. PAGE 59

''When customers have a bad experience they blame both of us,'' the chief executive of Travelocity said. PAGE 6

HEADLINE: Blair Charity to Enlist Religion as a Positive Force

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, formally unveiled plans in New York City on Friday for an ambitious new charity that he hopes will enlist religion as a force for economic development and conflict resolution, rather than violence and strife.
 In a news conference kicked off by former President Bill Clinton and attended by religious leaders, donors and United Nations representatives, Mr. Blair said one of his main goals was to support religious leaders who were working to counter extremism within their faiths. 
 ''Though there is much focus, understandably, on extremism associated with the perversion of the proper faith of Islam,'' Mr. Blair said, ''there are elements of extremism in every major faith.''
 Mr. Blair recently converted to Catholicism, from Anglicanism, but dates his religious awakening to his student days at Oxford. While in office in secular England, he was quiet about his deep religiosity. Mr. Blair's charity, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, is the most high-profile effort in a recent proliferation of organizations dedicated to inter-religious understanding. 
 In part, the trend is a reaction to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Religious leaders began looking for ways to build interfaith ties and to elevate the voices of religious moderates at a time when extremists seemed to be monopolizing the microphones. 
 Now there are interfaith dinner parties, book clubs and university dorms. Among the latest initiatives, Karen Armstrong, a prominent British scholar of comparative religions, wants to convene a council of Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders to draft a ''Charter of Compassion'' of shared moral principles. 
 Ms. Armstrong's plan was recently awarded a $100,000 TED Prize, which is backed by an international conference of technology, entertainment and design leaders.
 Interfaith programs that predate the 9/11 attacks have grown sharply. The Right Rev. William E. Swing, the former Episcopal bishop of San Francisco, says his United Religions Initiative has spun off more than 400 interfaith ''cooperation circles'' around the world that work on local problems. 
 Mr. Blair's charity will help develop an interfaith dialogue and conference center in London, and create materials to educate people about world religions. Mr. Blair himself will teach a course on religion and globalization at Yale that can be reproduced elsewhere.
 The foundation will also encourage religious groups to collaborate on specific antipoverty projects. Its first focus is to join the growing campaign to eradicate malaria by distributing mosquito nets.
 In an interview after his news conference, he said, ''We don't want to replicate what other people are doing, and the purpose is not simply to have a dialogue.
 ''The purpose is action,'' he said. ''Action to do good, action to counter extremism, because that has an impact on our security, and action to educate, because if there's better understanding between the faiths there's less potential for religious difference to become a source of conflict.''
 While in office, Mr. Blair was reticent about religion. His spokesman once interrupted an interview with the words: ''We don't do God.'' 
 But his reticence was one way to avoid sensitive questions about his own affiliation. Mr. Blair was officially an Anglican, but attended Catholic Mass with his wife, Cherie, who is Catholic, and his children. British prime ministers have traditionally belonged to the Church of England (with the exception of Benjamin Disraeli, a Jew), and one of their responsibilities is to recommend nominees for archbishop of Canterbury to the queen. 
 In the interview on Friday, Mr. Blair said he waited to convert until last December, six months after he left office, because, ''You just would have got yourself into a whole series of issues that would have obscured what is, in the end, a rather personal decision.'' 
 He said he had told Pope Benedict XVI about his plans for the interfaith foundation, and that the pope and the Vatican were ''very supportive.''
 Mr. Blair's standing as prime minister dropped in England and abroad after he supported the war in Iraq. When he resigned, he was appointed special envoy from the Quartet on the Middle East (the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations), and has made several trips to the region.
 Sayyid M. Syeed, national director of the office for Interfaith and Community Alliances of the Islamic Society of North America, said in an interview that despite his record on Iraq, Mr. Blair retained enough credibility for his foundation to be taken seriously.
 ''You have to see the content of the message and the resources he's able to mobilize,'' Dr. Syeed said. ''It's a very powerful initiative.'' 
 Mr. Blair declined to say how much money his foundation had raised. An aide responded in an e-mail message that initial financing was in the ''tens of millions,'' raised from individuals, charitable foundations, companies and governments.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a plan by Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, to create a charity that would use religion as a force for economic development and conflict resolution described the religion of one of his predecessors, Benjamin Disraeli, incorrectly. Although Mr. Disraeli was of Italian-Jewish descent, he was baptized and practiced in the Church of England; he was not an exception to the tradition of prime ministers belonging to that church.

HEADLINE: Musharraf Denies He Is Stepping Down

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Pressed by a swirl of rumors that he was about to be ousted, President Pervez Musharraf insisted this week that he was staying, and President Bush on Friday confirmed his continued support with a reassuring phone call to Mr. Musharraf, the White House said. 
 Mr. Musharraf was forced at an official dinner Thursday night to deny rumors of his imminent departure, speaking after a Pakistani newspaper reported that the chief of army staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, met with him on Wednesday to persuade him to resign. 
 At the same time, the Pakistani military confirmed that General Kayani had removed a loyalist to Mr. Musharraf from one of the army's most significant posts. 
 The change involved the leader of the Triple-One Brigade, a unit based in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, which is responsible for the security of the president and of the capital, Islamabad. It is commonly regarded as the ''coup'' brigade because it has been used by the army chief to topple civilian opponents.
 The army described the appointment of Brig. Faheem Rao to the Triple-One Brigade as ''routine,'' but the removal of the brigade's commander, Brig. Aasim Salim Bajwa, was widely interpreted as a step by General Kayani to further weaken Mr. Musharraf. 
 In his telephone conversation with the Pakistani president, Mr. Bush ''reiterated the United States' strong support for Pakistan, and he indicated that he looked forward to President Musharraf's continuing role in further strengthening United States-Pakistani relations,'' said the White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino. 
 In remarks that were televised Friday, Mr. Musharraf denied there was a rift between him and General Kayani. He called the rumors about his departure a ''malicious campaign,'' saying he had given the newly elected prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, his ''full cooperation.'' 
 Mr. Musharraf, considered a vital ally by the Bush administration in the campaign against terrorism and a force for stability in Pakistan, has seen a steady erosion in his power in the last six months. He suffered a steep drop in popularity after he dismissed the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. 
 After intense pressure, he relinquished the leadership of the military to General Kayani last December, and in elections in February, the political party that had supported him for eight years went down in defeat. 
 Since then, the question of whether Mr. Musharraf should stay as president or be forced out has been one of the dominant themes of Pakistani politics, even as the economy reels under severe power shortages, a declining currency and escalating food prices. 
 Pressure mounted when in a surprising turnabout, the leader of the majority party in the civilian government, Asif Ali Zardari, said last week that Mr. Musharraf was a ''relic of the past.'' 
 Without being specific about how or when, Mr. Zardari, who had been relatively supportive of the president, suggested that he should go. 
 In the past several days, the news media have widely reported that Mr. Zardari believes Mr. Musharraf should be given ''safe passage'' to leave the country. 
 But a former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is the leader of the junior party in the coalition, said Wednesday that Mr. Musharraf should be impeached. 
 Mr. Sharif, who was removed as prime minister by Mr. Musharraf in a coup in October 1999, said he could forgive Mr. Musharraf for the personal indignities he suffered after the coup. But, he said, the nation could not forgive Mr. Musharraf for the damage he had done during his military rule. 
 Adding to the rising political uproar, Aitzaz Ahsan, the leader of a lawyers' movement to restore the chief justice, said a long march of disgruntled lawyers from around the country would converge on Parliament next week. 
 If the president did not quit, Mr. Ahsan warned, the lawyers' march would also besiege Army House in Rawalpindi, where Mr. Musharraf lives. 
 Those who said Mr. Musharraf was creating instability for the new civilian government said it was a matter of time, perhaps weeks, perhaps months, before he was forced out. 
 ''Things are very uncertain,'' said Athar Minallah, a leader of the lawyers' movement. ''But it is at least decided he has to go. When he would go is not clear.''

HEADLINE: Job Climate for the Class of 2008 Is a Bit Warmer Than Expected

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
Given that the economy is flagging, this would seem an inauspicious time to be graduating from college and looking for full-time employment.
 Job prospects this year, however, have been better than career counselors and recent graduates had expected. Employers are still extending offers, just not as many as last year.
 Economists said the class of 2008 has been helped by employers concerned by the impending exodus of baby boomers from the work force. But they warn that the job market is going to get tougher as the full extent of the nation's financial problems emerges, and they predict a growing inequality in access to employment between elite and lower-achieving students.
 As a result of the tighter job market, applications to graduate schools and service-oriented programs abroad are expected to increase in the fall. 
 ''Things are not good but they aren't really bad yet either,'' said James Tarbox, director of career services at San Diego State University. Of the 23 campuses in the California State University system, half have had a decline in campus recruiting last semester. 
 Indeed, MonsterTrak, a career development and job search Web site based in Los Angeles, reported that 59 percent of 1,200 employers surveyed nationwide in February expected to hire 2008 graduates in the spring or summer, a drop of 17 percentage points from last year. And 29 percent said they were unsure, nearly twice as many who were undecided in 2007.
 Companies in the troubled financial and housing sectors like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Home Depot and the home builder D. R. Horton have pulled back the most, according to college career counselors. And, of course, Bear Stearns, after its collapse, had to rescind its offers to new graduates. 
 Regardless, many in the class of 2008 have found employment. Preliminary surveys conducted by university and college career counselors indicate that the percentage of students who had found jobs by graduation was about the same as last year. The salaries were also comparable to last year, which, given inflation, could be interpreted as a decline. 
 But this year's graduates reported that they had fewer choices than the class of 2007. ''They might have received one or two job offers when last year they might have gotten four of five,'' said Al Cotrone, director of career services and student affairs at the University of Michigan School of Business in Ann Arbor. Undergraduates, as well as graduate students, are jumping at any opportunity. ''When the economy is like it is, they are accepting what they get as soon as they get it,'' he said.
 Thomas Holstien, a 22-year-old finance major at the University of Texas at Austin, said his job search over the last several months yielded two job offers from banks in Houston. But said he was leaning toward working in Washington as a senatorial staff assistant for three to five years partly because, he said, ''maybe by then the financial sector will be better off.''
 Experts said the aging of baby boomers was insulating recent graduates somewhat from the sluggish economy.
 ''Employers can't afford not to fill the pipeline,'' said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a recruiting and consulting firm in Chicago. In addition, some companies are laying off longtime employees and replacing them with new graduates at lower salaries. ''Employers only want the cream'' of the graduating class to fill these positions, he said. 
 Many companies, including the Walt Disney Company, McKinsey & Company and Pfizer, are offering paid and unpaid internships to new graduates rather than full-time positions. ''In uncertain times, employers are more cautious and want a known quantity before they decide to hire,'' said Michael Profita, director of career services at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
 Sarah Rossetto, a 22-year-old communications major from San Diego State University, started a paid internship in public relations at an agency in San Diego the day after her graduation this month. ''My hope is that it will lead to a permanent job,'' she said. ''It's good experience no matter what.''
 Career advisers and placement agencies said that entry level, career track or management training positions were going to only the most motivated and competitive candidates who graduated at the top of their class and have, through an internship or otherwise, demonstrated their ability. 
 ''It's not going to work to just post a resume on a Web site anymore,'' said Randy Miller, chief executive of ReadyMinds, a career counseling service based in Lyndhurst, N.J. His business, in fact, has had a 15 percent increase in clients, 2008 seniors and other job seekers, since March, when the economy ''really started to sink.''
 The graduates who are struggling to find work now typically earned degrees from less prestigious institutions and were not the top students. 
 ''A poor economy magnifies the differences between student groups,'' said Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''Those graduating from spectacular schools with spectacular grades will continue to do well, while those in the middle and lower end will have a much harder time finding jobs and will be offered much lower salaries.'' 
 Moreover, entry-level hiring lags behind economic conditions. ''If you look at the last recession in 2001, the job market didn't fully reflect economic reality until 2002,'' Mr. Katz said. Indeed, career services directors at universities predicted that the class of 2009 might suffer. ''We're braced for even more declines in recruiting and hiring next year,'' said Mr. Tarbox at San Diego State.
 Some recent graduates are choosing to end their job search and further their education instead. Graduate school preparation programs like Kaplan and Princeton Review report double-digit increases in enrollment in the last few months, far outpacing the same period last year.
 Other recent graduates are choosing to wait out the economic downturn by engaging in more adventurous or service-oriented pursuits. ''This generation perhaps because of 9/11 wants meaningful work and experiences,'' said Mr. Challenger, of the outplacement consulting firm. ''They aren't just in it for the money.''
 Travis Roe-Raymond, a 22-year-old religious studies major at Skidmore College, said he initially looked for community development jobs on the East and West Coasts but is now planning to lead bicycle tours in France for the summer before leaving for China to teach English for a year. 
 After that, he is unsure what he will do. ''I guess the idea is to leave now and come back when the economy is better,'' he said. ''But I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.''

HEADLINE: Job Climate for the Class of 2008 Is a Bit Warmer Than Expected

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
Given that the economy is flagging, this would seem an inauspicious time to be graduating from college and looking for full-time employment.
Job prospects this year, however, have been better than career counselors and recent graduates had expected. Employers are still extending offers, just not as many as last year.
Economists said the class of 2008 has been helped by employers concerned by the impending exodus of baby boomers from the work force. But they warn that the job market is going to get tougher as the full extent of the nation's financial problems emerges, and they predict a growing inequality in access to employment between elite and lower-achieving students.
As a result of the tighter job market, applications to graduate schools and service-oriented programs abroad are expected to increase in the fall. 
''Things are not good but they aren't really bad yet either,'' said James Tarbox, director of career services at San Diego State University. Of the 23 campuses in the California State University system, half have had a decline in campus recruiting last semester.

And 29 percent said they were unsure, nearly twice as many who were undecided in 2007.
