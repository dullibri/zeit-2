HEADLINE: The Loopholes in I.R.S. Reform

 BODY:
No one ever lost an election by abusing the tax collector. So it is probably inevitable that a bill overhauling the Internal Revenue Service will become law before November. It has already been passed by the House and Senate in different forms. The Clinton Administration has also clambered on board. The Treasury Department says that Congressional plans to reorganize the I.R.S. bureaucracy and make the agency more user-friendly are almost precisely what it intended to do anyway.
Congress still has some issues to resolve, however. The Senate version of the bill costs three times as much as the House's, and pretends to pay the difference with a ridiculous tax break for rich senior citizens that would bring a short-term windfall into the Treasury, while sucking out far more revenue over the long run. The conference committee should ditch that idea immediately, and also pare back some of the expensive new taxpayer protections, to make sure they are as narrowly targeted as possible. 
 These new taxpayer rights are bound to appeal to the public, even though they will actually only affect the minuscule number of taxpayers who wind up fighting the I.R.S. in tax court. They include the "innocent spouse" protection, which is supposed to keep low-salaried women from being dunned for taxes owed by their former husbands. The bills also shift the burden of proof in court cases from the taxpayer to the I.R.S.
Like most changes in tax law, the taxpayer protections are going to be a big help mainly to the very wealthy. Only about 30,000 of the 118 million individual returns filed wind up in tax court, and few of the taxpayers who fight that long are impoverished widows. Ordinary taxpayers whose skirmishes with the I.R.S. take place on a lower level will have to continue documenting their expenses and responding to auditors' demands just as they did in the past.
Critics are right when they complain that the tax-collecting bureaucracy is inefficient, particularly in regard to its outdated computers, which are the cause of many of the horror stories that have been given wide publicity. But the main cause of the nation's tax phobia is the complicated system of tax exemptions that was created by Congress and that the overhaul bills do little to address.
The danger is that the publicity over the proposed changes will encourage the public to believe the I.R.S. is toothless. The American system of tax collection, much as all red-blooded citizens may hate it, is one of the bulwarks of the economy. Compliance is far higher than in many other Western countries, creating a system that is fairer and collects more money. If Congressional hype over the I.R.S. bill encourages people to underreport their incomes in hopes of dodging penalties later, it will do far more harm than good.

HEADLINE: Roslyn Bancorp Is Expected To Acquire T.R. Financial

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Roslyn Bancorp is expected to acquire the T. R. Financial Corporation in a stock swap valued at about $1.1 billion, according to people close to the merger talks.
The boards of both of the Long Island companies were meeting late last evening and had not approved the transaction, although people close to the boards said they were confident that they would do so by tomorrow. 
 It could not be determined if a merger would result in layoffs.
The deal continues a recent wave of mergers by savings and loan institutions in the metropolitan area as they struggle to compete with more aggressive retail banks like the Chase Manhattan and Citibank.
Mortgage lending has traditionally been the bread and butter of the savings and loan industry. Even though industrywide profits have been rising and the economic landscape is more favorable nationally than it was earlier in the decade, savings and loan associations have had difficulty in the increasingly competitive mortgage business.
Though some giant savings and loans, like the West Coast behemoth being created by the pending merger of Washington Mutual Inc. and H. F. Ahmanson & Company, may be survivors, many of these companies will not be able to compete. And so, many have given up the battle and are merging with an eye to making themselves more attractive takeover targets, analysts and bank advisers say. That is particularly true in the Northeast and in the area around New York.
In April, the Astoria Financial Corporation agreed to buy Long Island Bancorp in a $1.8 billion stock swap. That transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter, would create the second-largest savings institution in New York State, with $16.6 billion in assets. It would rank behind Dime Bancorp, which has about $21.8 billion in assets, and ahead of the Greenpoint Financial Corporation, which has about $13 billion in assets.
A combination of Roslyn and T. R. Financial would create the fourth-largest savings and loan in New York State, with about $7.7 billion in assets.
The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, pending regulatory approval.
Roslyn, which is based in Roslyn, went public only a year ago, and analysts say it has been planning to beef up its banking presence through acquisitions. It has 8 full-service branches in Nassau and Suffolk counties and 12 mortgage units in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. It has about $3.7 billion in assets and $2 billion in deposits.
T. R. Financial, the parent company of Roosevelt Savings Bank, is based in Garden City and has 15 branches in Nassau and Suffolk counties, Queens and Brooklyn. It has about $4 billion in assets and $2.1 billion in deposits.
The new company would retain the Roslyn Bancorp name and be based in Roslyn.
Ten of the new company's 14 board members would come from Roslyn Bancorp, and Joseph L. Mancino, Roslyn's chairman and chief executive, would be president and chief executive of the new company. John M. Tsimbinos, T. R. Financial's chairman and chief executive, would be chairman of the new company.
T. R. Financial shareholders will receive 2.05 shares of Roslyn stock for each share of T. R. Financial that they own.
Based on Roslyn's closing share price of $27.625 on Friday, that values T. R. Financial shares at about $56.63, a 46.6 percent premium to T. R. Financial's closing price of $38.625 on Friday.

HEADLINE: A Pot of Gold For Publishers Of Textbooks

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
If public passion for the printed word has died, as some say, then a textbook case of resurrection is taking place.
Last weekend the British media conglomerate Pearson P.L.C. agreed to buy Simon & Schuster's education division of publishing imprints, boasting about the future of textbooks and education as the "great growth industry of our time" and instantly becoming the industry behemoth. 
 But its sizable $3.6 billion purchase is dwarfed by an even broader public investment in textbooks for new generations of readers -- a trend that does not attract the publicity of a multibillion-dollar corporate deal, but belies longstanding fears in the publishing industry that the printed page is steadily losing favor to the electronic monitor.
Buoyed by increased spending and growing student enrollment, publishers of textbooks and instructional materials registered the strongest gains in sales last year in any category of the $21 billion United States book market, with purchases of elementary school books increasing by 13 percent, to $3 billion, and college texts rising by 7.4 percent, to $2.7 billion.
In Florida, state officials have doubled spending for textbook purchases over the last four years while California legislators are mulling various bills that could raise textbook spending from $30 a student to $60. And next year is expected to be the busiest period in at least a decade for critical state adoptions of textbooks in Texas, California and Florida.
At the same time, libraries are reveling in a wave of new public investment, with more than 85 percent of almost 9,000 American library systems reporting budget increases for fiscal year 1996, according to the Chicago-based American Library Association.
"In the late 1980's and early 1990's much of the talk about education centered on the emerging technologies -- that the book was dead and traditional publishing was out," said Patrick J. Quinn, managing editor of the education group for Simba Information Inc., a market research firm. "And now, through all the hype and hoopla about it, textbooks have actually started to sell at a brisker pace."
With its purchase of the Simon & Schuster division, Pearson executives are speaking in glowing terms about future prospects for English-language textbooks, not only for the United States, but for the world.
They are predicting 10 percent annual growth rates in the international and domestic markets although analysts for the Book Industry Study Group have been more cautious in their projections for the United States.
"There's a national interest and this is not just in the United States," said Peter Jovanovich, the chief executive of Pearson's Addison Wesley Longman unit, who will preside over the merger of Simon & Schuster with his publishing company. "If you're in Canada or the United Kingdom, there's a renewed or growing emphasis on education. Most leaders realize that it's the key to improving productivity, and so what we see worldwide is more enrollment in higher education, more students staying in schools. All these factors have been good for college publishing and for school publishing."
Such sentiments are also shared by rival publishers who all struggled during the early 1990's through a period of declining sales and rising marketing and production costs.
"It's a good time for all of us -- all tides are rising," said Roby Harrington, the director of the college department for W. W. Norton & Company, who noted that this year 79 of the 123 titles in the Norton Critical Editions series showed higher sales.
"These are the sort of books that you can set your watch by," Mr. Harrington said of the editions that include critical essays along with classics like "Paradise Lost," "War and Peace" and "Moby Dick."
The increased sales activity comes after a period of intense competition, struggle and consolidation within the industry, which evolved from MacMillan's first textbook division established in 1906, to more than 50 companies capitalizing on the baby boom generation in the 1960's, to the top 10 publishers, which controlled more than 83 percent of the market in 1996. With its purchase of Simon & Schuster, a unit of Viacom, Pearson vaulted to the first position in that group, ahead of McGraw-Hill and Harcourt General.
The early 1990's were particularly lean times for educational publishers with sales declines that reflected the recession and taxpayer rejection of school tax increases, which resulted in widespread cuts in educational spending.
It was these and other market pressures that intensified consolidation in the industry.
As enrollments lagged and profits declined in the recession, production and marketing expenses were increasing and the major publishers started to merge to compete. College publishers sought to increase their share of the market by developing an expensive array of free perks packaged with textbooks that included graphics, computer disks, transparencies, videos and even jokes for the first day of class. In some cases, the textbook packages included up to 100 different elements, driving up the price of psychology or science books to as much as $100.
Textbooks also became weightier with the addition of graphics that expanded the number of pages in a biology book from 400 several decades ago to more than 1,000 today.
By 1996, within a six-month period, there was a flurry of consolidation in the industry with Addison Wesley Longman buying HarperCollins's education division and two other major players buying other American publishing properties.
"There wasn't as much room for as many players," Mr. Quinn of Simba said. "It became more expensive with a lot more pressure on the margins and the emergence of a used book market."
With its purchase, Pearson is now positioned to be the leading publisher for American students, commanding more than 27 percent of the $6.43 billion education market, which covers higher education and the kindergarten through 12th-grade level, according to Mr. Quinn.
The combined company's size worries the New York-based Authors Guild, a trade association that has formally challenged the merger of two large trade publishing houses, Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G.
"There are too few entities that will be deciding what texts are available to readers and there should be diversity in the textbook market," said Paul Aiken, the executive director of the Authors Guild.
At this point the precise shape and form of the new giant in the industry is not clear. Pearson has yet to disclose the name of the new company or even its headquarters, although one executive close to Pearson said the company was considering creating a headquarters out of Simon & Schuster's 475,000-square-foot offices in Upper Saddle River, N.J.
Pearson has said that it intends to achieve annual savings of $130 million by the year 2000 through integration of functions like production, distribution, central management and property. But Mr. Jovanovich declined to discuss whether duplicate publishing imprints would be folded together or eliminated as part of the merger.
But he is not shy about talking of Pearson's vision of the future. "It's a market that will continue to grow faster than the gross national product," he said, adding, "in many ways, education is going to be the growth industry of the 21st century."

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Reading, Writing and Revenue"
By combining its Addison Wesley Longman education publishing house with Simon & Schuster's, Pearson will become the biggest education publisher in the United States. Pearson is making such a big bet on education publishing because it is growing faster than the industry as a whole.

HEADLINE: City's Reliance On Wall Street Raises Concern

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Even as Wall Street's boom continues to feed the budget surplus in New York City, fiscal monitors and others say City Hall remains dangerously tied to the fortunes of the securities industry and question whether it has done enough to prepare for any downturn in the markets.
Since 1990, jobs in the securities industry have accounted for 97 percent of the inflation-adjusted growth in wages in the city, according to the State Comptroller's office. And those salaries, along with the even bigger bonuses that Wall Street gives out each year, have contributed to the largest budget surplus in city history -- $2 billion. 
 The city's budget boom is especially stunning because New York's economic and job growth has trailed the nation's. So, given this mixed overall economic picture, financial experts warn that the city's fortunes are increasingly dependent on an industry whose fortunes can turn suddenly on the Delphic pronouncements of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, or the unfolding events in a distant place like Indonesia.
They also raised doubts about how government officials have used the current period of plenty to prepare for an inevitable decline.
"We have traditionally viewed New York and the metro area as having a broad and diverse economic base, but recently, especially since 1995, that base has become dominated by the securities industry," said Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, a bond-rating agency. "Wall Street has been historically volatile. Years of huge profits could evaporate just as quickly."
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting and research firm, has a similar view. "Increasingly," he said, "we get the sense that governments are beginning to believe these kinds of revenue gains are going to be around for a long time and they're starting to base their policy decisions on that belief -- and that's the risk."
Analysts prescribed a menu of policies that would improve the city's ability to respond to a downturn on Wall Street, including bigger reserve funds, smaller spending increases and the use of more of the surplus to reduce long-term debt.
Last week, the City Council put the Giuliani administration on the defensive by proposing to use $500 million to retire some of the long-term debt next year. But the Giuliani administration said that plan was merely a ploy by the Council to spend an additional $226 million on various programs.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has tended to play down Wall Street's importance to his budgets, arguing that his fiscal policies are responsible for their surpluses.
And he has pointed out that the number of jobs in the city's securities industry, roughly 155,000, has fallen from its historic peak in 1987 and that employment has grown in other sectors. But what he fails to mention is that many of the securities industry's low-paying jobs have been eliminated by computers and other technological advances, thereby raising the industry's share of high-paying jobs and their importance to tax revenues, analysts said.
In 1987, the securities industry's jobs accounted for 4.5 percent of the city's total employment and 11 percent of all wages earned. But now, the industry still makes up 4.5 percent of the city's total employment but 17 percent of all wages. No other industry comes even close to having salaries with such a disproportionate impact on the city's tax base, economists said.
By almost any measure, analysts said, Wall Street's boom has made a significant and ever-growing impact on the budgets of not only New York City but also that of New York State and its neighbors. In 1985 and 1986, the height of the last decade's boom, the securities industry recorded $9.6 billion in profits. But they have been eclipsed by Wall Street's profits over the last two years of $23.5 billion, which has far outpaced inflation over that time.
In fiscal 1996, the city had a $224 million surplus; in the last two years, the surpluses shot up, in sync with the market boom, to $1.4 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Surpluses also reached record highs in Albany, $1.4 billion and $2 billion in each of the last two years.
Bonuses earned on Wall Street totaled about $27.6 billion over the last three years, compared to the $6.5 billion recorded from 1985 to 1987. Perhaps even more importantly, Wall Street workers now receive a greater share of their total compensation from bonuses, more than double the level of 1987, according to estimates by the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget. Because the size of bonuses depends on profit levels, the tax revenues they produce can swing from year to year.
"The bonuses can go down as quickly as they went up," said Donald J. Boyd, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "It's hard to base spending or tax-cutting decisions on what may be extraordinary good luck."
In particular, Mr. Kurtter said that bonuses could quickly change the fortunes of Albany, which gets more than half of its tax revenues from personal income taxes, compared with 24 percent for the city. A one-year dip in the market, he said, could mean a drop of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax money for Albany.
Reflecting such concerns, the state's long-term fiscal health continues to be ranked last in the nation by Moody's.
In addition, city taxpayers realized more than $11 billion in capital gains last year, up from $4.5 billion in 1994, before the boom began, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The gains were mostly from the stock market, ranging from Wall Street tycoons cashing in stock options to average New Yorkers selling off some of their mutual funds.
And in a broader sense, economists said, governments are benefiting from a host of other tax revenues that have risen with the stock market. The bull market has kept lawyers busy on mergers and acquisitions, sent tourists to Manhattan and encouraged consumers to spend on everything from clothes to computers to apartments.
Using historical relationships between the stock market and tax revenue growth, Mr. Zandi calculated that since 1996, Wall Street has produced 43 to 72 percent of the annual tax revenue growth of New York State.
And he estimated that at least 31 percent of Connecticut's tax revenue growth since 1996, and at least 18 percent of New Jersey's, resulted from Wall Street.
"This makes the 1980's look like small potatoes," said Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "Most people think this is merely another boom period that we've had, a reflection of the cyclical nature in the New York economy. This is a megaboom compared to earlier booms.
"But," he added, "the bigger the boom, the bigger the bust."
As an example of how Wall Street's wild swings can hurt the city, Thomas L. McMahon, the New York City Council's finance director, pointed to 1994, when the bond market tumbled suddenly in February after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. That year, Wall Street's profits plummeted 87 percent from the previous year, to $1.1 billion.
So only weeks after the city adopted a budget in late June of 1994, Mr. McMahon said, City Hall had to cut $700 million from it, because tax collections were far lower than expected. As the market worsened and tax revenues kept shrinking, the Mayor and Council fought over how to cut more than $1 billion in November. "It got so wild that we ended up in court," Mr. McMahon said. "Services were affected in every area of the city."
So how well prepared is the city government for the next downturn?
Joseph J. Lhota, the Mayor's budget director, said, "We have prepared for the volatility of Wall Street by being fiscally disciplined and not dramatically increasing the rate of growth in spending." He noted that 38 percent of the city's revenue came from property taxes, which are more stable than personal income taxes.
"Our diversity is our strength," Mr. Lhota said. "While Wall Street represents 17 percent of our revenues, other industries represent 83 percent."
But some analysts said the Giuliani administration had not done enough to put the city's fiscal house in order. The government's spending is still growing faster than its revenues, contributing to multibillion-dollar budget gaps that the city has been able to patch recently with the Wall Street revenues but that, in Mr. Giuliani's early budgets, the city closed through service cuts and one-shot budget maneuvers.
Mr. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission said the Wall Street boom masked the budget gaps and other inherent problems in the city's budget, and it had driven Mr. Giuliani from his pledge to make the municipal government more productive. Lengthening the workweek of city employees by two hours, to 37, would have saved the city millions and would have been a real but politically difficult reform, Mr. Horton said.
Mr. Lhota dismissed the criticism as politically unrealistic. "You would get a better budget analysis by turning on the Psychic Friends Network," Mr. Lhota said.
In general, analysts on Wall Street and in government reacted favorably to the budget Mr. Giuliani has proposed for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1, especially compared with the state budget.
"This year's budget actions show that the Mayor and the City Council have been more attentive to the long-term problem of Wall Street's volatility than officials in Albany, both the Governor and the Legislature," said H. Carl McCall, the New York State Comptroller.
Mr. McCall endorsed the Mayor's proposal to patch short-term budget gaps with the surplus, instead of spending it. But he said the city was failing to use the boom to tackle long-term problems, including retiring some of its $32 billion in debt. The Giuliani administration, however, says the city should focus on getting its current house in order.
Once the short-term budget gaps shrink, the city should begin paying off debt as a way of addressing long-term problems, the Mayor said Sunday. Explaining why he opposed the Council's plan to spend more money on programs, the Mayor cited the uncertainty of city finances.
"Anything," he added, "can happen on Wall Street."

With a booming economy, jobholders in the securities industry have enjoyed bigger salaries and more buying power, contributing to the city's large surplus. But financial experts fear city and state budgets are depending too much on this unstable trend to continue. Chart shows securities industry wages and total city wages, from 1987 through 1997.

In repeated germ attacks in the early 1990's, a Japanese cult tried to kill millions of people throughout Tokyo and, a cultist has now testified, also thousands of people at nearby American military bases. An examination of court testimony and confessions of the cult's members, as well as interviews with Japanese and American officials, show that the group's germ attacks were far more numerous than previously known.

Israel May Concede More Land
The Israeli Defense Minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, said that Israel would have to agree to turn over a "double-digit" percentage of West Bank land to Palestinians. It was the first time he has publicly envisaged a transfer above the 9 percent already offered by Israel in the second stage of a three-stage withdrawal. But his remarks stopped short of acceptance of the 13 percent proposed by the United States. (Reuters)

Improved Air Safety Is Goal Of Laser Detection System
A laser-based system for detecting air turbulence and other invisible hazards to planes has been tested at Kennedy International Airport in New York. The results of the technique, which uses lasers to listen for the sound of rapidly moving air, could improve airline safety. The laser system could detect the wake behind large jets, which can toss about smaller planes. Scientists also hope to adapt the technique to hear the microbursts that cause wind shear, a deadly hazard to planes at low altitude, and clear-air turbulence. A16

As Drug Raids Increase, More Residents Sue City
The Giuliani administration has stepped up its anti-drug initiatives, forcing many low-level dealers off the sidewalks, leading the police to double the number of narcotics search warrants executed each year. Most allow the police to enter without warning and they say most raids yield drugs. But in at least a half-dozen cases in the past year, people say the police wrongly raided their homes and they have filed or announced plans to file multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the city. Those warrants were based largely, or solely, on the word of confidential informers. A1

HEADLINE: Putting Africa On Coke's Map;
Pushing Soft Drinks on a Continent That Has Seen Hard, Hard Times

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS and DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
On the edge of the black South African township of Soweto, perched atop Vic de Villiers's gas station roof, is a retired South African Air Force warplane, known as the Coke Bomber. Earlier this month, workers showed up to give the plane, which bears the Coca-Cola Company's trademark red logo, a fresh paint job, courtesy of Coke. Coke is now also paying Mr. de Villiers to illuminate the plane at night.
Elsewhere in South Africa, in the vast Orange Farm shantytown outside Johannesburg, the refrigerators at tiny "spaza shops," run out of the backs of tin and cinderblock houses, carry Coca-Cola products supplied by local distributors who have plenty of incentive to keep them filled with Coke bottles. Meshack Malindi, one such distributor, says if he can beat all his rivals to double-digit sales growth, he will win a trip to the soccer World Cup in France this summer. 
 And to the north, in war-shattered Angola, local officials in the town of Bonjesus are awaiting the construction of a $30 million Coke bottling plant. Meanwhile, in Ghana, on the West African coast, another $34 million plant is already in full swing.
These are among the many signs that Coke is heating up its efforts in Africa. Sure, Coca-Cola has been available in South Africa for 60 years and West Africa for 30, and its trademark glass bottles turn up in Ugandan villages, Madagascar roadside huts and Zairean refugee camps. But the company has long tended to ignore Africa's underdeveloped markets and only recently has the continent acquired priority status -- a decision made largely by the new chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester.
Mr. Ivester toured Africa in January 1997, nine months before getting Coke's top job. His Africa strategy, presented to the board in December, aims to double sales -- they were 712 million cases last year, a meager 3 percent of the company's global total -- in five years.
The strategy has several parts: strengthening the bottler network, increasing the number of outlets and intensifying the marketing to consumers. During Phase 1 last year, an estimated 50,000 coolers and refrigerators were installed, many in places like Orange Farm that only recently got electricity, to put Coke products within easier reach.
Coke is spending freely to build its network of bottlers and sales people, both on its own and through its anchor bottler, Coca-Cola Sabco. It is also using local institutions, from universities to soccer tournaments, to propel its strategy along.
"To be very candid, Africa has not historically been a real priority for the Coca-Cola Company," Mr. Ivester declared in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year. "But over the past two years, we have come to a very different perspective."
That shift came about, he said, because of population growth -- there are 610 million people now, possibly a billion by 2020 -- and disproportionately low sales. The per-capita consumption is 27 eight-ounce Coke servings a year, microscopic compared with North America (358) and Latin America (187).
Even though Coke, at 20 to 80 cents a bottle (in returnable glass bottles), is relatively cheap compared with prices in the United States and Europe, Africans drink far more water, fruit juice and other beverages. The market is "grossly underdeveloped with some very large populations," said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst with Morgan Stanley.
Not everyone agrees that getting the world's poorest, most undernourished continent to double its consumption of a sugar-filled, nutritionally empty beverage is a good thing.
"The direct adverse public health effect is mostly on teeth," said David Sanders, a professor of public health at South Africa's University of the Western Cape. "As for indirect effects -- it's an inefficient use of a low income. If people are encouraged to spend some of their meager incomes on empty calories, they won't have money to spend on more nutritious foods."
In an interview, Mr. Ivester said he had personally researched the nutrition question. "Actually, our product is quite healthy," he said. "Fluid replenishment is a key to health, and when you have a population that has appropriate fluid intake, what you find is they have a lot less kidney problems and kidney disease." Although the World Health Organization says that kidney disease ranks low on the long list of illnesses that afflict Africans, Mr. Ivester said he had spent time with scientists who specialized in the issue, and "some of them will tell you Coca-Cola does a great service because it encourages people to take in more and more liquids."
Coca-Cola prides itself on promoting entrepreneurship, which the continent badly needs. A hawker who can raise $7 to buy a case can sell it quickly on a hot day and re-invest the profits in more. S'bu Mngadi, chief spokesman for Coca-Cola Southern Africa, pointed proudly to the Kunene brothers of Mpumalanga, South Africa, who started out as spaza shop owners selling Coke and now own a multimillion-dollar bottling business.
Coke also does charitable work in Africa, paying for mobile clinics and college scholarships to the tune of about $7 million a year, Mr. Mngadi said, although Professor Sanders dismissed that amount as "peanuts" relative to its sales. Still, Coke's per-case profit margins are lower in Africa than in many other parts of the world. One analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber, estimates profit in the region at about 24 cents a case last year, up 5 percent over 1996 but still only two-thirds of the company average.
In any case, the terrain for expansion is tough. Twelve of the continent's 55 countries have fought civil wars in the last decade. Some major highways are pocked with potholes big enough to flip a truck. In Angola and the former Zaire, trucks risk landmines and ambushes by soldiers-turned-bandits. And poverty limits sales growth.
But as far as competitors go, Coke has the territory pretty much to itself. South Africa is the gateway to the continent and Coca-Cola never really left, even during the years of anti-apartheid sanctions. The company moved its syrup plant to Swaziland, a tiny nation virtually inside South Africa, selling off its bottling interests, but it continued to advertise and sell in South Africa.
Pepsi, which did honor the sanctions and pull out, has twice tried to get back in, and twice failed. It is now sold in only 11 African countries but holds a 50 percent market share in Uganda and has a strong presence in Ethiopia and Nigeria. Africa is less of a priority for Pepsi, which is focusing on India, China and Russia, though it does not exactly admit that. Pepsi is a unit of Pepsico.
"We think there's a lot of growth opportunity in Africa," said a Pepsi-Cola International spokesman, Keith Hughes, "and we intend to continue building a solid business to tap that."
Over all, Coke has a 79 percent share of the African soft-drink market. "Coke's biggest obstacle to growth in the region," says Michael Branca, a beverage industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, "is themselves."
On his 1997 trip, Mr. Ivester personally discovered the region's potential during an impromptu stop along the road between Johannesburg and Soweto. "There was a squatters' camp that had arisen there, with people coming from Mozambique and the outlying territories," Mr. Ivester recalled.
"I ran across this guy who was selling ice cream," he said. "I started interviewing him about how much ice cream he sold, where he got it, how much money he was making. It was clear to me that an entrepreneurial environment exists at all levels of society, even in these squatter camps."
Coke has one anchor bottler, Coca-Cola Sabco, based in Port Elizabeth, in which it holds a 21 percent stake, and scores of smaller ones. Some analysts think it will soon assemble at least one more anchor bottler -- important, since it is through them that headquarters in Atlanta drives its marketing and sales objectives. It vastly prefers to use fewer, more efficient bottlers than a fragmented network like the one that has slowed its strategy in India.
With the strategy has come re-education for bottlers. Most of them saw their jobs only as selling Coke where people wanted it. The bottler's role, however, is "not just about fulfilling demand, but about creating demand," said Carl H. Ware, president of Coke's Africa group.
For example, last year a group of executives visited Angola, which is slowly recovering from decades of civil war, and glimpsed people feasting and dancing by lamplight in town squares late at night.
"Our strategy would call for us to get in there and place coolers, to help give people a simple moment of pleasure," said Charles S. Frenette, recently named Coke's chief marketing officer after two years running Coca-Cola South Africa.
Coolers are not alone on the Angolan agenda. In September, Coke signed an agreement with the Government to build the bottling plant in Bonjesus, near Luanda.
Similar agreements are being negotiated in other countries. The company makes sure most of the materials used in the plants, from the sugar in the processing to the wood in the crates, are locally produced. "As a result," Mr. Ivester said, "we are able to price the product in almost local wage terms so it is affordable."
To create new customers, Coke is helping to open shops from Uganda to South Africa. By making irresistible offers -- it often pays the entire cost of a kiosk or an ice chest and sponsors business and management classes for budding micro-entrepreneurs -- it is generating markets where there might have been none.
"The infrastructure in terms of people and equipment that is already in place should enable them to capture per capita growth as Africa develops," said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a trade publication.
Moving to the academic sector, the company has set up "Coca-Cola Forums" to train entrepreneurs, usually to work for Coke, at the University of Zimbabwe and the University of Nairobi in Kenya.
"What we've seen in South Africa is somebody who starts by standing on a street corner, then moving up to a kiosk," Mr. Frenette said.
One of the chief marketing vehicles has been sports, especially soccer, Africa's passion. Coke was lead sponsor of the African Cup of Nations, a continentwide tournament held this year in Burkina Faso, a tiny impoverished country that borders Ghana on the north.
Every local bottler on the continent had posters and ads linking Coca-Cola with the Cup. To build good will and brand identification, Coke also re-sods local soccer fields and hands out new goal posts and scoreboards with the Coke logo.
Coke supplied free soft drinks, telephones and transportation to officials and reporters at the tournament. On a continent where television stations are too cash-strapped to send their own reporters to the games, the company contracted with a reporter from a Nairobi station to present a nightly two-minute feature that it broadcast without charge to any station that asked.
"It's a very happy marriage," said Brendan Harris, Coca-Cola Africa's marketing director. To be linked with soccer "is very good for us; at the same time, we were able to put something back."

HEADLINE: Russia Takes Steps To Assure Investors Economy Will Hold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 25

 BODY:
Shaken by global financial turmoil, Russia tried to assure anxious investors today that it would not follow the path of Indonesia and other faltering Asian economies.
President Boris N. Yeltsin summoned leading bankers and industrialists to an unusual Kremlin meeting this week on ways to end the financial crisis. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Yeltsin's new Prime Minister told foreign investors that the Government would not allow the downturn in Asia to infect Russia's economy. "We intend to live up to our financial obligations," Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said told a group of American pension fund and money managers.
The Government's assurances come as Russia has been knocked off balance by a series of economic and political body blows. In recent weeks the Government has had to cope with anxious foreign investors, a decline in oil prices, tough talks with the International Monetary Fund and labor unrest, all while Mr. Kiriyenko, a determined but politically untested Prime Minister, was trying to assemble his Government.
The key question is whether Russia can maintain the stability of the ruble and avoid the panic both among investors and ordinary Russians that would almost certainly follow a currency devaluation. So far, the Central Bank has managed to keep the ruble steady, though it has been forced to spend from its reserves to do so. But investors say Russia is approaching several critical tests: avoiding the collapse of cash-strapped banks, attracting bidders for its long-awaiting selloffs of state property and winning the support of the International Monetary Fund, which is considering whether to provide the latest installment of a $10 billion loan.
"Unfortunately, the situation has not developed in a favorable way," Sergei Dubinin, the chairman of the Central Bank said. "I believe this reflects not only our dependence on international events, including those in southeast Asia, but also our own internal problems."
Russia's economic crisis is all the more unsettling because this was supposed to be the year when the economy finally began to take off. But with such an array of problems one senior Government official predicted that the economy -- which grew at a rate of eight-tenths of a percentage point last year -- would be generally flat this year.
Russia's economic woes stem from a dangerous interaction between events beyond the Kremlin's control and the nation's heavy dependence on deficit financing.
Foreign investors have been fleeing emerging markets in recent months as Asian economies stumbled. That has hit Russia hard since it is heavily dependent on foreign investors to finance its enormous budget deficit.
To encourage investors to keep buying Russian treasury bills, the Central Bank raised interest rates to over 50 percent. Paying such high interest will divert Government funds from other pressing needs.
The exodus of foreign investors has also taken a serious toll on Russia's stock market, which fell by more than 30 percent this month. The drop in world oil prices has hurt Russian exports and deprived the Government of badly needed revenue.
Meanwhile, the central bank has been dipping into its reserves to buy rubles and prop up the nation's currency.
There are several reasons the Government feels that it needs to maintain the ruble at its current relation to the dollar. A stable ruble would buttress the solvency of banks and prevent the ballooning of the Government's debt. It is also important to ordinary Russians, who see a firm exchange rate as a barometer of the nation's economic and political stability.
The Government is also trying to cope with problems inflicted on the economy by Russian nationalists. In a move that scared many investors, the Parliament voted earlier this month to restrict foreign ownership of the electrical monopoly, Unified Energy Systems. Since foreigners own many shares in the monopoly, that has spurred fears that some of those shares will be confiscated. The Yeltsin Government is challenging the law in the Constitutional Court.
Another pressing question is whether the 35 year-old Mr. Kiriyenko and his team of young aides can get the economy back on track.
Mr. Kiriyenko told foreign investors today that he would work to protect the rights of shareholders, promote tax reform and reduce the Government's borrowing costs by cutting spending drastically. Some investors were clearly pleased by what they heard.
"They're answering all the questions that my colleagues and investors are asking and they're answering them right," said Peter Aldrich, chairman of AEW International, in Boston, which has $50 million invested in Russia.
Walter Stern, chairman of Capital Group International Inc., in New York, was more skeptical.
"His talk was favorably received but the question is how he will implement these reforms," Mr. Stern said. "The next two to three weeks are going to be critical."
There are, in fact, some immediate challenges. One case that investors are closely monitoring concerns Tokobank, an institution that has run into trouble.
Tokobank has received a temporary infusion of cash from the Central Bank. But the Central Bank also says that it does not plan to prop up Tokobank after this week and that shareholders and creditors need to work out a long-term plan to keep the bank afloat. A collapse of the bank could send shock waves through the banking sector.
Another potential bellwether concerns the Government's plans to sell Rosneft, a state-owned oil company. The Government has stipulated that bids start at $2.1 billion.
But with many companies experiencing a cash crunch and with oil prices depressed it is not clear which companies, if any, will bid. A failure to sell Rosneft would be taken by many investors as a sign that Russian assets are no longer so desirable.
Beyond that, the Government is waiting to hear from the I.M.F. following talks here last week. Russian officials say they expect the fund to approve a $700 million disbursement, though fund officials say they are still studying the Government's deficit reduction plan.
One issue on which the Government has made headway is in defusing swelling labor unrest.
Mr. Kiriyenko's team has persuaded coal miners to stop blocking rail lines in Siberia and other parts of the country by rushing back wages to them. Most of the wage arrears for the miners, however, remain unpaid and just where the money will come to pay them is unclear.
Today, Mr. Yeltsin convened a meeting of his Security Council to discuss the plight of the coal miners and ethnic strife in the Caucasus.
Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, later underscored the severity of the woes, while insisting that the worst was over.
"The deterioration of the situation posed a threat to political stability in the country and in several cases to the national security," he said.

HEADLINE: After School and Before Home;
Parents Seek Havens Like 'Homework Club' to Fill the Gap

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y., May 25

 BODY:
Pam Carrano tells one child to take off his hat before dinner, another to abandon the computer and the rest to settle down. She asks who wants sesame chicken and who wants baked ziti.
Homework is finished. So is softball practice and a few screechy turns on the violin. There will be enough daylight after dinner for a tussle with the dogs. 
 The scene could be a Saturday Evening Post cover of a suburban family spending an evening at home. But it is not. This is Ms. Carrano's business venture, the Homework Club, a place for children to go after school and before their parents come home from work, where they study, play and enjoy the amenities of home from 3 to 8 P.M.
It is also one small effort to bring some safety and order to these five weekday hours that have become the focus of growing national attention, anxiety and debate -- particularly for preteen-agers and young teen-agers who seem too old for baby sitters and too young to be left on their own.
These are the hours that working parents everywhere dread, and that experts agree are the most dangerous time of the day for youngsters.
Studies -- and common sense -- indicate that unsupervised youngsters are more likely to use drugs or alcohol, have sex, get poor grades or commit crimes. But even for children who steer clear of such trouble, the after-school hours can loom long and empty.
In recent months, policymakers have turned their attention to the risks and opportunities of these hours, particularly for vulnerable early adolescents. In Washington, President Clinton has proposed spending $200 million a year on after-school programs. In New York City, George Soros, the philanthropist, is offering up to $25 million to establish such programs.
And around the nation, there is a push to keep schools open from dawn to dark, sanctuaries for the children of working parents.
"A majority of them are lonely," Ms. Carrano said. "Who wants to go home to an empty house? It goes against nature. Kids this age are social creatures."
The twin perils for these children are over-scheduling and isolation. Some race from Little League to rehearsals for "Guys and Dolls," without a moment to spare. Others pass afternoons at home with Oprah, Final Fantasy and a bag of Doritos for company.
"Both create the sense that nobody cares," said Edward Zigler, director of the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University.
And that has two results: "One is the acting-out, aggressive kind of stuff," he said. "And the other, which is rarely discussed, is depression."
Around the country, people like Ms. Carrano have begun to see opportunity in the changing face of America's families. Car services have proliferated in recent years in the suburbs, to replace the mothers who once spent their afternoons ferrying children to play dates and other activities. Tutors are hired to supervise homework, so parents can spend their meager time at home in more pleasant pursuits.
The Homework Club, Ms. Carrano says, tries to be scheduled without being hectic. Loneliness is not a problem. After snacks and school work, a half-dozen children sit on bean-bag chairs and dissect their day. They talk about a math teacher so mean she does not allow gum chewing during tests. They debate the merits of the Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys.
Ms. Carrano, who started the Homework Club for elementary school children in 1995 and added preteen-agers six months ago, tells parents that her philosophy is to try to fill their shoes.
"I tell them, 'I want your child's life to be as normal as if you were home,' " said Ms. Carrano, who gave up a career in New York City as a fashion stylist to rear two daughters. "If your kid forgets lunch, I'll bring it to school. If your kid falls in Sugar Pond, I'll bring dry clothes. If they're sick, they come here with a pillow and I feed them chicken soup."
The Homework Club is just one place in the after-school universe of this economically diverse Westchester County village of about 8,000 people. Indeed, at a cost of $25 a day, and $10 more for dinner, for each of the 30 children who take part in the sessions either at Ms. Carrano's house or at a nearby church, the club is the sort of solution only the relatively well-to-do can afford.
Here in Hastings, 3 to 8 actually begins at 2:45, when youngsters rich and poor tumble out of the red-brick building that houses the middle and high schools. Toting backpacks, sports equipment and musical instruments, they fan out in all directions: to confraternity classes and dance lessons, to tutors and karate instruction, downtown for pizza or up to a meadow where the police often find empty beer kegs.
Many actually stay at school. Seven of 10 youngsters belong to sports teams, the elementary school runs a popular after-hours program and the high school library and computer lab stay open until 5. But the district's commitment to keeping schools open later to accommodate working parents is matched by only one-third of the nation's schools.
And those teen-agers whose parents cannot afford music lessons or the Homework Club after the schools close their doors are often left to fend for themselves. They also get in trouble more often. During a recent week, one was arrested for scrawling anti-Semitic graffiti on parking meters and six others for scaling a fence at the local swimming pool to have a beer party.
Their hangouts are a shabby community center that has cigarette butts littering the stoop, cast-off furniture and a boom box that works only sometimes, and a village landmark known simply as "the Wall," a stone rampart outside the V.F.W. Hall where generations of teen-agers have congregated.
The middle class and wealthy children are more likely to be supervised, but even in richer families, stay-at-home mothers are rare -- the middle school principal, Jennifer Dolan, can find just a few when she rifles through her Rolodex of parents.
It is the many working parents in Hastings who keep Pam Carrano's dinner table full -- the parents who juggle work and home and sometimes end up feeling they are doing neither terribly well.
Many of the children there complain that their mothers are inattentive after a long day of work and their fathers do not get home until bedtime.
Danny Lebost, who is 11, says his mother is so cranky at night that he dare not "get in her way one tiny bit." And she does not contradict him. Sondra Lebost says that a job at the New York Botanical Garden, a husband who works all hours and elderly parents who need her help leave her frayed. She comes home to a pile of mail, a blinking answering machine and a dog who needs walking. Too beat for anything better, the evening meal is often a can of soup.
"He enjoys Pam's dinner table enormously," Mrs. Lebost said. "I know he's lonely."
Homework is the centerpiece of Ms. Carrano's program, with the younger children at work in her basement and older ones at the parish hall at Grace Episcopal Church. One recent day, Kate Frey hunched over her fifth-grade social studies workbook, answering questions like "Why did the founders think we needed a government?" Next, for a language arts lesson, she used new vocabulary words in a sentence: "The king has a lots of dictums. The girl would gloat about her tests."
Bennett Faber, also 11, invaded her tranquillity to announce that his class had just seen a film about puberty. Kate shut him up with a sharp, "Thank you, Bennett," before he could offer details. "I had to go to the nurse, I felt so sick," Bennett said, determined to get the last word.
Supervising, from a respectful distance, was Melanie Anderson, a former psychologist who now works for Ms. Carrano. She had picked up the children at school, given them a snack of crackers and peanut butter and set them to their homework. "If you have practically nothing to do, that means you have something to do," she told one recalcitrant boy. "So get to work on your something."
Next came an activity -- pottery, carpentry or cartooning, the last taught by a high school senior, Zack Mason, who showed the children how to change a face from worried to angry just by reversing the tilt of the eyebrows. Most of the children were picked up by a parent before 6 P.M., the rest by Ms. Carrano, who drove them up the hill for dinner.
The last to leave the parish hall was Bennett, who grew agitated as other mothers came and went with no sign of his. He finally settled into his favorite activity, drawing gory pictures of a man with his head cut off and another with blood dripping from his mouth, the sort of images common in computer games.
All the mothers look haggard when they come to claim their children. And they agonize about the appropriate age to leave youngsters unsupervised. Susan Frey, Kate's mother and a librarian in nearby Dobbs Ferry, lets her 15-year-old son go home by himself after school. But he is not allowed to answer the telephone.
And some children experiment with independence. Bennett is now permitted one day a week at home with a friend, a concession his mother made after much pestering.
"I call constantly," said his mother, Ginny Faber, a book editor. "This is the age where they say they don't need you, but they really do."

Blocking Promising Students From City University

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
California's decision to outlaw the use of race in public college admissions has barred most black and Latino students from the elite campuses and raised the specter of a whitening professional class in a steadily browning state. Politicians elsewhere have recognized the potential for harm and have backed away from proposals that would limit minority access to higher education. But a different and more destructive plan has emerged in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is pushing a proposal that would scuttle open admissions at the City University of New York. This would depress graduation rates, not just for blacks and Latinos but for every ethnic group. Such a result would be terrible for the city's work force and economy.
Open admissions at the City University began in 1970, when the trustees allowed high school graduates who finished in the top half of their classes into the four-year colleges and anyone who graduated at all to attend the two-year junior colleges. CUNY's freshman class nearly doubled in a single year, with the largest increases occurring among ethnic whites who, like blacks and Latinos, had traditionally gone to worse public schools and done poorly on entrance exams. 
 Critics saw the new plan as radical. In truth, it was already common practice around the country -- most notably in California, which had historically offered broad access while maintaining the best public university system in the nation.
CUNY's version of open admissions has been called the most studied program in higher education history. The history of that research is summarized in the recently published book "Changing the Odds: Open Admissions and the Life Chances of the Disadvantaged," by the sociologists David Lavin and David Hyllegard. Nearly a quarter of a million New Yorkers who would otherwise have been shut out of college have gone on to receive degrees from CUNY. "Changing the Odds" documents significant income differences between students who took advantage of open admissions and their peers who did not.
Despite its obvious success, Mayor Giuliani has termed open admissions "a mistake." One alternative to that policy would forbid the senior colleges to offer the remedial courses that make open admissions work. Mr. Lavin calculates that the new policy would bar 38 percent of whites, 67 percent of African-Americans, 70 percent of Latinos and 71 percent of Asians from the four-year schools. Half of these students are immigrants, many of them better educated than their American peers but in need of schooling in English. Many of the rest are native New Yorkers whom the city schools have cheated of full educations.
The junior colleges that would supposedly catch these students are overcrowded and vocationally oriented, and tend to steer students away from more valuable, four-year degrees. In addition, junior college students are about half as likely to complete bachelor's degrees as are students who begin their educations on senior campuses.
The junior college system would smother many of the students who aspire to careers in science, medicine and engineering. This is clear from what happens at CUNY's most prestigious school, the City College School of Engineering, which is recognized as one of the country's best and ranks as one of the top producers of minority engineers nationwide. A significant number of engineering graduates begin with remedial calculus. Those who take this course at the engineering school thrive. But those who get it at junior colleges struggle.
Enemies of open admissions call it a blight on the university. But students who need one or two remedial courses are consistently among the system's most distinguished and highest-earning graduates, and graduate at only a slightly lower rate than students who do not need remediation.
Open admissions is not to blame for New York City's education problems. The trouble lies with a public school system that has consistently cheated the students whom CUNY must accept. Killing open admissions will not make the public schools better.
Californians pleaded ignorance after passing a seemingly innocuous law that proved catastrophic. But if the CUNY trustees pass this remedial plan, they will do so with full knowledge of the damage it portends.

Closing of Plant Moved Up

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Efforts have failed to persuade Imperial Wallcoverings to stay in Plattsburg, N.Y., and the 90-year-old company moved up its deadline to close, which would leave 350 people without jobs by October.
Imperial's closing announcement came in February as a result of a merger between Imperial and an Ohio-based wallpaper company, Borden Decorative Products. 
 The employees had been told that the plant's operations would be phased out over 18 months. But on Friday, without explanation, a sign went up on a bulletin board informing employees of the new deadline.
Union officials have called a meeting for today, when they are expected to provide details of the closing schedule and benefits package.

HEADLINE: Green, the Energizer Candidate, Proudly Holds the Liberal Line

SERIES: EARLY STEPS: The Senate Campaign

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mark Green opposes the death penalty; in fact, as he likes to tell audiences, he is the only candidate running for United States Senate who is against it. In a field of Democrats who all support abortion rights, he goes so far as to assert that "life begins at birth," opposing virtually any restrictions on the procedure.
Mr. Green, New York City's Public Advocate, opposes tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools. He wants to raise the minimum wage. And as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, he reaches back to the New Deal to inspire the foundation of his campaign: what he calls a Social Security system for children, with new spending on education and health care. 
 In a decade when such positions have fallen into some disrepute, Mr. Green at times sounds like a throwback, appealing to liberal voters at the risk of making himself an easy target for Mr. D'Amato and his chief political adviser, Arthur J. Finkelstein, both of whom have made a career out of attacking liberals.
But with far less money than either of his Democratic opponents, and seeking his second -- and if he does not succeed, no doubt last -- chance to unseat the Senator he has pursued for 12 years, Mr. Green may have little choice. While such a campaign by another politician might be readily dismissed, his candidacy is emerging as a test of his redoubtable capabilities as a politician, and a fresh measure of the vibrancy of liberal thinking in New York.
Of the three candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to unseat Mr. D'Amato, no one has been at it as long as Mr. Green. He ran unsuccessfully against Mr. D'Amato in 1986, and filed the complaint that led the Senate Ethics Committee to reprimand Mr. D'Amato in 1991. Mr. Green is known as a wily, resourceful and clever (perhaps, some of his friends say, a bit too clever) candidate who has been presenting himself as a consumer advocate and dedicated government servant; in short, anything but an ideologue or a career politician.
"I have spent more years as a public interest lawyer with Ralph Nader than I have in elective and appointive office," Mr. Green said over sushi and wine to a small gathering at the Park Avenue apartment of Eleanor Guggenheim the other evening. "I have spent more years writing and editing books than I have in elective office. So while I am a politician -- I wear dark suits, I'm nice to people I don't always like -- I am really, in biography and philosophy, more an advocate than a politician."
In truth, Mr. Green has been something of a fixture in New York politics for the better part of a decade. And in some significant, if not yet obvious, ways, he is different from both his Democratic opponents, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the 1984 Vice-Presidential candidate, and Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn. That difference is a point he has been subtly making with increasing frequency in the days leading up to tomorrow's Democratic state convention at the Rye Town Hilton in Westchester County, where the party will select candidates to run in the September primary.
Unlike Mr. Schumer and Ms. Ferraro, Mr. Green opposes the death penalty, which has long been an ideological marker in this state. Unlike Ms. Ferraro, Mr. Green opposes the ban on late-term abortions.
He lets his audiences know that he would have opposed the bill that effectively banned marriages between homosexuals. Mr. Schumer voted for the legislation in 1996, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, and Ms. Ferraro said she would have supported it had she held office at the time. And Mr. Green is far more inclined to advocate ambitious social spending programs -- financed by the projected Federal surplus -- than either rival.
The differences go to tactics as well. In a campaign in which Mr. Schumer and Ms. Ferraro have concluded that attacks on Mr. D'Amato's ethics are of dubious political value -- "To be quite frank, the voters all know he's a sleaze," Ms. Ferraro said the other evening -- the man who made his statewide name attacking Mr. D'Amato shows not the slightest interest in restraint. Mr. Green assails Mr. D'Amato at every microphone as an "ethical embarrassment who often votes against the interests of our children and our state," and he presents himself as "the un-D'Amato."
"Now I will not belabor, at the risk of insulting you, the topic of Al D'Amato," Mr. Green assured an audience of like-minded Democrats in Morningside Heights. He then proceeded to do precisely that.
"His idea of economic development is to get Federal contracts to his big contributors," Mr. Green said. "I would maintain that the last person you want, entering the 21st century, as our political leader is someone who is an old-fashioned, big-money, political boss."
In sketching out his attacks on Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Green is addressing the concerns of party members who remember the brutal campaign of 1992. Mr. Green asserted that his opponents were naive in concluding that attacks on Mr. D'Amato's values might not work.
"How can a candidate avoid talking about the problem of public ethics in a year of so many campaign finance scandals?" Mr. Green asked in an interview. "The public is interested. The issue is important. And it's relevant to how we govern the Senate. This issue has been the No. 1 issue to me in my first 30 years in public life."
As he heads to Westchester for the convention, there are indications that he has less organized support than his rivals; he certainly has far less money. Characteristically, Mr. Green has sought to turn that into an advantage, contending that it actually makes him a stronger candidate. "It's not very likely that Al D'Amato and Chuck Schumer can survive the liability of their millions of dollars in the popular vote," he said.
Along the same lines of trying to turn a little into a lot, Mr. Green has repeatedly shown his ability to use his public office -- consumer affairs commissioner and now public advocate -- to win public attention, on issues small and large. He was one of the earliest people to take credit for the effort to bar tobacco advertising aimed at children. Speaking to a luncheon of Harlem ministers, he took some credit for City Hall's effort to curb the influence of the mob in carting.
As Mr. Green presents his record, there are few chapters that escape his mention, even those that might seem to have little bearing on what he might do in the Senate. At Ms. Guggenheim's apartment, he boasted to a mostly female audience about his success in pursuing dry cleaners who charge more for cleaning women's clothes.
Among other politicians, Mr. Green is known for turning quickly to gimmickry to win press attention. At times, he can be "over the top," to borrow a description he once used for himself as he pulled a tattered copy of his typed bar mitzvah speech and began reciting it while accepting endorsements of Jewish leaders in front of City Hall. Similarly, Mr. Green turned up to denounce Mr. D'Amato's re-election announcement the other Sunday a full two hours before Mr. D'Amato's event.
He is given to alliteration and unlikely rhyme (once Mr. Green sought to rhyme "Manhattan Island" with "Staten Island"). He is quick to find parallels between his campaign and current events, relevant or not. "Thank you for civic commitment in coming here over watching the replay of David Wells's perfect game," Mr. Green told a group of Chelsea Democrats. "I am not throwing a perfect campaign. But it's not a bad campaign." His audience sat silent.
At another stop, Mr. Green told how he began in politics as an intern on Jacob K. Javits's Senate staff in 1968. "Apparently, at that time, an intern program meant something different," Mr. Green said, waiting for laughs. "He didn't lay a hand on me! I swear!"
Even his friends say Mr. Green can sometimes be a bit much; that said, there are indications that that style might be effective. At a candidates' forum the other evening, as Ms. Ferraro waited in the back of the room, Mr. Green made disparaging mention of her as a candidate who "seems to run on the fumes of fame and polls."
Ms. Ferraro was not smiling when she followed him to the lectern. "I just floated in on the fumes of fame and polls and I am delighted to be with you," she said sharply.
In the midst of this, Mr. Green has begun to lay out what he would do in the Senate. "First, I will push for the systematic campaign finance reform to end the Senate for sale," he said. "Second, I want a consumer H.M.O. bill of rights," to protect abuses by health maintenance organizations. His third priority would be the Social Security system for children, which would include increased Federal spending, after-school programs, prenatal care for mothers and universal health care for young people.
The key question is whether Mr. Green can emerge from the primary without being vulnerable to the ideological attacks that have become a staple of Mr. D'Amato's arsenal. Significantly, Mr. Green never uses the word "liberal" when describing himself. Speaking over a cellular telephone from Buffalo, he said he had no doubt that the attacks Mr. D'Amato had used successfully in the past would fail this time, for one reason in particular.
"I've never ever voted for a spending increase and I've never voted for a tax increase," he crackled over the phone. He paused for effect before delivering the political punch line.
"That's because I never voted!" said Mr. Green, who has never served in a legislature. "Arthur Finkelstein is going to have to dig long and deep to have his stale rhetoric stick to me."

Graph: "It's the Busiest Time of the Year"The Memorial Day weekend kicked off the summer vacation season. Things are looking bright. A booming economy has kept occupancy very high and allowed hotels to raise room rates. To keep up with demand, companies are planning to pick up the pace of new hotel development this year and next. Industry analysts believe that while that may ease overcrowding, it will not significantly reduce the price of rooms for travelers.Even though occupancy rates are expected to slip, room rates are rising, leading to a spurt of new hotels. Graph tracks hotel occupancy rate, average daily rate for a hotel room. and hotel rooms being built each year, from 1996 through a projected 2000.(Source: Coopers & Lybrand Lodging Research Network)

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA;
Indian Culture, at Risk at Home, Finds Fans Abroad

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Heilman Brooke 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
While American Indians fear that their languages, songs, dances, arts, crafts, rituals and oral history may not survive the cultural melding of the 21st century, they are finding a growing audience in Europe and Asia.
For instance, this year a Navajo poet will be published in Navajo by an Irish publishing company that will provide English and Gaelic translations. A group of Lakota musicians and storytellers will take tales of Lakota stellar traditions to a Cheshire, England, planetarium. And the Hopi's Nuvatukyaovi Dancers will be the first American Indian dancers ever to perform in Slovenia when they sing and dance in Maribor in early July. 
 In 1995 and 1996, the Navajo's Chinle Valley Singers donned their colorful native dress and sang in Estonia, Finland and the Philippines. In 1996, a Cherokee children's book author and illustrator toured Singapore.
Of course, Buffalo Bill first recognized an international market for the lore of the America Indian in the late 1800's when he took bareback riders and sharpshooters on tour throughout Europe.
Rather than Indian and cowboy showmen, today's Buffalo Bills are more likely to be anthropologists, historical guardians or savvy artists. Many Indian performing artists have begun to establish European contacts and regular European venues, but others have an agent handle details of museum exhibitions, folk festivals, fund-raising and transportation of sacred objects.
Jason Yazzie, economic development specialist for the Navajo nation, said that often "the native dancers are naive about how to market themselves." But the naivete works both ways. Birgil Kills Straight, a Lakota who has lectured in various European universities, said, "They still ask me if Indians wear feathers and live in teepees." Mr. Kills Straight is the executive director of the Oglala Sioux Parks and Recreation Authority and since the 1980's has been helping the Lakota's Takini Dance Group get performance dates in Paris, Geneva, Milan and Marseilles. In 1996 the 10 singers and dancers of the group performed for Prince Rainier in Monaco. This year, the group will perform June 4-12 in Bologna, Italy.
"Our group has always performed right out of the reservation," Mr. Kills Straight said. "We bring onto the stage the genuine moves with very little lighting. We've had great success." Mr. Kills Straight deals with logistics and scheduling.
In general, transporting sacred eagle feathers across international borders has not been a problem, but he said: "In New Zealand they wanted to fumigate my eagle feather. I am always very cautious with our eagle feathers. We regard the eagle feathers as sacred, and before we make a journey and before and after a performance we have our own purification ceremonies. We smudge the feathers with sage."
Burning sage scented the Robert H. Johnson Planetarium in Lakewood, Colo., one evening as Ben Artichoker, Ben Sherman and Jessica Bordeaux-Vigil told Lakota tales of "The Stars, the Black Hills and the Buffalo," a presentation of ancient star knowledge that will be repeated in England this year.
Mr. Sherman is the chairman of the Western American Indian Chamber of Commerce and has traveled to France and Germany with a performing group of Dakota and Lakota, members of the Sioux nation.
"We had a wonderful reception even in Paris, where some seem to despise Americans but seem to love Native Americans," Mr. Sherman said. "Our drum group met several Frenchmen who were fluent in Lakota, but couldn't speak English."
Gordon Bronitsky, a white anthropologist based in Denver, represents Lakota, Hopi, Navajo, Blackfeet, Cherokee, Zuni, Isleta Pueblo, Inuit, Tlingit, even Sami from Finland. Originally from Albuquerque, Dr. Bronitsky was teaching in Frankfurt in the mid-1980's when he noticed German appreciation for American Indians. Later, while teaching at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, he realized "the depth, breadth and variety of Native American talent."
Since 1990, he has been "helping Indians do business overseas," as an agent and grant-proposal writer. Dr. Bronitsky, who has been fondly called in Navajo the "talkative cowboy," has a little gray ponytail and lots of big turquoise-studded Navajo jewelry. He works the phone and a fax from an apartment decorated with Hopi and Apache baskets and Navajo rugs. His German partner, Horst Eilers, is based in Bergamo, Italy, and scouts possible performance sites throughout Europe.
European interest "started with a romanticized vision of Native Americans," Mr. Eilers said. "The conquest of the West has left its impact on Europe." Mr. Eilers said an Italian comic magazine about cowboys and Indians is read by millions, and he wants to build on this interest and bring American Indian artists or even American Indian comic writers to Italy.
Europeans have been intrigued by American Indians since the 1890's, when a German fiction writer, Karl May, who had never met an Indian, began a series of books with characters like Winnetou and the Oil Baron. Mr. May's series never took hold in the United States, which already had its own cowboy and Indian writer, Zane Grey. Today there are Karl May theme parks in Austria and Germany.
The next issue of Capital magazine in Italy is to have a feature on four contemporary American Indian artists. Japan has an Old West village with an Indian theater and facade of a Western town. "Indian Time" is a current French magazine. Nanai-Notes is a Dutch magazine, and there is a Netherlands Action Group on Behalf of American Indians. First Americans Magazine is published in St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Minsk there is a Belorussian American Indian Friendship Society. When William Yazzie, a Navajo flute player and storyteller, performed in Minsk, a group of tall, blond Russian Indian hobbyists put on a powwow in his honor.
Kendrick Coochyamptewa, lead singer with the Nuvatukyaovi Dancers, a traditional Hopi dance group based in Flagstaff, Ariz., said he would leave the United States for the first time when he and the 10 other members of his group go to Slovenia and Italy at the end of June. He said they would be nervous getting on the airplane, but he would be happy to give people an accurate picture. "Native Americans still have a lot of traditions they hold sacred," he said. "People there think we must be wearing moccasins, but a lot of us have Nikes."
William Yazzie, the Navajo flute player from Chinle, Ariz., has been to Belarus, Germany and Greece, thanks to Dr. Bronitsky's initiative. "When I give my presentations," Mr. Yazzie said, "I talk about Navajo life. It is a simple way of life. My message is that the Navajo have a simple respect for nature, and if we all take time to show that simple respect for the earth, maybe the world would be a better place. Then we get the audience to participate, to dance with us in the Round Dance, which is like life: everything goes in a circle."

HEADLINE: THE ARTS IN: El Paso -- Dreams on the Streets of El Paso;
Home-Grown Culture Blooms in a Struggling Border Town

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
The gallery that just opened in the heart of this city's historic downtown has a dreamy, almost flower-child feel to it. Just a few blocks from the Mexican border, it is an artists' collective, with the exhibition space in an old furniture showroom on the ground floor, chaotically messy studios upstairs and a performance area in the basement.
Most of the artists are Hispanic, and they have filled the walls with fresh paintings. They are friendly, stoned-out types ("We smoke a little grass," one of them said with a shrug) who speak earnestly about self-expression, harmony and partying. They are essentially squatters, rent-free occupants of a building that would otherwise be empty, providing a genuine spark of exuberance on a once-bustling commercial strip that has gone seamy and listless, a casualty of the collapse of the peso. Almost as a bonus, not all the art is terrible. 
 "For now, we're here on the benevolence of the owner," said Gilbert Sanchez Lujan, a Chicano artist who goes by the name Magu and, at 57, is the oldest member of the collective and the most aware of the economic realities it faces. "But eventually we need $73,000 a month to operate this place, and these guys, they want to be anarchists. I mean, I do, too. That's what artists are. But it's not realistic. I know we can do something here, and I'm frustrated, because I see a lot of potential."
And so the new gallery, known as the Alternative Ark, sits here like a daisy placed in a gun barrel, unrealistically abloom in an unnatural environment and perhaps unlikely to survive but indisputably a good idea.
Which is not a bad metaphor for the arts overall in a city as poor and remote as this one, where they endure rather nobly in a kind of vacuum. It is a place, for example, where the city is building a new art museum and trying to develop its own arts and entertainment district.
Yet it is also a place where the local symphony orchestra is often featured on National Public Radio, but where few if any of its players make a living as musicians.
"I have an evangelistic spirit, but it's been tempered by reality," said Kwang-Wu Kim, who gave up a career as a concert pianist in Baltimore five years ago to run El Paso Pro Musica, an organization that presents chamber music events and runs introductory music programs in elementary schools. "A lot of people will never be interested. You make things accessible and count your successes one person at a time."
For another example, the city has a long tradition of muralistas; walls throughout the city are skillfully painted with the iconography of Mexican and Southwestern culture. But sadly, this draws attention to a dearth of conventional spaces for artists to show their work. The city's galleries can be counted almost on one hand. "We have no constituency," said Mr. Lujan. "We're not Houston, not Santa Fe, not L.A. There aren't any art buyers here."
And yet painters and sculptors are plentiful; among the best known are Tom Lea, now in his 90's, whose paintings (and writings, as a journalist and novelist), focused on the Southwest during the middle of the century; Luis Jiminez, whose fiberglass sculpture of alligators crawling over one another is a much beloved downtown landmark, and James Drake, whose work concentrates on the violation of Hispanic culture by modern industry here.
 
Always Struck By the Light
Perhaps most eccentrically, there is James Magee, who creates abstract sculptures from industrial bric-a-brac, but who also paints, in expressionist style, Southwestern land and skyscapes, under the name of Annabel Livermore.
Mr. Magee, who once lived in a junkyard beneath the Bayonne Bridge on Staten Island, sounds more like Annabel when he speaks of the appeal of El Paso.
"One of its most interesting aspects is the light," he said. "The aridity of the air. I'm always struck by how harsh and crisp the light is."
Annabelle, who Mr. Magee considers to have her own identity -- "Alter ego is a term that doesn't explain her," he said -- also has her own following. Sales of her work are brisk, much brisker than Mr. Magee's, said his local dealer, Adair Margo.
Writers also abound; the literary history of the region is strong. William Carlos Williams visited and was inspired to write "The Desert Music," a long narrative poem that begins with his encountering a huddled body on the bridge to Mexico and uses a day in El Paso to examine the mind of a poet. The novelist John Rechy grew up in El Paso; his novel "City of Night" begins here. Jack Kerouac wrote about El Paso; so did Carlos Fuentes, in "The Old Gringo." Since 1985, there has been a small publisher here, Cinco Puntos Press, run by two writers, Bobby Byrd and Lee Merrill Byrd, out of their home.
Even so, the literary community is fragmented. Writers don't seem to have the inclination, or the place, to come together. The reclusiveness of Cormac McCarthy, the reigning local literary celebrity, is a bit of an exasperation to many of his colleagues. "Cormac? He hangs out with golfers, not writers," is a frequently heard sentiment. No one expected him to respond to an interview request, and he didn't.
 
'We're Kidding Ourselves'
More striking, there is not a single independent bookstore here, astounding in a city of some 600,000 people.
"We're kidding ourselves if we think we're affecting the city in any way," said Abraham Verghese, a doctor and the author of "My Own Country," about his experience treating AIDS patients in rural Tennessee, who came to El Paso in 1991. His forthcoming book, "The Tennis Partner," about a drug-addicted colleague, is set here. "People are much more aware of me as a doctor than as a writer," he said.
El Paso is a sprawling city, having nearly doubled in size since 1970, expanding some 20 miles to the east from its downtown, past the Franklin Mountains, which now split the city like a great spine and glow red at sunset. Surrounded by high desert, it is isolated from the other big cities in Texas, more than 500 miles from San Antonio and Dallas, almost 700 from Houston; El Paso is in a different time zone.
Indeed, one interesting paradox seems to be that much of what makes the city appealing to artists as a subject is also what makes it a struggle for them to be heard: it's off on its own, a long way from the mainstream culture circuit. That's one reason it exports talent. Theater companies struggle here; they could use the hometown actors F. Murray Abraham and Judith Ivey, who left long ago.
It doesn't help that El Paso is one of the poorest and most undereducated cities in the United States. Unemployment hovers at about 11 percent, and nearly 20 percent of the population has not completed the ninth grade.
"There has always been an interest here, but there is not a lot of cash flowing for entertainment," said Alejandrina Drew, the director of the city's Arts Resources Department, most of whose $500,000 annual budget is allotted for presenting performances in the city. That's unusual, a city government in the business of producing shows, which it does for reasonable prices. But it focuses on bringing in performers from out of town -- the Missoula Children's Theater, the performance artist and director Ping Chon and and the Cuban guitarist Manuel Barrueco have all been here this year -- an acknowledgment that mainstream culture exists elsewhere and must be imported.
Still, it's a rich social fabric, unusual and complex. Just to the south across the Rio Grande, walkable for dinner from downtown, is Ciudad Juarez, a Mexican city of 1.5 million, which has far more of an effect on the identity of El Paso, whose population is 70 percent Hispanic. The border, with its issues of immigration, drugs, language and dual cultures, tends to dominate the local discourse, which has been especially volatile lately. On April 20, El Paso celebrated the 400th anniversary of the discovery of El Paso del Norte, the north pass across the Rio Grande, by the Spanish explorer Don Juan de Onate.
 
'The Idea Of a Border'
"For a lot of people, the place right before you fall off the earth is El Paso, but I don't think that," said Benjamin Alire Saenz, a Chicano novelist and poet. Much to his displeasure, he is the only Hispanic faculty member in the 33-member English department of the University of Texas at El Paso. "It's not marginal. This is a real cultural center for me. I like the idea of a border, and what it does to one's identity. Borders give you the opportunity to critique the very idea of nationalism."
For American travelers, El Paso has tended to be little more than a place to refuel or sleep between distant stations, a situation the city is trying to address with a redevelopment project just west of downtown focusing, as in many other cities, on arts and entertainment. Located alongside the city's convention center and its science museum, the project, called Union Plaza, is to revamp several square blocks of abandoned storehouses into a neighborhood of restaurants and nonfranchise entertainment spots.
"We can't generate the numbers for a Hard Rock, or anything like that," said Christopher Allen Peck of the Goodman Corporation, a Houston-based consultancy that is overseeing the downtown development project. "But there are 48 million cars that pass through El Paso on I-10 every year, and the bulk of them never stop. We want to give them a destination."
Toward that end, the city has also spent $8 million for a new building on the foundation of the old Greyhound Bus Terminal downtown to house the El Paso Museum of Art; it is scheduled to open in July, enabling the museum to show off more of its recent acquisitions in modern and contemporary art of the region. It's a project with optimism behind it.
"We want people to see what the artists of this region think about it," said Becky Duval Reese, who as the museum director since 1991 has been transforming it from a stodgy, elitist institution to a more accessible one. "This is a place unique to itself. It's not really Texas. It's not New Mexico. It's not Mexico. It's truly bicultural and bilingual. And it's like a frontier. Anything's open. You don't have the New York or L.A. attitude of 'It's been done,' or 'It won't work.' "
Indeed, the artists of El Paso tend to see the city as, pardon the expression, a blank canvas.
"The community just has so many needs that you can do anything," said Mr. Kim, the pianist, after teaching a class for elementary school students. "This is a harsh testing ground for artists, but the spirit is here."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
Languedoc Succeeds by Switching from Quantity to Quality

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE Languedoc, a vast scimitar-shaped region that sweeps from the Rhone almost to the Spanish border, is France's oldest, largest and most troublesome wine-producing area. The vines reach from Montpellier in the east through the ancient Roman city of Narbonne, northwest to Carcassonne and south to Perpignan and the foothills of the Pyrenees.
Almost a third of France's vineyards are in the Languedoc, and not too long ago there were many more. The region was called France's wine reservoir: quantity was the hallmark, quality was inconsequential. In fact, much of the Languedoc's wine was vile stuff. 
 In the first edition of his "World Atlas of Wine," published in 1971, Hugh Johnson wrote off the Languedoc this way: "It is the home of vin ordinaire, mainly red, of low strength and no character, which is usually built up with stronger imported wine to be sold as the everyday drink of the French workman."
As much of France moved into the middle class in the years after World War II, the taste -- indeed, the need -- for immense quantities of cheap red wine diminished drastically. But the conservative and politically powerful farmers of the south refused to change. Year after year, as wine-drinking habits changed throughout France, the Government continued to subsidize the production of millions of gallons of unsalable wine, only then to distill it into equally unneeded commercial alcohol.
While meridional France clung grimly to the old ways, the rest of the wine world was changing rapidly. Led by the United States, winemakers from Australia to South Africa were learning how to produce light, fresh, delicious wines that put to shame the cheap wines of the Languedoc, which were based on the carignane and aramon grapes.
In the late 1970's and early 80's, the picture began to change. The European Economic Community, now the European Union, did not look kindly on France's recurring price-supported wine surpluses, and from 1976 to 1984, 74,000 acres of indifferent wine grapes were uprooted. A new generation of growers and winemakers, many of them university trained, had learned the benefits of modernization.
Overcoming the traditional preference for regional names for their wines -- Fitou, Minervois, Corbieres -- the winemakers of the Languedoc and neighboring Roussillon plunged into the world of varietals, which are wines named for the grape from which they were made.
Slowly at first, the world became aware of these new wines -- chardonnays, merlots, cabernet sauvignons and others -- from this arid, desert-like region. By the late 80's, names like Les Jamelles and Val d'Orbieu began to appear in wine shops around the globe. By 1995, the biggest producer of these new varietals, Fortant de France, based in Sete, was turning out 35 million bottles a year. The Languedoc, once written off as a serious wine-producing region, had bounced back.
Significantly, the market for these wines was almost all export. The French had yet to put aside their preference for geographical and proprietary names. Chateau Lafite-Rothschild would never be called a cabernet-merlot blend; no waiter would ever refer to a Batard-Montrachet as a top-quality chardonnay.
Fortunately for French wine lovers, and ultimately for the rest of us, a separate trend began to develop in the Languedoc and Roussillon about the same time that the new varietals were beginning to appear: the production of top-quality wines named proudly for the region and often the estate where they were made.
In bringing modern viticultural and winemaking techniques to the region, French experts discovered what some of the local producers had known all along: that the Languedoc had the weather and the soil to produce great wines. To encourage fine-wine development and to tempt the local growers with better income from their land, the Government began in the 1980's to upgrade a number of Languedoc districts by granting them Appellation Controlee status, recognizing their commitment to lower yields in the vineyards and better winemaking techniques. Previously, the best that most Languedoc vineyards could hope for was the lowly rating of Vin de Table, or table wine. Appellation Controlee status tells the world that the wine is well made and is worth more money. Even so, these wines are bargains; almost all sell for $10 or less.
Even as these inexpensive varietals were making their mark, the traditional grapes of the fine wines of the Rhone -- syrah, mourvedre and grenache -- began to appear in a new group of higher-quality Languedoc wines, some of which have achieved recognition beyond France. Some are estate wines like the best of Bordeaux and Burgundy. In 1970, Mas de Daumas Gassac became one of the first producers to lead the fight to raise the reputation of the Languedoc wines. These new wines can reach $30 a bottle.
Pic St.-Loup, a community southwest of the old Roman city of Nimes, is producing exceptional wines from traditional Rhone grapes. The Pic St.-Loup from the Chateau La Roque is a worthy example of what can happen when syrah, mourvedre and grenache are skillfully blended. The wines of the Domaine St. Martin de la Garrigue, another estate, can be outstanding, too. The Domaine's Cuvee St. Martin, a syrah-mourvedre blend, is an attractive example of the good things happening in this once forlorn wine region.
 
Tastings
A Dijon Clone
Millbrook Vineyards Pinot Noir Grand Reserve, California central coast. About $24.
 
NO, it's not a misprint; Millbrook Vineyards is indeed in Millbrook, N.Y., and this wine comes from California. Well, if the shoe business can be globalized, why not wine? John Dyson, the founder and owner of Millbrook, has branched out to California and Italy, and this wine is a result of that expansion.
May his other adventures away from home be as successful. Clone talk is all the rage, especially when the conversation is about wine from Burgundy. This California wine was made from grapes known as Dijon clones. Dijon, as in Burgundy. They are said to be more flavorful than the usual American pinot noir clones, mostly because the yield -- the amount of grapes produced by each vine -- is lower. Whatever the reason, the end result here is a top quality, quite Burgundian pinot noir. The fruit is intense, and the oak, for a change, is helpful rather than intrusive.

HEADLINE: RETRO IN NEW YORK;
Rusty, Maybe, but Not Forsaken

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
WHAT with all the seductive new kitchen equipment on the market these days, it's a miracle anything old survives. But some things do -- or should -- because they're just better, no matter what Madison Avenue says.
I have my own aging favorites. The omelet pan and the crepe pan -- the black steel models, uncorrupted by modern nonstick surfaces -- have always been with me. Then there are the kitchen tools that I gave up on too soon and sent to the basement mortuary, only to rescue them when I realized the error of my ways. 
 The Foley food mill was the first piece of retro equipment to regain my ardor. There is nothing like it for making mashed potatoes, pureeing the vegetables for a soup or turning apples into applesauce. The mill is a bowl-shaped device, with a crank-operated handle that pushes the food through the holes in the bottom of the bowl.
Probably everyone tried to make mashed potatoes in a food processor when it first came out. But after two attempts I gave up and dug out the food mill. Potatoes and food processors are not made for each other, unless you want to serve library paste. A food mill delivers mashed potatoes with the kind of coarse texture and hominess craved by just about everybody, even the most accomplished chefs.
So I'm back to making terrific, soul-satisfying mashed potatoes (skins on or off) with buttermilk and garlic instead of butter and cream, and that food mill is earning its keep.
Fortunately, food mills, even if neglected by most home cooks, are still being produced. My old rusty version has only one bottom. The modern Italian and French versions have three bottoms, each with different size holes. And they do not rust because they are stainless-steel.
Steven Bridge at Bridge Kitchenware, 214 East 52d Street in Manhattan, which caters to both home and professional cooks, recommends the Italian version for home cooks because, at $35, it is less expensive than the slightly larger French model for $110.
The fact that my pressure cooker was still in the basement not too long ago had nothing to do with my mother's experience, when the lid blew off and the contents deposited themselves on the newly painted walls and ceiling. No. The pressure cooker had been relegated to the basement because most meals I put together just don't require long cooking. But mine has found a new home in Santiago de Compostelo, Spain, where my son, Michael, has a restaurant. He uses it for stocks and beans. "I couldn't live without it," he said the other day.
In a pressure cooker the heat builds up much more than it can in an ordinary pot. So you can achieve the moist, tenderizing cooking required for, say, a stew without spending hours at it.
Carolynn Bridge, Steven's mother and the widow of the founder of Bridge Kitchenware, has seen kitchen tools come and go for decades: she is also a home economist, trained in the Betty Crocker kitchens. Mrs. Bridge knows what deserves to be in use today, old-fashioned or not. She can't live without her pressure cooker, either. She particularly likes it for soups, which, she said, she can prepare in 40 minutes instead of the hours they usually take her.
"I've used a pressure cooker since I was 10," Mrs. Bridge said.
Like the food mill, there are refined new versions of pressure cookers. Today's models, made of stainless steel instead of aluminum, are not as likely to explode because of their modern safety valves. And Mrs. Bridge prefers the stainless steel, she said, because it is a nonreactive metal.
When my son took my old pressure cooker, he paid for it in the perfect currency: his high-carbon-steel knives, the sort I gave up years ago for stainless steel. The stainless seemed so much better. No rust. But for a really sharp edge nothing beats an old-fashioned high-carbon-steel knife, and I'm using one again. Chefs, who value sharpness over convenience, often prefer them, too. So if you have any rusting away in a drawer, think about resurrecting them. Or buying them in a shop catering to restaurants. They do need to be sharpened more often, and they can't be left in the sink overnight.
It is also worth learning how to use a sharpening steel and a stone, no matter what kind of knife you use. Very retro but really quick. Now, my electric knife sharpener has become obsolete after I rediscovered the old steel my stepfather taught me how to use. It is so much faster.
For slicing, Mr. Bridge swears by his old French mandoline made by Bron. The food processor, which promised to do everything, and does quite a bit, cannot do many things as well as a mandoline can, like slicing and creating julienne strips. Mr. Bridge admits the Bron is intimidating, especially since it doesn't come with instructions. But another French company, Mafer, is now making a $140 version with instructions, which he recommends for the home cook.
If you don't want to spend that much, he recommends the poor man's mandoline, the Feemster, a $9.90 gadget that can slice ingredients thick or thin. "I love it," Mr. Bridge said, even though it once sliced off the tip of his finger. "It's very sharp and does a great job, and it isn't as technical as a mandoline. We've had it about 35 years."
Marion Cunningham, a longtime food authority who made her name revising the Fannie Farmer cookbooks and who values the tools of the past, agrees that a food processor isn't the be-all and end-all. She is putting the finishing touches to a book based on her cooking classes for adults, "Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham," to be published by Knopf. In her classes she insists her students learn to use a mezzaluna, the two-handled half-moon-shaped chopping blade. "I want them to know there are other things besides a food processor," she said.
In her own kitchen, a flour sifter is indispensable, instructions on flour bags to the contrary. "I frankly think that despite what the bags say, for something very delicate you have to sift the flour," she said.
But for the essence of retro, nothing beats the electric knife. I didn't know they were still making them but found four brands at Zabar's. Mine is long gone, so I bought one last week after seeing it recommended in recent newspaper and magazine articles. I brought it to the office to try out on a few foods never associated with an electric knife in the 1960's. Colleagues gathered around. Everyone had fond memories. One remembered how important it was to her father, who was a master carver of roast beef and turkey. Another said it had been the wedding gift of choice when she was married in the late 1960's.
Today Daniel Boulud of Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan swears by it for roasts with crusts and for terrines. An article in the June Gourmet magazine suggests an electric knife for a meringue ice cream cake. I tried it for a foie gras mousse and a coarse pate. The results: excellent, smooth slices. Then on a fruit tart with a butter crust. Just fair, but better than a sharp knife when I used it to cut the crust. And finally on flaky puff pastry, which tends to send crumbs flying when cut. There were many fewer crumbs with the electric knife.
Would I go out and buy an electric knife for my home? Probably not. But if I still had one in my basement, I'd sure consider bringing it upstairs.
 
BASIL-GARLIC MASHED POTATOES
Time:20 minutes

 2 pounds scrubbed, unpeeled thin skinned potatoes (Yukon golds if possible). sliced 1/4 inch thick
 3 large cloves garlic
 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
 1 cup or more lowfat or nonfat buttermilk
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

 1. Cook the potato slices and garlic in water to cover until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
 2. Mash, peel and all, in a food mill. (The little bit of skin that goes through is not a problem.). Stir in the basil and buttermilk to a creamy consistency; season with salt and pepper.
 Note: If it is necessary to reheat potatoes, cover and reheat in microwave oven. If potatoes become too dry, add a little more buttermilk.
 Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

HEADLINE: Taming Little Tyrants

BYLINE: By Mary Ann Cantwell; Mary Ann Cantwell is the author of "Homosexuality: The Secret a Child Dare Not Tell."

DATELINE: SEBASTOPOL, Calif.

 BODY:
For some years there has been conflict between older women who were stay-at-home moms and their career daughters and sons about the rearing of their children. I, along with several other grandmothers of my acquaintance, believe that children today are being indulged.
When we see these parents cater to their children -- letting them interrupt any conversation at will -- we view it as a criticism of our own mothering. We wonder what was wrong with the way we did it. Aren't our daughters smart, successful women who exhibit common sense? Aren't our sons decisive men? 
 We agree that it's a good idea to avoid spanking, but we would like to keep it as a sanction. The parent must run the show. That is what we grandmothers don't see happening.
We can't go backward to a time before economic necessity dictated two incomes per family, but we must go forward, away from these tiny tyrants. The conflict is no longer just familial.
Public Agenda, a research group, recently published a report called "Kids These Days: What Americans Really Think About the Next Generation." The answer seemed to be: not much. Younger children, ages 5 to 12, were seen by adults as acquisitive, lazy and demonstrating a lack of respect. "Only 37 percent of Americans believe that when today's children grow up, they will make this country a better place," the report said in bold print.
Another sign that the conflict is going public comes from two news items about children who were arrested in incidents that the family would traditionally have handled. In Pensacola, Fla., a 5-year-old girl was charged with assaulting a school counselor. In Miami, a 10-year-old boy in a pizza shop was arrested after he kicked his mother and a waitress called the police.
The father of the 5-year-old pointed out that officials might have sought another solution before resorting to arrest. Still, the parents' reactions were telling. In their anger at the authorities, they seemed to have forgotten to save some of their ire for their abusive children, whom they staunchly defended as they sprang them from juvenile detention.
Another crotchety grandmother and I were having coffee the other day when she quoted her career daughter as approving of kindergarten because it provided structure for her child. "Doesn't she realize," I asked, "that the teacher is earning the girl's respect, while the parents are not?"
Then I had a moment of clarity. It was not that we were overly strict mothers. We were full-time mothers. The buck stopped with us. Whatever we allowed, we had to endure. I remarked to my friend that today's parents couldn't stand to be around their toddlers 24 hours a day.
"If they had them all day," my friend said, "you can bet they'd have a firm bedtime."
I'd like to suggest a disciplinary experiment short of arrest. Let one parent and a child spend, say, five days in a small structure or apartment that contains all the necessities of life but few diversions. Books, certainly. Let them get to know each other. A one-way mirror might be useful. I'd like to watch.
I don't think there's much chance of a parent feigning control of the child to secure early release. They're too oblivious -- parents are often unaware of what their children are perpetrating on them. But maybe, given enough time, they would learn how pleasant and rewarding it is to be the parent of a well-behaved child.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Down Slightly; Consumer Confidence Slips

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Two economic indicators released today suggested that the economy might be throttling back from the pace it reached earlier this year. Sales of previously owned homes fell in April, while consumer confidence edged lower this month.
Sales of existing homes in the United States declined 2.5 percent to an annual rate of 4.77 million units last month, according to the National Association of Realtors. And the Conference Board said consumer confidence declined to 135.2 in May from 137.2 a month ago. 
 "The economy is cooling off in the second quarter," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
While both economic indicators declined, they stayed close to historic highs. Home resales for April receded from a record annual rate of 4.89 million units in March, and matched the level of sales set in February. The May confidence index was just below February's 30-year high of 137.4.
That suggests the economy is still expanding, though at a pace below the first quarter's 4.2 percent annual rate, the fastest in a year. Mr. Thayer expects growth to slow to 2 percent in the second quarter.
The Conference Board's index, which gauges consumer expectations for the next six months, fell to 112 in May from 115.8 in April, while the index tracking assessment of present conditions rose to 170 this month from a revised 169.3 last month.
And so far this month, consumers appear to be making their way to the stores at a slower pace than they did in April, according to weekly industry reports. In the first two weeks of May, sales at stores open at least a year fell three-tenths of a percent from the pervious month, according to LJR Redbook Research.
Home resales declined in three regions in April. In the West, existing home sales rose 1 percent, while resales fell 2.4 percent in the Midwest, 4.2 percent in the South and 4.1 percent in the Northeast.

Signs of Economic Slowdown Help Aid Treasury Price Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rallied yesterday, spurred by a strong dollar and signs that the economy may be slowing, thus easing the threat of inflation. The slumping stock market also created strong demand for short-term Treasuries.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 31/32 , to 104 2/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.83 percent from 5.90 percent on Friday and was the lowest in more than a month. For investors, the gains amounted to nearly $10 per $1,000 invested in bonds. 
 The Conference Board's report on consumer confidence in May gave investors some relief. The confidence index declined to 135.2 from a revised 137.2 in April. Sales of existing homes in April fell 2.5 percent to a rate of 4.77 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts said both reports came in close to expectations.
Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said yesterday's rally was also fueled by rumors from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin would support a sharply higher value for the dollar versus the yen. "As these stories circulated, the dollar reached nearly a seven-year high against the yen and thereby produced renewed foreign interest in the U.S. credit markets," Mr. Chan said. A strong dollar makes United States dollar denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive because of the higher rates and the potential gains from currency translation.
The regular weekly bill auction, which was conducted yesterday because Monday was Memorial Day, went well, but there were fewer bids than had been expected.
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares Slide on Concerns About Valuation and Profits

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A growing fear among investors that stocks may be overvalued and that corporate earnings growth may be stalling sent equities tumbling for a third day, as all major market gauges lost more than 1 percent of their value yesterday.
The sharp declines in stocks contrasted with a rally in the bond market that was fueled by waning inflation fears. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.83 percent, its lowest level since mid-April. 
 A rise in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen also helped increase the attractiveness of bonds to foreign investors.
Stock prices opened higher, climbing as much as 54 points, before meandering lower through the rest of the session. A number of computer-generated sell programs heightened the losses, lopping more than 149 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. In fact, in the final hour of trading, the computer programs chopped more than 107 points off the blue-chip index.
The Dow closed down 150.71 points, or 1.65 percent, to 8,963.73.
Yesterday's decline in the Dow was the largest since Jan. 9, when the index fell 222.20 points. It eclipsed a 146.98-point drop in late April, which was spurred by concerns that the Federal Reserve was inclined to raise short-term interest rates to curb economic growth.
While an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve is no longer anticipated anytime soon, there are fears that economic growth is slowing significantly with no catalyst in sight to justify pushing stock prices above current levels.
"The U.S. economy is doing just what we hoped it would do -- slow," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "There are growing concerns about the economy and earnings, and that there aren't strong enough earnings to support stocks."
Yesterday's downturn was fueled in part by economic reports showing a decline in the sales of existing homes in April and a May drop in consumer sentiment, which had been holding near 30-year highs.
Although analysts have been cautioning that stocks have been overvalued for some time, they have also pointed to continued strong consumer confidence and spending as a catalyst that could help sustain high stock prices.
Analysts also pointed to renewed concerns about the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific region and its impact on American companies and the economy, in part illustrated by last week's report of a $13 billion United States trade deficit in March, a six-year high.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.45 points, or 1.48 percent, to 1,094.02. The Nasdaq composite index lost 26.91 points, to 1,778.09, a 1.49 percent decline.
While most analysts are not forecasting the end of the bull market, many think that a pullback in stock prices is warranted in the near term.
Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Rauscher, thinks the Dow could fall to anywhere from 8,500 to 8,000 in the next three to six months before moving higher again.
"I don't think this is all we're going to get," Mr. Dickey said of recent market declines, adding that the full impact of Asia's crisis has not been felt by American corporations.
Yesterday, Barton M. Biggs, global equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, reduced his recommended investor allocation of stocks to 48 percent of investments from 51 percent. He recommended selling domestic stocks and those of emerging markets, and holding onto cash, which he believes should be at 5 percent of assets, up from 2 percent.
"The tone of equity markets around the world is deteriorating," he said. "After so many false alarms, a serious decline finally could be coming."

HEADLINE: Business Travel: Road Warriors Losing Options;
Corporate Ire Rises Along With Business Air Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Corporate air travel is no longer the land of the blank check.
Seagram sometimes suggests that employees headed for San Francisco fly instead to San Jose, Calif., then make the hour-plus drive north, saving hundreds of dollars on fares. 
 Bell Atlantic, rebelling at the high fares out of Charleston, W. Va., where it has a local headquarters, often charters a small plane to Washington or other cities.
Dresser Industries has been known to chauffeur London-bound employees from its upstate New York plant two hours to Toronto, to save about $1,000 a ticket.
And when the trip is a short one -- say, four or five hours by car -- Dresser, Bell Atlantic and many other companies are urging employees to drive, not fly.
In short, corporate America has grown increasingly irritated by steadily rising business air fares, especially to smaller cities. In response, companies are giving more and more of their employees less and less choice and flexibility in making travel arrangements.
Many companies, in fact, dictate not only what airlines employees can fly on -- if they let them fly at all -- but also what hotels and rental car companies they must use. And video conferences are more often pushed as an alternative to a trip.
Some employees resist switching from a favorite airline or hotel, but companies are making that harder. "If they still insist on traveling out of policy," said Bob Grant, who runs the travel program at Charles Schwab & Company, "they have to go to the executive vice president for approval. That usually convinces them they don't want to do it."
Over the years, companies have repeatedly tried to hold down travel costs, particularly when profits and the economy are weak. The difference in the crackdown this time is the unusual lengths companies are going to and the fact that it is being done in the midst of a roaring economy. Business travel amounted to an estimated $156 billion last year, according to American Express.
An indication of companies' determination can be gleaned from a survey released this month by the National Business Travel Association, whose 1,200 travel manager members booked $21 billion in air fares last year and $29 billion in other travel expenses.
Through March of this year, 62 percent of member companies reported using lower-priced advance-purchase fares, compared with 45 percent in 1996; 54 percent said they had increased their use of low-cost carriers, up from 30 percent in 1996; 52 percent reported using video conferences, up from 27 percent, and 54 percent have reduced the number of employees on a trip, up from 36.5 percent in 1996.
In addition, Topaz International, a Portland, Ore., company that audits fares, said that lower air fares negotiated by corporations soared to 56.9 percent through last year, up from 42.5 percent in 1994. And more than a third of those fares represented lower-cost nonrefundable tickets, more than double the percentage three years earlier.
"This indicates a very heightened sense of how businesses are trying to contain costs by changing travel behavior and travel patterns," said Valerie Estep, the president of Topaz.
While air fares are usually the biggest single travel expense, other costs add up. "On the average four- or five-day trip to New York, for example, where rooms can easily cost $250 a night, hotel costs will be about the same as air fares," said Earl S. Foster, director of global travel management at Seagram. "That's why you have to manage the whole trip."
For Seagram and other companies, that also means limiting the number of employees allowed to attend particular meetings, sometimes by substituting video and audio conferences.
Even top managers are affected. Presidents or chief executives are allowed to fly first class at 39 percent of companies that normally decree coach-class seating, according to a survey compiled this month by the Bureau of National Affairs, a Washington research firm. But at many companies, no one is allowed to fly first class. Even Charles Schwab, the financial company's founder, rarely flies first class, although he has access to a corporate jet.
Of course, airlines are so eager to please business travelers that whenever possible they upgrade them, or give them aisle seats and keep the middle seat empty, or provide better service.
For companies, an important part of the calculation is the bulk discounts that can be negotiated. These depend on how many airline seats or hotel rooms they deliver, and for some the savings easily run into seven figures. And Mr. Grant of Schwab, for one, insists that employees do not feel the pinch.
"By using five airlines whose routes don't overlap, one rental car company and 71 hotels instead of the 1,500 we used to have," he said, "we saved $1.9 million last year. That's cash to the bottom line. And we achieved it without sacrificing the comfort, care or security of our travelers."
Schwab's air fare costs have plummeted from 41 cents a mile in 1995 to 21 cents last year, Mr. Grant said, compared with an industry average of 34 cents.
Corporations clearly want to put pressure on airlines to holding back on further increases in business fares, which, even adjusted for inflation, have risen by 22 percent since 1992.
Company travel managers, however, recognize that the airlines, after losing $14 billion from 1990 to 1994, are trying to chalk up healthy profits while they can. The travel managers are understanding, but only to a point. "It's in everybody's best interest to have a healthy transportation system," said Will Tate, the travel manager of Dresser Industries, of Dallas. "But there comes a time when no matter how much you sympathize with the airlines and wish them well, you have to say, wait a minute."
That is exactly what companies are doing, as can be seen in the push to drive, not fly. "We've done some studies that show it's not only cheaper to drive to some of those cities," said Bob McGurk, vice president for business development at Rosenbluth International, "it's also faster when you add getting to and from the airport, checking in and all the rest of it."
Bell Atlantic also authorizes its travelers who stay with friends or family, instead of in a hotel, to give their host a gift equivalent to the amount of money they would spend on meals in a single day.
And instead of paying some $700 for employees at its plant in Alexandria, La., to fly round trip to Houston, Bell Atlantic asks them to drive, which take four and a half hours each way.
Republic National Bank asks overseas-bound employees to combine journeys where possible -- for example, visit Singapore and Hong Kong on the same trip, instead of two. And on flights between New York and Miami, it asks employees to consider landing at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., if and when fares are cheaper, as they often are depending on the day and the time of day, and driving the remaining 25 miles.
"Our goal is to get as close to 100 percent of maximum return on our travel investment," said Andrew W. Menkes, vice president of Republic National's for global travel, "which means no wasted trips and no unnecessary expenditures."
Like most companies, Seagram and Schwab prefer to save money whenever it is cost effective to do so. By flying on transcontinental flights that make a stop between Washington and San Francisco, rather than using nonstop flights, Mr. Foster said, Seagram employees save the company a bundle. Schwab employees save about $1,000 on round trips between San Francisco and Denver by flying on Frontier Airlines, instead of on a major carrier.
And when Seagram employees have to fly to London, then Brussels and Madrid, they are asked to rejigger their schedules, if possible, to avoid flying to London first, thus avoiding the high cost of flying directly to Heathrow airport.
Employees of Mariner Health, a Connecticut-based company that provides health-care services in many states, often use nonrefundable airline tickets. "Even when we have to pay the $75 penalty for changing the itinerary, we save money," said Lou Togneri, its travel manager. Moreover, ever since Southwest Airlines moved into Eastern markets like Providence, R.I., Baltimore and Nashville, Mariner has been booking its employees on that low-cost carrier, raising its overall flights on Southwest to 16 percent from 10 percent in the past year. It also uses Nashville-based Corporate Airlines, whose 19-seat planes fly six daily nonstop flights between Nashville and Atlanta.
Although Seagram presents the revamped London itinerary and the San Jose option as suggestions, not decrees, most employees choose them -- in no small part, obviously, so as not to displease superiors. But they also do so because managers at Seagram, as at other companies, increasingly use seminars, internal electronic communications, newsletters and similar presentations to show the savings in dollars and cents.
While companies can be expected to fine tune or even loosen various aspects of this or that policy, travel managers say, the potential to hold down costs just about insures that limits on corporate travel are here to stay. And while only bigger companies have the clout to barter for discounts, many small companies are also becoming creative at the travel game.
Richard J. Keating, president of Keating Communications, a New York public relations firm, always has his travel agent tell him the different fares for different times of day. He learned, for instance, that it would cost about $700 for a round-trip flight to Atlanta departing at 7:30 A.M., but only about $300 if he left two hours later. "Since my client reimburses our expenses," Mr. Keating said, "I gave him the choice of what flight he wanted me on, and he chose the later one."
Mr. Keating also recently gave three associates who are scheduled to fly to Los Angeles with him next month the choice of flying on an unrestricted coach ticket or on an advance-purchase fare that costs about half as much but requires a Saturday stay. If they chose the cheaper fare, he told them, they could bring their spouses. All three took him up on it.

Selling in China: A Smile, a Shoeshine and a Scam

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: WUHAN, China

 BODY:
Door-to-door sales networks can seem dangerously intriguing to people still gullible about tales of easy money, so when a craze for selling ankle massage machines hit this city early this year, it spelled trouble.
Many thousands of wide-eyed men and women clamored for a chance to sell, convinced that it was the road to riches. They were willing to pay up to $500, almost a year's salary for most urban workers, just for the right to cart an ankle massager door-to-door. 
 But the frenzy for selling was limited, it turned out, to selling. Few people wanted to buy. And no wonder: anyone who looked closely could see that the ankle massager does not really massage the ankle at all. It simply shakes it back and forth.
"I lost my own money, my wife's money, my parents' money, my brother's money, my friends' money," said Fu Yanbing, who borrowed from so many to buy a small truckload of ankle massagers. "My wife says I have a year to pay it all back or she wants a divorce."
Door-to-door sales captured, and destroyed, the hopes and dreams of millions of people across China, sketching a painful episode in this nation's elaborate move from a planned to a market economy.
In April, citing a rash of fly-by-night operations like the one that tricked Mr. Fu, the Chinese Government banned all door-to-door selling, or direct sales. When the announcement was made, managers at many of those companies closed shop and fled, provoking riots in Wuhan and other cities where salespeople were unable to return unsold goods.
The ban has been a disaster for American companies like Amway, Avon Products and Mary Kay, which have spent heavily trying to apply a direct sales formula for soap, cosmetics and other products in China's vast market. Suddenly their prospects look very dim.
The ban was intended to clamp down on illegitimate sales operations, many of them run by local Chinese and Taiwanese businessmen, which played shamelessly on the naive aspirations of a people still emerging from poverty and not yet wise to the dark side of capitalism.
"Do you want to get rich? To afford a mistress? To own a villa?" cried one local newspaper advertisement in Guangdong Province, trying to attract sales personnel.
Yet the ban has also deprived millions of legitimate work. Tens of millions of urban workers in China are already unemployed, and many of those who went into direct sales had lost a job in a state-run enterprise.
Officially, more than 1,500 direct-sales companies employed 2.6 million people, though many more unregistered companies operated as well.
For a direct-sales giant like Amway, it has been a lesson in the utter unpredictability of doing business in China. Amway has invested more than $100 million since it came to China in 1995, and it was careful to secure official approval while building a network of 80,000 distributors, or people selling door-to-door full-time. In 1997, Amway sold $178 million of personal care products.
Chinese officials met extensively with Amway executives in Beijing recently, insisting that Amway shift its sales from the street into stores. Amway executives say they are committed to staying in China but want to try to avoid sacrificing their core sales method.
"We realize the Chinese have concerns," said Richard Holwill, Amway's director of international affairs, based in Washington. "But we have a basic bond with our distributors worldwide that we will not sell in retail outlets."
Executives at Avon and Mary Kay also expressed amazement that faced with a situation that called for better regulation and supervision, the Chinese authorities instead issued a blanket ban on door-to-door sales, effectively punishing legitimate operations along with fraudulent ones.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, coincidentally visiting Beijing just after the ban was announced on April 21, objected that it unfairly penalized American companies operating openly and accountably.
Yet in China, where the central authorities have difficulty cutting through layers of bureaucracy and corruption to get local officials to act on many issues, Beijing's leaders appear to have decided that only a complete ban would be taken seriously in the endless push-and-pull between the center and the provinces.
Here in Wuhan, several former salespeople said local officials had paid little attention to even the most blatant rip-offs by direct-sales companies until Beijing made a major issue of them.
"No one stopped these Taiwan bosses from operating, even when it was obvious what they were doing," said Fang Yibin, a disappointed saleswoman. "Officials are very busy, always having banquets. They don't care about ordinary people."
Perhaps even more alarming to Chinese leaders, who remain deeply suspicious of any organization they can not easily monitor or control, was the independent nature of direct sales. Anyone building a network of salepeople, encouraging a commitment so fervent that it often looks cult-like to outsiders, was sure to ring alarm bells in Beijing.
"Some companies engaged in evil missionary teaching, gang activity and superstition," the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily wrote on May 8, describing direct sales. "They formed sellers into 'families.' Even if the salesmen were not religious believers, it was like being trained for illegal religious activities."
Although Amway once mixed Christian evangelical teaching with its teaching on how to sell in the United States, Mr. Holwill said, it now tries to keep them separate.
"If you go to a sales motivational meeting at GM, you'll hear pretty much the same language we use at Amway," said Mr. Holwill, maintaining that Amway had received no official complaints about its sales teachings in China. "We were given guidelines when we came to China about what was allowed, and we have followed them."
Those guidelines are now suddenly obsolete. But the root of China's direct-sales problem was that so many shady companies were ignoring the guidelines in the first place.
In Wuhan, the main supplier of ankle massagers for door-to-door salesmen was a Taiwan-run company called Xintian. It lured sales representatives by telling them that ankle massagers were growing ever more popular and that it was well worth spending $500 for the right to sell one.
Never mind that the machines were on sale in any department store for less than $100, or that they could barely deliver on giving a massage. People were so eager to believe in sales and to win commissions by recruiting new salespeople that they fell for it.
Attempts to return unsold goods at Xintian often met with a runaround. The company closed shop almost immediately after the ban was announced. In late April, outraged salesmen burned their wares and vandalized automobiles outside Xintian's closed storefront. In a city in Hunan Province, four people were killed in similar disturbances.
More legitimate sales operations, like Amway, Avon and Mary Kay, never charge sales agents a premium for the right to sell, ask them to sell goods easily available in nearby stores at a lower price or refuse returns on unsold goods.
After the ban, and much publicity about all the fraud, door-to-door sales have such a bad name in China that it may be hard to recover.
"Direct sales -- it's really tricking yourself," said Fang Siming, a woman reduced to selling ankle massagers on the sidewalk for only $25, a fraction of what she paid for them. "You tell yourself you can succeed where everyone else is failing. You tell yourself you can make a fortune where everyone else is up to the neck in debt."

HEADLINE: Bilingual Education Battle Splits Santa Barbara

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif., May 21

 BODY:
On the night this city's school board decided whether to end a quarter-century of bilingual education, more than 600 people showed up. It was the largest board meeting that anyone could recall. It was also the most emotional.
The board's five members said they were haunted by accusations that the proposal before them amounted to "ethnic cleansing" and posted six police officers in the auditorium. 
 And when it was finally time for the vote, after three hours of anguished pleas from all sides, several dozen proponents of bilingual education moved within a few feet of the board members and glared at them. But the board unanimously approved the proposal that, beginning in September, would put the district's many Spanish-speaking children into classes where English would take precedence.
"Then the police walked us back to our cars," said Fred Rifkin, the board's president. "It was very tense."
Four months after that mid-January meeting, the situation is still tense -- not just in Santa Barbara, but also in much of California. On June 2, California voters will decide whether to approve Proposition 227, the sweeping ballot initiative that would do statewide what Santa Barbara has already done: dismantle bilingual education.
The debate in this city is a microcosm of the complex politics swirling around Proposition 227 and a painful preview of the potential fallout in a racially, ethnically and economically diverse state.
"This is a multilayered debate," Robert Pohl, an educational consultant who is a member of the elected school board, said in an interview. "It's about politics. It's about culture. It's about power. It's about disenfranchisement. And it's about what is the purpose and responsibility of the school system."
Polls suggest that Proposition 227 will be easily approved and that a majority of Hispanic voters favor it. Even so, the initiative has ardent opponents and, coming on the heels of initiatives that sought to deny public services to illegal immigrants and that ended affirmative action in public employment and university admissions, has become the latest lightning rod in a state with a burgeoning minority population.
In Santa Barbara, the lightning struck early and with particular force, illuminating a variety of agendas embedded in the bilingual education debate.
The board's fiercest opponent of bilingual education was Alan Ebenstein, an affluent candidate for the State Assembly. His efforts won him local press attention and the favor of fellow Republicans, including Ron Unz, a wealthy entrepreneur from Northern California, who is the principal proponent of Proposition 227.
On the other side, the debate drew the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which seized the occasion not merely to support bilingual education but also to denounce institutional racism and the neglect of African-Americans in Santa Barbara's schools.
The debate attracted a woman upset that the city had a day honoring Hispanic people in general but not Mexican-Americans in particular, and it caught the attention of students and faculty members from the University of California at Santa Barbara, who complained that diversity was under siege.
Even if the debate had focused only on the best way to teach children English, it would have been no cakewalk.
Proponents of bilingual education pointed to studies suggesting that in the long run, children learned best if allowed to take instruction in their native language while gradually incorporating English into lessons. Opponents cited the poor standardized test scores and low college enrollment of many children in bilingual programs as evidence that they did not work.
If neither side wanted to give an inch, it was partly because the well-being of children was in the balance. A bilingual education teacher told the school board in January, "You are playing with the very lives -- the futures -- of our children."
School districts in California are theoretically required to provide instruction to children in their primary languages until teachers deem them suitably proficient in English.
While many districts have been unable to comply fully with that goal -- only 30 percent of the 1.4 million children in the state with limited English proficiency are actually enrolled in bilingual education programs -- others, including Santa Barbara, have put thousands of children in Spanish-language classes and often kept them there for five years or longer.
Santa Barbara is among a handful of districts that eventually sought and received state permission to end bilingual programs. Proposition 227 would essentially require all districts to do so. Under its mandate, most students who speak limited English would get about a year of intensive instruction in the English language, then be put in general classrooms where teachers would be forbidden to speak Spanish.
Santa Barbara's plan, which could be eclipsed by Proposition 227, is slightly different. It would immediately put students with limited English skills into general classrooms, but would call for Spanish-speaking teachers or teachers' aides to speak some Spanish, as needed, to help the children keep up with the class. It would also provide supplementary tutoring after school and during the summer for Spanish-speaking children with limited English.
Like the rest of California, Santa Barbara, a city of 90,000 residents, has experienced dramatic growth in its Hispanic population over the last two decades. From 1980 to 1990, the last year for which an accurate racial and ethnic breakdown of the population is available, the percentage of Hispanic people rose to 31.5 percent, from 22 percent.
Also, like the rest of California, Santa Barbara embraces stark extremes of wealth, distributed unevenly between the Hispanic residents and the non-Hispanic white ones, with the former providing much of the elbow grease that burnishes Santa Barbara's aura as an oceanside, mountain-crowned resort.
In the city's elementary schools, more than half of the Hispanic students are in bilingual programs, but there has been mounting concern over the last several years about how well they were being prepared for the future.
Mr. Ebenstein constantly underlined the statistic that showed that less than 15 percent of eligible Hispanic students in Santa Barbara's high schools were taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a requirement for admission to many colleges, and that last year, not one student from bilingual programs scored higher than 1,000 out of a possible 1,600 on the S.A.T.
Proponents of bilingual education contend that the problem is not bilingual education but the shoddy way it was being implemented, and they suggested tinkering with the system by incorporating more English more rapidly into bilingual classrooms in kindergarten through third grade.
But Mr. Ebenstein, other board members and some Hispanic parents said they were troubled by a Balkanization of Santa Barbara's elementary schools, where non-Hispanic white students clustered in one set of classes, Hispanic students in another and seldom the twain did meet.
Suspicion was aroused last summer when the board members, all of whom are white and non-Hispanic, began discussing the total abolition of bilingual programs.
Critics openly wondered if the board's mission was to stamp out the sounds of Spanish in Santa Barbara. Words like "racism," "oppression" and even "genocide" were thrown around.
In an article published in a local newspaper, Pete Relis, a public school teacher who supports bilingual education, summoned the specter of ethnic cleansing. And at one board meeting, Mr. Rifkin said, a woman compared him to Adolf Hitler.
"Imagine being a Jew and hearing that," he said.
Meanwhile, many bilingual teachers here who supported the status quo seemed to resent the intrusion of the school board members on their work, along with the implication that they had devoted years to a failed experiment.
The arguments also delved into what, if any, role the schools should play in preserving the culture of Hispanic people, whose presence in California pre-dated that of English-speaking settlers.
The three children of Ruben and Maria Rey began school speaking only Spanish -- not because their parents did not know English, but because the couple made a cultural decision to rear them that way. The couple, vocal critics of the board's plan, said the schools should respect and celebrate that decision while also teaching their children English through bilingual programs.
Yolanda Broyles-Gonzalez, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, concurred, saying that the point of bilingual education was not just the effective acquisition of English.
Referring to her sixth-grade son, Professor Broyles-Gonzalez said, "He dreams in two languages and two worlds, and I wanted that to be cultivated." So she recently transferred him to a private school that would do so.
But several board members questioned whether it was reasonable to ask schools to give a level of consideration to Hispanic people that had not been given to other ethnic groups, and several white parents clearly saw bilingual programs as the coddling of one group of students, which was somehow hurting other students.
At the January school board meeting, one non-Hispanic white parent called bilingual education "the biggest factor in the downfall of education in this state," while another said it had driven his family and many other middle-class families to private schools.
Mr. Ebenstein said, "They don't want their kids to go to a school where half the kids speak Spanish. People want their children to have a happy, open learning experience."
In the days before the board's vote, more than 300 Hispanic families boycotted the schools, sending their children to a community center instead. The morning after, some critics accused board members of having made up their minds in private sessions and pressed unsuccessfully to have them criminally charged with violating the state's open-meeting law. They also began a petition drive to recall Mr. Ebenstein.
The board members said that they had forged ahead with their plan, even though Proposition 227 loomed, because the voter initiative could become tangled in legal challenges. The board members are split in their positions on the statewide proposition.
Mr. Rifkin opposes the initiative, saying it deprives local districts of control. But Steve Forsell, another member, favors it, saying it would enable school districts elsewhere to follow Santa Barbara's lead without taking the heat.
"I don't know that other school boards in the state could stand up to that kind of abuse," Mr. Forsell said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Delays World Bank Loans For India in Response to A-Tests

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Administration made good today on its threat to make India pay for conducting five nuclear tests earlier this month, forcing what the World Bank called "an indefinite delay" on $865 million in loans for an electric power grid and other projects.
While the action was directed at New Delhi, it was clearly intended to send a signal to Pakistan about how it would suffer if it responded with a nuclear test of its own. Today the Central Intelligence Agency reported that Pakistan had completed preparations for such a test. 
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is under enormous pressure from militant Islamic groups to demonstrate his nation's nuclear ability, too, but it is unclear whether he has decided what course to take after weeks of intensive American diplomatic efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear tensions.
Tonight the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said reports that a test is imminent are "absolutely incorrect."
The World Bank action today hits India where it most needs help: Building a reliable electrical system.
The biggest single loan put on hold today -- $450 million -- is part of a $5.7 billion program to build a national power distribution network that would increase the reliability of electric service. It is exactly the kind of project that the United States favors: using loans from international institutions to attract private investors and promote competition in an industry dominated by money-losing government agencies.
Without the World Bank's financing, India will have to either scale the project back or seek loans from private banks, at a far greater cost. Such loans are not likely to be forthcoming: India's powerful State Electricity Boards have lost roughly $3 billion in recent years.
As a result, the prospect of more sanctions has sent the Indian rupee plunging to a record low against the dollar. The decline of the currency is perhaps the harshest sanction of all because it makes it more difficult to cut interest rates to attract investors, and thus to bolster an economy that is deeply troubled.
The World Bank also postponed a $130 million loan to build small hydroelectric generators throughout the country, especially in remote villages that have no other source of power. The projects tend to raise few environmental objections -- especially compared with coal-fired power stations -- and the equipment often comes from American and European suppliers.
A third loan was to provide $275 million for road construction in Haryana state, near New Delhi.
The United States was not alone in acting to force the World Bank to delay the loan; Japan, which is the second-largest contributor to the bank, also sought a delay, and the major contributors have the greatest weight when decisions are made.
But there is a widening gap between Washington and several allies over using World Bank loans and other international assistance to punish New Delhi. Most European nations, including Britain, view economic sanctions as unwise and unlikely to deter India from turning its nuclear capacity into weapons.
The United States and Japan could delay India's loans for months at the least. But officials familiar with the bank's inner workings say Washington would find itself on shaky ground if the subject ever came to a formal vote.
The politics of the World Bank are less than clear-cut. The United States and Japan can prevent the issue of money for India from coming to a vote for a time because the Bank generally operates by consensus rather than by formal vote. No one foresees a vote for at least several months and perhaps longer.
But eventually, if the matter did come to a vote, a majority of board members would likely vote for the loans, American and other officials say.
Such a step would almost certainly enrage Congress, especially when some legislators are attacking the size of American contributions to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and others are upset that the United States contributes at all.
The United States has also cut off bilateral aid to India, including trade credits, private American bank loans to the Indian Government and loan guarantees to American companies doing business there.
But some companies have been working behind the scenes to ease the regulations under which the sanctions will be imposed. Though the law mandating sanctions was passed in 1994, the regulations to implement them were never written and are only now being hastily assembled.
"It's just beginning to dawn on people that this is going to undercut years of trying to get American companies into India," one Administration official said last week. "But at this point, it is unavoidable."
India has also been working to undermine the sanctions, officials say, offering to open up long-closed markets in the hope of giving Europeans and others an incentive to part ways with Washington's policy.
One reason the United States was eager to mete out punishment this week was to show Pakistan, which is more dependent than India on international aid, that it could suffer the same fate.
It is unclear whether that message is getting through.
The C.I.A. told the White House today that Pakistan could detonate an underground nuclear explosion at any moment. Intelligence officials said they had irrefutable evidence that the preparations, which began two weeks ago after India's tests but were slowed by the pleadings of senior American officials, were complete except for minor technical details. But Pakistani officials say reports that a test is near are incorrect.
Pakistan's test site is in the Chagai Hills, in the Baluchistan desert near the Iranian border. The United States monitors activities there with spy satellites and reports from foreign intelligence agents inside Pakistan.
United States officials, from President Clinton down, have all but begged Pakistan not to conduct a test, saying it would set off a dangerous arms race.
"If Pakistan's leaders do not test, they will defy India's expectations and foil India's desire to drag Pakistan's world standing down," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said. "They will pull South Asia back from an arms competition that nations there cannot afford and might not survive."
The United States held out promises of renewed military and economic aid, which was suspended in 1990 because of Pakistan's nuclear-weapons program. In the 1980's Pakistan received up to $600 million a year in American military and economic aid, making it the third-largest recipient of such assistance, after Israel and Egypt.
The United States also suggested that it might deliver some or all of the 28 F-16 fighter jets that Pakistan has paid for but never received because of the 1990 sanctions.

HEADLINE: Welfare Workers Rate High In Job Retention at Companies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Some companies hiring welfare recipients say they have found, to their surprise, that such workers stay on the job longer, with less turnover, than other employees.
The findings run counter to the expectations of many skeptics, who said that welfare recipients lacked the skills and the motivation needed to hold jobs. 
 The companies, Borg-Warner, Giant Food, Marriott International, Salomon Smith Barney, Sprint, United Airlines, owned by UAL, United Parcel Service and Xerox, said they had made systematic efforts to hire welfare recipients in the last year. And in separate interviews, executives at those companies said that they had retained a larger proportion of former welfare recipients than other entry-level employees.
"It's been a real pleasant surprise for us," said Ricki C. Crescenzi, manager of employment at Giant Food, a regional supermarket chain based in Landover, Md.
She said the company had hired more than 100 welfare recipients as cashiers, pharmacy clerks, baker's assistants and apprentice meat-cutters. After 90 days, she said, 79 percent of welfare recipients were still on the job, while the retention rate for other Giant employees in similar jobs was 50 percent.
Janet M. Tully, director of community employment and training at Marriott International, said her company hired 360 welfare recipients last year and 100 so far this year, with retention rates very similar to those reported by Giant.
The efforts to hire welfare recipients, to be recognized at the White House on Wednesday, come at a time of low unemployment, and those efforts have several features in common. Most of the companies work with local government agencies or nonprofit community organizations that recruit and train welfare recipients for particular jobs.
Also, many of the employers use mentors, job coaches or some type of "buddy" system to help welfare recipients learn skills needed for their jobs and many offer welfare recipients extra help with child care and transportation to and from work.
Welfare experts sounded a note of caution, saying that some of the people still on welfare might have more difficulty getting and holding jobs. They include homeless people, drug addicts, people with serious mental disorders, convicted felons, battered women and people with a limited ability to read or speak English.
Ms. Tully attributed the high retention rates at Marriott to the "training, personal attention, coaching and counseling" given to welfare recipients.
"That's a luxury that a lot of other employees don't have," Ms. Tully said.
LaDonna A. Pavetti, a welfare expert at Mathematica Policy Research, said that welfare recipients were given access to job training, child care and transportation services that was unavailable to people "hired off the street."
"In Massachusetts," Ms. Pavetti said, "if you find a job while you're on welfare, you are guaranteed child care."
The work requirements of the 1996 welfare law may also be a factor. "Welfare recipients have a mandate to work," Ms. Pavetti said. "If they lose this job, they'll have to get another one."
Barbara A. Silvan, senior vice president of Salomon Smith Barney, said her company had retained 92 percent of the 53 welfare recipients hired in the last year. Some of the new employees took jobs paying more than $24,000 a year, and in the last few weeks, she said, "we hired someone off welfare at $30,000."
Company executives said their main reason for hiring welfare recipients was to create a more stable work force and to improve the bottom line. Such hiring is essential to the success of the welfare bill that President Clinton signed in August 1996. But the executives said they were not hiring welfare recipients as a favor to Mr. Clinton.
Eli J. Segal, president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, said 5,000 companies had made commitments to hire and retain welfare recipients.
The Welfare to Work Partnership, a nonprofit corporation formed to promote the hiring of welfare recipients, has been praised by Mr. Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican.
Michael E. Schlein, director of corporate development at Salomon Smith Barney, said, "The transition from years of welfare to corporate life can be rough." Before being hired for full-time jobs, he said, welfare recipients must complete 16 weeks of preparation at the Wildcat Service Corporation, a job training and employment agency, and they go through a 16-week internship at Salomon Smith Barney.
Jeffrey Jablow, senior vice president of Wildcat, said his company trained 1,500 welfare recipients a year, teaching them work habits, clerical skills, computer skills and the language skills and mathematics needed for their jobs.
Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines, said the company had retained 70 percent of the 760 welfare recipients it had hired in the last year. Among other people hired for similar jobs, he said, the retention rate was 40 percent.
Paula Fulford, a spokeswoman for United Parcel Service, said: "Since January 1997, we have hired more than 10,400 welfare recipients as part-time package sorters, at an average wage of $8.50 an hour. We make no distinction between a former welfare recipient and anyone else hired for an entry-level job in terms of salary, benefits and hours."
But, she said, many of the welfare recipients receive extra "supportive services" from U.P.S. and community organizations.
Peter B. Edelman, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, resigned in protest over the new welfare law in September 1996. In March 1997, he said that the law's work requirements were unrealistic because many welfare recipients lacked basic skills.
But in an interview today, Mr. Edelman said, "In the short run, more people are getting jobs than I would have thought."

HEADLINE: Clinton Projects $39 Billion Budget Surplus in '98

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
President Clinton announced today that the Federal Government would run a budget surplus of $39 billion this year, as he maneuvered to deprive Republicans of an election-year issue by demanding that the money be protected from "short-term schemes" for tax cuts.
The Clinton Administration had estimated in February that the Government would run a deficit of $10 billion this year. But officials from Mr. Clinton on down have signaled for months that because of surging tax revenue they expected instead to see the first surplus since 1969. 
 In making his announcement today in the Rose Garden, the President was trying to make a point of his economic stewardship and dominate the news with Congress out of town, his aides acknowledged. But he was also seeking to frame what his advisers expect to be one of two dominant domestic issues, together with tobacco legislation, before the November elections.
Hoping for a potent issue in the fall, Republicans are bent on delivering a big tax cut as part of the budget this year. But Mr. Clinton, repeating his call to devote any surplus to preserving Social Security, said today that talk of tax cuts should be postponed until at least next year, after negotiators devise a plan to shore up Social Security.
"We cannot abandon the strategy of fiscal discipline and investments in the future which has brought us to this moment," the President said.
Republicans have argued that Mr. Clinton was hoarding taxpayers' hard-earned gains. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, "Because of record-high taxation, the surplus is surging out of control."
Saying he feared that politicians would use the surplus to create new Federal programs, Mr. Archer added, "I believe we should use the surplus to pay down the debt, save Social Security and use a portion for tax relief."
In issuing its estimates for the surplus today, the Administration revised, with some eye-popping results, the numbers that it released as part of the President's budget in February. It said today that the surplus would accumulate to $495 billion over the next five years, compared with the $127 billion it had forecast. Over 10 years, the Administration said, the surplus would amount to $1.477 trillion, compared with its previous estimate of $846 billion.
"America can now turn off the deficit clock," Mr. Clinton said, "and plug in the surplus clock."
By law, the Administration is required to issue a revised estimate, called a "mid-session review," of the budget deficit or surplus. Such revisions are required by July 15 and are usually made in July. Republican Congressional aides questioned whether the Administration made its estimate earlier this year in the hope of producing a lower number that would constrain budget negotiators.
Jack Lew, the acting budget director, said the Administration acted early because of the "intense interest" in the budget number. Waiting another month, Mr. Lew said, would not have improved the forecast because the most important factor is the April tax receipts, which have now been counted.
"We think that this is the right way to continue the debate, the policy debate, for the balance of this year, and it shows the most accurate picture that we have of the state of the budget and the state of the economy," he said.
The Administration was careful today to emphasize the surplus for this year, rather than the much large figures for later years. But Republicans seized on the latter numbers to emphasize that money would be rolling in and to make the case for tax cuts. "Why is the Government collecting this much excess taxation?" asked Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Clinton's aides argued that public polls showed overwhelming majorities prefer using the surplus not to cut taxes, but to preserve Social Security or to increase spending on programs like education.
One Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, maintained that Republicans ran the risk of "letting us be both the defenders of seniors and the champions of fiscal discipline."
The official added, "We can't do that on our own, but it looks like they're hellbent on doing that for us."
Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the Administration's new surplus estimates were based on a forecast of slower annual economic growth of 2 percent over the next three years, rising to 2.4 percent after that. She also predicted that unemployment and inflation would edge upward.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Assesses New Indonesia Government

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 26

 BODY:
Indonesia's political upheaval has worsened its severe economic problems, and a high-level team from the International Monetary Fund arrived here today to explore ways to restart its rescue package.
The country's political and economic crises have become dangerously intertwined, and the fund's Asia director, Hubert Neiss, said on his arrival that the country must urgently address its leadership questions if it is to begin a real recovery. 
 "We have to recognize that the economic measures will only work and be truly effective if there is political stability," he said. "Along with political stability, it is important that the trust of the people in the Government is restored, the support of foreign governments is obtained and market confidence is returned."
But the politics today are far from stable. President B. J. Habibie, who took office on Thursday when President Suharto resigned under pressure, promised on Monday to hold a new election. But he did not set a date and the promise has only accelerated a widening struggle over the future leadership.
Rather than an orderly transition to a stable leadership, there is the possibility of political chaos as long-suppressed forces jockey to fill the vacuum left by the sudden departure of the strongman who governed Indonesia for 32 years.
New political parties have begun to form and the formerly illegal labor movement and newly potent student movement have marshalled their forces. Opposition figures debate ways to hurry a transition of power, and the military waits in the wings, its agenda still uncertain.
Mr. Neiss said he would assess the situation as quickly as he could and report back to the fund's board, which must decide whether to resume disbursements from its $40 billion rescue package. They were suspended on Friday, after Mr. Suharto stepped down.
On the same day, the United States Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said it would be premature for the fund to resume disbursements as long as the political situation remained unclear.
Mari Pangestu, a leading economist here, said the I.M.F., the World Bank and international investors remain wary of Mr. Habibie's Government, although he has installed a credible economic team.
"The greatest fear is that we will have months of uncertainty," she said. "Certainly the economic conditions have gotten much, much worse. Analysts used to say recovery would take three to five years. Now they are saying four to five years."
Apart from the political questions, Mr. Neiss will find a severely weakened economy, and the fund will need to lower its estimates of the country's potential, economists said.
Foreign exchange reserves have fallen dangerously low and the Goverment has compensated by printing new money, driving up inflation to a projected 47 percent this year, one foreign economist said.
The country's private foreign debt, estimated as high as $70 billion, remains an intractable problem. The banking system is on the verge of collapse, its peril heighted today by a run on the country's largest private bank, Bank Central Asia.
That bank, which is partly owned by two of Mr. Suharto's six wealthy children, was a prime target of rioters two weeks ago, reportedly closing 122 offices and losing 1,250 automatic teller machines to vandals and thieves.
Surveying the wreckage, private economists have dismissed an I.M.F. estimate of recent trends showing a 5 percent contraction in the economy. Various estimates now put the shrinkage at anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent.
Ms. Pangestu estimates that unemployment will rise to more than 15 million this year, or nearly 20 percent of the workforce. With food prices rising sharply, she said, this means that as many as 58 million people would soon be in poverty, far above the 22.5 million at the start of the year.
"You aren't going to see any investment coming in for a while," she said. "The more you look at the numbers, the gloomier it gets."
The situation is compounded by the worst drought in half a century, which has parched harvests and made it necessary to spend huge amounts of scarce foreign currency on imported food.
In a speech on Monday after his first Cabinet meeting, Mr. Habibie acknowledged the need for stability to attract foreign investment and aid.
"We must honestly admit that our success in overcoming the economic crisis depends largely on foreign loans, especially to finance imports of raw material and spare parts," he said. "Foreign loans are influenced by our success in stabilizing domestic political life."
His chief economic minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said over the weekend that Indonesia would cooperate with the I.M.F. Since the rescue package was first agreed to last October, Mr. Suharto delayed and equivocated, promising reforms, then retreating, time and again.
In a challenge to his own Government, Mr. Ginandjar agreed with critics who say Mr. Habibie's Government cannot provide the needed confidence. "One thing is for sure," he said. "We need to have a new Government with a new mandate from the people. This means general elections as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Has A Stronghold In Office Suites

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
When employees of the New York Attorney General's office sat down last week to prepare the final draft of the multistate lawsuit accusing the Microsoft Corporation of monopolistic, anticompetitive behavior, they typed the document using Microsoft Word, the word processor installed on the office's computers as part of a group of business programs known as Office.
"We have Windows 95 and the Microsoft Office suite," Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco acknowledged with a rueful chuckle. 
 So does virtually every other office in America, which is one of the reasons that Mr. Vacco and 19 other state Attorneys General have targeted Office in their lawsuit.
Dataquest, a market research firm, said that Microsoft Office now has 93 percent of the world market for the collections of business software known as suites. The other 7 percent is divided between two other suites built around former industry heavyweights. Lotus Smartsuite, has 4 percent of the market, and Corel Wordperfect Suite has 3 percent.
In addition to Word, Microsoft Office includes the Excel spreadsheet program for financial analysis and management, and Outlook, a personal information manager for keeping schedules and contact directories. Microsoft offers Office in three versions -- standard, professional and small-business editions. Various versions also include Powerpoint presentation software for developing slide shows on a computer screen; Access, a data-base management tool for finding and analyzing information stored in large computer filing cabinets, or Streets, a mapping and directions program.
The part of the states' lawsuit dealing with Office accuses Microsoft of using predatory pricing strategies to gain dominance in the market for office suites.
The Justice Department argues that Microsoft's pricing policy for Office leaves computer manufacturers the practical choice of installing Microsoft's suite on all the computers they make or on none of them. The result, the suit says, is that competition "is threatened to be curtailed and foreclosed."
But some experts in the industry argue that the states are mounting a battle that may already be lost, since Microsoft Office already enjoys the same level of monopolistic dominance held by the company's Windows operating system.
Just three years ago, Wordperfect was the world's best-selling word processor, with more than half the market. Lotus 1-2-3, the venerable spreadsheet program, had a similar market share.
No one argues that Microsoft's pricing strategies alone are responsible for the sharp decline of these competing suites.
Most analysts say that Microsoft gained its monopoly position in part by figuring out more quickly than others that most people want programs bundled in a suite and designed to work with and look like one another. The company also produced updates that took advantage of technological advances far more quickly than competitors did.
As an example, Dennis Tevlin, Microsoft's director of marketing for the desktop applications division, said that when Windows 95 was released, "Lotus and Wordperfect had ample time to develop updates. But they just didn't do it. So we were already on to our second generation when they were just shipping product."
Corel assigns blame for Wordperfect's decline largely to its previous owner, Novell Inc. And a senior Lotus Development executive, who, under company policy declined to be identified, said that the many shifts in the industry the last five years, including the move to suites, brought the downfall of Lotus 1-2-3. Neither company placed primary emphasis on the pricing policy described in the states' lawsuit.
Whatever happened in the past, said Chris Le Tocq, an analyst for Dataquest who follows this industry, "it's very tough to see a way anyone could come in with a word processor or a spreadsheet and turn this around" in the future.
And Lewis E. Platt, chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company, said: "By now, it's over in that business. Most people find it more difficult to switch applications programs than to even switch operating systems."
Even Attorney General Vacco, when told of the latest sales figures, said: "Wow! Perhaps it has gone too far, but only the marketplace can provide an answer. Given a more level playing field, can another player compete? I don't know."
A senior Government official involved with the state and Federal lawsuits said, "When a market tips as decisively as this, there's a real question whether or not it makes sense to try to generate competition."
Microsoft, the state lawsuit said, offered computer manufacturers -- known in the industry as an O.E.M., for original equipment manufacturer -- two choices when buying the office suite. They can buy individual copies of the program for installation on some computers at a price of roughly $170 to $190. Or, they can buy the program at a far lower price, roughly $125, if they purchase it for installation on every computer in a company line -- the Dimension series of Dell computers, for example.
This is called a "per system" license, and the suit says: "It is impractical in an economic sense for an O.E.M. to install a competing office productivity suite on a computer subject to a per-system license. In order to do so, the O.E.M. would have to pay for both Office and the competing product, and likewise would be required to pass along to the customer the cost of offering both Office and the competing product."
But Mr. Tevlin said that Microsoft's pricing was set in this manner because retailers would complain if manufacturers could buy single copies at a cost far below theirs.
Executives of the Corel Corporation, the Canadian company that owns Wordperfect, said sales may have been hurt by this -- but not very much. "The fact is, sales to O.E.M.s are not really a big money maker for us; the retail market is more important," said Cindy McGann, Corel's corporate counsel. Mr. Tevlin of Microsoft said manufacturers accounted for only about 6 percent of the Office market.
Still, Don Sylvester, a senior vice president at Corel, argued that Microsoft's pricing "absolutely harms everyone in the market, and nobody wants to wake up six months from now and find that Micorosoft is the only one standing in the word processing and suite market."
As it is, Corel has changed its marketing strategy. "It's clear to us that Microsoft isn't our competition anymore," he said. "They are our environment, and we need to deal with that fact by making our product completely compatible with Microsoft Office so users can move files back and forth between their programs and ours."
The senior Lotus executive agreed that compatibility was essential for survival. And both companies are now selling their products at a fraction of the cost of Microsoft Office. This leaves Microsoft officials wondering aloud what all the fuss is about, since predatory pricing typically means selling a product for far less than a competitor. Corel sells Wordperfect Suite to manufacturers for about $15, and the retail price for the program is only $99. Lotus is owned by I.B.M., and its suite is bundled free on most I.B.M. personal computers. The retail price of Microsoft Office is $399.
Even with rock-bottom prices, both companies said they believed they could survive and both have large bases of customers who buy updated versions of the programs. A survey early this year of about 300 companies by the Olsten Corporation, a temporary worker company, found that 21 percent of the offices surveyed still used Wordperfect, and 27 percent still used Lotus 1-2-3.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 29, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about a lawsuit filed by 20 states against the Microsoft Corporation misidentified the antitrust officials who contend that the company's pricing policies for its Office suite of programs leave computer makers with the practical choice of installing the software on all their computers or none. They are the states' attorneys general, not staff members of the Justice Department.

The Justice Department's antitrust concerns about Microsoft extend beyond the operating system to its dominance of business software. Microsoft has dominated the market for bundled software which has grown rapidly allowing the company's software to dominate the workplace. (Sources: Dataquest; PC Data; Olsen Corporation)(pg. D2)

HEADLINE: PUBLIC EYE;
Beyond Tape Measures: A New Human Scale

BYLINE: By Phil Patton 

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD, for one, knows that you need scale: "His tail is as big as four subway cars." "His foot is as big as this billboard." Even Godzilla's scales have scale.
Scale makes us feel significant or insignificant, and soon designers will have a new human scale, thanks to a project that has just been initiated by the Wright Research Laboratory at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. On April 27, a laser scanned the body of the first of some 9,000 people in the United States and Europe; their measurements (in every dimension) will help the Air Force develop a new database of body scale. The aim is to "improve hundreds of goods and services, anything a person might wear or use," said an Air Force spokesman, Bobbie Mixon. 
 Some 20 companies, including Nissan, Boeing, Levi Strauss and Sara Lee Knits, are part of the joint project, called Caesar, which stands for the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource. Kathleen Robinette is the head of the lab where the whole-body scanner was developed. Ms. Robinette said that the scanner goes beyond the tape measure by also assessing surface and volume. The goal is to provide a set of three-dimensional measurements that will supplant the classic standards first compiled in 1960 in "Human Scale" by Alvin Tilley.
As information crazy as society has become, Ms. Robinette said, many of our designs are based on obsolete statistics. And marketing further twists our sense of proportion: the smallest cup of coffee Starbucks sells is "tall." From there you move on to "grande" and "vente" -- meaning the 20-ounce size. At the movies, popcorn sizes start at medium and escalate to milk pail.
Sizes are especially askew for women's clothing; they are still based in large part on a 1942 Agriculture Department survey. Ms. Robinette has also noticed what many women have long suspected: buy the more expensive labels, and you, too, can slip into a size 4.
Because many of the scales for clothing and equipment were derived from measuring military men, they had limits in civilian application. And because men chiefly set the scales, women have suffered.
The military has led the way in setting standards ever since the Civil War, when boot makers introduced the first system of standardized sizes for the Union Army. World War II saw the birth of ergonomics -- taken from the measurements of many soldiers, which were used to create better cockpits and gunnery stations.
Now, the Air Force is doing it all over again in three dimensions. The device in its lab scans a human body in 17 seconds. To assure a wide sample, Caesar will look to Europe, where, on average, the Dutch are nearly four inches taller than the average American, Ms. Robinette said. (Americans seem to have leveled off in height since 1970.)
It's all in an attempt to give us an even greater grip on our world. Without scale, we become Gulliver, wandering from Brobdingnag to Lilliput.
"Some people lose their sense of proportion," says the narrator of "Scale," a story by Will Self, an heir to Swift. "I've lost my sense of scale." The hero dreams he walks into a scale model of his hometown and descends down six levels of scale. "It took me two months to climb out," he adds.
The best designers have always understood the importance of scale. One of Charles and Ray Eames's most important designs is not a chair or table but the film "Powers of 10," with its famous recession from the atomic to the cosmic scale, turning exponents into images.
The Air Force's goals are less cosmic: it aims to provide the numbers that will help make furniture that won't cramp your legs, bike helmets that fit children, aircraft seats that make customer's bottoms happier.
The information will offer manufacturers the potential to save money, too. One beneficiary could be the catalogue business, which must deal with merchandise that has been returned because it didn't fit.
Levi Strauss already offers Personal Pairs, custom-fit jeans for women, but in the not-too-distant future less expensive versions of Caesar's $400,000 scanner may be coming to a mall near you, for perfect sizing -- if you want it.
My son will probably still prefer his baggy jeans.

HEADLINE: Orchestra Celebrates Clarinetist's 50 Years

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
Stanley Drucker has a succinct but vivid memory of his first rehearsal as a member of the New York Philharmonic's clarinet section. The orchestra's home was Carnegie Hall then, and Dmitri Mitropoulos was on the podium. The work at hand was Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra." And it was fully 20 years before that score's opening phrase -- the slow, rising arpeggio and the two brass-heavy chordal blasts followed by pounding kettledrums -- became irrevocably linked to Stanley Kubrick's film "2001: A Space Odyssey."
"The sound was overwhelming on the Carnegie Hall stage at that time," Mr. Drucker said. "But you know, it feels like it just happened. I feel as though I'm just starting out. I still love this." 
 That rehearsal was a few months shy of 50 years ago. Twelve years later, in 1960, he became the Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, and in that capacity he has made more than 150 appearances as a concerto soloist with the orchestra. The Philharmonic and its music director, Kurt Masur, are celebrating Mr. Drucker's anniversary in the closing subscription concerts of the season, tonight and Saturday at 8 P.M.
At those performances, Mr. Drucker is to be the soloist in the Copland Concerto for Clarinet, Strings, Harp and Piano, a work he has played with the orchestra several times, and which the Philharmonic is about to take on its spring tour to Asia. And not to make things too easy on himself, he is playing Bartok's "Contrasts" and Leonard Bernstein's Clarinet Sonata with some of his Philharmonic colleagues in a Prelude concert at 6:45 both nights.
"The Copland is an old friend," said Mr. Drucker, who was nominated for a Grammy for his 1989 recording of the work with Bernstein and the Philharmonic. "It was commissioned by Benny Goodman. So was Bartok's 'Contrasts.' Do you realize, Goodman commissioned music from Milhaud, Hindemith, Copland, Bartok? If he had started earlier, we would probably have gotten more concertos. It would have been great to have one from Samuel Barber, for instance.
"The Bernstein Sonata was his first published work, but I played what was probably one of the first performances when I was a student. Its second movement is pretty difficult rhythmically. He always wrote pieces with a lot of interesting rhythms, and this one has passages in 5/8 and 7/8 going pretty fast. It's a good piece, I've played it a lot, and I've recorded it twice."
No one on the current Philharmonic roster has played in the orchestra longer than Mr. Drucker, and he does not remember other golden anniversaries occurring during his tenure. It is rare, in fact, for an orchestra player to hold his post so long, not least because musicians are normally well into their 20's before they have sufficient experience to land a position in a major orchestra.
Mr. Drucker was 19 when he joined the Philharmonic, but his resume was hardly blank. He was born in Brooklyn and began studying the clarinet when he was 10, an age that would be considered late for a pianist but, Mr. Drucker said, is when wind players typically take up their instruments. He attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia when he was 15, but at the end of his first year he was spotted by the conductor of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, who invited him to join that ensemble as principal clarinetist.
After one season in Indianapolis, Mr. Drucker toured for a year with the Busch Little Symphony, a conductorless chamber orchestra led by the violinist Adolph Busch, and from there he became principal clarinetist of the Buffalo Philharmonic. On Busch's recommendation, the New York Philharmonic invited Mr. Drucker to audition when a clarinetist's chair opened up in 1948.
Mr. Drucker, whose impeccable tone and broad coloristic palette have regularly been praised in reviews, shrugs off the suggestion that his career trajectory -- from his first lesson to the New York Philharmonic in less than a decade -- was unusually steep.
"It does seem that way," he explained, "but you know, the clarinet was never out of my hands. And in those days, one did what one could to move to better orchestras. The seasons were very short. One didn't really make any money at it, and there was no unemployment insurance. Playing had to be a labor of love. Now the seasons are year round, and one can live well."
Plenty else has changed as well. Auditions, for example, were both simpler and more perilous: instead of auditioning for a committee and going through preliminary and final rounds, Mr. Drucker said, a musician played for the conductor, who had full hiring and firing power. The concept of tenure had not reached the orchestral world. Nor had diversity. Blind auditions, in which the musician plays from behind a screen to minimize potential gender or racial biases, though typical today were unheard of in 1948.
How has the Philharmonic itself changed? "Well, it was all male, for one thing," he said. "And they were all Europeans, with only a few exceptions, of which I was one. Most of the orchestra had been trained in Europe and had come from European orchestras. It was an orchestra of great individuals, people with a great sense of humor and persona, people who really had something to say individually. It was a real United Nations mix of players, at that time."
Mr. Drucker lives in Massapequa, N.Y., where he and his wife, Naomi, also a clarinetist, reared two children who followed in his footsteps, more or less. Their daughter, Rosanne, is a pop singer and songwriter, and their son, Leon -- better known by his stage name, Lee Rocker -- was the bassist in the Stray Cats, a rockabilly trio that disbanded a few years ago but recently reconvened to play at a memorial concert for Carl Perkins. Mr. Rocker also has a blues band.
"No, I never did get to play with the Stray Cats," Mr. Drucker said. "I don't think I'd fit. I don't have the right kind of hair. But I thought they were wonderful. It was old-fashioned stuff, very pure, very accessible, and it put a smile on your face."
During his years as the Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Mr. Drucker has played virtually all the major clarinet concertos and has been the soloist on several notable recordings, including the Copland; a 1967 account of the Nielsen Clarinet Concerto, with Bernstein conducting, and two recordings of John Corigliano's Clarinet Concerto (one with Bernstein, one with Zubin Mehta), which the orchestra commissioned for him in 1977.
A recording of the premiere of the Corigliano Concerto was included in the recent 10-disk compilation of the Philharmonic's historic radio broadcasts. More recently, Mr. Drucker played the premiere of William Bolcom's Clarinet Concerto, also commissioned by the orchestra.
He points out, too, that beyond concertos, an orchestral clarinetist has plenty of great music to play, and he cites crucial lines in Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade" and "Capriccio Espagnole," the short but memorable clarinet phrases in Strauss's "Til Eulenspiegel," the slow movement of the Rachmaninoff Second Symphony, and passages in Bartok's "Miraculous Mandarin," Kodaly's "Dances from Galanta" and the Shostakovich symphonies.
Mr. Drucker turns 70 next February, but his playing is as agile as ever, and he said that his plans for the foreseeable future do not include retirement. (The orchestra has no mandatory retirement age.)
"I'm going to play as long as I can," he said, "I think loving it and having something to offer are very important. At any rate, I'm not the oldest player in the Philharmonic, there are a handful older than I. I've been there the longest, because I started so young. But time compresses, you know? Fifty years doesn't really seem so long.
"I tell my colleagues that I've lasted so long because I commute. All that running up and down the stairs to the train keeps me in shape."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Raising cigarette taxes will surely punish tobacco's victims.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
BIG Tobacco is on the run. While specific provisions of the Federal legislation remain in doubt, there is no question the industry will pay hundreds of billions of dollars to compensate states, individual smokers and their lawyers for the medical costs and premature death of smokers. Nor is there much doubt that the settlements will be financed almost entirely by new cigarette taxes.
By the same token, it is safe to assume that virtually any resolution that prices teen-agers out of the cigarette market and generates hundreds of billions of dollars in "sin tax" revenue will enjoy widespread public support. 
 But economists and legal scholars who generally share the public's distaste for cigarette pushers still wonder whether a tax-based fix for tobacco is good public policy.
In some cases, their concerns could be resolved with a little more care in the division of the spoils. There is a more fundamental drawback, though, to any political consensus that turns on enormous increases in the retail price of tobacco: it punishes the victims.
INCENTIVES FOR BETTER CIGARETTES -- When the smoke clears, 40 million adults -- most of whom have tried and failed to stop smoking -- will still be addicted.
The tobacco companies apparently have some good ideas about making cigarettes that minimize their ill effects on health, said Adam Jaffe, an economist at Brandeis University and an expert witness for Blue Cross in the Minnesota litigation.
But under the terms of the legal settlements to date, the companies' financial liability for past transgressions is proportional to their share of the future market. Hence they lack incentives to invest in making a safer cigarette that persuades addicts to switch to their brands.
THE LIGGETT WINDFALL -- When Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of the Brooke Group, the parent of the Liggett Group, broke ranks and settled with the state Attorneys General, it was widely understood that he had made a lucrative deal for his company. But not many people understand just how ahead of the curve Liggett will be if LeBow-lobbied amendments to the White House-backed bill, sponsored by Senator John McCain of Arizona, become law.
The company would not be required to turn over a $1.10-a-pack tax to Washington over the next quarter century as long as Liggett's market share remains below 3 percent. Assuming Liggett takes full advantage of the break by pricing to maximize profits, it will be worth $15 billion, according to calculations by Jeremy Bulow, an economist at Stanford's business school. "Unless Congress removes this handout, Bennett LeBow will be the next member of the Forbes 400," Mr. Bulow said.
LEGAL FEES -- Without Federal legislation, Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, a research group, estimates that the private lawyers in the state Medicaid suits stand to reap $1 billion to $3 billion a year, while contingency fees from suits on behalf of individual smokers could run from $2 billion to $12 billion annually. Even with the bill's $8 billion cap on payouts for individual suits, Mr. Horowitz said, the lawyers' total fees could still touch $6.5 billion a year.
And what is wrong with rewarding the entrepreneurs who spent their own millions to breach the legal defenses of Fortress Tobacco? For one thing, the rewards will be disproportionate to the risk -- especially on cases that come after the initial disclosures of the tobacco companies' misdeeds and are built around early settlement precedents. More important from Mr. Horowitz's perspective, failure to cap fees at, say, five times the highest charges paid to cigarette company lawyers, would set back the general cause of legal reform.
"Trial lawyers already use their riches to influence legislatures and courts," he said. "What will happen when they have billions more to promote their interests?"
TAXING ADDICTS -- It is widely understood that future smokers will pay most of the cost of both the state settlements and any new Federal programs financed with the tobacco tax. What has not sunk in yet is how regressive this tax is likely to be. "The tobacco companies are almost certainly right that the bulk of this tax will be on people making less than $30,000" a year, said Mr. Bulow -- quite a bite for a 500-pack-a-year habit.
Part of the logic in taxing low-income smokers is to recover the costs of smoking-related illnesses covered by Medicaid, Medicare and nonsmokers' health insurance premiums. Yet most of the research on these costs suggests they are largely offset by reduced Social Security payments to smokers who die young. And existing taxes offset the rest. "The idea that smokers cost the rest of us money is simply wrong," said Thomas Schelling, an economist at the University of Maryland.
How, other than taxing cigarettes, might the Government deter teen-age smoking? Perhaps by insisting that stores not sell tobacco to minors, Mr. Bulow said. "But that puts the burden on state and local governments," he reminded -- hardly as popular an idea as handing them freshly collected excise taxes.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Who's Losing Russia?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It can't happen here, but assume our Dow average were to drop substantially. Not just the 10 or 15 percent correction customary after big run-ups, but all the way down to 4,000. What would our reaction be?
After the disbelieving shock would come the rage. Fingers would point at economists who failed to foresee, corporate merger maniacs, bankers and brokers, at surplus budgeteers and muckraking journalists. 
 Most of all, we would fix our fury on the President. Having taken credit for the rain, Bill Clinton would be blamed for the drought. As his popularity plunged, impeachment for other than economic actions would be in the air.
Now let's take a look at Russia. The Russian stock market is the worst-performing market anywhere, down more than 50 percent this year, a panic-stricken 10 percent this week. The young unknown whom Boris Yeltsin put in as Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, has had to raise interest rates to 150 percent to avoid a run on the ruble. Desperate for $2 billion to pay government workers, he put a huge government-owned oil company up for sale, but nobody came to the auction.
And yet the populace has not risen up to demand a change in government. Unlike Americans with pension funds or 401(K) accounts, most Russians are not personally affected by the stock market. And published economic figures on the above-ground economy are misleading because three-quarters of business done in Russia is barter or paid with i.o.u.'s.
What would worry the average Russian most is inflation, which is now relatively low, running about 1 percent a month. That's why Yeltsin's untried new team is desperate to avoid devaluation, pressure for which is building.
Although it would restore some economic equilibrium, devaluing the currency would drive up the price of imports and hit Russians in their pocketbooks, causing political unrest.
The only calls for impeachment of Yeltsin come from the Communists in the Duma they dominate, but that's just a trick: the Constitution forbids the President to dissolve the Duma if it is considering impeachment, and the Communists don't want to face the people yet.
That's because the Communists are stuck at one-fourth of the electorate. Last week's unscientific telephone poll on the popular TV show "Itogi," with 30,000 respondents, showed the Communist Gennadi Zyuganov with only 18 percent; Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, and the newly elected Krasnoyarsk Governor, Aleksandr Lebed, tied for 25 percent, and the Yabloko reform leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, at 32 percent. Yeltsin, whose latest shake-up evidently inspired no confidence, was nowhere.
How does Russia's President restore investor confidence? To keep the wolf from the door, he will seek to borrow more from the International Monetary Fund, grimly promising to collect more taxes from deadbeats.
That's just a palliative. If Yeltsin is to build the global market's confidence, he should tax the state-owned Gazprom, the railways and oil pipeline monopolies; bankrupt Soviet-era collectives and give the farmers their land; reduce and simplify taxes on individuals so he can collect them; close hundreds of tottering banks and make transparent the accounting of the remainder; break the system of official bribery and protect small business from the Mafiya. That's for starters.
Confidence does not come from loans; it's the other way around. When Russia replaces its present crony capitalism with free enterprise under contract law, it will build business confidence. When it stops endangering the world by selling nuclear technology to Iran and allying itself with Iraq, Russia will gain the diplomatic confidence of the Western nation that can do it the most good.
America's national interest is in advancing democracy and competitive capitalism. With the Soviet Union gone, we no longer have to support corrupt, autocratic regimes, as we did Suharto's Indonesia and the Shah's Iran, only because they are non-Communist.
Thanks partly to Yeltsin's courage, Russia is no longer Communist, but largely because of Yeltsin's economic ignorance, his resource-rich land with its literate people is stagnating and imploding. Confidence will overcome panic only when enterprise is freed.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Cut Production Of 747 Jumbo Jets in 1999

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that weakening demand from Asian airlines would probably force it to cut production of its 747 jumbo jet next year. The company also said it still faced difficulties meeting demand for the new version of its popular 737 narrow-body jet.
Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, had been saying for months that the financial crisis in Asia was having only a limited effect on its commercial airplane business. But executives acknowledged yesterday that declining demand from Asian airlines would most likely force the company to reduce production of the 747, its most profitable airplane. 
 Boeing recently began building five 747's a month, up from four a month, to meet orders received two or more years ago. That production rate will likely be reduced next year, but the company said it would not decide until next month.
"We think the rate will be down in mid-'99," said Ronald B. Woodard, president of Boeing's commercial plane unit. "We have to figure out when and where we want to go to."
Many analysts who follow Boeing have been expecting such a move for months. But the announcement still hurt Boeing's stock price. Investors are apparently worried that the worldwide demand for commercial aircraft will be in decline by the time the company overcomes production difficulties that it first disclosed in October. Shares of Boeing fell 75 cents yesterday, to $46.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 17 percent from a high of $56.0625 on April 6.
Paradoxically, the loss of confidence in Boeing stock comes when analysts are beginning to think the company is surmounting the production problems caused by parts shortages, regulatory delays and inexperienced workers.
"The level of disruption and turmoil is clearly declining, and the ability to predict is clearly improving," said Howard A. Rubel, who follows Boeing for Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York.
But the credibility of Boeing's leaders has badly deteriorated in recent months. From the moment the production problems were first disclosed last fall, Boeing managers were upbeat about their ability to rebound only to surprise Wall Street with more bad news.
The company registered its first annual loss in 50 years in 1997, saw profits tumble in this year's first quarter and has taken several pretax charges totaling nearly $3 billion to account for the production problems.
In their monthly production update to reporters and analysts yesterday, Boeing executives said that they still expected to deliver 550 airplanes in 1998 but that deliveries of the new 737 would suffer delays for the rest of the year.
Boeing recently began producing 737's at a pace of 14 a month, up from 7 a month, and plans to increase that to 21 a month later this year. Mr. Woodard said that while more 737 production fell behind schedule the last month, Boeing was still meeting its recovery plan.
"The facts are the situation on the field and our bottlenecks are improving, not getting worse," he said, responding to what he called unfounded reports of a growing number of unfinished 737's parked at Boeing's Renton production center near Seattle.
Earlier this month, Boeing said it would shift some finishing work on some 737's to its Douglas Products Division in Long Beach, Calif. The move upset Boeing's largest union, the International Association of Machinists, which does not represent the California workers. But the company said that it might add a 737 production line in Long Beach.

HEADLINE: Carl H. Builder, 67, an Expert On Military at Rand Corporation

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Carl H. Builder, an analyst with the Rand Corporation whose views on military affairs were widely quoted, died on May 20 at his home in Culver City, Calif. He was 67.
The cause was cancer, said Jess Cook, Rand's director of public information. 
 At his death, Mr. Builder was a senior operations research specialist at Rand, the research concern based in Santa Monica, Calif. He was on its staff for 29 years.
Mr. Builder worked with and advised the Army, the Air Force and Government agencies on aspects of American security policy, contributed to operational doctrines for nonnuclear strategic weapons and was a main designer of an early computer-based military war-games system.
In 1976, an internal memorandum he wrote, in a year off from Rand as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's director of nuclear safeguards, was made public by another Government agency. It said the commission supported the view that safeguards to prevent theft of explosive materials by terrorist or other criminal elements were inadequate.
Mr. Builder was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the commission and the Certificate of Merit by the Air Force Systems Command.
In his analyses, Mr. Builder sometimes emphasized human factors. In the late 1980's he wrote that to halt the search for larger and better intercontinental ballistic missiles would be a blow to the self-image of people who had spent their careers on that kind of weaponry.
"For their sense of personal worth," he said, "people will fight long and hard."
In his highly praised book "The Masks of War: American Military Styles in Strategy and Analysis" (Johns Hopkins, 1989), he wrote, "The military services have acquired personalities of their own that are shaped by their experiences."
In a 1996 interview commenting on the differing severity of the sexual harassment problem in different services, he said: "The Marines and the Army focus on being rough, tough and mean; 'We beat up on people.' In the Air Force, machismo takes a different form -- gallantry, brave aviators in long silk scarves taking off into the wild blue. And in the Navy, much of the machismo is simply facing the elements."
His book "The Icarus Syndrome: the Role of Air Power Theory in the Evolution and Fate of the U.S. Air Force" (Transaction, 1994) was applauded in Public Administration Review as "an excellent and provocative study."
Another book, "Information Technologies and the Future of Land Warfare" (Rand, 1995), by Mr. Builder and Brian Nichiporuk, was praised in Foreign Affairs as a useful contribution "from the think tank world."
A native of Allendale, N.J., Mr. Builder served in the Navy after World War II, attended the United States Naval Academy and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles in the late 1950's.
His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Gabriele Menke; a son, Mark, of Oxnard, Calif.; a daughter, Susannah Lone Horse, who lives in Southern California; six grandchildren; and a brother, Rear Adm. James A. Winnefeld, retired, of Annapolis, Md.

HEADLINE: New Evidence Of China Tie To Clinton Is Asserted

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
In a bid to jumpstart an inquiry hampered by recalcitrant witnesses and staff defections, House Republican investigators today released what they portrayed as further evidence of a Chinese Government connection to President Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996.
Investigators for the panel led by Representative Dan Burton of Indiana said bank records showed that a bookkeeper for a Democratic fund-raiser, Yah Lin Trie, had shared several bank accounts here with two Chinese officials -- a senior executive of a Chinese state-run corporation and a former Chinese Embassy attache in Washington. 
 Investigators acknowledged that the evidence was highly circumstantial. But they decided to release it in part to try to breathe life into Mr. Burton's inquiry, which has been hamstrung by partisan wrangling and strategic missteps.
The bookkeeper, Keshi Zhan, shared a checking account at the International Monetary Fund credit union here with Zhengkang Shao, a senior executive at China Everbright, a financial holdings conglomerate owned by a Chinese state council, according to bank records. From 1988 to 1994, Mr. Shao was a permanent resident of the United States and an economist with the International Monetary Fund.
But the investigators found no evidence that Mr. Shao's money was funneled to the Democratic Party and no connection between Mr. Trie, who was indicted earlier this year, and China Everbright.
Ms. Zhan and Mr. Shao also shared an account with Yongli Su, an attache at the Chinese Embassy until 1992 and a friend of Ms. Zhan.
The disclosures were made by senior investigators for the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, which Mr. Burton heads. The investigators said the information bolstered the so-called "China connection" to the 1996 elections. They said they decided to release the information after recent reports that a Democratic fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, had told the Justice Department that nearly $100,000 in his contributions originated with a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese Army.
Investigators called Mr. Shao an "intriguing figure" who could have important information about "Mr. Trie's money-laundering network."
Mr. Burton said in a statement: "The material developed by the Committee regarding Charlie Trie, Keshi Zhan and others raises serious questions. Did representatives of the Chinese Government have a hand in this conduit contributions scheme or is it all just a coincidence?"
The panel's disclosures also raise new questions about Ms. Zhan, a former clerk for the Arlington County, Va., government and a part-time hostess for Mr. Trie, a former Little Rock restaurateur known as Charlie whose $645,000 in donations to the Democrats were returned when their origins could not be determined. After being granted immunity by the Senate campaign finance committee, Ms. Zhan answered questions under oath for two days.
Ms. Zhan's lawyer, Breckinridge L. Willcox, said: "To me, what Mr. Burton is doing is simply an exercise in completely unwarranted and creative inference building in a desperate search for a Chinese connection. This is a complete joke."
Mr. Willcox said that much of the information released by the House panel was gathered by the Senate campaign finance committee led by Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee.
"They did not view it as evidence of a Chinese connection," he said. "Isn't it ironic that Mr. Burton now views it that way?"
Indeed, there may be other motives for the disclosures. Mr. Burton's committee has been reeling in recent weeks from criticism by Democrats, particularly after the bungled release of audiotapes of Webster L. Hubbell's prison conversations, and the dismissal of the panel's chief investigator, David Bossie.
Much of the attention has shifted away from Mr. Burton's committee since Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed a special select committee, led by Representative Christopher Cox of California, to investigate Clinton Administration policy that has permitted American satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets.
Kevin Binger, Mr. Burton's chief of staff, denied that the disclosures amounted to the panel's final piece of business. "These circumstances raise a lot of questions that have not been answered," Mr. Binger said.
Still, there are signs that Mr. Burton's inquiry is slowing down. Several investigators said in interviews that they intended to leave the committee in the weeks ahead to pursue other opportunities. And the House leadership has said it would like to move to a different House panel the testimony of four witnesses who have been denied immunity by Democrats on the Burton committee.

HEADLINE: Jerry Brown Dominates Oakland Race

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., May 27

 BODY:
Propelled by unbeatable name recognition, unmatchable press attention and a potent appeal to voters willing to try something new and decidedly different, Edmund G. Brown Jr. has zoomed so far ahead in this city's mayoral race that he seems poised to win outright in the primary on June 2, according to a new poll.
The poll, published today in The San Francisco Chronicle, showed that 46 percent of registered voters in Oakland favored Mr. Brown, the former two-term Governor of California, while 30 percent remained undecided. 
 Under the rules of Oakland's nonpartisan primary, Mr. Brown can avoid a November runoff between the top two finishers if he gets more than 50 percent of the vote. The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted by Baldassare Associates from May 21 to 25 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The poll showed that Mr. Brown's nearest challenger in the field of 11, Ed Blakely, an urban planning professor, was favored by 8 percent of voters. Shannon Reeves, president of the Oakland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, came in third, with 5 percent.
Mr. Brown credited his showing in large part to his record as Governor from 1975 to 1983.
"I'd say there's a memory here of a certain period in California politics when I was Governor," he said in an interview today. "It was a time of creativity and inclusiveness, and in the stagnant waters that are engulfing the mediocrity of politics today, that memory has power."
Opponents attributed Jerry Brown's enormous lead to his celebrity wattage, which they said was more blinding than they had anticipated. "It's been virtually impossible for anyone to get any play in this race except Jerry," said Gale Kaufman, a consultant to another mayoral candidate, Ignacio De La Fuente, a City Councilman. "This is the most unusual race I've ever been in. There's just no way of breaking past Jerry. People seem dazzled by him."
If elected, Mr. Brown would be the first white mayor in two decades in Oakland, a city where African-Americans represent the largest racial group but not a majority.
The poll suggested that Oaklanders were ready not only to elect Mr. Brown, but also to grant him more power than other mayors have had. Mr. Brown is about to start circulating a petition to put a referendum on the November ballot that would strengthen the city's weak mayor system, and the poll showed that voters favored that proposal by a margin of 2 to 1. Two years ago, voters defeated a similar proposal.
When Mr. Brown announced the petition drive about two weeks ago, his opponents disparaged it as an act of extraordinary hubris and predicted that it would turn off voters. But Mr. Brown's numbers in the new poll were higher than in the last published poll, in March.
Political analysts noted that Oakland had not participated as fully in the state's current economic boom as other cities and that its residents resented that.

HEADLINE: As India Adds Up Costs of Its A-Tests, Dissent Grows Louder

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 27

 BODY:
Only two weeks after India detonated five underground nuclear tests to popular acclaim, the Hindu nationalists who lead the Government ran into a storm of protest in Parliament today that reflected growing disquiet about the risks and costs of acquiring nuclear weapons.
"The nuclear tests are a great achievement for India, no doubt, but we can't even supply ordinary drinking water and electrical power to the people of this country," said Indrajit Gupta, a Communist. He was Interior Minister in the coalition Government that ran the country for 20 months until March, when a new, 14-party coalition headed by the Hindu nationalists took over. "Where does all this lead to?" he asked. 
 The scene in Parliament, meeting for the first time since the tests, appeared to dismay Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other senior nationalists, who listened in stony silence.
Other signs that the wave of support might be breaking have included several incidents in the capital in the past 48 hours in which angry crowds in areas lacking electricity for days attacked power substations, smashing equipment and beating employees.
In an attack on Monday, a mob in a district that had been without power for 15 days, in temperatures rising above 115 degrees, ransacked a local office of the main Hindu nationalist organization, the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Vajpayee is the party's parliamentary leader.
The attack came 24 hours before the United States, carrying out economic sanctions brought on by the nuclear tests, forced a delay in $865 million in World Bank loans for the upgrading of India's badly outdated, vastly underpowered electricity grid.
Mr. Vajpayee entered Parliament in a subdued mood that contrasted with the triumphalism displayed by many nationalists after the tests. He noted that his Government had declared a "voluntary moratorium" on tests, and renewed an earlier offer by India to sign a pact with Pakistan that would bind each nation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other. He also repeated a longstanding offer to forswear nuclear arms as part of a global pact binding the United States and other nuclear powers to abandon their arsenals.
"India is now a nuclear weapons state; this is a reality that cannot be denied," the Prime Minister said. "It is India's due, the right of one-sixth of humankind. Our strengthened capability adds to our sense of responsibility. We do not intend to use these weapons for aggression or for mounting threats against any country; these are weapons of self-defense, to insure that India is not subjected to nuclear threats or coercion. We do not intend to engage in an arms race."
Immediately after the tests, with polls showing popular support at more than 90 percent, opposition politicians offered only mild dissent. But in today's speeches, shown throughout India on live television, the opposition accused the Government of abandoning Mohandas K. Gandhi's legacy of nonviolence, of isolating India and of courting economic disaster because of the trade, banking and aid sanctions imposed by the United States and others.
The opposition leaders also accused the Hindu nationalists of "inventing" the threats posed by Pakistan and China to justify the tests, and to artificially increase their popularity with a view to holding a new election. In so doing, several opposition spokesmen said, the Vajpayee Government had forged an anti-India axis of three nations, the United States, China and Pakistan, that had all shown signs of wanting stable, friendly relations with India.
"Before the mushroom cloud had died down, you and your ministers were talking about nuclear weaponization, about mounting warheads on missiles, about unfinished agendas and about a fourth war with Pakistan," said Palianappan Chidambaram, a Harvard-educated lawyer who served as Finance Minister in the previous Government. "And if anybody asks why, where is the threat, they are branded as a traitor. That is the depth of your political cynicism."
In the March vote, the Hindu nationalists registered their best result in 50 years. But they won only 26 percent of the popular vote and a little more than a third of the seats in Parliament, forcing them to round up a dozen smaller parties in a governing coalition. Their minority status makes them vulnerable to parliamentary maneuvering by the Congress Party and other long-established groups that oppose the nationalist creed of Hindu supremacy, considering it a threat to India's minorities, especially the 120 million Muslims.
In today's debate, leading opposition figures even accused the Government of risking war through a spate of aggressive warnings about India's enhanced military power that leading nationalists, including Lal Krishna Advani, the Interior Minister, have issued to Pakistan.
Mr. Advani said last week that the tests had "brought about a qualitatively new stage" in relations between India and Pakistan, and that India would adopt a more "pro-active" policy in dealing with Pakistan, especially over the long-running war that Indian troops have been fighting with Pakistan-backed insurgents in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
Mr. Chidambaram, the former Finance Minister, spoke of "people in this Government who would travel down the road to war." And Natwar Singh, a senior Congress Party leader who is a former Foreign Minister, noted that one of Mr. Vajpayee's ministers had suggested that India was prepared to send troops on "hot pursuit" into the part of Kashmir that has been held by Pakistan since the partition of British India in 1947.
"Do you know what the consequences will be?" Mr. Singh said. "The United Nations Security Council will be summoned within minutes, and mandatory sanctions will be imposed on India."
But the central theme was that the Hindu nationalists had betrayed the 350 million Indians who live in dire poverty. Some speakers dwelled on the possible cost of sanctions to India, which some Western economists have put as high as $20 billion; others cited the huge costs involved in developing, deploying and maintaining an arsenal of nuclear missiles.
Many Indian business executives are also worried, and their doubts have been reflected in a steady slide on Indian stock markets, in credit ratings and in the value of the rupee. When markets closed today in Bombay, the country's main financial center, the Indian currency hit a record low for the third day in a row, 41.35 rupees to the dollar, down 4 per cent since May 11, the day of the first nuclear tests.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Recoup Most Losses, With the Dow Off 27 Points

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Asia's continuing financial crisis reverberated around the world yesterday, sending some financial markets into a tailspin and briefly punishing stocks in the United States.
At one point in the afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 175 points, or almost 2 percent, before buyers piled back in, leaving the blue-chip index down just 27 points for the day. The market's action followed a down day on Tuesday, when the Dow fell 150.71. 
 Political uncertainty in Indonesia, banking and economic woes in Japan, a labor strike in South Korea and recessionary warnings from Hong Kong's chief executive helped push jittery investors to the exits.
Russia, in deepening financial trouble, tripled its overnight lending rate in hope of restoring lost confidence in the ruble and stemming the outflow of capital. European stock indexes fell across the board.
The combination of events signaled to American investors that Asia remained a wild card that could reduce corporate profits here.
"Asia rearing its now ugly head spooked the market a bit," said Rick White, a managing director and portfolio manager for Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York. "It made people focus on the fact that earnings for the year are probably too high."
Companies are reluctant to gauge what the impact of Asia's financial woes will be or how long the negative effects may last. But National Semiconductor, Callaway Golf, Kent Electronics, Analog Devices, Boeing and Ford have all hinted that the effects of the Asian malaise could carry into the second half of the year, jeopardizing forecasts for corporate earnings growth.
Yesterday, the Boeing Company confirmed what some analysts had anticipated, telling investors that the Asian troubles might force it to cut production of the 747 jumbo jet, its most profitable aircraft, as orders from the Pacific region weaken for 1999.
Slowing Asian demand also led Matt Berler, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, to lower his second-quarter and full-year 1998 estimates for several paper and forest-products companies, including Boise Cascade, International Paper and Georgia-Pacific. In lowering his forecasts, Mr. Berler warned that pricing and volume would remain under pressure because of the strong dollar and weak Asian markets.
At the Ford Motor Company's annual meeting earlier this month, the chairman, Alexander Trotman, warned that the automobile industry had yet to feel the full impact of Asia's weakness, which could lead to lower prices and rising auto imports.
More companies may sound alarms in coming weeks as the Asian economic turmoil shows few signs of improving soon, despite initial hopes of a quick recovery.
"A normal business cycle would dictate a recovery in 12 to 18 months -- but this is anything but normal," said Jesper Koll, an economist with J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. "The risk of a long and drawn-out adjustment process is pretty high. It's not meaningful to talk about a bottom yet."
Last October, Morgan forecast that Asia's emerging markets would grow about 6.5 percent. That forecast is now about 1.4 percent, Mr. Koll said, adding that he expected 6 of 11 countries in that region, excluding Australia and Japan, to see declines.
"People had become less concerned about the Far East almost to the point of believing that there's nothing to worry about," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. But "if you do your homework, you know there's not much growth" in the region.
In United States equity markets, analysts expect earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to increase by 4.3 percent in the second quarter, according to data compiled by I.B.E.S. International. Their forecast rises as high as 12.7 percent growth in the third quarter and 17 percent in the fourth quarter, with corporate growth ending the full year at 8.4 percent. Estimates compiled by First Call, a competing firm, put annual growth a little higher, around 10 percent, said Chuck Hill, research director.
But Joseph Abbott, an I.B.E.S. equity analyst, expects earnings to grow 4.5 percent this year. Referring to the more optimistic forecasts, he said, "We do believe it will come in much slower than that, primarily due to a slowdown in Asia" and the weaker currencies in the region.
Companies most likely to see earnings falter as the result of weak Asian demand include semiconductor makers. David Wu, an analyst with ABN Amro, has lowered earnings forecasts for several companies, including Applied Materials, Novellus Systems and Lam Research because of their vulnerability to Asian economic conditions.
"Everybody has Asia exposure and everybody's in trouble," Mr. Wu said. The next 12 months are not going to bring a lot of good news."
Other likely candidates include companies in the energy, aerospace and military goods industries. According to a recent Morgan Stanley Dean Witter research report, these companies generated more than 10 percent of their revenue in 1996 from Asia, excluding Japan.
The Asian fiscal crisis may also force American investors to realize that a rosy economic expectation of slower economic growth and low inflation may not translate into strong corporate earnings, said George Jacobsen, chief investment strategist with Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen in New York.
"The economy's been expanding since 1991," he said, "and people have come to expect that as long as the economy's good, corporate profits will grow and stock prices will rise."
Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, believes that a further deterioration in Asia could provoke a 10 percent pullback in the market, sending the Dow Jones industrials down to 8,000.
The Dow closed yesterday at 8,936.57, down 27.16 points, its lowest level since April 28. The S.& P. 500 slipped 1.79 to 1,092.23, but the Nasdaq composite index gained 3.01 points, closing at 1,781.10. All made marked comebacks in the last hour or so of trading.

 Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday, erasing earlier gains, as stocks recovered much of their losses.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 103 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.84 percent from 5.83 percent.
Treasury prices were kept in check in part as investors digested $13 billion of new two-year notes sold yesterday by the Treasury. Today, it auctions $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, the new five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.54 percent.
Following are the results of the auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Next 'Asian' Crisis?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The financial panic that struck Russia today had distinctly Russian causes: the Government cannot collect taxes, it suffers from an economy that is nearly moribund and it has an untested new economic team. But in Washington the Russian crisis looks very much like the next phase of the Asian crisis.
In fact, the two are related. In recent days, as President Suharto was being toppled in Indonesia, the yen was falling in Tokyo and workers were striking in South Korea against long-delayed layoffs, investors began to fear that Asia's troubles were far from over and could easily spread to other emerging markets. 
 In that atmosphere, a senior American official said today, "Russia is particularly vulnerable."
Like Indonesia, it has a rocky banking system. Like South Korea last November, it is seeing its foreign currency reserves dwindling to alarming levels. Russia's foreign debt of $145 billion is not huge as a percentage of its economy, but lenders around the world are clearly unwilling to put more on the line.
And while the economic plan put together by Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has impressed American officials, no one yet knows whether the 35-year-old handpicked by President Boris N. Yeltsin has the clout to turn reform into reality.
"Russia is facing substantial financial strains, arising from a combination of factors," a senior Treasury official said today. But he tried to dampen speculation that it was about to suffer an Asian-style meltdown, suggesting that Moscow might rise to the challenge -- much as Brazil did last fall when it appeared to be in danger of catching the Asian flu.
He may be right. Russia's recent economic history has been a series of narrow escapes after flirtations with disaster. It has repeatedly gone to the brink, requiring assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
But if its economy requires massive help anytime soon, it is not clear where the assistance might come from. Pinned down in Asia, the International Monetary Fund -- the world's lender of last resort -- says it is strapped for cash.
The monetary fund estimates that it has only $10 billion to $15 billion easily available to fight another national meltdown. Congress has declined so far to commit $16 billion more to the fund, and until Washington acts, other governments refuse to increase their contributions.
So if Russia's troubles deepen, the I.M.F.'s remaining reserves could prove insufficient to support the Russian currency and help the country meet its debt payments.
After all, South Korea needed a bailout package that totaled more than $50 billion from the fund and other sources, though only a fraction of that has been spent so far. And its economy is far healthier and more developed than Russia's.
Clinton Administration officials insisted today that they had not discussed using American funds to help the Russians out, even with the kind of backup financing offered to Indonesia and Korea.
Instead, the Americans are offering plenty of private advice and public encouragement designed to calm the markets. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers visited Mr. Kiriyenko 10 days ago, and the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said today that Washington was confident that the Russian Government was "capable of leading the economy in a direction of successful economic growth."
But unlike Washington, the world's currency traders and investors do not dwell on Russia's strategic importance or its nuclear capabilities. They are interested in hard evidence that the country can pay its debts. And these days, they have a lot of reason for doubt.
Declining oil prices have cut into the country's revenues and prevented Russia from getting the price it wanted at the auction of the last big Government-owned oil company. The outlook has worsened with disturbances triggered by coal miners and with the Government's inability to force profitable companies to pay their taxes.
While none of those problems are particularly new, the revival of the Asian crisis -- which makes investors nervous about any emerging market -- is creating a bad case of economic contagion.
"The markets are just waking up to the fact that the Asian crisis is far from over, and in some places it is getting worse," Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank, said recently, before Russia's problems took center stage. "People just pull their horns in. They are much more attuned to risk than they were even a few months ago."
The connections are more than psychological. Among the heaviest investors in Russia were the South Koreans, who lent to the country and began to build factories there as part of their strategy of isolating North Korea from its onetime ally. Now, with the South Korean stock market at an 11-year low and South Korean manufacturers cutting back around the world, that source has dried up.
Once there was hope that Japan would see Russia as an enormous opportunity, within sight of its northern islands. But with Japanese banks reeling and the Japanese currency in rapid decline, there is little hope that Japan will help anyone but itself.
So for Russia, the next few days are critical. Its decision to jack up the interest rate paid by its central bank to more than 150 percent was meant to send a message that Russia will defend the ruble. But it cannot afford to pay such rates for long.
It must somehow convince investors that Mr. Kiriyenko's reform plan to cut spending and raise revenues is about to become reality. Otherwise, Russia could suffer the fate of many of Asia's high-flyers.

Antitrust Suit Against Intel Prepared by Regulators
The Federal Trade Commission is readying a major antitrust suit against Intel, charging the company with abusing its position as the dominant manufacturer of microprocessor chips for personal computers and bullying some computer makers, lawyers said.
The suit marks the second front in the Federal Government's antitrust assault on Wintel, as the computer juggernaut built around Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessors is known. Microsoft was sued last week. Page A1.

HEADLINE: MOSCOW ATTEMPTS DRASTIC MEASURES TO SAVE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 27

 BODY:
As Russia's financial markets teetered on the brink of collapse, Moscow mounted a drastic effort today to preserve the value of its currency and stem the exodus of foreign investors.
In a quick series of steps to address the new Russian Government's most serious economic crisis, officials tripled interest rates, announced that they would be willing to accept a far lower price for the sell-off of Russia's last big oil company, and appealed for support from the International Monetary Fund. 
 "This will become a cold shower on those who are counting on the weakness of the Government and the Bank of Russia," said Sergei Dubinin, the head of the Russian central bank.
All week, Russia's financial markets have been under siege as fears have mounted among investors and United States officials that the economic turmoil in Asia would spread to Russia.
The Moscow stock market is now the world's worst performing market, off more than 50 percent this year, bond prices are declining and efforts to boost the ruble by buying up the currency on the open market have cost more than $1 billion over the past week from a cash reserve that is alarmingly low.
The swoon in the markets has also turned into a profound political crisis here and has become a major worry for American policymakers who have thrown their support behind President Boris N. Yeltsin's reform Government.
Mr. Yeltsin has staked the credibility of his new team on defending the value of the ruble, which for ordinary Russians is the ultimate barometer of the nation's economic and political health.
The value of the ruble determines what many everyday staples cost. A failure to stabilize the currency could lead to a devaluation and a chain reaction of debt problems for the Russian Government, bank failures, inflation and political unrest.
If ordinary Russians joined the foreign investors who are exchanging their rubles for dollars it would be extremely difficult for the central bank to maintain the current ruble-dollar exchange rates.
Against a backdrop of a currency crisis in Indonesia that led to the resignation last week of President Suharto, and a widespread belief that Asia's economic troubles are far from over, nervous investors are increasingly shunning markets in developing countries like Russia.
Today those jitters had an effect all over the world as stock markets fell from Hong Kong to Frankfurt, from London to New York fell.
In Russia, "the market has crashed," said Mark Mobius, money manager for Templeton Worldwide Inc. "We are seeing a so-called meltdown."
Most analysts agree that Mr. Yeltsin's new young Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, has worked hard to reduce the nation's budget deficit with a series of proposed spending cuts, though tax collection remains a major problem.
Now, the focus of the crisis is the ruble and the reserves the central bank has on hand to boost its value.
Today, the bank disclosed that its reserves have dwindled to about $14 billion. However, about $4.5 billion of those reserves are in gold and are not readily available to spend to prop up the currency.
Last October, by comparison, the central bank's reserves were about $23 billion.
As the reserves have shrunk, foreign investors have become increasingly worried that the Government would be forced to devalue the currency.
There are some additional sources of funds -- though they may be far too modest to put out the financial fire. The International Monetary Fund is expected shortly to approve the next $700 million disbursement of its $10 billion loan. So far Russia has received $5.2 billion of the three-year loan. Russia may also be able to obtain financing through commercial banks.
"We have some proposals from the biggest private banks," Oleg Vyugin, the Deputy Finance Minister, said today in an interview. "We have to consider whether that would be useful or not."
Also, the Government hopes to press ahead with the auction of state property. Mr. Kiriyenko cancelled the sale of Rosneft, the big oil company, after the Government failed to receive a single bid by the Tuesday deadline.
But today, Russian officials said that a new auction would be quickly arranged with an asking price of $1.6 to $1.7 billion instead of $2.1 billion, a cut of more than 19 to 24 percent. The Government said it hopes to announce a winner by the middle of next month.
Still, a growing chorus of Russian officials and foreign investors think a large bailout, akin to the rescue packages for Indonesia and South Korea, may be required.
"Russia desperately needs some kind of standby facility," said Marc Holtzman, the president of corporate finance for ABN AMRO, a major Dutch bank. "The Russian Government has done a very commendable job to date. The I.M.F. has to take some decision action."
Prime Minister Kiriyenko has also talked about the need for additional assistance from the Monetary Fund to help it restructure its debts.
Mr. Kiriyenko spoke by telephone last night with Michel Camdessus, the Fund's managing director, who is attending a conference in Kyrgyzstan.
After that conversation, the Fund's chief Russian specialist, John Odling-Smee, was dispatched to Moscow. But the Fund tried to play down the seriousness of the Russian financial situation and it was unclear whether it would be willing to provide more aid.
"Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining, this is not a crisis," Mr. Camdessus said. "This is not a major development."
The perception in Moscow, however, was very different. Russia's stock market, which was already seriously depressed, plummeted more than 10 percent today.
Meanwhile, interest rates on Russian Treasury bills have soared to almost 90 percent, as the central bank tries to attract investors to buy the securities. Russia depends heavily on the sale of Treasury bills to finance its budget deficit.
The latest financial shocks reflect investors' anxiety over emerging markets, declining world oil prices and Russia's difficult negotiations with the Monetary Fund. But they were also sparked by the Government's failure on Tuesday to receive any bids for Rosneft, a development that many investors took at a vote of no-confidence on the Russian economy.
The most dramatic increase came today when the central bank tripled its refinancing rate, an interest rate it charges on loans to banks, to 150 percent from 50 percent.
Boosting that rate, in effect, encourages investors to hold rubles and discourages investors who have rubles from selling them for dollars.
Mr. Yeltsin plans to meet with Mr. Kiriyenko, Mr. Dubinin, and his Finance Minister on Thursday. Russian officials said that the Kremlin was weighing various steps, including a Presidential speech, to try to calm the markets.
Meanwhile, Mr. Yeltsin's foes sought to exploit the financial crisis. Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist leader, describe the financial crunch as a "national catastrophe."
Before he left for Moscow, Mr. Odling-Smee, the expert at the Monetary Fund insisted that there was no need to devalue the ruble.
"There is no objective case for devaluing the ruble in terms of Russia's competitiveness or exports and the likely medium to long-term flows of capital," Mr. Odling-Smee said

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Out of the Shadow of a Noted Family Name

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
PEGGY DULANY was always considered one of the more unorthodox "Cousins," as the fourth-generation Rockefellers are known, although she was utterly orthodox when it came to family rebellion. Ms. Dulany joined the S.D.S. at Harvard, lived in a squatters' colony in Brazil and was among the first to drop the Rockefeller name for Dulany, her middle name from her mother's side. In the 1980's she met Oliver Tambo, the president of the African National Congress.
"I told him I wanted to do something," Ms. Dulany recalled. "And he said, 'Don't get arrested outside the South African Embassy.' Of course that was what I was thinking of doing. But he said, 'We have plenty of people who can do that. What we don't have is people with connections to the business community.' And it gradually gave me the notion that there could be a role helping people across gaps." Change at the "grass roots" was fine, Ms. Dulany concluded, "but that's not where my value-added was." 
 Sounds sensible for a Rockefeller.
Ms. Dulany smiled. "It only took 20 years to figure out," she said.
Ms. Dulany, 50, is now the founder and chairman of Synergos, a small Manhattan-based nonprofit group -- built on her considerable connections -- that works to alleviate poverty in the developing world. Her father is David Rockefeller, the former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Her great-grandfather was John D. Rockefeller Sr., the founder of Standard Oil. On Tuesday night Synergos (pronounced sin-AIR-gose) gave a dinner at the United Nations. Kofi A. Annan, the Secretary General, came; so did James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank.
Yesterday at noon, in her offices at Park Avenue and 85th Street, Ms. Dulany talked for an hour about Synergos and her family. It is, after all, a time of renewed debate about the Rockefeller legacy.
Consider this: At exactly the same hour, Ron Chernow, the author of "Titan," a new biography of John D. Sr., talked at the University Club about his subject's "visionary" philanthropy.
"In the 19th century, rich people typically gave money in a sentimental or haphazard way to their alma maters or to museums or to local hospitals, which they still do," Mr. Chernow said afterward. But John D. Sr., he said, went from "retail" to "wholesale" philanthropy, creating Spelman College in Atlanta, the University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Foundation.
MS. DULANY said that Synergos had no ambitions on that scale -- its annual budget is $2 million -- but that she was proud of her family for creating "perm-anent institutions" for social change.
"Money has a finite use if it's not used in a constructive way," she said. She has also learned -- from her father and her uncles Nelson and John D. Rockefeller 3d -- that "even if I could provide all the funding for an organization, which I couldn't, it's not a good idea.
"Because then people say, 'Oh, that's just a Rockefeller-funded organization. They don't need money.' Which sometimes people say anyway."
In the decade since Synergos was founded, Ms. Dulany has contributed more than $1 million of her own money, but not more than 10 percent of the yearly budget. (Other contributors are Fortune 500 companies, foundations, Unicef and Dwayne O. Andreas, the friend and donor to many Republicans.)
Ms. Dulany is thoughtful, serious and wary. She would probably be happier not having to talk about her family at all -- she said she has not yet read "Titan" and finds the comparisons of Microsoft to Standard Oil only "vaguely interesting" -- but seems to accept it as her fate. She billed the Synergos dinner as a "University for a Night," and instructed each table to discuss a pre-selected world problem, which friends say was classic Peggy. At her father's table, the question was: "What can business leaders do to raise the living standards of the poorest in the United States and abroad?"
Ms. Dulany said that some of the best work of Synergos was in Ecuador, where her group helped create a foundation that trained 1,200 women who make what Americans call Panama hats. The women formed a cooperative, eliminated the middlemen, found their own source of straw and developed markets in Europe. Ms. Dulany grew up in Manhattan and spent weekends at Pocantico Hills, the Rockefeller estate in Tarrytown, N.Y. (She still does, although she now has her own house on the Upper East Side. She has a 21-year-old son, Michael, a student at Northwestern University, and is separated from her second husband.) She earned a masters and doctorate from the Harvard School of Education and for six years ran an alternative high school near Boston. In the early 1980's, she moved back to New York and worked at the New York City Partnership, a civic organization; her father was then its chairman. Ms. Dulany looks back on the move as the end of her rebellion against the family.
"I think my willingness to come back to New York and work with the partnership was an indication that I was ready to use the access that my part of this family provided me," she said.
If she had it to do over again, would she prefer not to live life as a Rockefeller? "I don't think I like that question," she said, more or less pleasantly. "If I had the chance to rewrite anything, I would have preferred to have figured out sooner to make use of the cards that were dealt to me."

HEADLINE: Giving Money Local Color;
A Small Connecticut Town Issues Its Own Currency To Urge Hometown Spending

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: WILLIMANTIC, Conn.

 BODY:
At the end of a 60-foot mahogany bar under a celestial 21-foot ceiling, Cindy Wollner watched the final lunchtime stragglers seep out of her new restaurant and fingered a few bills, part of the afternoon's take.
But the image on the lavender notes wasn't a portrait of George Washington, or even Thomas Jefferson, but an engraving of a covered wagon and three pioneers; the bills' motto declared not "In God We Trust," but "In Community We Trust." 
 "It's real money in this town," explained Ms. Wollner, who runs her restaurant, the Willimantic Brewing Company, in a gray, granite monolith that once was a United States post office. "It's worth 10 real dollars. And we take it for 100 percent of a bill."
Even as much of Europe is moving to rip down national monetary systems with the creation of the euro, a currency that will start circulating in 11 European countries in 1999, a small but growing number of communities in the United States and Canada are digging small monetary moats around their towns and villages.
In more than 60 municipalities, groups of citizens, some with broad political agendas to increase local activism, others looking to keep money in their economically troubled communities, have begun printing and issuing their own currency. In Hot Springs, N.C., much business is done in Mountain Money. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, there are Maritime Hours. And in Bolinas, Calif., a bit of trading is done in Sand Dollars.
And here in New England, as well as in New York State, a peppering of towns have well-entrenched systems of local currencies or, in some cases, fledgling efforts just taking shaky wing.
"This is a way people are using to rebuild communities without going to Washington, or to their local governments," said Lewis Solomon, a law professor at Georgetown University who has studied both the economics and legalities of local currencies. "The foundation of this is that the U.S. currency is not backed by gold, but by trust. In the same way, local currencies are backed by community trust, by goods and services in the community."
Crucially, said Mr. Solomon, such currency systems are perfectly legal in this country, because there are no laws barring citizens from issuing their own currencies in their communities. But the Internal Revenue Service requires that all earnings in these currencies be declared in United States dollars for tax purposes.
Here in Connecticut, where little towns straddle two-lane rural highways, the city of Willimantic sits hard against the rush of the spring-swollen Willimantic River. In the last century, that river brought industry here, its waters driving the great water wheels of the American Thread Company, once one of the nation's largest thread manufacturers.
But in the 1980's, the last of the mills closed. Unemployment rose and lights in the storefronts of Main Street's stretch of two- and three-story red brick buildings began winking off. Even the monolithic granite post office closed.
At City Hall, a red-brick pile of Victorian architecture, the first selectman, Walter M. Pawelkiewicz, has worked to get urban redevelopment grants to renovate the old mills. "Since '93," Mr. Pawelkiewicz said as he slumped in a leather armchair in an office piled with sheaves of project time lines, artists' renderings and unreturned phone messages, "we've been trying to do a lot of regional economic development. Our whole notion in the mill project is capture a biotech park."
But elsewhere in town, a group of citizens decided that it should do something besides wait for the state to pump millions of dollars into the town. So last summer, Donna Nicolino, the director of a local arts council, gathered about a dozen peopletogether, including a business consultant, the manager of the local food cooperative and some faculty from the local college, Eastern Connecticut State University, and decided to print their own money.
They called it Thread City Bread.
"There were a lot of businesses opening up on Main Street and then closing down," Ms. Nicolino said. "It's hard to be a small business person in this town. So we thought this was a way to keep the wealth in the community."
Modeling the town's currency on a similar system in Ithaca, N.Y., where a local currency has been in use for seven years, Ms. Nicolino had two bills designed, one for a single unit of Thread City Bread and one for a quarter unit, with each unit pegged at $10 in American currency.
"We liked the idea of everyone's labor being of equal value," she said. "Of course, people set the rate for their work differently, but the exchange is in our currency." Most systems using local currencies peg each unit, also called hours, at a value of $10, roughly keyed to double the minimum wage, asserting a shared belief that the minimum wage is too low.
Under the system of local money used in Willimantic, and elsewhere, the local currency is distributed in a rigidly controlled manner to businesses and service providers who agree to participate in the system. Those businesses can give change in Thread City Bread to willing customers. The businesses will also accept the local currency for up to 100 percent of their goods and services. The business people often use the local currency in one another's businesses, much like a barter system. "This is to let people know that they have some alternative to the dollar economy if that isn't working for them," Ms. Nicolino said.
For businesspeople like Ms. Wollner, the restaurant owner who is one of the leaders of the Downtown Business Council, which represents the interests of local merchants, spending the local currency they take in is not necessarily easy because not all businesses accept it. A local directory lists about 100 businesses and individuals who will take the bills.
Willimantic's experiment with local currency is barely a year old and some people think it has a long way to go before it is widely accepted. In Ithaca, however, the system is deeply embedded in the community.
Founded by a bearded, graying environmentalist named Paul Glover, the Ithaca Hours currency is accepted at more than 350 businesses in the town of 30,000 people. "We're looking for control over our local economy," Mr. Glover said. "People are less comfortable with control of their economy by distant elites who will invest or disinvest at the snap of a finger without concern for the fate of communities."
But unlike other forms of community advocacy, the local currency systems are in many ways politically diverse, appealing to and used by people with a spectrum of political and economic views.
Indeed, a key member of the Ithaca Hours advisory board, a sort of central bank that is informally called the Municipal Reserve System, is a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Monica Hargraves.
"I came here in 1995," Ms. Hargraves said, "and I was amazed that this worked. It's trust that holds the system together, the confidence that people will accept Ithaca Hours."
So far, there are the equivalent of $65,000 in Ithaca Hours in circulation. But not unlike the concerns of the Federal Reserve, the committee that oversees the issuance of the currency wrestles continually with questions of economic liquidity, money supply and economic benefits.
"At the moment," Ms. Hargraves said, "there's a debate over are there enough Hours out there. It's really hard to get the data that one would want. The Federal Reserve has an enormous data-gathering apparatus and a long track record on how much money is right. The question is tricky even if you have a lot of data. So we end up with little alternative to a fairly anecdotal process."
Back in Willimantic, about halfway down the half-shuttered Main Street, Bruce Carver padded across the 1890 oak floorboards of his toy store, With a Wink and a Smile, to show a customer a windup yellow tin automobile. "This is a bit of a retro toy store," Mr. Carver said with a laugh. "No battery toys here."
But like a growing number of merchants in town, Mr. Carver, who tends his menagerie of stuffed animals, shelves of windup toys and bins of kites with the fastidiousness of an organic gardener, said he welcomed Thread City Bread.
"It's our local money," he said. "There's not enough around. There should be more, and I hope we'll see more. It's one of the ways I see us being able to bring this town back. It's good stuff."

A Frenzy of Global Anxiety Kicks Up Dust That Had Been Settling

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Investors stampeded in and out of financial markets around the world yesterday, raising new concerns about the global reverberations of the Asian economic crisis that began nearly a year ago.
Such heightened uncertainties helped further deflate a financial rebound in developing countries that began earlier this year. Now, the outlook for these emerging markets has grown even cloudier because of severe problems in Russia. 
 Russia, moving to keep investors from abandoning its shaky economy, tripled interest rates to 150 percent yesterday as its stock market plummeted 11 percent. That led to a dizzying wave of global speculation that roiled stock markets and currency exchange rates elsewhere.
The Brazilian stock market, down nearly 5 percent at one point, finished the day up 2.46 percent. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average ended only marginally lower after falling as much as 1 percent during the day. Markets in other countries weakened more substantially.
Hong Kong's chief executive warned of a looming recession as the stock market there plunged 5.3 percent. Japan's stock market fell 1.4 percent, Germany's dropped 3.1 percent, France's 2.4 percent and Britain's 1.7 percent.
At its midday break today, Japan's Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 122.52 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent. The South Korean market was up 4.09 percent early today, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 81.14 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Economists and analysts have a bleak term for financial problems that seep out of one country and begin to swamp the economies of other nations: "contagion." While it is still unclear whether full-blown financial contagion is afoot, analysts are finding little to be optimistic about overseas.
"As I look at it with a broad brush, there are a lot of things going south at the same time," said Morris Goldstein, a former International Monetary Fund official and a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "Where's the good news coming from? There's no silver bullet out there."
Without good news, nervous investors are quick to seek safe havens. And in an era when vast amounts of capital can be moved swiftly around the globe merely by tapping a computer keyboard, bad news can have rapid and brutal economic consequences.
Currency traders said they were finding shelter in strong currencies like the Swiss franc, German mark and United States dollar. That has put pressure on weaker currencies like the South African rand, the South Korean won, the Mexican peso, and, of course, the Russian ruble.
"The Russian situation is serious indeed, and they've made it clear they're going to defend the ruble at all costs," said Chris Turner, a currency analyst with I.D.E.A., an economics consulting firm in New York. "Foreigners own about $15 billion of Russian treasury bills, and the Russians are trying to discourage them from pulling out."
Traders also said Russia's precarious financial position helped cause sell-offs of the Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and the Czech koruna.
Russian officials in recent days have expressed confidence about the nation's economic prospects.
"Those who have been speculating in the Russian market have shown a little nervousness," Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian Minister of Foreign affairs and current member of the Parliament of the Russian Federation, said in a recent interview. "But those companies that are long-term investors, I don't think they will run out. They know better, and I think they will tell you that there will be a growing market in Russia.
"I think there is a high-percentage chance that the Government will be able to keep the currency stable. We are faced with an unfortunate combination of low oil prices and Asian market turmoil. That has probably scared some investors, who have extrapolated their fears about the Asian markets to Russia. But that is not justified."
Such explanations do not necessarily offer reassurance to American investors who have watched their holdings in Russia go from a stellar performance last year to disastrous losses in recent weeks.
For example, Lexington Troika Russia fund, a mutual fund that invests primarily in Russia, was the fourth-best performing equity fund in the United States last year, gaining 67.5 percent. But the fund's value has fallen 45 percent from the beginning of the year through Tuesday.
Similarly, the value of several closed-end funds that invest in Russia and Eastern Europe have declined sharply. (A closed-end fund invests like a mutual fund, but its shares are traded on a stock exchange.) Shares of the Templeton Russia fund, which had $150 million in assets at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest such fund devoted to Russian investment, fell $1.1875 yesterday, to $24.9375, down 39 percent since the beginning of the year and down 63 percent from a high of $64.75 last July.
Mark Mobius, who manages the Templeton Russia fund, told Bloomberg News that the Russian stock market "has crashed." Although Mr. Mobius said Templeton would continue investing in Russia, he said "we are seeing a so-called meltdown" in the financial markets there.
The first companies to feel the downdraft from the emerging-market turmoil are financial services firms because they are the most directly connected to economic problems ravaging those markets. So it was no surprise that the stocks of American banks and brokerage firms were battered yesterday by fears about potential losses from overseas operations.
The Bankers Trust Corporation, which has a significant presence in Asia, was hit hardest. Its shares fell $5.75, or 4.38 percent, to $125.5625. The BankBoston Corporation, which has a big presence in Latin America, dropped $3.9375, or 3.56 percent, to $106.8125. Citicorp fell $4, to $148.875; the Chase Manhattan Corporation fell $3.25, to $136.0625, and J. P. Morgan & Company fell $3.375, to $126.6875. The brokerage giant Merrill Lynch & Company fell $3.5625, to $88.50, and American International Group dropped $1.4375, to $124.25.
"There seems to be a capital panic in all of the emerging markets," said David Berry, a banking analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. "We were all feeling better in April about bank exposure to emerging markets, but maybe we're all a little guilty of taking our eye off the ball."
In a recent report, Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc., noted that most United States banks operating in Asia have been hesitant to establish reserves that would provide a buffer if Asian financial problems worsened because the banks have been optimistic about an economic rebound in the region.
"The point is that, when there's a shock to the system, bankers generally assume it to be abnormal," Mr. Peabody said. "It is only after a certain period of time has passed that the 'abnormality' then becomes a 'reality.' Bottom line: The full economic impact of the Asian crisis has yet to be fully reflected in banks' earnings reports."

Inside Intel, Latest Setbacks Provoke Worries

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Immortal. Beloved.
That's how investors see the Intel Corporation, the world's premier maker of microprocessors, the guts that run computers. Even though the stock has fallen 21 percent from its February high, Intel has remained one of the most widely held and deeply loved stocks in America. For many investors Intel is not just a stock, it's a religion. 
 This reverence is not without reason. Intel dominates the chip business: its microprocessors power 85 percent to 90 percent of the world's computers. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has generated average annual earnings increases of 42 percent over the last five years. Its sales have risen 34 percent annually during that period to $25 billion last year. Profitability has also been immense: in 1997, net profit margins came in at almost 28 percent, versus 13 percent for the semiconductor industry.
But Intel's industry dominance has attracted the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission, which is expected to file an antitrust suit against the company within the next week. At question is whether the company abused its position as the dominant producer of chips for personal computers and whether it bullied some computer makers, according to lawyers familiar with the suit.
What impact would an antitrust action have on Intel's business? Not much initially. But over the longer term, being embroiled in a battle with the Government could take its toll.
Scott Randall, who tracks semiconductor stocks and is a principal of Soundview Financial Group, says the Government must have great confidence in its case against Intel because the commission investigated the company previously, between 1991 and 1993, but took no action. It wouldn't want to come up empty-handed again, he said.
The company says it has done nothing wrong. "We believe that we have behaved legally and that we continue to behave legally," said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman.
But Intel could suffer tremendously if the Government's suit resulted in, say, guidelines on the company's technological advancements. "The industry changes so fast that to be under any constraint about what the technology could migrate to would be a nightmare," Mr. Randall said.
The job of steering Intel falls to Craig R. Barrett, who took over the chief executive's job from longtime leader Andrew S. Grove, just last week.
Even without the F.T.C. pressure, Intel was facing much stronger headwinds than it had only two years ago. Circumstances beyond Intel's control -- a sharp drop in demand for personal computers, turmoil in Asian economies, a sharp increase in competition from other chip makers -- pose serious threats to Intel's hegemony and to its shares. "Intel has lost control of its market," said William J. Milton, semiconductor analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Adding to the anxiety surrounding the company: some Intel insiders seem to be losing faith in their company's stock. During the last six months, insider selling has picked up.
Intel stock, which fell 37.5 cents in heavy trading yesterday, to $74.3125, is already well off its 1998 high of $94.19. But trading at around 24 times expected 1998 earnings of $3.15 a share, the stock is not cheap, especially given that revenues, flat for the last five quarters, actually fell 7 percent in the first quarter of 1998. Margins are falling as well: Operating income dropped from 44 percent of sales in the first quarter of 1997 to 32 percent this year.
The company has stated that although near-term prospects are gloomy, sales will pick up in the second half of the year on back-to-school and holiday purchases. Most Wall Street analysts are buying the "things are looking up" argument. Of the 47 investment-firm analysts following the company, 31 have buy recommendations on the stock; 14 call it a "hold," and only 2 analysts advise selling.
One skeptic is Larry Woods, an independent technology analyst in Stony Creek, Ontario, and author of The Tech Review newsletter. He said: "Investors are paying more for less and less profitability at Intel. The stock holds up because Wall Street analysts say that everything will be sweet in the second half. I say nonsense."
Analysts are notoriously upbeat, of course. And their optimism grows even rosier the further out their estimates go. For example, according to First Call, the consensus estimate for Intel's first quarter among analysts following the company back in July 1997 was $1.13 a share. Six months later, when the new year rolled in, the consensus had fallen to 93 cents a share. The actual number Intel reported for the quarter: 81 cents a share.
What most Wall Street analysts don't want to talk about is how much Intel's world has changed. Gone are the days when Intel had virtually no competition. Today, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is producing an impressive chip called the K-6 that in many measurements matches the speed of Intel's Pentiums at a price 25 percent less. And National Semiconductor's Cyrix chips -- the higher-priced Media GX and lower-priced MII's -- are winning converts.
Computer manufacturers that once put only Intel chips inside their boxes are moving to other suppliers. Compaq Computer, the world's largest computer maker, and I.B.M., the No. 2, are using Advanced Micro Devices chips as well as those from Cyrix. I.B.M. is making its own chips and chips for Advanced Micro to compete with Intel, too. And last week, Packard Bell-NEC, the world's fifth-largest PC producer, announced that it was ending its exclusive use of Intel chips in its machines. Its new supplier: National Semiconductor's Cyrix, at much lower prices.
Increased competition isn't Intel's only problem. The company, which got the majority of its revenues from Pentium and related board products last year, is selling into a computer market that is becoming saturated. In spite of PC price cuts in the neighborhood of 50 percent, the portion of American households owning computers has inched up only 3 percentage points over the past year and a half to 43 percent.
According to PC Data Inc., a research company that tracks the industry, PC sales in April were up only 6 percent from a year earlier, way down from the double-digit increases that computer makers have grown accustomed to in recent years. The slowdown appears to be worsening: compared with March 1998, unit sales were down 31 percent in April and revenues fell 30 percent.
Those computers that do sell go for bargain-basement prices, not a positive factor for manufacturers' margins. The average selling price of a PC at retail is now about $1,000, down from the $2,200 average for the past few years. Even Dell Computer, the industry's stellar performer, saw its average sales price for a PC drop 9 percent in the most recent quarter.
The computer industry was counting on sales overseas to pick up some of the slack from falling demand in the United States. But the economic turmoil and currency woes in Asia, particularly Japan, mean computer purchases are no longer a priority for consumers there.
One relatively new approach for Intel is to focus on the low-end chip market with its two-month-old Celeron chip designed for use in under-$1,000 PC's. But users report the chip is slower than the competition's, and it is not doing well.
"Intel has to protect its margins to protect its stock price," said Fred Hickey, technology analyst and author of the High-Tech Strategist newsletter. But this may no longer be possible. Although Intel will not divulge its average selling price per chip, an industry source estimates it at $200. Advanced Micro Devices has said it can make money with an average selling price of $100 a chip.
Even more ominous to some Intel watchers is how many insiders are exiting the stock. "For years, Intel insiders were reluctant to part with their stock," said Bob Gabele who follows insider transactions at CDA Investnet in Rockville, Md. "Now, the inclination of Intel insiders to sell increasing numbers of shares into weakening share prices is troubling."
From July through early October 1997, Intel executives sold less than 150,000 shares. When the shares started to tumble in October, insiders sold almost 700,000 shares at prices of $80.86 to $85.44. In January 1998, Intel executives sold 916,000 more shares at $75 to $82.50 each. Three months later, six insiders announced plans to sell 800,000 shares at prices of $74 to $84.
"The increased selling seen at Intel is not reflected across the semiconductor industry," Mr. Gabele said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Preparing to Sue Intel Over Microchip Dominance

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to file a major antitrust lawsuit against the Intel Corporation, charging the company with abusing its position as the dominant manufacturer of microprocessor chips for personal computers and bullying some computer manufacturers, Government lawyers said today.
The suit will accuse Intel of selectively withholding key technical information about its microprocessor chips from the computer manufacturers with which Intel is involved in patent and related product disputes. Without that data, the manufacturers are unable to design new products. The commission is expected to ask that Intel be forced to share information about its processors with all manufacturers. 
 If filed as planned, the suit would be the second front in the Federal Government's assault on Wintel, as the personal computer juggernaut built around the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessors is known in industry parlance. Intel's processors and Microsoft's operating systems are the brains and nerves, respectively, that run 90 percent of personal computers.
The Justice Department and 20 state Attorneys General filed antitrust actions against Microsoft on May 18. A Federal judge in Washington combined those cases, and they are set to be heard in September.
Later this year, the trade commission lawyers said, the F.T.C. may file even more charges against Intel, accusing the company of using predatory pricing and contract provisions to expand its dominant position and to squeeze its few competitors out of the market. Those are the same general complaints filed against Microsoft last week.
Within the next week, the trade commission staff is expected to forward its recommendation for the antitrust suit to the full commission for approval. The commissioners are expected to vote to move forward with the lawsuit a week or 10 days later.
Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, in Santa Clara, Calif., said: "Our view is that we are not going to comment because this is not public yet. We are cooperating with the commission fully. We are very sensitive about antitrust enforcement, and at the end of the day, once the appropriate processes have been concluded, we believe they will determine that we behaved lawfully."
The lawyers involved with the investigation said that Intel executives had attended meetings with trade commission staff members in Washington earlier this month in an attempt to avert the lawsuit. But the Intel executives had not made any significant concessions, in the view of Government officials, and had insisted that all their business practices were lawful.
The F.T.C. and the Justice Department have equal jurisdiction to enforce the nation's antitrust laws, and the two agencies decide between themselves which will handle each new case. Since the Justice Department was already preoccupied with the Microsoft case, the commission took the Intel case.
At the heart of the Government's case, one lawyer said, is the charge that "a monopolist cannot cut off a customer who has no other alternatives in the market, causing him severe economic harm, just because they are having a dispute."
The proposed lawsuit charges that Intel illegally retaliated against four companies, including the Digital Equipment Corporation and the Intergraph Corporation, a maker of computer work stations. Intergraph and Digital both filed their own civil lawsuits against Intel last year. In a preliminary ruling last month, a Federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., found that Intel had violated antitrust law in the Intergraph case.
Intergraph and Intel were involved in a patent dispute. As leverage in that fight, the proposed Federal suit will charge, Intel refused to give Intergraph the product data books that set out the specifications for Intel's Pentium II family of microprocessors.
Since those chips serve as the brain of a personal computer, manufacturers must have the information to design their new machines, and holding back the data "is a nuclear weapon for a monopolist," one commission lawyer said.
In that case and in other public statements, Intel said it had the right to supply or withhold its own proprietary information according to its own business interests. Company executives made the same arguments in discussions with the Government. But the Government, the lawyers said, will argue that a monopolist does not have that choice.
If computer manufacturers were able to buy microprocessor chips from another company, then Intel's behavior would not brush up against antitrust laws, the lawyers said. But since Intel is the sole source for the chips, Federal Judge Edwin L. Nelson ruled in the Intergraph case last month that Intel was an "essential facility, similar to electrical power" and therefore did not have the right to supply crucial information to some companies but not to others.
Digital, like Intergraph, was involved in a patent dispute with Intel last spring. In its lawsuit, Digital charged Intel with infringing on Digital patents in the design of some of its Pentium chips. The proposed Federal suit charges that Intel then threatened to stop supplying microprocessors to Digital. The two companies settled their dispute last summer. Digital has since agreed to be purchased by the Compaq Computer.
The trade commission will charge that Intel has engaged in a pattern of similar behavior involving at least two other companies. All those cases show "a monopolist engaging in exclusionary conduct designed to enhance its monopolistic position," one lawyer said.
The commission is still investigating the other possible charges against Intel and has not decided whether to present additional cases. One possible complaint would charge the company with offering special pricing and joint advertising deals to computer manufacturers who agreed to install Intel chips on entire lines of their computers.
That charge is similar to one included in the state Attorneys General's suit, which accuses Microsoft of offering special prices to computer manufacturers who agree to install certain Microsoft software on all their computers.

Drastic Action in Russia To Stabilize Its Markets
As its financial markets teetered on the brink of collapse, Russia attempted to preserve the value of its currency and stem the exodus of foreign investors. In order to address the economic crisis, Moscow tripled interest rates, announced that it would be willing to accept a far lower price for the selloff of its last big remaining oil company, and appealed for support from the International Monetary Fund.

U.S. Irks Allies on Kosovo
America's closest European allies, having been pressed hard by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to impose sanctions on Serbia over its crackdown in Kosovo, are upset that Washington has shifted yet again, quietly easing the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic despite his intensified repression there.

Journalist's Return Permitted
After months of refusing to allow a Zimbabwean journalist to return to fight a deportation order, the South African Government has reversed itself. The journalist, Newton Kanhema, had been living and working in South Africa but is in the United States on a journalism fellowship. Advocates of a free press say the South African Government is trying to chill freedom of the press by deporting a journalist who has angered Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. A6
 
Workers Strike in South Korea
Tens of thousands of South Korean workers walked off the job and staged polite protests against layoffs and the increasing use of temporary workers.

Secret Session Preceded Ruling on Clinton's Aides
A Federal judge ordered two top White House officials to appear before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter only after the independent counsel made a presentation to the judge, outside of the presence of Administration lawyers, to demonstrate that the need for the aides' testimony outweighed President Clinton's right to claim executive and attorney-client privilege. Court papers revealed some previously secret arguments on both sides of the executive privilege issue and much of the judge's reasoning for rejecting Mr. Clinton's attempt to block some testimony by top aides.

States Told to Pay for Viagra
The Clinton Administration has told state officials that it intends to require their Medicaid programs to pay for medically approved uses of Viagra. But states could limit the number of pills and prescriptions for the impotence drug. State officials contend the decision should be theirs because they share the cost of Medicare. A1
 
Decrease in Welfare Rolls
President Clinton announced that another 900,000 people have left the welfare rolls since September, reducing the total receiving welfare benefits to 8.9 million. A White House ceremony marked the one-year anniversary of his "Welfare to Work Partnership," a nonprofit group intended to encourage businesses to hire welfare recipients. A26
 
Fund-Raising Disclosure
In a bid to revive an inquiry hampered by recalcitrant witnesses and staff defections, House Republican investigators said that they had unearthed further evidence of a Chinese Government connection to President Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996. But investigators acknowledged that the evidence was highly circumstantial. A26
 
Support for Initiative Falls
For months, the conservative effort to shatter organized labor's political war chest in California looked like a sure winner.

Democrats to Face Primary In the Gubernatorial Race
At the state Democratic Party convention, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and James L. Larocca, a former state Transportation Commissioner, said they would circulate petitions to force themselves on the gubernatorial ballot. The state party voted to set up a two-way primary for its gubernatorial nomination, foiling a campaign by Peter E. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, to become the favored candidate to challenge Gov. George E. Pataki this year. B1
 
Dropping Remedial Classes
In deciding to phase out remedial courses at four-year colleges, the trustees of the City University of New York have set in motion a sketchy but sweeping transformation of the university. The new policy, which prevents freshmen or transfer students from enrolling unless they have passed placement exams, may give the 11 senior colleges a screening tool they have lacked since open admissions was instituted in 1970.

Police to Hold Suspects Longer
Responding to the shooting of a police officer by a fugitive parolee who was mistakenly set free, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that anyone arrested for even minor offenses, like drinking in public, must now remain in police custody until a computerized fingerprint check is run. The policy will add hours to the processing time of the 80,000 people who receive desk-appearance tickets each year for low-level offenses from disorderly conduct to possession of small amounts of narcotics.

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 23) searches for a figure of speech to characterize the vast movements of liquid capital daily around the world and settles for the jet airplane, to which the markets were likened by Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. 
 A better description was developed by the historian Oswald Spengler after World War I. He described the modern powers of liquid capital as the new "plutocracy." He said that capital would flow like electricity through a vast network of high-voltage lines and that it would not be controllable by politicians or governments.
Those who controlled the conduits would in effect determine the course of a technologically advanced world, and it would be impersonal, as nonhuman as its form and function implied. Spengler seems to have hit on it precisely.

Regional Economy Was Strong in May

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Business activity in the New York region grew at a faster pace this month as manufacturing and services strengthened, according to a survey of service and factory executives released yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-New York index rose in May to 58.4 after falling in April to 52.6. An index reading of 50 or more suggests that the region's economy is expanding; a reading below 50 signals weakness or even a potential contraction. 
 The index for the region's factories rose to 54.9 in May from 47.9 in April. The April reading was the weakest since March 1997. The index for nonmanufacturers increased to 58.8 in May from 53.1 in April.
The outlook for the next six months remained positive in May, although businesses were more optimistic in April.
The outlook index edged down to 70.3 in May after a 73.6 reading a month earlier. Inflation was well behaved during the month. An index tracking prices paid by businesses for goods and services was unchanged at 51 in May.

Parcells and O'Donnell Defrost Cold War, a Bit

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., May 27

 BODY:
For the first time in 156 days, the coach of the Jets spoke to his (starting?) quarterback today, adding to the confusion.
Don't read anything into this five-month noncommunication, Coach Bill Parcells cautioned -- even though quarterback Neil O'Donnell admitted he was concerned by what had been going on. And who can blame him? O'Donnell knows as much about his status as callers to WFAN. A large part of it is that Parcells seems genuinely perplexed. 
 And yet, there appears to be some sort of understanding between Parcells and O'Donnell as a result of today's meeting. It was the first time they had spoken since Dec. 22, the day after the season ended with the Jets' 13-10 loss to the Lions, which kept the Jets out of the playoffs. O'Donnell was replaced several times in the game.
But what transpired at the meeting? Will O'Donnell have to take a pay cut to remain a Jet? Or can O'Donnell start an informal search for a job with another team?
"Basically, we still believe Neil will be a Jet," his agent, Leigh Steinberg, said today. "Bill has never wavered in that he wants Neil back. We feel the contract is fair, and our position is that the Jets should honor the contract. At this point there hasn't been much negotiation."
Parcells also reiterated to reporters today that he expected to keep O'Donnell this season. And O'Donnell, in his first news conference in more than five months, said that he expected to start. For what it was worth, O'Donnell repeatedly took the first snap when the minicamp for veterans began today. Then Glenn Foley came in. Foley had replaced O'Donnell as the starting quarterback last season, but soon was out for the season with a knee injury.
Parcells said that the players who took the field today had "more skill" than last year's 9-7 team. But he was not ready to say they were better. He pointed out that everyone in the backfield catches the ball well, especially with the addition of Curtis Martin at running back for Adrian Murrell, who was traded.
In addition, said Parcells, "I'm rooting for Jerald Sowell to make it at fullback." Sowell was the Packers' last draft pick of 1997, then was cut and picked up by the Jets. He will be tutored by the veteran Keith Byars, who was acquired in the off season. But Sowell seems certain to remain a Jet. And O'Donnell?
"Neil and I have a clear understanding of what's going on here," Parcells said after their meeting. "The June 1 date may change that."
After Monday, the Jets could cut O'Donnell and save millions of dollars for this year's salary cup. If he is cut on or before Monday, the Jets will be charged $4.2 million against the 1998 cap, but only $1.4 million afterward.
Last January, Parcells tried unsuccessfully to renegotiate O'Donnell's 1998 salary. But through Steinberg, O'Donnell balked, and Steinberg said O'Donnell believed he had had a fine season and saw no reason to take a cut in pay.
Yet, only a few minutes after bringing up the June 1 date at today's news conference, Parcells denied it had any significance. He said he had conclusively explained "my view of the economics" to O'Donnell. "We have to separate the economics from the football," he said.
Then Parcells added an ominous note, reminiscent of the line from "The Godfather." Reflecting on the fact that O'Donnell had been told not to participate in the recent off-season workouts, Parcells said he had told him, "It's business."
"I'm not letting him go June 1," Parcells said.
O'Donnell said yesterday that for the first time in months he felt confident that he would be back with the Jets. He admitted that when Parcells told him to stay away from the off-season conditioning program, it became "a different kind of off season."
With the start of today's camp, O'Donnell can avail himself of the Jets' facilities once again.
"I expect to start," he said. "I'm not a backup."
Foley would not comment on O'Donnell's status, but said, "I showed last year I can play on a pretty high level."
Foley has added about 15 pounds during the off season and has been a regular in the weight room in an attempt to avoid the types of injuries that have ended his seasons two of the last three years.
 
EXTRA POINTS
BILL PARCELLS all but officially said goodbye to DAVID WILLIAMS, the right tackle whose chronic back pain will force his retirement next Tuesday. . . . JOHN RIGGINS, the Jets' first 1,000-yard rusher, who went on to a Hall of Fame career as a Washington Redskin, will team with CHRIS RUSSO on a Channel 2 pre-game show next season.

HEADLINE: Allies Upset as U.S. Eases Stance on Kosovo

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
America's closest European allies are upset that Washington has changed tack yet again on the issue of Kosovo, pushing to ease the pressure on the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, despite his intensified repression in the province.
To induce Mr. Milosevic to begin a dialogue with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, the allies, at Washington's urging, recently suspended the economic sanctions that would hit Mr. Milosevic the hardest, measures that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had insisted on in the first place in the name of international cohesion. 
 "There has been a real shift of tactics and tone that is bound to cause real confusion in Belgrade," said a senior Western diplomat, who like the others did not want his name or country attached to his comments. "Now the pressure is all gone."
Another diplomat said, "The Americans have switched too quickly, for unclear ends, and we think Milosevic should not be let off the hook too easily."
The diplomats said they feared that Mr. Milosevic was again successfully manipulating Washington. All he has agreed to do, one diplomat said, is to open talks with Mr. Rugova. They met on May 15.
The diplomat expressed skepticism at the effectiveness of rewarding such a small step, saying: "Milosevic has agreed only to talk, not to strike an agreement on the future of Kosovo. The Americans have used our leverage to get the dialogue going, rather than to get somewhere."
The Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia consists of the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia. Britain and Germany are the countries most unhappy with the American shift, while the Italians and French, who supported the dialogue but thought sanctions ineffective, are less unhappy, but annoyed with what they consider excessive American flexibility. The Russians never agreed to sanctions other than a United Nations arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.
The American shift originated with Richard C. Holbrooke, the former diplomat who is the architect of the Bosnian peace settlement. Mr. Holbrooke, known for his strong relationship with Mr. Milosevic and his flexible tactics, was invited to help and visited the Balkans with the American special representative for the former Yugoslavia, Robert S. Gelbard, this month. The trip resulted in the allies' decision to suspend imposing a ban on investments in Serbia that had been agreed on a week before. It remains suspended, even though Mr. Milosevic has intensified a crackdown in Kosovo, is shutting down independent media throughout Yugoslavia, and is trying to manipulate a vote on Sunday for the presidency of Montenegro.
Senior American officials said they recognized the dangers of reducing pressure on Mr. Milosevic, but they said inducements were the only way to have him talk with Mr. Rugova. Time matters, the officials said, because as pressures on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo grow, Mr. Rugova, who embraces nonviolence, loses credibility with his people.
The Americans argue that it was clear that the sanctions were not pushing Mr. Milosevic into dialogue, an echo of the very argument that European countries like Italy made to Ms. Albright.
"The fact that Milosevic and Rugova are finally talking for the first time ever is very important," Mr. Holbrooke said today. "But we need these talks to make real progress."
"We know there are enormous risks here," Mr. Gelbard said. "But absent any effort to get talks going there are even more enormous risks. Others failed at getting a dialogue going, and we succeeded."
Mr. Gelbard emphasized that the sanctions remain on the table, were "suspended" and could be imposed later, if Mr. Milosevic did not behave responsibly. "We need to be able to turn these measures on and off," Mr. Gelbard said.
But turning the crucial sanction -- the investment ban -- on and off is impossible, a Western diplomat said.
Mr. Rugova and his negotiating team arrived in Washington today for meetings with American officials, and President Clinton on Friday. The Kosovo issue will be an important subject for a NATO meeting that Ms. Albright is to attend in Luxembourg.
The American attention to Mr. Rugova is intended to help his credibility at home and with Mr. Milosevic. He is also expected to meet J. Brian Atwood, head of the Agency for International Development.
Other officials said that Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Gelbard were suggesting, as an incentive to Mr. Milosevic if two or three meetings with Mr. Rugova go well, a lifting of sanctions that were applied in March. Those include a freeze on Serbia's foreign assets, a ban on visas to officials responsible for the crackdown in Kosovo and a halt to the financing of export or import credits for trade and investment.
But no decisions have been made, the officials said. "It's a matter of style and substance," a Western diplomat said. "It's a little embarrassing, but we have a good chance to go forward in Kosovo if we stay united and we don't change our stance too quickly."

HEADLINE: Re-election Struggle in Panama Could Affect Transfer of Canal

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
The slogan is blunt and emphatic, and it has begun appearing on glossy billboards and as crudely scrawled graffiti: "No Re-election!" Having decided to defy 95 years of tradition, President Ernesto Perez Balladares is encountering widespread opposition to his effort to amend the Panamanian Constitution so he can seek a second five-year term.
The outcome of the struggle, which a Latin American diplomat here described as "getting nastier by the day," is of vital importance to the United States. Whoever wins the election, scheduled for next May, will administer the Panama Canal when the United States yields control of the waterway and the remaining military bases around it on Dec. 31, 1999. 
 The Democratic Revolutionary Party, which Mr. Perez Balladares leads, has a long history of anti-Americanism.
But as President, Mr. Perez Balladares has sought to ingratiate himself with Washington. He has tried to curb money laundering and reform the banking system, offered to accept Cuban and Haitian refugees when the Clinton Administration sought havens for them and is now trying to negotiate an agreement for an anti-narcotics center that would permit 2,000 American troops to remain here well into the next century.
To Panamanians, though, the future of the canal overshadows everything, and it is on that front that much of the opposition to the President has coalesced. Mr. Perez Balladares has said his decision to seek re-election stems from a desire to "finish the job we've begun." But opposition groups say his real aim is to convert the canal into an asset of the governing party.
Those suspicions have been prevalent since the fall, when the President announced his nominees to the Panama Canal Authority, which will run the canal beginning in 2000. Instead of the broad-based nonpartisan board that had been expected, Mr. Perez Balladares appointed relatives, business partners and party loyalists.
Not long after, one appointee, Moises Mizrachi, a former campaign fund-raiser who is a member of the Panama Canal Commission, suggested that some canal functions could be privatized after it had passed into Panamanian hands. That set off a huge furor, with opposition figures accusing Mr. Perez Balladares of intending to raffle off pieces of the canal to his cronies.
As required by the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977, some parts of the former Panama Canal Zone have already been turned over to the Panamanian Government and are being made into industrial parks, shopping malls, hotels and other projects. But as the United States Trade Representative's office pointed out in a report last month, "Rumors of corruption are fueled by public bids which lack transparency," most notably in a recent effort to privatize a port area.
In addition, early in the next century the new canal administration will have to decide whether to modernize the waterway by building an additional set of locks. The estimated cost of the new locks is at least $5 billion, and officials expect, if approved, that the work will generate a bonanza of contracts and a host of new concerns about Government bidding procedures.
"During the next five years a tremendous number of opportunities will be emerging in the reverted areas," Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former Vice President and a leader of the Christian Democratic Party, said. "This explains to me the reason the President is breaking with a longstanding national consensus against re-election. He wants to concentrate economic power around himself and those who support him to a degree never before seen in Panama."
In an interview here, Jorge Ritter, the Panamanian Government's Minister of Canal Affairs and the chairman-designate of the body that is to run the waterway, said Mr. Mizrachi's comments had been misconstrued. There is no Spanish equivalent for the word "outsourcing," Mr. Ritter said, which is what Mr. Mizrachi really meant.
"I don't want to tell you that all operations relating to the maintenance and operation of the canal will not be subject to outsourcing," Mr. Ritter said. "Not everything the Canal Commission does is in house, even today. That was the misunderstanding that could have caused a certain concern that has now dissipated. But the canal will never be subject to privatization."
The National Assembly, which Mr. Perez Balladares's party controls, has approved an amendment to the Constitution that would allow him to seek a second term. But that decision is subject to ratification in a referendum. On May 21 the Government announced that the vote would be held on Aug. 30. In a recent poll, 57 percent of those surveyed said they opposed allowing the President to run for a second term.
Mr. Perez Balladares was able to win office in 1994 with barely one-third of the vote, as the opposition split among several candidates. Though opposition parties, which are united in their dislike of the re-election proposal, talk of running a single coalition candidate to prevent that from recurring, they seem unable to agree who that candidate should be.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin to Ask Western Help for Ruble as Markets Steady

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 28

 BODY:
As Russian financial markets steadied slightly after this week's record plunge, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would call on Western leaders to help defend Russia's embattled ruble.
His appeal was later echoed by a top finance official who said Russia would need a hefty rescue package from the West -- more generous than a $700 million loan already expected from the International Monetary Fund -- if it is to stem the panic that has threatened Russia's economic and political stability. 
 Speaking at a televised meeting of Government officials hastily summoned to his country house, Mr. Yeltsin said he would call foreign leaders, including President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, asking them to support Russia as it proceeds with a plan for a new round of spending cuts and more vigorous tax collecting measures.
"Foreign investors should feel confident there will be no collapse of financial markets in Russia," Mr. Yeltsin said, tapping the table for emphasis. "The Central Bank and Finance Ministry today possess enough reserve funds to stay afloat. That's what is important."
For now, the Yeltsin strategy seemed to work. The ruble was stable for the second consecutive day, and Moscow stock indexes rose.
According to the latest report from the Russian Central Bank, Russia's gold and currency reserves now stand at $14.5 billion -- down from the $23 billion levels declared in October. Maintaining the stability of the ruble has been a key achievement of Mr. Yeltsin's reform-minded Government over the last few years, and as its desperate actions this week demonstrated, a stable ruble remains its top priority for keeping the shaky Russian economy on track.
The arrival in Moscow tonight of a top emissary from the International Monetary Fund is seen here as a sign that some help is already on the way. John Odling-Smee, the fund's official in charge of Russia and the former Soviet Union, is expected to confirm approval of a $700 million installment of a $10 billion loan to Russia, delivering a seal of approval that has been closely watched by financial markets here and abroad.
Meanwhile, Anatoly B. Chubais, a former top Kremlin aide and the head of Russia's electrical monopoly, was headed for Washington. Mr. Chubais maintains close ties to Mr. Yeltsin, and it is believed that he will consult with American officials about possible economic help for Russia.
Sergei Vasilyev, a senior Kremlin aide, was also on the trip. The Kremlin declined comment about it.
At a news conference held today in Kazakhstan, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, said Russia's latest efforts had convinced the I.M.F that it was serious about tackling its budget deficit. "These are important enough that we believe we can release the next tranche of support," he told reporters, adding that an announcement would come in the "in the next few days."
But Deputy Finance Minister Oleg V. Vyugin said today that Russia needed the psychological boost of more foreign credits -- even if those credits turn out to be unnecessary.
"Judging from the current situation, I can tell you that in principle there is a chance that we can resolve this situation without additional assistance," he said. But he added that further credits "would play a psychological role because panic is a psychological phenomenon." The amount Russia seeks, he said, would be "a different order of figure."
"Such a credit would show everybody that there are considerable resources and that there won't be problems in the future," he said. "I don't see how such a decision would hurt."
Financial analysts here said today that Western institutions and banks were unlikely to come forward with a currency-stabilization package for Russia anytime soon, preferring to see if financial markets will be convinced by the endorsements given Russia's fiscal program this week by the I.M.F. and Western governments, including Washington.
In trading today on the Moscow stock exchange, the benchmark Russian RTS index rose 6.2 percent, winning back most of Wednesday's losses. The ruble, which was pegged at 6.17 to the dollar on Wednesday, rose slightly to 6.14.
The fiscal crisis, which has dominated the news for days now, has for the most part floated over the heads of most Russians, who are more preoccupied with making ends meet than with the values of currencies and stocks.
A key test of the markets' response will come Wednesday at a regular auction of Russia's Government-backed bonds, known as G.K.O.'s. The bonds will carry an interest rate of 150 percent as rates were tripled on Wednesday to save lure investors to hold bonds and the ruble.
"Supportive statements by the I.M.F. and the U.S. Treasury are useful to show the markets that the support is there," said Christopher Granville, chief strategist at Fleming UCB, a London-based investment group. "For the moment, the panic seems to have stopped. Then, the bluff will be called."
Russian finance officials are exploring the possibility of a sovereign syndicated loan, which would be pulled together by Western banks, financial analysts said today. "If they did get the money, the thing to do would be to restructure their loans, and buy back the G.K.O.'s, and cut their domestic debt," said Mr. Granville.
At the emergency meeting held this morning, Mr. Yeltsin called on Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko to focus efforts on shoring up the ruble. Mr. Yeltsin said he would press Russia's tax authorities to improve their dismal tax collection record, an indicator that has been under close scrutiny by Western advisers.
"Heads will roll," Mr. Yeltsin said, noting that he will meet on Friday with the law enforcement and fiscal authorities. "They have been working poorly. They must be stricter."
Mr. Kiriyenko said later that Mr. Yeltsin would sign a decree authorizing the tax police to confiscate property belonging to tax dodgers, with a list of major delinquents now being drawn up. Other measures under consideration would call for the forced bankruptcy of companies that have not paid their tax bills, and court proceedings against the managers of delinquent state-owned companies.
At a Cabinet meeting today, Mr. Kiriyenko said the principal cause of the Russian crisis was that "we have not learned to live within our means," a failure that he said had cost the Russian Government credibility here and abroad.
Mr. Kiriyenko, 35, who became Prime Minister just a month ago, also met on Wednesday last night with four influential Russian bankers at their request. According to reports, the bankers were reassured by his pledge to stick to the Government's announced austerity plan.
In public statements, several top Russian finance officials have blamed foreign investors -- who hold $20 billion in Russian Government securities -- for triggering the panic on the markets this week.
"The market was rocked by a small circle of market players," Mr. Vyugin said today. "We know them. We know about their operations. Judging from these operations, we can say with certainty that their purpose was to push the prices down."
At a news conference on Wednesday Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Russia Fund, outlined the difference between the Asian and Russian financial crises.
"In the case of Russia, the crisis is a Government debt crisis, a Government cash-flow crisis," he said. "In the case of Asia, the government was rich, and the private sector was in debt. In the case of Russia, the Government is in trouble, and the private sector is very rich. In both cases, the capital markets, stock markets, bond markets have become extremely volatile."

Stocks Gain Slightly as Wary Buyers Return to Blue Chips

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market rebounded modestly yesterday, ending a four-day slump as investors crept back into some of their favorite blue-chip stocks as well as a broad variety of smaller issues.
 Even so, investors remained jittery over the sharp global selloff that erupted on Tuesday and Wednesday, resulting in losses for most of the major indexes amid fears about slowing profit growth and renewed concerns about a global economic crisis reverberating out of Asia.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, after falling in four consecutive sessions, rose 33.63 points, or four-tenths of a percent, yesterday, to close at 8,970.20. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.37 points, or half of a percent, to 1,097.60, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller company issues climbed more than 1.2 percent.
 Still, Wall Street analysts say that after a sharp run-up in prices in the early part of the year, the market appears to be correcting, adding that share prices may continue to sag on concerns about corporate profits.
 "The market, in retrospect, did a bit more than it should have," said A. Marshall Acuff, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "We're in for a reality check after a feel-better rally in the first quarter."
 That early-year rally saw the Dow soar 21.5 percent from early January to its peak of 9,211.84 on May 13, even though profit growth slowed significantly in the first quarter. Investors, ever confident if not euphoric, were cheered by falling interest rates, declining fears about economic turmoil in Asia, a global wave of corporate merger activity and the prospect of a sharp profit recovery in the second half of the year.
 But with share prices at record levels, analysts say a slowdown was inevitable, and perhaps necessary. "When the Dow reached 9,200 the market was very high, about 20 percent overvalued," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Investor optimism was at or near historic levels. Now, though, people are getting worried about another wave of problems in the emerging markets and the prospect of disappointing profits in the second quarter."
 Indeed, the Asian crisis that helped sink share prices around the globe in October appears to be bubbling up again. In Japan, a decade-long economic decline is deepening, and yesterday, the Japanese yen fell to a seven-year low against the dollar.
And, in addition to the global turmoil, analysts say that corporate profits are being squeezed in the United States by rising wage costs and an inability to raise prices. In the first quarter, for instance, corporate profits rose just 2.5 percent, even though the nation's gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, making it one of the strongest quarters in a decade. A year ago, profits were up about 10 percent. In other words, the economy is strong, but profit growth is weak. "That shows there's a margin squeeze going on," Mr. Wien said.
In the future, profits could also be hit by the strong dollar, which continues to rise against the Japanese yen, as well as a soaring trade deficit -- factors that worry investors who have paid high share prices in recent years.
 "Some people felt Asia was a one-quarter affair and it isn't," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. "There's going to be a continuing trickle of bad news out of Asia. And so our stock market is clearly on hold for some time."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Strong Dollar and Woes Abroad Drop Long Bond Yield to 5.82%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rose yesterday, pushing long-term yields to nearly two-month lows, in a rally propelled by financial turmoil in Russia and much of Asia and the rising value of the dollar.
In buying Treasury bonds, investors ignored news that in other circumstances might have been interpreted as negative for the market, notably new signs of a robust American economy and a new supply of debt issues from a Treasury auction. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond rose 11/32, to a price of 104 9/32. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, dropped to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent, the lowest since April 6.
Early gains were brought on by instability in Asian markets, resulting in part from Pakistan's announcement that it had carried out five nuclear tests. This helped bring foreign investors into the United States market. Anxiety from the financial crisis in Russia also helped support demand for Treasury instruments, which are an investment of refuge at times of turmoil.
The market was further aided by a gain in the dollar's value against the Japanese yen and other currencies; a rising dollar makes dollar-denominated assets more valuable.
That partly explained the strong demand for $11 billion in five-year Treasury notes sold yesterday. Market analysts said the weakness in Asia played a role in the muted reaction to data that showed unexpectedly strong economic growth in the January-March quarter and a sharp rise in April factory orders. "While the data today were on the strong side," said Donald Fine of Chase Asset Management, "there was also growing evidence that some of the strength in the first quarter is likely to be balanced by some softness during the second quarter."
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price 99.676
High Yield 5.575%

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE REACTION;
Wealthy Nations Cut Aid to Pakistan Over Nuclear Tests

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 28

 BODY:
In reactions that followed the relatively mild pattern of responses to nuclear tests conducted by India two weeks ago, Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia joined the United States today in taking action against Pakistan for going ahead with tests of its own.
Other Pakistani trading partners, like France and Russia, expressed "disappointment" and "concern" at word of the tests but stopped short of recommending any sanctions. 
 Japan, the biggest aid donor to both Pakistan and India, said it would adopt the same position toward Pakistan as it did to India two weeks ago when New Delhi also set off underground nuclear blasts.
"We will consider what we should do in parallel with what we did with India," a Japanese Government official told reporters in Tokyo, but he declined to say exactly what steps Tokyo could take.
Freezing aid to Pakistan could be a severe blow to the Pakistan economy because Japan provided $235 million in loans and $42 million in aid last year. Japan has decided to halt new loans and grants, effectively cutting its official assistance to Pakistan by two-thirds. That will have a large effect on Pakistan, because Japan provides more than half of the total world assistance to that nation.
After the Indian tests, Tokyo froze $30 million in grants to New Delhi and said it would make cuts in its annual $1 billion loan program. It also withdrew its offer to be the host of a June 30 World Bank meeting at which donors of aid to India were to discuss development assistance. Japan's annual program of low-cost loans and aid to Pakistan totals $485 million. Kanezo Muraoka, the Government spokesman, said "we cannot condone" the tests.
The German Government said it was canceling planned discussions in June with Pakistani officials about new development aid worth about $45 million. Otto Hauser, the Government spokesman, said Bonn "sharply condemns this action," which he described as unacceptable.
Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, joined a number of officials around the world in saying it was "unfortunate" that Pakistan had disregarded the international calls for restraint and responded to the Indian tests "with the same coin."
In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said that relations with Pakistan would "now be placed on hold" and that further measures would be announced. Canada recalled its Ambassador to India earlier this month and canceled some joint talks as well as military exports to New Delhi. "Canada is deeply disappointed the Pakistani Government did not heed the international call for restraint but chose to act in a manner contrary to international norms," Mr. Chretien said.
Australia, which suspended military links with New Delhi and all assistance except relief aid after the Indian tests, condemned the Pakistani actions and said it was withdrawing an offer made Wednesday to double its existing $1.5 million annual aid to Islamabad.
Britain, which believes that cuts in aid unfairly hurt the poor, does not plan any reductions in its $41 million assistance to Pakistan, just as it did not trim its $165 million to India. Saying he was "dismayed," the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said, "We condemn this action, which runs counter to the will expressed by 149 signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to cease nuclear testing and to efforts to strengthen the global nonproliferation regime."
In Paris, a Foreign Ministry statement said that France "deplores and condemns these tests which run counter to world efforts to prevent proliferation and testing." The Russian Foreign Ministry said "it was regrettable that the Pakistani leadership failed to overcome its emotions and show prudence and good sense at an extremely responsible time."
Javier Solana, the Secretary General of NATO, said he condemned Pakistan's action, and the European Union said it would hold urgent meetings to consider taking the same action against Pakistan that it took Monday in the case of India. The European Union barred payments by international and financial institutions to India and called into question trade preferences.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called on the allies to join in slapping sanctions on countries that test nuclear weapons. "Only by acting together can we deter others from pursuing the nuclear option," she said.

HEADLINE: Economy Brisk, But Data Offer Some Cautions

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In the midst of fresh crises in Asia and Russia, the Commerce Department announced yesterday that the American economy in the first quarter was even stronger than originally thought, but there was a suggestion in the new figures of slower growth ahead.
The good news came in the overall number. The gross domestic product, the value of all the goods and services produced in the United States, rose from January through March at a torrid annual rate of 4.8 percent. The first estimate for the quarter, issued last month, had been 4.2 percent, itself a surprisingly powerful performance, even for an economy that has been expanding rapidly for more than two years. 
 The worry was in the details. Corporate profits in the first quarter, reported yesterday for the first time, fell by 2.2 percent, after taxes. It was the second quarterly decline -- profits fell 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter -- after more than three years of steadily rising profits. What is more, a significant portion of the economic growth came from accumulating inventories. Factories hummed along, but a big chunk of what they produced stayed on the shelf, unsold. Without this overrun, the G.D.P. would have grown by 3.4 percent.
The stock market, which thrives on expectations of rising profits, took the news calmly enough. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.63 points to 8,970.20. But after having shot up 21 percent during the first quarter, the Dow average has hovered at its present level since early April.
"We are heading for slower growth," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, a consulting firm, offering a view widely shared by forecasters. "We are pretty sure you cannot continue to accumulate inventories at such a rapid rate without a slowdown. But economic growth is still likely to be quite respectable this year."
The latest numbers produced an unusual amount of uncertainty among forecasters about what might happen next. Profits, for example, may be falling, but they are still high, equaling a healthy 9.9 percent of total output -- enough perhaps to sustain the current strong level of spending by business for new investment.
Inventories are another matter. Nearly every forecaster agrees they cannot accumulate at an annual level of $100 billion, roughly 30 percent greater than most of last year -- and a surprising 25 percent higher than first thought. Last month's estimate for the first quarter was $77 billion in stockpiled merchandise.
Production -- and with it, the economy -- has to slow down while these stockpiles are depleted, most economists agree. "Every time inventory growth has risen faster than economic growth, the economy has slowed," said Nancy Lazar, a vice president and economist at ISI Group Inc., a Wall Street firm.
But by how much might production drop? Falling exports to Asia accounted for some of the inventory buildup. So did Federal Government purchases, which fell at a rather sharp annual rate of 9.8 percent in the first quarter. Not much improvement is likely soon in these areas. But personal consumption expenditure -- the spending of American consumers -- rose at a very strong annual rate of 6.1 percent. Not surprisingly, savings edged down.
That willingness to spend might encourage companies to maintain fairly high inventory levels, although not at the first quarter's levels.
"Normally one attributes inventory building to optimism among business people that sales will keep rising," said Robert Parker, chief statistician at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues the G.D.P. numbers. "As long as they remain optimistic about domestic spending, they are likely to be comfortable about stockpiling goods."
A dark spot is trade. While exports fell in the first quarter, imports rose sharply, and whatever consumers spend on imports, they cannot spend on domestically made goods and services. What is more, falling import prices have made it harder to raise prices on domestically made goods.
Reflecting this pressure, the implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation issued along with the G.D.P. report, rose in the first quarter at an annual rate of just 1 percent, the smallest increase since the second quarter of 1964.
The pricing problem helps to explain the downturn in profits, economists said. Gradually rising labor costs and a stronger dollar also squeezed profits. The stronger dollar means American companies earn less abroad because foreign currencies translate into fewer dollars on their balance sheets.
For nearly two and a half years, the gross domestic product has been expanding at an average annual rate of more than 3 percent. In four different quarters during this period economic growth exceeded 4 percent, and in last year's fourth quarter, it reached 3.7 percent.
Many forecasters expect growth to slow in the months ahead to an annual rate of less than 3 percent, which would be more in line with average growth over the seven years of expansion since the last recession. The average growth rate through this period has been 2.86 percent.
In another report, the Commerce Department said new orders for costly durable goods jumped 2.6 percent, to $191.2 billion in April, after a slight increase in March. But analysts discounted the increase, noting much of it reflected aircraft orders, which can fluctuate.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: IN WASHINGTON;
After an Anguished Phone Call, Clinton Penalizes the Pakistanis

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
After a futile midnight effort to stop Pakistan's nuclear tests, President Clinton grimly denounced them today as dangerously destabilizing and imposed penalties that could cost the Pakistanis billions.
 "I deplore the decision" by Pakistan to test its nuclear arsenal in reaction to India's five tests two weeks ago, the President said. He said the two nations were now embarked on a "dangerous arms race." 
 The Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, one of several senior officials who traveled to Pakistan to try to prevent the tests, called the rising nuclear tensions in South Asia "an extraordinarily serious situation," one of "immense importance, complexity and, I would say, danger."
The tests came less than seven hours after Mr. Clinton telephoned Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and all but begged him not to detonate a weapon. Administration officials described their half-hour conversation, which ended around midnight, as anguished and impassioned.
The talk, the fourth between the President and the Prime Minister since the first Indian tests on May 11, began with Mr. Clinton offering "a changed relationship" with Pakistan if Mr. Sharif canceled the nuclear tests, an Administration official said.
Mr. Clinton pledged to try to deliver 28 F-16 fighter jets that Pakistan has paid for, but never received, and to try "to cut through the knot" of laws blocking military and economic aid to Pakistan, said the official, who insisted on anonymity.
"The President said he unilaterally would keep trying to get closer in security terms," the official said. "It was a promise of a changed relationship. He said, 'If you do this, we can do great things together, we can work on your economy, we can give you the tools you need to help defend your country.' "
Pakistan received $500 million to $600 million a year in cash and high-tech weapons from the United States during the 1980's, when it provided invaluable help to the Central Intelligence Agency by smuggling billions of dollars worth of weapons to guerrillas fighting off Soviet invaders in Afghanistan. But when that cold war battle ended in 1989, so did the aid. In 1990 the United States openly declared what it had known for a decade: Pakistan was building a nuclear bomb, and was thus ineligible for American assistance.
After hearing Mr. Clinton out, Mr. Sharif replied, "You have said all the right things, but the rest of the world is filing its fingernails," the official said. Mr. Sharif said the failure of most of the world to punish India for its tests made it impossible for him not to follow suit. "There was anguish in Sharif," the official said. "This was a man between a nuclear rock and a hard place. He was saying: 'I wish I did not have these forces acting on me, but people are demonstrating in the streets, the editorialists and the opposition are demanding I test. You have to understand my position.' He as much as said this was out of his hands."
Mr. Clinton said the tests would force him to impose sanctions that could cost Pakistan billions and cripple its economy. "He said, If you do this, Nawaz, I have to do this, and it'll hurt you a lot more than it'll hurt India,' " the official said. " 'If your hands are tied, mine are too.' "
The two leaders, resigned to take political acts against their personal wishes, signed off. While Mr. Clinton slept, Mr. Sharif gave the go-ahead for the nuclear explosions.
This morning, three hours after the tests, Mr. Clinton said they had cost Pakistan "a truly priceless opportunity to strengthen its own security, to improve its political standing in the eyes of the world." Because of the tests, the United States will try to delay any future loans to Pakistan by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and will cut off loans by private United States banks to the Pakistani Government. Similar measures were taken against India after its tests.
Announcing the economic sanctions against Pakistan that he was required to impose under law, Mr. Clinton said, "I cannot believe that we are about to start the 21st century by having the Indian subcontinent repeat the worst mistakes of the 20th century."
The dangers of the tests were underscored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and a former Ambassador to India. He said he feared that the Islamic republic of Pakistan might share its nuclear technology with Middle East nations hostile to Israel. "We now have an Islamic bomb," he said.
United States intelligence officials said today that Pakistan had probably not exploded five nuclear weapons, as Mr. Sharif announced, but as few as two, both in the range of 5 to 10 kilotons, according to preliminary estimates. The bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 was 12 kiloton.
Mr. Sharif's announcement of "five successful nuclear explosions," leveling the score with India, was probably propaganda intended for domestic consumption, the officials said. They said the same was true of his warning that Pakistan was already mounting nuclear warheads on its new medium-range Ghauri missiles, which can strike India's biggest cities. And so were statements by Pakistani officials that India was threatening to attack Pakistan's nuclear test site hours before the detonations, they said.
They also said more tests by Pakistan were possible.
United States officials were well aware of what Secretary of State Madeline K. Albright today called the "overwhelming domestic pressures and regional dynamics" forcing Mr. Sharif's hand. The pressures were so intense that Mr. Sharif's Government might have fallen had he not tested, said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who spoke with the Prime Minister twice in the last 10 days.
That pressure might have been relieved had the United States given Pakistan its F-16's and addressed its security concerns, said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican and a Foreign Relations subcommittee chairman. But now, he said, "this chain reaction is spiraling out of control, and this is very scary."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE RIVALRY;
South Asian Arms Race: Reviving Dormant Fears of Nuclear War

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 28

 BODY:
In a matter of weeks, covert nuclear programs in India and Pakistan, rivals who have three times gone to war, have turned into an open nuclear arms race, raising alarms about what comes next -- and where.
Diplomats and arms control experts see this arms race as particularly dangerous because Pakistan and India, unlike the United States and Russia during the cold war, have not held serious negotiations over outstanding problems for decades or concluded agreements that reduced the number of weapons aimed at each other. 
 These experts now fear that Pakistan and India could be drawn into a nuclear war over Kashmir, a territory that has been in dispute since the two countries gained independence in 1947. They also worry that nuclear testing by India and Pakistan could encourage other nations that have long sought nuclear arms to acquire these weapons.
"We are at perhaps the most dangerous period since the beginning of the nuclear age -- with the exception of the Cuban missile crisis," said Thomas Graham, a former negotiator for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency who is now president of the independent Lawyers' Alliance for World Security.
The United Nations, and the nuclear powers who hold Security Council seats, are left standing by helplessly. Since the end of the Cold War, few nations have much leverage with either India or Pakistan.
"They don't want outside help, at least the Indians don't," said Mr. Graham. "They think it's too much like colonialism. The Indians have probably not been very interested in confidence-building measures because in their heart of hearts they probably thought they would one day eliminate Pakistan."
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, in Washington, an independent military research organization, said that years of watching the two nations sign agreements and then ignore or circumvent them led him to conclude that these pacts were used for little more than scoring points off one another.
Furthermore, neither India nor Pakistan has signed the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons or the nuclear test-ban treaty.
Pakistani officials and several former American diplomats said today that public outrage at threats by Lal Krishna Advani, India's Home Minister and policy maker on Kashmir, that India might attack Pakistan along the Kashmir border, overwhelmed cautious civilian politicians in Islamabad and made the tests inevitable.
The United States, which had been surprised by India's nuclear explosions, did not offer Pakistan, a country that feels friendless and surrounded by dangers in a tumultuous region, any real incentives not to test, said Stephen P. Cohen, an expert on India-Pakistan military affairs who is joining the Brookings Institution in Washington as its first South Asian policy scholar in the fall.
"Two things didn't happen," Mr. Cohen said today. "The price we offered was not close to what we offered North Korea." Pyongyang got $4 billion in American assistance to cap its nuclear program; Pakistan was given vague promises that it might finally be given the 28 F-16 aircraft it bought and paid for almost a decade ago.
"And we and the Chinese were unwilling to offer the Pakistanis security guarantees that would have made them feel comfortable," Mr. Cohen said.
Furthermore, said Robert Oakley, Ambassador to Pakistan in 1990, Pakistan thought its national security was compromised by Washington, because a legal provision known as the Pressler Amendment cut off economic and military assistance to Pakistan because of its nuclear program, but did not similarly punish India, which had already set off a nuclear explosion in 1974.
"For eight years Pakistan has been deprived of everything, and therefore we severely weakened their conventional military capability, which was predicated on the use of American equipment," Mr. Oakley said today. "We certainly weakened their confidence in the United States."
"At the same time, India was getting stronger," he said. "So what could the Pakistanis rely upon? Missiles and nuclear capability."
The decision to test not only brings down crippling economic sanctions on the country, but has also prompted India's Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to assert that Indian explosions were now fully justified, since Pakistan had proved how dangerous it is. Furthermore, the Pakistani military, which has only recently been pushed back from the center of political power, now has the bomb.
From Pakistan's perspective, pleas from around the world -- and several long telephone appeals from President Clinton -- were not enough to overcome visceral fears of India, a country of nearly a billion people that looms large over the border.
"Pakistan is a profoundly insecure state," Mr. Cohen said. "It is a state that feels itself surrounded by enemies, beginning with Iran, a security problem. Afghanistan has turned out to be a terrible disaster for them. The Indians are as troublesome as ever. Their friends are not really friends. The U.S. has moved out of the region, and the Chinese are cool. Add to that the domestic troubles."
India, better armed by virtually every measure, has kept Pakistan off balance since they were created from the partition of British India in 1947.
It was the Indian Army that seized a large part of Kashmir in 1947, when raiders from Pakistan entered the territory, then still under a Hindu Maharaja, who called for help. In 1971, the Indian Army came to the rescue of a nationalist Bengali movement and severed East Pakistan -- now Bangladesh -- from the rest of the country.
"Pakistan refuses to accept Indian primacy and India refuses to accept anything else," Richard H. Haass, a former member of the National Security Council in the Bush Administration, wrote in 1990. That core problem was often at the heart of the two nations' disputes.
Richard Murphy, senior fellow for the Mideast at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Assistant Secretary of State for the region, said today that policy makers cannot now rule out the possibility that Iran will react to the Pakistani tests.
"The Pakistan-Iranian relationship is edgy -- totally hostile no, but really quite edgy -- and there have been a number of incidents of terrorism, assassination in Pakistan that they have blamed on Iranian instigation," Mr. Murphy said. "Don't rule out the chain reaction -- that this will add to the motivation of Iranians to go for a nuclear weapons program, although they have said in various U.N. forums that they stand for a nuclear-free zone in the Persian Gulf."
In India as in Pakistan, the decision to test was also explained by fears of neighbors' weapons and intentions. India singled out China, but many diplomats and experts on the South Asian region and on China rule this out as a serious consideration.
"There hasn't been any increased threat to India's security at all from China or Pakistan," said Mr. Oakley, the former Ambassador who is now at the National Defense University on Washington.
Several experts said that they believe that the Indians, now under a new Hindu nationalist leadership also seeking to broaden its political support, were determined to acquire a world-power image they believe has been unfairly denied them.
That point was made clear in a statement on nuclear policy presented to India's Parliament on Wednesday by Prime Minister Vajpayee. The bomb, he said, "is India's due, the right of one-sixth of mankind."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
PAKISTAN, ANSWERING INDIA, CARRIES OUT NUCLEAR TESTS; CLINTON'S APPEAL REJECTED

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Friday, May 29

 BODY:
Pakistan responded to India's nuclear tests on Thursday with underground nuclear tests of its own. Within hours, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared his country a "nuclear power," fulfilling a secret plan made by a predecessor nearly 30 years ago that Pakistan would build an "Islamic bomb."
In announcing that it had conducted five underground nuclear tests, Pakistan's first, the Islamabad Government simultaneously said it was already fitting nuclear warheads on a type of missile said to be able to strike targets across most of north and central India. 
 The news set off pandemonium in the Indian Parliament, which had been hotly debating India's recent nuclear tests. The announcement raised the specter of retaliation by India, Pakistan's archrival, which said after it conducted five tests of its own two weeks ago that it would begin fitting nuclear warheads on a range of missiles, including several developed specifically for targets in Pakistan.
"Today, we have evened the score with India," Mr. Sharif announced in a solemn television address about three hours after the tests, which were carried out at 3:30 P.M. Thursday (6:30 A.M. Thursday, Eastern time) at a testing range in the Chagai Hills, a desert region in the remote southwest, close to the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
As he spoke, Pakistanis poured into the streets to dance and fire guns in the air, and crowds jammed mosques to offer prayers.
Early today, Mr. Sharif's Government declared a national state of emergency, further heightening the sense of crisis that has gripped the subcontinent since the first Indian nuclear tests on May 11. The statement was issued shortly after midnight by the titular President, Mohammed Rafiq Tarar, acting under constitutional provisions that may be invoked when Pakistan's security falls "under threat of external aggression."
It was not clear whether Mr. Sharif intended to go further, by curbing civil rights, suspending Parliament or taking other measures that Pakistan has often resorted to in its 50 years as a nation. Officials in Pakistan said privately that they did not expect such moves, but noted that Mr. Sharif would need emergency powers to respond quickly if India reacted to the Pakistan tests by actions that push the two countries closer to a military confrontation.
Tremors from Pakistan's tests registered at seismic centers as far away as Australia, Sweden and the United States, although American intelligence officials said Pakistan had probably tested only two weapons rather than the five announced.
Pakistan described its tests as "a complete success," but offered no details about the types of weapons involved or their explosive power. But a separate Government statement said the Ghauri missile, test-fired on April 6, was "already being capped with nuclear warheads to give a befitting reply to any misadventure by the enemy," meaning India.
Some Indian officials have said it was the Ghauri test that touched off the tests ordered by India's Hindu nationalist-led Government.
President Clinton, who had made the last of five telephone calls appealing for restraint from Mr. Sharif only hours before the tests, quickly announced that the United States would impose the same package of economic sanctions on Pakistan that it applied to India after its tests. The sanctions include a suspension of American economic aid, a ban on American bank loans to government institutions and pressure for a cutoff of aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which have propped up Pakistan's debt-laden, enfeebled economy for years.
"I cannot believe," Mr. Clinton said. "that we are about to start the 21st century by having the Indian subcontinent repeat the worst mistakes of the 20th century, when we know it is not necessary to peace, to security, to prosperity, to national greatness, or to personal fulfillment."
When the first shouted word of Pakistan's tests has heard in the Indian Parliament, a Communist leader, Somnath Chatterjee, interrupted a speech condemning India's tests and addressed himself directly to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Hindu nationalist leader who approved the Indian tests. "You have started a nuclear arms race in this region," he said.
Mr. Vajpayee left the chamber to check with other officials, returning quickly to make a statement. "If this is true, then India's policy has been vindicated," he said.
Later, Mr. Vajpayee rejected suggestions that India had set off a nuclear spiral, saying it had acted only because of concern about Pakistan's covert nuclear program. "In fact, Pakistan forced us to take the path of nuclear deterrence," he said.
He did not rule out retaliation. "India is ready to meet any challenge," he said.
Asked if India might set aside the moratorium on nuclear testing it declared after its tests, Mr. Vajpayee replied, "A new situation has been created, and it will be taken into account in formulating our policy."
The tests set off widespread alarm around the world, with statements of condemnation from Russia, China, Britain and a score of other nations, some of which, including Japan, Australia, Germany and Sweden, announced economic sanctions of their own against Pakistan. Many economists predicted that the sanctions, especially if they include a cutoff in emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund that have repeatedly staved off bankruptcy for Pakistan, could be a body blow to an economy that has staggered from crisis to crisis for decades.
The hours before the tests were marked by extreme tensions in Islamabad and New Delhi after Pakistan summoned India's diplomatic envoy to a meeting at 1:30 A.M. on Thursday and accused India of planning a pre-emptive military strike "before dawn" on the Chagai Hills testing center.
Simultaneously, Pakistan's representative to the United Nations, Ahmad Kamal, met Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York, and asked him to intervene with the United States and India to halt any Indian attack.
Pakistan issued a statement saying any Indian attack on the nuclear installations would "receive a swift and massive retaliation with unforeseen consequences."
India, which signed a pact with Pakistan in 1988 under which both nations undertook not to attack each other's nuclear installations, responded with a statement describing Pakistan's allegation as "vicious propaganda" and pledging to abide by India's obligation under the pact.
American intelligence officials expressed skepticism about Mr. Sharif's assertion that Pakistan was already mounting nuclear warheads on its missiles, as well as about Pakistani officials' assertions that India had threatened to attack the nuclear test site hours before the detonations.
Unlike India, which undertook elaborate deceptive measures ahead of its tests, catching even the Central Intelligence Agency off guard, Pakistan made its preparations under close scrutiny from Western intelligence agencies. About 24 hours before the tests, officials in Washington said American spy satellites had detected last-minute steps at the Chagai Hills site, including the pouring of concrete into the shafts prepared for the tests, and said the blasts could come at any time.
By going ahead with the tests, Mr. Sharif turned his back on a broad package of American military and economic assistance Mr. Clinton had offered if Pakistan held off.
Many economists, in Pakistan and elsewhere, have said Pakistan's $32 billion in foreign debt and more than $30 billion in domestic debt made it far more vulnerable to the sanctions imposed by Mr. Clinton than India is. A similar point has been made by Indian politicians who have supported New Delhi's tests, some of whom have said India's deeper pockets will enable it to outspend and eventually ruin Pakistan if a nuclear arms race develops.
In rejecting the American overtures, Mr. Sharif said he was bowing to overwhelming domestic political pressures, from military chiefs, opposition leaders like former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and powerful Muslim clerics. Ms. Bhutto had vowed to "take to the streets" at the head of mass demonstrations in a bid to force Mr. Sharif from office if he did not go ahead with the tests, and she had even urged Western powers to mount a "pre-emptive" strike on India's nuclear installations to help Pakistan.
It was Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who as Pakistan's President committed the country to a covert nuclear weapons program in the early 1970's, telling associates that the world needed an "Islamaic bomb" to match those under the control of Christians, Communists and, once India's secret nuclear weapons program matured, Hindus. After Mr. Bhutto was overthrown by the Pakistani Army in 1977 and hanged in 1979, there were reports that some of the financing for the Pakistani program came from other Muslim countries, including Libya.
But according to Western intelligence reports and court records, an equally important role was played, in most cases inadvertently, by Western countries. Since the 1970's, Pakistani scientists and intelligence agents have illicitly obtained much of the know-how needed to build nuclear weapons, as well as many of the components. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the physicist who oversaw the tests, is said to have played a key role by photocopying classified documents while he was working in a laboratory in the Netherlands in the 1970's.
In his television address, Mr. Sharif, a 48-year-old industrialist who has alternated in office with Ms. Bhutto since the end of military rule in 1988, spoke of the nuclear tests as a national rite of passage as well as an "inevitable" defensive measure after India's nuclear tests.
"Today, we have made history," he said, speaking in Urdu, the national language. "Today, God has given us the opportunity to take critical steps for the country's defense. We have become a nuclear power."
The Pakistani leader described India as "an expansionist power" and claimed that New Delhi had "started" all three wars between the two countries in 1947, 1965 and 1971.
But he reserved some of his strongest language for Western powers, saying they had ignored repeated pleas from Pakistan. "The big powers have never taken us seriously, and have accepted India's falsehoods instead," he said. "So what happened today must be seen as a natural reaction on our part."
But Mr. Sharif devoted most of his address to the economic challenge facing Pakistan. He said he had ordered all Government ministers to move out of their official residences, and announced that he would leave what he described as the "palatial" Prime Minister's residence, a $50 million mansion. He said the residences would be turned into schools, clinics and welfare centers.
He said sanctions would give Pakistan an opportunity to abandon decades of profligacy and corruption, especially by a small minority of rich Pakistanis, who he said had "mortgaged" the country's future. He announced an immediate end to the import of foreign luxury goods like cars and television sets, a crackdown on rampant tax evasion and a drive against smuggling, which has cut into the customs duties that are the Government's largest revenue source.
"By imposing sanctions, the Western powers will have done us a favor," he said. "They will have given us a chance to effect a revolution in our way of life, to learn to live within our means and to stop this cynical wastage of our national resources. We must conserve every penny of foreign exchange, and treat it like oxygen, essential to our country's survival. We will have to be disciplined, at all times, in all places."
In another decree today, Mr. Sharif imposed "temporary restrictions" on all foreign exchange transactions in Pakistan and a mandatory "holiday" for all banks. The moves appeared to be an effort to halt a flight of foreign investment and a run on the hard-currency bank accounts held by many wealthy Pakistanis.
For many Pakistanis, belt-tightening is likely to be superfluous, since tens of millions live in conditions of extreme deprivation, with menial jobs or none at all, no access to safe drinking water and little in the way of education or medical care. By most estimates, Pakistan is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world.
But as was the case in India after its nuclear tests, the streets of Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, as well as scores of other cities and towns, were filled with celebrations by Pakistanis from every rung on the economic ladder.
"I'm very glad we've done it -- it was the right thing to do," said Raisuddin, a butcher in Karachi, a city of 15 million people that was virtually paralyzed by traffic jams as people headed for the city center to join in the festivities, according to an Associated Press report.
An Agence France-Presse report from Lahore, 15 miles from the Indian border in east-central Pakistan, described crowds burning effigies of Mr. Vajpayee, the Indian leader, and chanting slogans in praise of Mr. Sharif, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, Pakistan's army chief, and Dr. Khan, the physicist. The report quoted a university student as saying, "We are ready to pay any price and make any sacrifice to live as a self-respecting nation."

MCI to Sell Internet Unit Amid Chill in Merger Review
MCI Communications agreed to sell its wholesale Internet business to Cable and Wireless P.L.C. for $625 million. While the deal is widely seen as a move to appease regulators reviewing MCI's acquisition by Worldcom, it also illustrates the increasingly testy relations between MCI and the Justice Department. 
 Executives said MCI had earlier sought an indication from the Justice Department whether the sale would allay its antitrust concerns, but that the department would not so indicate. MCI has appeared to grow increasingly frustrated with the department's handling of the merger. Page D4.

INTERNATIONAL A3-11
 
Pakistan, Answering India, Conducts Nuclear Tests
Pakistan responded to India's nuclear tests with underground nuclear tests of its own. Within hours, Pakistan's Prime Minister declared his country a "nuclear power," fulfilling a secret plan made by a predecessor nearly 30 years ago that it would build an "Islamic bomb." A1 

U.S. Penalizes Pakistan
President Clinton denounced Pakistan's nuclear tests as dangerously destabilizing and imposed penalties that could cost the Islamic nation billions of dollars. A1
 
Pakistan has long depended on the World Bank, and more recently the International Monetary Fund, to prop up a failing banking system and a debt-ridden economy. A9
 
Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia joined the United States in taking action against Pakistan. France, Russia and Britain condemned the testing but did not back sanctions. A10
 
China expressed "deep regret" over Pakistan's decision to conduct nuclear tests, but denounced India for provoking the crisis. A10
 
The global network of seismometers that track earthquakes and underground atomic tests detected a lone nuclear signal from Pakistan. The signal could have been from several simultaneous blasts, scientists said, or from a single detonation. A10
 
Russia Asks for Fiscal Support
President Boris N. Yeltsin said he would appeal to Western leaders for a support package to help stabilize Russia's shaky economy. A3
 
Germany Approves Pardon
The German Parliament approved a mass pardon for hundreds of thousands of people punished unjustly by Nazi courts, military tribunals and medical panels. The new law is intended to provide moral rehabilitation for those Germans who fell afoul of the Nazis as resistance fighters, homosexuals or deserters. A3
 
Sentence for Internet Smut
The former head of Compuserve Deutschland was sentenced to two years in jail, with a suspended sentence, on charges of spreading pornography. The judgment was the first time in Germany that an Internet provider had been held legally responsible for images reached through its service. A3
 
Protests Resume in Indonesia
Students demonstrated in Jakarta to demand immediate elections. Their demand was repeated by the Muslim leader Amien Rais, who used the student demonstrations in recent weeks as a platform to consolidate his position as the country's most influential opposition figure. A11
 
Panamanians Oppose 2d Term
The President of Panama is facing widespread opposition to his effort to amend the country's Constitution so he can seek a second five-year term. Whoever wins the election, scheduled for next May, will administer the Panama Canal when the United States yields control of the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999. A4
 
NATIONAL A12-18
 
Catalytic Devices Found To Add to Global Warming
The catalytic converter, which has sharply reduced smog from cars, is now a significant and growing cause of global warming, the E.P.A. says. Researchers have long suspected that the converters sometimes rearrange nitrogen-oxygen compounds from exhaust to form nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas that is more than 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases, experts say. A1

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE ECONOMY;
Sanctions Could Badly Bruise Fragile Pakistan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Fear of economic sanctions from the United States did not stop India from testing five nuclear devices two weeks ago, nor did it stop Pakistan from retaliating. Now, having promised to punish both nations, the Clinton Administration is uncertain how much pain it can inflict.
Administration officials said today that they would try to delay World Bank loans to Pakistan, as they did earlier this week on loans to India. Pakistan has long depended on the World Bank, and more recently the International Monetary Fund, to prop up a failing banking system and a debt-ridden economy. 
 Because Pakistan is more heavily dependent on the World Bank and the I.M.F. than India is, the threat of delays should give the United States some leverage.
But World Bank officials say Pakistan has already received all of the $808 million in aid promised in the bank's current fiscal year, which ends on June 30.
That means that the soonest the United States could intervene to delay next year's loans and credits, which are expected to total about $750 million, is this fall, when the first projects come up for approval.
At the I.M.F., which began a three-year, $1.52 billion program in Pakistan last October, the United States could intercede to block development funds as soon as next month. Fund officials just returned from Islamabad, the capital, and they are preparing a report to pave the way for what a spokesman called "a small disbursement of funds" in June. But the next large chunk of cash is not likely to come up for approval until later this year or next.
That time span could prove important. American officials say that with backing from Japan and Canada, they can delay loans for both countries for a few months. But most board members at both the World Bank and the I.M.F. oppose the American sanctions policy, so if the issue comes to a vote, both India and Pakistan are likely to see the aid resume.
"This has started off as an issue between the U.S. and India and Pakistan," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs & Company and a top economic official in the Carter Administration.
"But it is headed toward becoming an issue between the U.S. and its closest allies: There is a philosophical difference on sanctions, and a commercial competitiveness that is likely to make most of our major trading partners unwilling to go along."
The aid is particularly important for Pakistan because that country, unlike India, receives little foreign investment. The aid received from the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other international agencies accounts for about 1.4 percent of the country's gross national product, a figure that significantly understates the importance of the money in Pakistan's beleaguered economy.
The World Bank, for example, approved $250 million in late March for a program that focuses on elementary school education, primary health care, family planning, rural water supplies and sanitation for women and children. While the bank's contribution is a small part of a $10 billion program, its involvement is critical to persuading other donors to join, and to keeping Pakistan's contributions from being diverted.
The bank maintains that a pilot version of the program has improved school enrollment in a country where only 55 percent of children attend school, compared with more than 90 percent in India and Bangladesh. Pakistan's adult literacy rate is estimated at 37 percent.
"Obviously, this is not the kind of program you would want to cut off, especially in a country where we are trying to convince people that the West is not the enemy," one senior Administration official said. "That's the problem with automatic sanctions: they don't let you differentiate very much between aid that is in America's interest and aid that is not."
In fact, while Administration officials were publicly declaring that the sanctions would be put in place as soon as possible, several expressed reservations, saying it was a poor moment to cut off economic interaction with both countries.
"It's not as if we can unexplode the nukes," the senior official noted. "We have to work with the new situation we're faced with."
There is another complication: the sanctions amendments to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, which President Clinton signed into law, do not end automatically at some point in the future. That means Congress would have to vote to end the economic isolation.
Some Administration officials fear that could greatly complicate diplomatic efforts to work out a package deal under which both countries might agree not to mount their nuclear devices on missiles, then sign nonproliferation treaties or allow inspections of their nuclear facilities.
Another part of the automatic sanctions law calls for a end to American bank loans to the Pakistan Government, but those amounts appear to be minimal. Today the Pakistan Government, apparently fearing that the country's few investors would flee, froze all foreign-currency accounts to keep hard currency in the country.

Though Pakistan receives less aid than India, its population and its economy are much more reliant on outside sources for loans and grants. Sanctions could imperil much of this aid. All figures are for 1996.

HEADLINE: United Health To Acquire Humana Inc.

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The United Healthcare Corporation, one of the nation's largest health insurers, agreed yesterday to buy Humana Inc. for $5.5 billion, further shrinking the number of competitors in the industry and narrowing the choices of managed-care plans for consumers.
The combination of the health plans, with more than 10 million members across the country, would dominate the South Florida market. It would be the strongest insurer in Chicago and some other Midwestern cities. 
 Both companies said the agreement would strengthen their ability to offer services that patients want and provide nationwide coverage for big employers. But some health-benefits consultants called such a combination part of a consolidation trend that was unsettling for many Americans in managed-care arrangements.
"Humana was a very aggressive player," said John Erb, a consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., with Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. "They gave the Blue Cross and United a run for their money. Now, that competition will dry up. There will be diminished choices for employers and consumers."
Both United and Humana recently reported strong financial results, after their success in raising this year's premiums. But like other health insurers, they are under more pressure to produce profits as consumers demand fewer restrictive rules, governments propose tighter regulations, and hospitals and physicians balk at some economizing.
Managed-care companies also face a squeeze on Government payments for Medicare for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid for low-income people. United Healthcare, based in Minnetonka, Minn., outside Minneapolis, and Humana, of Louisville, Ky., have a combined 902,000 Medicare members and 1.2 million Medicaid members.
Under the terms of the all-stock deal announced yesterday, United Healthcare would exchange one of its shares for two shares of Humana and assume $850 million of Humana's debt. On the basis of United's closing share price Wednesday of $64.125, before the deal was announced, the value of the stock swap is $5.5 billion.
United Healthcare shares fell $1.625 yesterday, to $62.50, while Humana's jumped $3.625, to $29.875.
The agreement is the latest in a series of huge-scale mergers and acquisitions in the health insurance industry. In March, Aetna Inc., which bought U.S. Healthcare for $8.8 billion in 1996, agreed to add the Nylcare health care unit of the New York Life Insurance Company in a $1.35 billion deal.
Both United and Humana have grown through acquisitions, notably the 1995 purchase by United of Metra Health, itself a combination of units of Metropolitan Life and the Travelers Insurance Company.
David Jones, a Kentucky entrepreneur, founded Humana with a partner in 1961. They owned nursing homes and later, hospitals. Humana spun off the hospitals in 1993 as a separate company, Galen Health Care Inc., which was later acquired by the chain that became the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation.
Mr. Jones, chairman of Humana, and Dr. William W. McGuire, chairman of United, said the combined company would promote United's "open access" health plans, which permit members to consult any specialist from a list approved by United, without approval in advance by their primary doctor.
Mr. Jones said it would have cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" for Humana to duplicate the computerized information systems that United has developed, which make it possible to allow more flexible choices of doctors for consumers while keeping track of physicians' activity, an important cost-control device for managed-care plans.
Doctors whose costs for patients are deemed excessive "can be identified and counseled," Mr. Jones said.
Dr. McGuire said profit margins were narrow in health insurance, while the demand for more capital was increasing. "You've got to have strong organizations," he said.
The two companies combined would have 602,000 members in health maintenance organizations in Miami, or 48 percent of that market, according to Interstudy, a nonprofit managed-care research center in Minneapolis. Dr. McGuire said United and Humana would have 1.4 million customers in all types of health care in Florida, or less than 10 percent of the state's estimated 14.7 million people.
In the Chicago market for health maintenance organizations, United and Humana would have a 28 percent share, ahead of H.M.O. Illinois, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, with 24 percent, Interstudy said.
Under the deal, Mr. Jones would have 4.5 million shares of United Healthcare and a seat on the United board. No new positions were immediately announced for Gregory H. Wolf, chief executive of Humana, or other Humana executives.
Security analysts said the lesser role for Humana officials could mean less of the clash of cultures that has hampered many deals. "The track record for mergers in this sector is less than stellar," said Rob Maines, an analyst with Advest Inc. Analysts said it had taken a year to 18 months for several health care companies to get back on their feet after big merger deals.
Dr. McGuire said the Humana acquisition would bring eventual savings of $100 million to $250 million by eliminating overlapping administrative costs and "a couple hundred million" through efficiencies in medical care, including $100 million from lower payments to hospitals.
The combined company, with headquarters near Minneapolis, would start with 50,000 employees before shedding an unspecified number.
In the transaction, Goldman, Sachs & Company and the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell advised United Healthcare. Humana was advised by Lehman Brothers and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.

HEADLINE: Autos' Converters Cut Smog But Add to Global Warming

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The catalytic converter, an invention that has sharply reduced smog from cars, has now become a significant and growing cause of global warming, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Hailed as a miracle by Detroit auto makers even today, catalytic converters have been reducing smog for 20 years. The converters break down compounds of nitrogen and oxygen from car exhaust that can combine with hydrocarbons, also from cars, and be cooked by sunlight into smog. 
 But researchers have suspected for years that the converters sometimes rearrange the nitrogen-oxygen compounds to form nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas. And nitrous oxide is more than 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases that trap heat and warm the atmosphere like in a greenhouse, experts say.
This spring, the E.P.A. published a study estimating that nitrous oxide now accounts for about 7.2 percent of the gases that cause global warming. Cars and trucks, most fitted with catalytic converters, produce nearly half of that nitrous oxide, the study said.
The E.P.A. has not proposed a solution at this point.
Other sources of nitrous oxide include everything from nitrogen-based fertilizer to manure from farm animals.
The E.P.A.'s study also showed that nitrous oxide is one of a few gases for which emissions are increasing rapidly. The gases are collectively known as greenhouse gases.
The increase in nitrous oxide, the study notes, stems from the growth in the number of miles traveled by cars that have catalytic converters. And the problem has worsened as improvements in the converters, changes that have eliminated more of the nitrogen-oxygen compounds that cause smog, have conversely produced more nitrous oxide.
Wylie J. Barbour, an E.P.A. official who worked on the recently published study, said the problem created by the converter was classic: "You've got people trying to solve one problem, and as is not uncommon, they've created another."
Nitrous oxide, or N2 O, is not regulated because the Clean Air Act was written in 1970 to control smog, not global warming. And no regulations exist to control greenhouse gases.
The United States and the other industrialized nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan, last December to lower emissions of greenhouse gases to 5 percent below 1990 levels, over the next 10 to 15 years, but the agreement has not been approved by the Senate and no implementing rules have been written.
"This hadn't really been on people's radar screen until climate change started becoming an issue," said one E.P.A. official involved in reducing pollution from cars, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Auto industry experts say they can solve the problem by tinkering with the catalytic converter, but some environmentalists suggest that the growing production of nitrous oxide is yet another reason to move away from gasoline-powered cars. The E.P.A.'s study estimated that nitrous oxide may represent about one-sixth of the global warming effect that results from gasoline use.
Precisely how much nitrous oxide the converters produce remains an issue. A report used by the E.P.A. in preparing its greenhouse gas study calculated that a car with a fuel economy of about 19 miles a gallon would produce 0.27 grams of nitrous oxide per mile. That represents an amount that is about one-third the emissions for nitrogen oxide, the chemicals causing smog.
Steven H. Cadle, a research scientist at General Motors, said, "it's a huge number." In contrast, an older car without a catalytic converter produces much larger amounts of nitrogen oxides, but only about a tenth as much nitrous oxide, the greenhouse gas.
The E.P.A. calculated that production of nitrous oxide from vehicles rose by nearly 50 percent between 1990 and 1996 as older cars without converters have neared extinction. Using a standard unit of measure for global-warming gases, millions of metric tons of carbon equivalent, nitrous oxide emissions rose to 54.7 million tons from 36.7 million during those years, the study said.
The contradictory impact of the converter has not been lost on environmental officials or industry experts, who continue to debate the extent of the growing problem as well as how to reduce the emissions in future years.
Ned Sullivan, head of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said the converter problem requires a "comprehensive" response. "This specific issue fits into a broader context that our regulatory system has tended to deal with pollutants on an individual, rather than a comprehensive, basis," he said.
Mr. Sullivan and others favor moving away from today's typical car design, a big gasoline engine driving the wheels, to electric cars. Another solution is hybrid cars, which use small, efficient engines running on gasoline to help turn the wheels and to charge batteries for electric motors that also run the wheels. Those have much higher fuel economy, and thus lower greenhouse gas emissions.
But car industry experts favor less drastic changes. They propose cutting nitrous oxide production by adjusting catalytic converters. They believe that redesigning the converters to reach optimum temperature faster would solve the problem and would also help them destroy other pollutants better.
 
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page headline on Friday about the contribution of automobiles' catalytic converters to global warming misstated the amount of nitrous oxide that the Environmental Protection Agency believes comes from the devices. A draft study by the E.P.A. said that about 3 percent comes from cars and trucks, out of a total contribution of 7 percent from all manmade sources. Cars and trucks alone do not account for 7 percent. In a statement issued yesterday in response to the article, the E.P.A. said the production of the gas by converters "could be closer to 2 percent or less."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Giants Ready to Unload Miller in Payroll Purge

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
Monday marks the beginning of the National Football League's annual roster-shaping and payroll-trimming festival. After June 1, salary cap regulations make it advantageous for some teams to dump high-salaried players, and many teams do.
What ensues is an unusually open market for veteran players -- many of whom are valuable and suddenly free agents. 
 For the Giants, the notable departure will be center Brian Williams, who will retire. Williams, 31, was on the verge of his first All-Pro season a year ago when he injured his eye seriously at the team's training camp. He was sidelined for the entire 1997 season with double vision that has not abated sufficiently for him to continue his football career.
Except for that somber announcement, the Giants -- initially at least -- will not be busy. But they will be closely watching the other teams, eager to find a gem in the pool of players cast aside in this grand payroll purge.
And should a quality defensive tackle or defensive end become available, the Giants will not let him stay unemployed for long. In the transaction that would follow, Corey Miller, a starting linebacker last year and, with seven pro seasons, one of the Giants' most experienced players, would be cut.
Miller's departure would save the Giants $1.5 million in salary -- money the team would use to sign its new defensive lineman.
Miller is in a salary squabble with the Giants, who want to cut Miller's $1.5 million salary by $600,000. The Giants now view Miller as a likely backup to Marcus Buckley, whom the team re-signed as a free agent this winter.
The Giants do not want to pay a backup $1.5 million, though the restructured contract they have proposed to Miller is laden with incentives that would return the $600,000 lost in salary if Miller were to regain his starting job.
Miller and the Giants haven't been able to come to a new salary arrangement. The Giants may need Miller next season, and they know it. Buckley is unproven as a strongside linebacker and, at 236 pounds, is considered undersized for the position.
But it is risky for Miller to try to call the Giants' bluff. If a reliable defensive lineman becomes a free agent this week, the Giants will not hesitate to jettison Miller and hand over at least part of his salary to the new player. Because as much as Miller adds depth, the Giants are thin and inexperienced on the defensive front line.
The front line's starting foursome -- defensive ends Michael Strahan and Chad Bratzke and tackles Robert Harris and Keith Hamilton -- had superb seasons last year, but this winter, the Giants lost the backup defensive tackle Ray Agnew to free agency. Harris recently had shoulder surgery. The team has said that Harris will be recovered by training camp, but there are always questions following surgery and Harris is not the only Giant defender attempting that kind of comeback.
Bratzke is returning from knee surgery, even if he looked nimble and fit during the team's minicamp earlier this month. Cedric Jones, the defensive end and 1996 first-round pick still in search of his first N.F.L. sack, also had an injury-riddled season as Bratzke's backup last year. Christian Peter, another backup at tackle, played sparingly as a rookie.
Williams's vision has not improved in a substantial way -- as far as his football capabilities -- for months despite a series of surgeries. His retirement has been timed to allow the Giants the most salary-cap relief for this season. Williams's $1.55 million base pay will not be charged to the Giants' cap. The Giants are expected to use this money to sign the players selected in April's league draft.

HEADLINE: Sanctuary Lost: Hong Kong Can't Hide From Asia's Woes

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 29

 BODY:
For the last year, as one thriving Asian economy after another caught a chill, this former British colony has seemed like the region's healthiest outpost. Today, though, Hong Kong acknowledged that it had come down with a full-blown case of the Asian economic flu.
The Hong Kong Government announced that its economy contracted by about 2 percent in the first quarter of 1998. It was the first time the economy shrank since the middle of 1985, and it raised the prospect that Hong Kong was entering its most severe recession since World War II. 
 "We are facing an unprecedented economic upheaval," said Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's top financial official, as he announced the much-anticipated economic statistics just after the close of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. "There is no panacea that will take immediate effect," he added.
In keeping with its role as the trading post for Asia, Hong Kong has not just shown isolated signs of economic distress -- say, a troubled banking system or a loss of investor confidence. It has caught a little of everything from its Asian neighbors: depressed consumer demand, declining export growth, tight credit and a plummeting real estate market.
"The uniqueness of Hong Kong is its open economy," said Ian K. Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "It's like being a boxer in the ring, trying to throw off punches from many opponents. But now we're starting to get punched by the referee as well."
Hong Kong was able to put off its day of reckoning because -- unlike Indonesia, South Korea or Thailand -- it did not have suffocating foreign debt or an insolvent banking system. Indeed, it managed to keep its dollar pegged to the United States dollar even as speculators were on the attack and its Asian neighbors were slashing the value of their currencies.
But in the end, Hong Kong's dependence on trade with the rest of Asia guaranteed that it would suffer, too. "However strong our system is, we can't insulate ourselves from the storm elsewhere," said Richard Margolis, regional strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, tried to prepare the public for the dismal results in a speech on Tuesday. But even pessimists were taken aback by the 2 percent decline. And Mr. Perkin said second-quarter results were likely to be just as bad, predicting that Hong Kong would suffer its first full year of contraction since it began keeping statistics in 1961.
Mr. Tung has so far declined to say that Hong Kong is entering a recession. But by the generally accepted definition -- two straight quarters of contraction -- it may already be here.
Sir Donald acknowledged that Hong Kong would not attain the Government's official forecast of 3.5 percent growth this year, but he declined to give a revised forecast, saying the continued turmoil in neighboring countries made it all but impossible to predict when Hong Kong would hit bottom.
Meanwhile, he appealed to people not to despair. "As soon as the situation stabilizes, especially in Indonesia and Japan, I'm quite sure that Hong Kong will be the first economy to turn around," he said.
But people here already seem to be looking on the dark side. The Hang Seng Index plunged a total of more than 6 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, before rebounding slightly today on rumors that the Government would announce measures to ease the effects of the downturn. Sir Donald did disclose a modest package of steps to increase tourism and help homeowners finance mortgages.
But at the upscale Landmark mall in central Hong Kong, where tourists and locals used to emerge with arm loads of designer clothing and accessories, people were browsing rather than buying on a recent afternoon.
"We're being more frugal these days," said Lau Kit Yee, a 32-year-old Hong Kong native who owns a garment-trading company. "I'm more careful of what I buy, and I only buy things that I need." Ms. Lau said many of her competitors in the garment business had been forced to shut down in the last year -- contributing to an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent, the highest in 14 years.
Tourists, meanwhile, are becoming a rare species. The number of visitors to Hong Kong dropped 24 percent in the first quarter. In an effort to drum up business, the Government said it would relax visa requirements for Taiwan residents and raise the weekly quota of mainland Chinese allowed entry.
Among the most revealing numbers, retail sales dropped 14 percent in the first quarter. Consumers have been spending less in part because the value of their primary assets -- their homes -- has been hit by a stomach-churning decline. Residential real estate prices have dropped more than 40 percent since last year, while commercial real estate has fallen about 30 percent.
Of course, the decline comes after years of frenzied speculation, when Hong Kong became famous as the city of the $20,000-a-month apartment and the $100 million private home. But those who bought homes when the prices were rising now face huge potential losses.
"It's fine for people who are going to buy, but don't forget that half of Hong Kong's people own their own homes," said Nicholas Brooke, chairman of Brooke Hillier Parker, a real estate brokerage firm.
The slack demand has, in turn, kicked off a price war among Hong Kong's usually cozy developers. Last week, in a rare mutiny against the Government, several of Hong Kong's most prominent developers demanded that Mr. Tung back off from his most cherished policy goal: building 85,000 apartments a year over five years to bring affordable housing to low-income people.
The developers said the Government was flooding Hong Kong with apartments, further depressing the market. Mr. Tung has not abandoned his policy, but the Government said today that it would scrap other regulations that it adopted during the heyday of Hong Kong real estate to curb speculation.
The property market is a home-grown problem. But Hong Kong's other woes have been made worse by its neighbors. Japan's economic woes, for example, have dire implications here because big Japanese banks are pulling credit lines to small and midsize businesses.
"It's the old story about the good borrower and the bad borrower," said Gary L. Greenberg, managing director of Van Eck Global Asset Management. "The bank will take the money back from the good borrower. Hong Kong is the good borrower, while the rest of the region is the bad."
Economic misery in Japan, Korea, and Indonesia has also slowed Hong Kong's exports to those countries. Exports grew 1 percent in the first quarter, a pittance compared with the 20 percent annual gains typical of the early 1990's. And the poor performance comes despite continued strong demand from the United States, Europe and China.
If China's growth slows -- as many analysts expect -- exports could tumble further. A few contend that China may also devalue its currency, the renminbi, which would put enormous pressure on Hong Kong to uncouple its dollar from the United States dollar. But that remains a minority view, and most experts still see Hong Kong's dollar as the bedrock of its economy.
Despite all the dark clouds, a few observers found a silver lining. Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians said public dissatisfaction with the state of the economy brought people out in record numbers to vote in Sunday's legislative elections. The pro-democracy candidates won a sweeping victory and are already gearing up to battle the Government on economic issues.
And Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said the troubled Asian economies would use exports to climb out of recession. As the largest trading and shipping center in the region, he said, Hong Kong would benefit as these countries began exporting again.
"I think you'll look back on this period and say, 'Yes, Hong Kong was hard hit, but the market did its job,' " Mr. Fung said.

HEADLINE: Income and Spending Were Up in April

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Growth in personal income accelerated in April and consumer spending continued to increase, signs that domestic demand was helping to offset the effect of the Asian crisis on the economy.
The Commerce Department said today that incomes rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, faster than March's gain of three-tenths of 1 percent. Spending rose half a percent, unchanged from March. 
 Trends in income can portend future business activity because they indicate how much consumers will be able to spend. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services.
Still, the outlook is uncertain. Government figures released on Thursday showed that the economy grew at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, faster than previously estimated. But a significant portion of the growth came from an accumulation of inventories, suggesting the economy could slow in the second quarter. With inventories higher, businesses will probably draw down existing stocks for a while.
Also, if turbulence in the stock market continues, consumers may become nervous and refrain from making big-ticket purchases.
In today's report, the Commerce Department also said that disposable income, the money left after taxes, increased four-tenths of 1 percent in April after having risen three-tenths of 1 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Catch-22

BYLINE: By Robert C. McFarlane; Robert C. McFarlane was national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1985.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Ten days ago, in a long session with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, I found him sobered and deeply anguished by the choices before him.
In addition to the obvious nuclear catastrophe that could occur if Pakistan's armed confrontation with India in Kashmir got out of control, he understood quite well the ruinous economic impact that a nuclear arms race with India could have on his country, which already spends 70 percent of the national budget on defense and debt service. Worse, however, would be for Pakistan to be subjugated and ultimately dismembered by the nationalist-led, fanatically anti-Muslim Government in India, which with each day's rhetoric has seemed devoted to that very course. 
 Mr. Sharif wanted desperately to find a way to deter India. Yet unless he received concrete security assurances from the United States and/or China -- a firm commitment to respond jointly to any Indian attack upon Pakistan -- he would have no choice but to respond in kind to India's nuclear tests. The only way he could compensate for India's lopsided advantage in conventional forces would be by relying on nuclear weapons -- as the NATO alliance did vis-a-vis the Soviet Union for 40 years in Europe.
Not wanting to embarrass his American guest, Mr. Sharif asked obliquely, "Do you think China would give us a security guarantee?" I replied that I doubted it, and, going on to answer his implied question, I said that for the United States to do so would require a far greater understanding among Americans and in the Congress of the stakes involved.
I added that about as much as he could hope for in the short term would be a commitment from President Clinton to begin working immediately with him on a joint security policy that could lead to the kind of assurance he was seeking. In his exchanges with President Clinton since then, he sought that kind of commitment. Apparently he didn't believe he received it.
Yes, this crisis could have been avoided, with outside intervention. To be fair, however, the failure to prevent it lies with leaders of both of our political parties, who have never wanted to invest the time and energy required to mediate the well-known disagreements between India and Pakistan. Instead, by default, American policy has been forged by the Congress, which has put in place a nonsensical framework of sanctions -- of "sticks" alone -- while offering no incentives for restraint or intellectual solutions to Pakistan's problems.
Ask yourself what you would do as Prime Minister of Pakistan, faced with an imbalance of at least 2-to-1 with India in every measure of conventional power? You would seek a security guarantee from the United States or China that, however ambiguous, might at least complicate Indian thinking before an attack. And if you couldn't get that, you would "go nuclear."
Where do we go from here? First, looking to the wider audience of nuclear wannabes, we must make it clear that India's prideful boasting of having joined the club of great powers is false and that there will be no rewards -- but instead, severe pain -- for its unwarranted decision. We must make clear to the Indian Government that it is today what it was two weeks ago, an arrogant, overreaching cabal that, by its devotion to the caste system, the political and economic disenfranchisement of its people and its religious intolerance, is unworthy of membership in any club. Concurrently, we should make clear that we welcome into the real club those nations, like Brazil and Argentina, that have had the courage and good sense to forgo nuclear weapons and instead to focus on providing for their people.
Second, we should show some active, visible leadership. President Clinton should commit himself to a sustained period of intense political, economic and security diplomacy with both sides.
It must focus first on a serious analysis of the precarious security situation in South Asia and the most volatile source of current tension, the Kashmir dispute. In addition to offering to mediate that disagreement, the President must focus on the root causes of poverty and unrest in both countries. That analysis could provide a basis for convening an international donors group, including Japan, Germany, Britain, the World Bank and others, to begin -- finally -- to think seriously about the human misery in South Asia.
In parallel, we must put forward and lead a serious agenda of arms control. Separate, but related, is the enduring need to assure the security of the weakest member in the region, Pakistan. But it is not beyond the wit of sensible people who understand both the stakes and the awful history of the region to do so.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
My China For Your Congress

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Let's get straight to the point: President Clinton has no business, no business whatsoever, going to China now. The Republicans are right. President Clinton is wrong, wrong, wrong. He should stay home. This trip to China is an outrage. A sham. An embarrassment. It should be canceled. Today. Now. Immediately.
On one condition. 
 That if the President agrees not to go to China, the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich agree not to go home. That's right. Mr. Clinton cancels his trip to Beijing and the Republicans cancel all Congressional recesses and agree to keep everyone at work until they pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.
Why not? That's the only thing worth the President staying home for. Because that's the only thing that's going to begin to solve this problem of candidates selling themselves and legislation to the highest bidder -- including foreigners. You can't buy something that's not for sale, and until we have a campaign finance system in this country that makes it much more difficult for Democrats and Republicans to put themselves up for sale, then this problem will never go away.
Of course we still need to investigate whether the Clintonites sold out America's national security interests to China for campaign cash. If so, they should be drawn and quartered. But let's get real. Lott, Gingrich & Company want to investigate the President for campaign finance improprieties, but when they had a chance to pass the McCain-Feingold bill to prevent future such improprieties they killed it. And why did they kill it? Because the Republicans are historically better at exploiting the soft-money loophole than the Democrats, and they assume that if they can keep that loophole in place, they can cement their hold over Congress and buy back the White House.
If this situation is not addressed now it is only going to get worse, because the more we move toward an open, globalized economy, the more foreigners will try to take advantage of our lack of campaign finance laws to penetrate our system and pervert it to their ends.
It is already ridiculously easy: A Chinese People's Liberation Army general writes a check to his daughter. His daughter, a lieutenant colonel, writes a check to her American friend Johnny Chung. Her American friend writes checks to the Democratic Party for $100,000. Bingo. The President makes a decision that potentially benefits the Chinese general's company. The head of Loral Space & Communications, Bernard Schwartz, contributes $600,000 in soft money to the Democratic Party and the President decides to allow Loral to export a communications satellite to China for launch on a Chinese rocket -- despite a pending criminal investigation of Loral for providing China with missile-launch technology.
Both of these foul-smelling deals would be much less likely if the McCain-Feingold bill were passed, with its hard limits on how much any single individual or corporation can give to any candidate in one election, and with its elimination of the soft-money loophole, which allows unlimited contributions to political parties to buy political advertising -- a license for politicians to beg for money from corporate donors.
Trent Lott says just follow the existing campaign finance laws. But, as Senator Feingold remarked to me: "That is very misleading because the laws themselves are inadequate. The current law allows for the sorts of enormous campaign contributions that led to the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom. But the Republican leaders don't want to make those laws adequate because they are benefiting from them even more than the Democrats. This is about who has the money and who has the power, and Lott & Company are ready to stand in the face of scandals and corruption and public disgust to hold onto the cash."
The support for McCain-Feingold is clearly growing. The President has endorsed it, and the bill now has 52 senators backing it, including 7 courageous Republicans. So if Republicans want the President to show some leadership and stay home from China, then their leaders should show some leadership and stay at the office. It's time both parties stopped serving Chinese generals and U.S. fat cats and started serving the American people with some real campaign finance reform that actually confronts the problem.
Mr. Lott, Mr. Gingrich, remember that old Chinese proverb: Put up or shut up.

HEADLINE: BRIDGE;
A Non-Pro Wins the Trophy For Master Points in a Year

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott 

 BODY:
In the early days of the game there were two national organizations, William McKenney's American Bridge League, with roots in auction bridge, and Ely Culbertson's United States Bridge Association. They were merged in 1937, with McKenney in command, and Charles Goren was named the first winner of the McKenney Trophy for winning the most master points in a year. He won seven more times, a record.
Second best with six victories was Barry Crane, and after his death in 1985 the name was changed to the Barry Crane Top 500. Since then there have been many different winners, nearly all of them professionals who play weekly on the tournament circuit with clients who can afford their fees. 
 The 1997 winner did not fit the mold. Randy Pettit of Marietta, Ga., is a 54-year-old semiretired financial planner who is neither a professional nor a client. His bridge planning is perhaps less effective, for he sometimes arrives at a tournament without partners and teammates and relies on happenstance. His skill is such that the professionals are happy to recruit him as a team member or play with him when they are unemployed.
In 1997, he attended all three national championships, 18 regional tournaments and three sectionals, far less than most of the professionals. But by the end of the year he had accumulated 2,117 master points. A perennial contender, Paul Soloway of Mill Creek, Wash., took second place. This was a remarkable performance by Pettit, who has battled attention deficit disorder all his life.
Pettit's favorite bridge memory concerns the diagramed deal, played long ago in a Grand National Team match against strong opponents. His partner, Bill Lohmann of Atlanta, opened the West hand with one no-trump. The partnership was using the superweak notrump, showing 10 to 13 high card points, as many experts do when the vulnerability is in their favor.
His opponents reached the normal four-spade contract, but en route North made a splinter bid. His jump to four clubs was an optimistic slam suggestion showing a spade fit with club shortness. Pettit, East, doubled this to show length and strength in clubs.
The idea was to suggest a club lead rather than a diamond, advice that Lohmann did not happen to need. But guided by the double he made an imaginative move: He underled his ace-king of clubs.
East won with the queen and shifted to the diamond ten. South finessed, losing to the king, and a diamond was returned.
South was a puzzled man. The normal reason for East to win the first trick with the club queen is that he has all the top honors. But West had shown 10-13, so something funny was going on.
The declarer was the central character in that old Hitchcock thriller, "The Man Who Knew Too Much." Searching for West's high-card points, he finessed the spade jack. That did not work, for East produced the queen and returned a trump. South won and could not now ruff two clubs in the dummy. Still convinced that West had high cards outside clubs, he finessed the heart queen and was discomfited to see Pettit produce the king, another card he was not supposed to have.
In the replay South had no useful information and had no trouble making an overtrick. The result was 13 imps for Pettit, Lohmann and their teammates.

HEADLINE: In Buying We Trust;
The Foundation of U.S. Consumerism Was Laid in the 18th Century

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
"A penny saved is a penny earned" and Benjamin Franklin's other homespun exhortations may stir nostalgia for an earlier age when habits of frugality and thrift are thought to have been more deeply ingrained in the American character.
Yet some scholars have questioned whether those early colonial Americans wouldn't have been almost as devoted to, say, the Home Shopping Network as their modern counterparts are. 
 "Recent scholarship has convincingly demolished the notion of a sudden and late revolution that transformed America into a nation of consumers," writes Daniel Horowitz in "The Morality of Spending," a 1992 history of consumer attitudes. Carole Shammas, a historian at the University of California at Riverside, agrees: "The foundations of American consumerism were laid in the 18th century," when large quantities of imported manufactured goods from England started to circulate in the 13 colonies.
Indeed, the origins of colonial America's relationship with thrift and consumerism are complicated. While there was certainly a reverence for the values associated with thrift, there was also a vital and active consumerism.
Yet until recently, only the thrift side of the equation was emphasized. It was assumed that thrift was an article of faith for America's early Protestant dissenters, Puritans, Baptists, Methodists, Quakers and the like. And indeed, they believed that God had called man to occupy a particular place in this world, and therefore he must fulfill the obligations imposed on him by his "calling." This implied careful husbandry of possessions because they came from God.
As David Fischer, a historian at Brandeis University, points out, as late as 1775 no less than three-quarters of the churches in the colonies belonged to dissenting Protestant faiths that believed every man had such a sacred calling.
Many colonial Americans also harbored a visceral suspicion of wealth, luxury and self-indulgence, believing they threatened social cohesion. When James Oglethorpe was planning the settlement of Georgia, for instance, he envisioned a utopian society in which each family would be limited to 500 acres and trade in land would be prohibited.
But the picture of the self-sufficient early settler carving a home out of the wilderness in a pre-capitalist environment is only part of the story. Historians now argue that thrift was imposed on the early colonists by the natural rigors of the world they found and for many reflected not so much a monkish wish to live simply as the desire to grow richer.
As John Wesley, the 18th-century founder of Methodism, wrote, "We ought not to prevent people from being diligent and frugal; we must exhort all Christians to gain all they can, and to save all they can; that is, in effect, to grow rich."
And Alexis de Tocqueville, the celebrated French observer of the New World, noted in 1831 that "Love of money is either the chief or a secondary motive at the bottom of everything the Americans do."
Max Weber put another dent in the thrift myth more than 50 years ago in his famous work "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." He showed how belief in salvation through hard work at one's "calling" laid the foundations of capitalism by encouraging men to accumulate riches. Such accumulation was fine in the eyes of the early American Protestants as long as men resisted the temptations that the riches created. Thus what Weber termed the "worldly asceticism" of America's Puritan founders also contained the seeds of that rip-roaring modern consumer capitalism that was eventually to devour it.
These days many historians believe early American colonists were even more involved in a market economy than previously thought, importing goods from England and trading with each other rather than fighting what one historian has termed "a desperate rear-guard action against the spread of capitalism."
In a paper titled "An Empire of Goods," the historian T. H. Green said that Staffordshire china was the 18th-century equivalent of Coca-Cola.
And in "Wealth of a Nation to Be: The American Colonies on the Eve of the Revolution," Alice H. Jones writes of "the substantial size and character of wealth in consumer goods" among colonists.
In fact, historians such as Shammas, Jones and Horowitz argue that the continual exhortations to be thrifty and practice self-restraint were prompted by the growth of consumerism, not the lack of it. Americans throughout the 18th century and even more in the 19th were faced with a growing array of consumer goods such as glass and china, pots and pans and decorative objects, making frugality a difficult virtue to embrace.
From 1828 to 1878, Sarah Hale, a famously prolific journalist, preached the virtues of thrift to American housewives in women's journals and tirelessly inveighed against consumption. These years saw the establishment of over 600 savings banks in the Eastern states by philanthropic bodies such as the New York Society for the Prevention of Pauperism and The Christian Disciple, a Boston religious paper, with the express aim of encouraging thrift among the working poor as well as savings institutions in public schools to teach children thrifty habits.
At around the turn of the century the intellectual climate shifted with the emergence of three thinkers who predicted an age of economic abundance in which the need to preach thriftiness would no longer be appropriate.
In "The New Basis of Civilization," published in 1907, Simon N. Patten saw the United States moving from "a pain or deficit economy" to a "pleasure or surplus economy." His conclusion, eerily similar to that reached by John Kenneth Galbraith 50 years later in "The Affluent Society," was that the country's surplus should be used to help the poor and to improve public services, not on conspicuous consumption by the rich.
Thorstein Veblen, who coined the phrase "conspicuous consumption" in 1899, also understood modern industry's potential for raising living standards across the board but carped at the rich for diverting its product to their own extravagant uses. The lesser-known George Gunton, a British immigrant, preached that shorter working hours and high wages stimulated mass consumption, profiting worker and capitalist alike.
With the American entry into World War I, the Federal Government threw its weight behind a national thrift campaign to pay for the conflict, selling $17 billion worth of Liberty Bonds and collecting $1 billion in War Savings. So successful was this campaign that Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon tried to continue it after the peace but ran into significant opposition from business, which, with industrial productivity rising, wanted people to spend.
In New York, store windows were plastered with posters of Uncle Sam at the controls of a locomotive saying: "Full speed ahead. Clear the track for prosperity. Buy what you need now." Even The New York Times called the Government's thrift campaign irritating and wearisome. In 1924 the United States Treasury threw in the towel. Officially sanctioned consumerism had won.
Only after the World War I did the golden age of mass consumption first envisaged by Patten, Veblen and Gunton finally dawn.
In "Buy Now, Pay Later" published in 1991, Martha L. Olney says the 1920's saw a revolution in consumer taste as Americans not only increased their purchases of consumer durables but also switched from buying china, furniture, books and jewelry to newly mass-produced items such as cars, radios and household appliances.
The average American household spent $79 a year between 1889 and 1908 on consumer durables; that rose to to $267 a year from 1919 to 1928, helped by the invention of consumer credit and an explosion of advertising spending that was deductible from the excess-profits tax imposed on business in 1917.
Since then thrift has taken a backseat to American consumerism. Some intellectuals have seen the shift as an encouraging sign: In 1954 David M. Potter argued in "People of Plenty" that the country's economy of abundance had shaped its view of democracy, freedom and equality by encouraging leveling up instead of leveling down.
Today thrift and mass consumption appear incompatible. Big-spending America has long had one of the lowest rates of savings in the industrial world and last year it fell further, to 3.8 percent of average household income from 4.3 percent the year before.
In classical economic theory, low savings leads to less investment and industrial weakness. But now a revisionist school of economists led by Martin Feldstein at Harvard and Paul David at Stanford argue that buying a car or a home is like an investment because it brings long-term benefits over time, just as spending on education should be considered an investment because it increases earning power. If such spending is included, then the country's savings rate has been running at over 25 percent throughout the century, Professor David calculates.
It may be that thrift and consumerism are compatible after all.

HEADLINE: Clinton Meets Delegation From Kosovo Seeking Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
President Clinton met today with ethnic Albanian leaders from the Serbian province of Kosovo who favor a negotiated solution to their conflict with the Serbian Government in Belgrade.
The attention from Mr. Clinton was intended to display American interest and involvement in Kosovo, as well as support for Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, in an attempt to bolster his position both with his people and with Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President. 
 To that end, the Agency for International Development announced an increase in aid to Kosovo of $6 million, nearly doubling the original allocation.
Mr. Rugova said he urged Mr. Clinton to act swiftly to halt the growing violence between Government forces and the ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
"We urged an increased U.S. presence in Kosovo and for more protection on the part of the United States for the people of Kosovo," Mr. Rugova said after the meeting. In particular, he asked Mr. Clinton to increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic to negotiate seriously with the Albanians in Kosovo and to stop the violence against them.
Another member of the delegation, Veton Surroi, a journalist, said Mr. Clinton assured the visitors of American support and told them that "Bosnia should not be repeated and will not be repeated." Mr. Surroi said later that he understood Mr. Clinton to mean that the West would not stand idly by and would act before it was too late.
But Mr. Surroi, in an interview, said that Kosovo was already in the first stage of war, with fighting between Serbian forces and the growing Kosovo Liberation Army, which American officials say is getting aid from Albania.
But American officials also acknowledge that the ethnic Albanian rebel group, in its fight for independence, is undermining the political credibility of Mr. Rugova and his hastily assembled negotiating team. Some members of the team, like Bujar Bukoshi, who holds the title of prime minister of the unofficial Kosovo government, live in exile and are considered close to the rebel group.
Without rapid international pressure on Mr. Milosevic to negotiate, Mr. Bukoshi said, "I'm afraid we will lose very quickly our credibility."
Pressed by the Americans, Mr. Milosevic met Mr. Rugova on May 15 with the United States Ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill. In return for Mr. Milosevic's compliance, Washington pressed the Europeans to suspend the introduction of tough economic sanctions against Mr. Milosevic, including a ban on foreign investment in Serbia.
While that sanction is only suspended, Mr. Surroi says there is not enough pressure on Mr. Milosevic to stop the violence or to turn the negotiations into productive talks.
While Washington is pressing the delegations to continue the talks on Monday, Mr. Surroi said that was unlikely. "It doesn't make sense to have talks while the Serbs are continuing the fighting," Mr. Surroi said.
Washington and its allies also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing that a redrawing of boundaries could restart a wider war in the Balkans. But even Mr. Rugova says that autonomy within Serbia is no longer an option, and that Kosovo must eventually become sovereign.
Today in Luxembourg, foreign ministers of NATO members and partner countries, including Russia, committed themselves to drafting quick contingency plans to deploy troops on Kosovo's borders if the fighting threatens to spill over. But preventive deployments, requiring a large number of troops, would not stop the fighting in Kosovo, and would probably fail to prevent the infiltration of military supplies from Albania, American officials say.
NATO also approved military exercises in Albania, a NATO partner, and other activities intended to "contribute to the stability of the neighbors," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today.

HEADLINE: Risky Business;
A Set Fee for Each Patient Gives Doctors More Control and More of a Financial Stake

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Even as a new Government-financed study raises questions about an increasingly popular way of paying for health services, many doctors and hospitals in New York City and a number of other big cities are embracing it. And while this form of managed care -- known as capitation -- gives health care providers more control, it also carries with it more financial risk.
Some doctors love it, and some hate it. Few patients have heard of it. But after catching on in many parts of California and some other states, capitation is now rapidly rolling into networks of doctors and hospitals not only in New York City and the area around it -- notoriously one of the last places to adopt changes in health care delivery -- but also in places like Philadelphia, Boston and Atlanta. 
 The new Government-financed study, however, raises some questions about the trend. It found that patients served by doctors receiving per capita payments were less satisfied with important aspects of their care than people in the same type of health maintenance organization whose doctors were reimbursed for the specific services they provided.
In the prevailing system of managed care in most of the country, health maintenance organizations typically pay doctors a fee for each medical service, though less than traditional insurers pay. The H.M.O. uses various ways to keep down costs, such as leaning on doctors deemed to be ordering too many tests, referrals to specialists and hospital stays. If at the end of the year money from the premiums paid by employees and their employers is left over, the H.M.O. keeps it; if expenses have exceeded premiums, the H.M.O. is stuck with the loss.
Under capitation, the H.M.O. pays groups of doctors -- both primary care doctors and specialists -- one lump sum per enrollee. The amount reflects an estimated cost of caring for every person who enrolled for care with those doctors and goes beyond earlier experiments in which primary care doctors received much smaller sums for providing basic care to patients. If at the end of the year, money is left, the doctors, not the H.M.O., keep it; if no money is left, the doctors absorb the loss. So, the doctors themselves have a financial stake in holding down costs.
That means the H.M.O. no longer has to play the bad-cop role of denying patients tests and other procedures. Rather, they let the doctors figure out how to rein in costs.
Many doctors and hospitals -- where capitation works in similar ways -- are jumping at the opportunity to reclaim some of the decision-making that insurers have taken from them in recent years. They are betting that they can manage the care of patients better, and at lower cost, than an H.M.O.'s staff. And they hope to keep more of the health care dollar for themselves or to spend on their patients, instead of rewarding an H.M.O.'s executives and shareholders.
"In an ideal world, there will be more white coats and fewer suits making decisions about what patients get," said Dr. Leonard Fromer, a board member of the Prairie Medical Group, a physicians group in Santa Monica, Calif., that is largely paid on a per capita basis.
For one thing, capitation gives doctors a stronger incentive to provide preventive care. "We spend money up front to improve the health care of a given population," said Dr. Ken Brin, medical director of the Summit Medical Group of 85 doctors in Summit, N.J., which gets per capita payments for one patient in five. "A capitation payments program will provide a better type of medical care."
But some doctors are resisting the trend, saying that they do not want to get into the insurance business and risk the losses that a lot of big insurers have suffered from underestimating costs. Other doctors fear they might be tempted to cut corners to maintain their incomes.
Their protests have not stopped the capitation movement, which has been in use by doctors at Kaiser Permanente in California for decades, was later adopted by other health plans in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, and has dominated health maintenance organizations in those cities since the early 1990's. It is also strong in Chicago and Denver, among other cities. Nationally, the number of doctors with at least one capitation contract surged almost 50 percent, to 174,000, between 1994 and 1997, according to the American Medical Association. Just over one-third of the nation's 483,000 doctors now have capitation contracts, although these represent only about one-fourth of their revenues.
Much of the recent growth has been in the East. In New York, a stronghold of traditional medicine, almost all hospitals are either experimenting with capitation or studying how to deal with it, said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. His organization is promoting the concept and "trying to help our hospitals do it," he said.
The doctor-hospital network of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Westchester County provides services under a per-capita system for 60,000 members of nine health plans, including Aetna U.S. Healthcare, NylCare, United Healthcare, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, an Oxford Medicare plan, and Health First, a Medicaid plan, said Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore. The system covers 50,000 more for hospital care only.
In Manhattan, Beth Israel Medical Center and several hundred affiliated doctors provide per capita coverage for 43,000 people under Aetna, Nylcare and Health First plans. Beth Israel and its partner, Roosevelt-St. Luke's, expect to double that roster in the next year. Others have smaller programs.
Oxford Health Plans, a troubled giant among New York insurers, said in March that it was pursuing capitation contracts that would transfer to medical providers "a significant portion of the medical cost risk" for Medicare and Medicaid patients. Empire has a few per capita contracts with physician groups.
In Boston, Partners Health Care System covers 200,000 members with per capita contracts. In Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Health System covers 160,000 that way. In the Penn hospital system, 25 percent of the patients are covered under capitation contracts for both doctors and hospitals, compared with less than 5 percent five years ago, said Dr. Alan Hillman, director of the center for health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
Most patients will not know if their doctor is in a capitation plan or not, said Ruth Levin, a vice president of the Beth Israel-Roosevelt-St. Luke's partnership. Either way, they will pay the same fees and premiums and, if they do not have a referral from their primary doctor, the same added charges for using a specialist.
Advocates of capitation contend that it delivers better care at lower cost, in large part because it shifts decision-making away from bureaucrats to medical professionals.
"Our doctors are not going to call an insurance company's '800' number to get permission to do an M.R.I. scan," said Ellen Zane, president of a physician network in the Partners Healthcare System in Boston. "We're taking the risk; we want control."
Hospitals and doctors groups also have an added inducement to take measures to prevent illnesses. For example, Dr. Brin at Summit Medical said, "We may spend more money up front for a nurse case manager to teach a patient with congestive heart failure how to take his weight every day and check his ankles for swelling." His group uses such strategies "to keep the patients healthy, so they don't end up in the emergency room," he said.
The system is credited with helping rein in costs in the tightfisted Los Angeles health care market. After leaning on H.M.O.'s for several years, employers paid an average of $99 in monthly premiums for each member, sick or well, in 1997. That was well below the $130 national average and two-thirds of premiums in New York and Boston.
Capitation is not without its flaws. Many consumer groups and doctors say that by forcing doctors to fixate on costs, the system threatens to undermine the physician-patient relationship and encourage the denial of necessary care.
"That's where the public has to be careful, why they need to look for quality physicians and a commitment historically to provide the best of care," said Dr. Bruce Spivey, president of Columbia-Cornell Care, a group of 1,700 physicians affiliated with the recently merged New York and Presbyterian Hospital.
He said the vast majority of his doctors had agreed to accept capitation contracts eventually, but a "substantial vocal minority" were holding back and some specialists would always reject the idea.
In the Government-financed study of 2,748 Massachusetts state employees, which has not been published, patients whose primary doctors were paid on a per capita basis rated them lower on their level of concern, familiarity with individual problems and providing answers to all questions, said Dana Gelb Safran, a senior policy analyst with the Health Institute at the New England Medical Center in Boston who led the study.
Out-of-pocket costs were significantly lower for patients in the per capita group, however. Under both payment systems, doctors rated about the same on referrals, thoroughness of exams and counseling on staying well.
The reluctance of some doctors to become involved is understandable. Those in smaller practices often lack the experience and expensive information systems to forecast costs accurately. Accepting a low-ball offer by an aggressive health plan could ruin them.
Joseph Newhouse, a Harvard University economist who advises Congress on Medicare issues, said forcing a solo practitioner to weigh medical costs patient by patient "should be outlawed."
A number of physicians find the whole idea of capitation repugnant. Dr. Richard Daum, a cardiologist and internist in Concord, Mass., said his four-doctor group planned to drop its contract with an H.M.O. that recently announced a switch to per capita payments, even though the doctors might lose 200 patients from their roster of 14,000. "I won't work under capitation," Dr. Daum said. "It's against my religion."
Yet, even where opposition is strong, capitation continues to make inroads. "Most physicians do not want to get into these arrangements," said Dr. Martin Edelstein, a family practice doctor in Great Neck, N.Y., who is president of the North Shore Independent Physicians Association. But his local hospitals, the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, already have per capita contracts for 15,000 people and are preparing for more.
"The insurance companies tell us, 'This is what the future is,' " Dr. Edelstein said. "We figure you've got to prepare for this eventuality."

"The Fees for Service"
Doctor and hospital groups that provide health coverage have to project how many services they will provide and at what cost. Here is an estimate of the average cost of covering 1,000 people each month in New York City. Figures exclude costs of drugs, lab work and X-rays and similar services.

Visits to a primary care physician -- $15.00
Surgical procedures -- 9.50
Other doctor visits -- 21.47

Japan Says Unemployment Has Reached Record High

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 29

 BODY:
Japan's economic distress deepened today as the Government reported the highest unemployment rate on record, bond yields tumbled to new lows and the yen hit a seven-year low, partly on fears that regional instability could send the world's second-largest economy into a tailspin.
The combination of rising joblessness and a falling currency intensified worries that Japan is not only stuck in a recession, but is also verging on a deflationary spiral. The fear is of a vicious cycle of declining prices, weakening profits, unemployment and falling demand that could ripple through other troubled economies of Asia and the United States economy. 
 "I think we are in the early stage of a deflationary spiral," said Haruo Shimada, an economics professor at Keio University. "It may very well come this year."
The yen's slide reflected selling by traders who turned to the dollar for safety after Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests Thursday, raising fears of a new arms race with India and worsening instability in Asia.
The Japanese currency slipped further after the Government said today that unemployment had hit a record 4.1 percent in April, up from 3.9 percent in March. The yen hit 139.20 in the morning here and ended trading in New York today at 138.90 yen to the dollar. The yen has fallen more than 16 percent compared with its level a year earlier.
American officials have been deeply worried about the economic problems in Japan. Concern is also growing that Japanese Government officials have few tools left to revive the economy. The Bank of Japan, the central bank, has been pursuing an easy monetary policy for years and its benchmark lending rate to banks is at half a percent, so there is little room for the bank to drop rates further to help fuel the economy.
"It's quite scary," said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan Ltd. Referring to the Bank of Japan, he said, "Japan's economy is sliding into recession without the B.O.J. able to cushion the blow."
Parliament finally passed long-awaited legislation today that will relax the fiscal austerity law and allow the Government to spend more on the economy and cut taxes to aid growth, part of a $120 billion invigoration package that will start trickling into the economy this summer. But there are already murmurings about the need for more stimulants.
Koji Omi, chief of the Economic Planning Agency, acknowledged today that the economic troubles are becoming increasingly severe, particularly in employment and production. The April unemployment data showed that the jobless rate for males was 4.2 percent and that only 55 jobs exist for every 100 applicants, the worst readings in two decades.
Those statistics make Japan's unemployment rate nearly the same as that in the United States, where joblessness historically has been far higher. But anyone in Japan who has worked for even one hour in the final week of the month is considered fully employed. Some economists say unemployment could double if calculated by American methods.
After the unemployment report was released, yields on the benchmark 10-year bond, a barometer of economic weakness, fell to an all-time low of 1.19 percent. By contrast, 10-year Treasury bonds in the United States yield about 5.55 percent.
The Economic Planning Agency also may finally acknowledge, possibly next month, that the economy is in a "downward phase," said a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading national Japanese daily. Economists have been saying for months that the economy is in a recession, but until now the Government has been describing the economy as simply "sluggish" with the "severity getting worse." Officials at the Economic Planning Agency refused to comment on the report.
Some economists are particularly worried about further weakness in the yen beyond the level of 139 to the dollar because that would escalate the risk of currency devaluations by other Asian nations trying to help keep their exports competitively priced.
"It certainly could get to 150," said Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. "The fundamentals don't look close to a reversal."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
LEADERS IN INDIA AND IN PAKISTAN TONE DOWN CRISIS

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 29

 BODY:
A day after Pakistan matched India by setting off its own underground nuclear tests, both nations began talking of new arrangements that would stabilize their rivalry and minimize the risk of war.
But neither seems ready to consider an agreement not to deploy nuclear weapons, especially missiles. And it is too soon to say whether the day's tone was merely a respite after turbulent events of this month. 
 In Washington, officials expressed skepticism that a calmer reality had set in. American intelligence reported that Pakistan may be preparing new tests, and the State Department called the situation grave. Page A5.
Even as officials in India and Pakistan were speaking as though they wanted to step back from the brink of military confrontation, there were many signs that the situation remains volatile. Among these was a statement by the scientist overseeing Pakistan's test, who described the devices as warheads that were being prepared for mounting on a medium-range missile that Pakistan tested last month.
In the Indian Parliament, several prominent opposition leaders, including I. K. Gujral, a former Prime Minister, appealed to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee not to transfer India's nuclear weapons to the armed forces immediately, a step that Defense Minister George Fernandes has said was already approved.
"If that has been done, God help us," Mr. Gujral said.
Mr. Vajpayee tried to soothe opposition leaders and offered to reopen broad-based diplomatic negotiations with Pakistan to discuss a nonaggression pact. Such talks were proposed on Thursday by Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, after he announced that Pakistan had set off five nuclear tests at a remote site in the southwestern desert.
"I welcome the statement of Pakistan's Prime Minister that Islamabad is prepared for negotiations," Mr. Vajpayee said in Parliament. "It is very good and we should have dialogue."
As for the suggestion of a nonaggression pact, a longstanding Pakistani proposal that has always bogged down in the bitter differences over the divided territory of Kashmir, Mr. Vajpayee added, "If a new offer is made, we are prepared to probe it."
In Islamabad, Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan suggested that both nations sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1994.
But the proposal is fraught with difficulty because India has said it will consider accepting "some provisions" of the treaty only if the global pact is revised to include India as an established nuclear power, along with the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, and only if the other powers pledge the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons, something they all have refused to do.
Mr. Vajpayee also repeated an offer made before Pakistan's tests, for India to promise not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. But India is certain to demand a similar pledge from Pakistan, and Pakistan has shown a reluctance to make such a promise, fearing that in case of attack by India's far more powerful conventional forces, it would need nuclear arms to defend itself.
Mr. Sharif spent the day in discussions with his Cabinet that focused on using the emergency powers that he declared during the night to shore up Pakistan's battered economy, an economy that is sure to be weakened by the sanctions imposed by the United States, Japan and others in retaliation for the nuclear tests.
On Friday the emergency powers were extended to include severe restrictions on access to the courts in civil cases, a step intended to prevent legal challenges to a harsh crackdown on tax evaders, smugglers and profiteers that Mr. Sharif has promised.
On the military side, Mr. Ayub Khan said Pakistan felt it had established an equilibrium that would discourage war. Since Pakistan and India were carved out of the British-ruled subcontinent in 1947, they have fought three wars; Kashmir was a factor in each one. Since India detonated its nuclear devices on May 11 and 13, at a site near the Pakistan border, there have been widespread fears of war in both countries.
"We have restored the military and strategic balance," Mr. Ayub Khan said in an interview with the BBC. A former army officer and son of Pakistan's first military dictator, the Foreign Minister said Pakistan had been increasingly vulnerable to conventional military attack since 1990, when the United States, saying Pakistan was secretly developing nuclear weapons, cut off military sales. American materiel had sustained Pakistan's armed forces since the 1950's.
"Since then, Pakistan has been at a tremendous conventional military disadvantage," Mr. Ayub Khan said.
While many opposition and military analysts in India and Pakistan have been shocked by the nuclear tests and the ensuing polemics, fearing they would trigger a war that might involve nuclear weapons, the view that open possession of nuclear weapons could eventually be a stabilizing factor has been gaining ground.
One who appears to share the Pakistan Foreign Minister's view is India's army chief, Gen. V. P. Malik, who told reporters after Pakistan's tests, "It is better this way."
"If there was any ambiguity earlier about Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, it no longer exists," General Malik said.
While cautioning that Indian generals have never sought to make Government policy, General Malik said India had no plans to attack Pakistan, and had not mobilized any troops except those confronting Pakistani forces across the cease-fire line in Kashmir.
"I don't see a war scenario on either side," he said. "I don't see a warlike situation."
Another sign that tension is diminishing came from India's Interior Minister, Lal Krishna Advani, who was accused of warmongering after warning Pakistan last week that India's tests had shifted the balance of power in India's favor.
Mr. Advani, one of the most hawkish of the Hindu nationalists who control the Government, also said India intended to adopt a "pro-active" military policy in Kashmir, including "hot pursuit" of Pakistan-backed insurgents operating across the cease-fire line.
But in a speech in Parliament on Thursday, at about the time Pakistan was detonating its tests, Mr. Advani said his reference to "hot pursuit" had not been intended as a threat to send troops into Pakistani-ruled areas in Kashmir. He also pulled back from his assertions about India's enhanced military power, saying India viewed nuclear weapons solely as a "deterrent" and had tested them only to match Pakistan's nuclear program.
"We do not want to be subjected to diplomatic coercion," he said.
The scientist who oversaw Pakistan's tests, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, described the devices tested as "ready-to-fire warheads" that had been miniaturized so they could fit onto Ghauri missiles, which Pakistan tested in early April at a range it put at about 900 miles.
In a telephone interview today with the Voice of Germany radio network, Dr. Qadeer Khan also said Pakistan was "ready to cap" Ghauri missiles with the warheads.
Mr. Ayub Khan made a similar claim in the BBC interview, saying Pakistan would "naturally be serially producing nuclear warheads and missiles."
But a later BBC report quoted other officials in Islamabad as saying there had been no decision to arm and deploy the Ghauri, a missile built with technology that Pakistan got from China and North Korea.
Western arms experts have questioned whether either India or Pakistan could move quickly toward deployment. Pakistan has test-fired the Ghauri only once and India's counterpart, the Agni, has been test-fired only three times, twice unsuccessfully, and not since 1994.
Jack Mendelsohn, an analyst with the Arms Control Association in Washington, told the BBC on Thursday that the lack of missile testing and a shortage of fuel for nuclear weapons would cause lengthy delays. In the meantime, he said, "hopefully we can walk them back" from deployment.
Similar hopes were expressed by several prominent Indian parliamentarians during a debate today. Mr. Gujral, who stepped down as Prime Minister after a defeat in the general election in March, said he learned during his 11 months in office that even then India had a reliable "nuclear deterrent," even though nuclear arms were not deployed.
For years Western intelligence reports have said India had a small stockpile of nuclear weapons, stored away from front-line forces and probably in disassembled form.
Mr. Gujral urged Prime Minister Vajpayee to open negotiations with China, Pakistan and the Western powers to draw up security arrangements that would make deployment unnecessary, and to think carefully about matters that he said Mr. Vajpayee and his ministers had ignored.
He said these included issues that the United States and the Soviet Union had tussled with for decades during the cold war -- the costs of building and maintaining a large nuclear arsenal, command and control systems to make the arms safe and an appropriate political and military strategy for their use.
"Jingoism and warmongering by a nation of India's size is an extremely dangerous thing," he said. "You can create an atmosphere of war without intending to, so for God's sake, be careful."

HEADLINE: Ending an Era, ABC News Chief Relinquishes Control

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
An era ended yesterday, when Roone Arledge, who has reigned over ABC News for 21 years -- longer than any other news executive in television history -- announced he would turn over leadership to the division's president, David Westin, starting on Monday.
Mr. Arledge, who will be 67 next month, will remain chairman of ABC News and will be a consultant to Mr. Westin. Mr. Westin, 45, will remain president. 
 In March 1997, Mr. Arledge named Mr. Westin to succeed him, without saying when. Now Mr. Westin will wield the decision-making power alone, concluding 15 months of power sharing with Mr. Arledge that left clouds of uncertainty over some ABC News ventures.
Although Mr. Westin, a lawyer and former president of the ABC Television Network, has had limited experience in journalism, Mr. Arledge praised him for having "integrity and a strong vision for ABC News," and said he was confident Mr. Westin would "do a terrific job."
Mr. Westin, who has worked for ABC seven years, is taking over when ABC News faces several major concerns. The Walt Disney Company, its parent, has demanded trimmer budgets; the ABC network has been in a slump, often delivering smaller audiences to the news division's programs, and "World News Tonight," the evening news program with Peter Jennings as anchor, has slipped to second place in the Nielsen ratings behind the "NBC Nightly News." The biggest problem is "Good Morning America," which has seen viewers leave in droves, and now ranks far behind the top-ranked morning show, NBC's "Today."
"Following a legend is always a challenge," Mr. Westin said of Mr. Arledge, adding that a greater challenge will be determining the role of television news in the future. "In a new world where there is almost unlimited access to information, what is our role? How do we make sure we have a special place with our viewers?"
In 1977, when Mr. Arledge, then president of ABC Sports, became president of ABC News, he, too, was criticized for not having sufficient news experience. Yet he had revolutionized sports television, and not just in production techniques. He was the first to refuse to allow event sponsors or league presidents to dictate which announcers would cover an event. He pushed ABC Sports to cover social and economic issues in sports, and gave free rein to the opinionated commentator Howard Cosell.
"Roone will go down in history as one of the true visionaries of our business," the president of ABC Inc., Robert A. Iger, said in a statement.
Starting in a production truck at an Alabama-Georgia college football game in 1960, Mr. Arledge became the most innovative producer in sports history. He created "up close and personal" coverage of the Olympic Games, and invented "Wide World of Sports" and "Monday Night Football," as well as most of the now-commonplace enhancements like instant replays, slow-motion replays, underwater cameras and on-screen graphics.
He translated some of those techniques to news. When he took over, ABC News was the least well-regarded network news division, and the lowest-rated. He raided other networks for young, talented producers and collected as many high-profile on-camera journalists as he could. He started the news magazine programs "20/20" and "Prime Time Live," expanded the Sunday morning program "This Week" and invented the late-night program "Nightline."
Sometimes criticized for creating a star system, Mr. Arledge believed that such stars as Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Peter Jennings, Hugh Downs, Sam Donaldson and Ted Koppel gave ABC News a distinct identity.
Within a decade, ABC's news programs had the best ratings and were widely considered to be of the best quality. In 1995, ABC News was the first network news division to be given a Gold Baton for overall excellence from the Alfred I. Dupont-Columbia University Awards.
Mr. Arledge has also been criticized for being disdainful of administrative duties, yet slow to delegate authority or to make decisions. Some journalists complained that he was remote, and seemed most interested in talking to the highly paid star journalists.
Asked about his legacy, Mr. Arledge said yesterday: "ABC Sports hardly existed when I first started, and I built it into the greatest sports television organization there has ever been, at its peak. ABC News had very little respect or sense of importance, and one reason I took that job when I could have taken other jobs was I felt it was a resource this country needed, and I built that into the No. 1 news division in television."
But Mr. Arledge has also presided during the recent ratings decline of "World News Tonight," and some say he paid too little attention to "Good Morning America" when, already in trouble, it was shifted from the entertainment division to the news division two years ago.
Still, he insisted that ABC News remained the strongest of the three network news divisions.
"NBC has some ratings," he said. "But if you look at its staff of people and correspondents, I'd love to match them up one-on-one and see who's the better.
"We're a little like today's Yankees -- star after star after star."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Wake-Up Call: Truisms Of U.S. Policy Totter

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Several of the hopes and assumptions of the post-cold-war era have been shaken by this month's momentous events in Asia. The collapse of President Suharto's rule in Indonesia and the detonation of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan has forced the rethinking in Washington and other Western capitals of ideas that had come to be policy truisms.
As a member of President Clinton's Cabinet said today, "the motto for this month in this town has turned out to be, 'Back to the drawing board.' " 
 For one thing, the widely acknowledged ascendancy of United States commercial and economic interests over strategic and other goals, which led to the subordination of human-rights considerations in the region, for instance, is likely to be questioned much more sharply than previously.
Even before Indonesia was gripped by turmoil, it was evident that United States policy there, based on trade and tacit backing for Mr. Suharto, had reached a dead end. And even before the nuclear tests, Congress had acted to ban satellite exports to China, in part because of fears that Chinese missile expertise may have already made its way to Pakistan.
The prospect of nuclear war is once again real, and that is likely to shake official Washington and at least part of the American public out of the easy assumption that foreign policy does not matter much any more. Sketchy foreign-policy reports on the network television newscasts are suddenly longer and far more substantive.
Mr. Clinton's visit to China next month was to have promoted trade between the two countries, as part of the Administration's efforts to help American companies expand their overseas markets; the subtext of that strategy has been the conviction that trade helps sell democratic ideas.
At least for the moment, wider trade with China seems dubious. Social conservatives and political liberals will find more of an audience for their moral agendas in the months to come, and dollar diplomacy will suffer.
Mr. Clinton had planned a trip later in the year to India and Pakistan, also with trade promotion as a major component. Having imposed sanctions against both countries, the President is rethinking the whole trip.
The month's events have also reinforced the impression that religious fundamentalism and religion-based nationalism are the most disruptive forces facing Western policy makers. The exchange of nuclear demonstrations was set off by a minority Indian Government dominated by a hard-line Hindu nationalist movement. Islamic fundamentalism is a political threat or a governmental reality in much of the Middle East, and the situation in Israel is complicated by the influence of a rigorously Orthodox Jewish minority upon the Government.
For the Hindus who danced in the streets of New Delhi, for the Pakistani leaders who boasted of becoming the first Islamic nuclear power and for Iraq and Libya, both of which have worked on nuclear bombs, the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction is not only a means of achieving policy goals but also an act of defiance of the rest of the world -- especially the nuclear powers. India has long been a nuclear power, and has been known as such by everyone. But it has never been an officially declared nuclear power.
It has long been deeply unhappy at its exclusion from the nuclear "club," as defined by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, which divides the world into haves -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and have-nots. India is permanently excluded under the terms of the treaty because it exploded its first nuclear device after the treaty was signed.
"They want status, and they want it desperately," said Michael Krepon of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, who is an authority on military and nuclear affairs in the region. "They want those at the high table to acknowledge them as an equal. But that would require the amendment of the treaty, which involves 180 countries or so, and it isn't going to happen."
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee all but said as much on Wednesday, telling the Indian Parliament that the bomb was "India's due, the right of one-sixth of mankind."
While the United States and the Soviet Union managed to survive for almost half a century as mutually antagonistic nuclear powers, with each deterring the other from making use of its nuclear arsenal, the prospects of India and Pakistan's doing likewise are not encouraging, for a number of reasons.
Moscow and Washington had decades to feel each other out, and at the beginning of that period each had only a few bombs and no missiles. When the missiles came along, the two countries narrowly averted a war in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Pakistan and India will have the benefit of no such grace period now that both have bombs and the means to deliver them.
Although the point is open to debate, the religious animosity between India and Pakistan seems even more intense than the ideological rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. At any rate, the United States and the Soviet Union had never fought against each other; India and Pakistan have already fought three wars.
Finally, there is the matter of geography. The main population centers of the United States and the Soviet Union are separated by thousands of miles of land and sea, while India and Pakistan are contiguous, their troops face each other in Kashmir, and New Delhi is a mere 250 miles from Lahore, Pakistan.
Even if India and Pakistan had sophisticated early-warning systems, which they do not, there would be virtually no margin for error.
The experts are deeply pessimistic. Thomas Graham Jr., a retired arms negotiator who now heads the Lawyers' Alliance for World Security, said it was fanciful to think that India and Pakistan would restrain themselves, and he also suggested that other countries would now be emboldened to push ahead with nuclear weapons development.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Sending Russia $670 Million to Help Stabilize Ruble

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 29

 BODY:
Russia received a boost today when the International Monetary Fund said it would disburse $670 million by the end of June. That, along with conditions the I.M.F. placed on the Government, should be enough to stabilize the Russian financial markets, fund officials said.
"The Government's economic policies are wholly coherent, and there is no reason for devaluation," said John Odling-Smee, the I.M.F.'s chief expert on Russia. 
 But Russian Government officials and investment bankers remain worried that the assistance may be a case of too little, too late. And Russian officials have begun to explore the establishment of a multi-billion-dollar fund to help stabilize the ruble.
Such a fund could be organized by the I.M.F. or by the seven leading industrialized nations. The idea would be to create a line of credit that the Central Bank could draw on if its reserves were depleted.
Russian officials stress that the money in the proposed fund, which they project should amount to about $10 billion, would not necessarily be used, but that foreign investors would find it comforting to know that it was available.
Mr. Odling-Smee acknowledged today that the Russians had been inquiring about the possibility of additional financing. Both the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration, however, said the Kremlin had not formally asked for more money.
So far, Russia's financial markets remained under siege. Stocks fell today after the Moody's investment service downgraded its ratings for Russian bonds.
Reflecting continued anxiety over the stability of the ruble, the Kremlin has sent a high-level delegation to Washington. Anatoly B. Chubais, the pro-reform former Kremlin aide, and Sergei Vasilyev, a senior Kremlin aide, met today with Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
The mission was authorized by President Boris N. Yeltsin, who has appealed to Western leaders for "moral support." One aim was to persuade Washington to support Mr. Yeltsin's program to cope with the financial crisis in the hope that this would help calm jittery investors.
Today, President Clinton praised Mr. Yeltsin's efforts. But he did not say whether the United States would be willing to help organize a currency stabilization fund or offer other assistance if it was needed.
"Russia's new economic plan puts in place a solid strategy for fiscal reform," Mr. Clinton said in a statement.
Much of the Yeltsin Government's plan was required by the I.M.F. as a condition for receiving the latest loan disbursement. The broad aim of many of the measures is to reduce Russia's budget deficit to 5 percent of its gross domestic product.
Its large budget deficit has made Russia particularly vulnerable to the effects of global economic turmoil. Moscow finances much of its deficit by selling treasury bills to foreign investors. As concerns over emerging markets has spread, many investors have been dumping the treasury bills and converting the proceeds to dollars, putting enormous pressure on the ruble.
Announcing its deficit-reduction program, the Yeltsin Government today named a tough-minded former Finance Minister to head the State Tax Service. The new minister, Boris Fyodorov, 40, will replace Aleksandr Pochinok as Russia's top tax collector. Russia's episodic efforts to crack down on tax cheats have been generally ineffective, and Mr. Fyodorov has long argued for stronger action.
The Kremlin has also promised to take swift action to collect back taxes. At least 5 billion rubles -- about $830 million -- in tax arrears is to be collected in June.
At least 20 major companies that owe taxes will be targeted. The Government has promised to declare companies bankrupt if they refuse or cannot pay.
To expedite the collection of tax arrears from Russia's oil companies, tax payments will be taken from their export earnings. By July, the payment of taxes will be required if an oil company wants to ship its crude on export pipelines.
The Government is also reversing its earlier decision to help Russia's oil companies deal with the downturn in world oil prices by reducing excise taxes.
The Kremlin has also promised to raise $2.5 billion by speeding up the auctions of state property after the financial situation stabilizes.
Still, Moscow has pledged to take action against tax delinquents before, only to retreat in the face of political pressure.
And even if the Russians begin to carry out their plan, it may not be enough to reassure nervous investors who believe Russia's Central Bank simply does not have enough funds to defend the ruble.
The Central Bank's reserves for stabilizing the ruble have dropped to $14.5 billion from $23 billion in October.
If the I.M.F. or the Group of Seven nations will not provide funds for a currency stabilization fund, the Russians have another option. They could take loans from private banks and use the money to restructure their short-term debt.
Russian Finance Ministry officials say they have already received proposals for loans from several major banks. But the I.M.F. has cautioned against this approach, saying the interest rates would be far too high during the current financial crisis.
"I would not advise the Russian Government to do it until it is clear that it really does have control over the fiscal situation and until stability has returned to the financial markets," Mr. Odling-Smee said.
In general, the I.M.F. predicts that investors will be heartened by the Russian program and that further financing will not be needed.
"I would expect stability in the financial markets to be established fairly soon," Mr. Odling-Smee said.
One leading investment banker, however, disagreed.
"The markets want to see more money," he said. "They want to know that the Central Bank would be able to tap additional funds if its reserves ran low."

Stocks Slump, Ending Worst Month Since October
Stocks retreated from early gains to end lower, hurt by weakness in computing issues and growing concern that political and economic turmoil in Asia could damage United States corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell for a fifth time in six sessions, losing 70.25 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,899.95, its first close below 8,900 since April 28. Broader gauges also fell. 
 The declines made May the worst month for the market since October, when Asia's troubles first damaged stock prices. For the month, the Dow lost 1.8 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 lost 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite index lost 4.8 percent. Page D3.
 
Bond prices strengthened. The 30-year Treasury yield fell to 5.80 percent from 5.82, extending a trend that has pushed yields to the lowest levels in nearly two months. D3.
 
Russia Getting I.M.F. Money Soon
The International Monetary Fund said it would disburse $670 million to Russia by the end of June. The I.M.F. said the disbursement should help stabilize Russian financial markets. But Russian Government officials and investment bankers remain worried that the assistance may be too little, too late. A3.
 
April Incomes and Spending Rose
The Government said personal income growth accelerated in April and consumer spending increased, signs that domestic demand was helping to offset the effect of the Asian crisis on the United States economy. D2.
 
Japan's Malaise Worsens
Japanese economic distress deepened as the Government reported the highest unemployment rate on record and the yen weakened to another seven-year low against the dollar. Fears intensified that the world's second-largest economy is not only mired in a recession but may be verging on a deflationary spiral that could hurt other countries. D2.
 
CBS Wins Help From Stations
CBS announced an agreement with affiliated stations to share in the cost of rights to National Football League games this fall. The agreement represents the first instance of a network's receiving direct financial help from affiliates to pay for programming. A1.
 
End of an Era at ABC News
Roone Arledge will surrender leadership of ABC News on Monday, ending a 21-year reign that made him the longest-running news executive in television history. Although Mr. Arledge, 67, left, will keep the title of chairman, the decision-making power will rest with the president, David Westin, 45. The transfer comes at a time when the parent company, Disney, is demanding smaller news budgets and ABC's evening news show has yielded the No. 1 rating to NBC News. A6.
 
Robertson Stephens Is Sold
BankBoston, as expected, announced that it would acquire BankAmerica Corporation's securities unit, Robertson Stephens. BankBoston, the second-largest bank in New England, will pay $400 million in cash to BankAmerica and put $400 million in a pool to persuade the firm's partners and key employees to remain after the sale. D3.
 
Suharto Pressed to Return Riches
Indonesia's new Government annnounced several measures aimed at curbing the economic favoritism that had permitted the Suharto family's fortunes to flourish. The measures came as popular support intensified for a return of an estimated $40 billion that the former leader and his relatives amassed during his four decades in power. A1.
 
Clinical Trials of Drugs Criticized
Federal investigators said patients who participated in clinical trials of new drugs were often exposed to unsafe and unethical practices because no one policed the research to protect their interests. A8.

HEADLINE: Fed's No. 2 Chosen to Lead District of Columbia's Financial Board

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
More than seven years after she headed a panel that warned of a looming fiscal crisis in the District of Columbia, Alice M. Rivlin was selected by President Clinton today as the chairwoman of the District's financial control board.
Ms. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board, will replace Andrew F. Brimmer. 
 Mr. Brimmer, an economist, was appointed the control board's first chairman in 1995, when Washington was already suffering from the troubles Ms. Rivlin's panel had predicted. He announced in March that he did not intend to serve another term.
The White House said in a statement that Ms. Rivlin would retain her position with the Federal Reserve and would assume her new duties after a 90-day transition during which Mr. Brimmer and two of his colleagues, Stephen D. Harlan and Constance B. Newman, will remain beyond the expiration next week of their three-year terms.
The two other members of the control board, Edward Singletary and Joyce Ladner, are stepping down next week.
The appointment of Ms. Rivlin comes at a time of major change in the capital's political landscape. Last week, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., a vocal critic of the control board and of Mr. Brimmer in particular, announced that he would not seek a fifth four-year term.
Mr. Barry's decision was hailed by Republican lawmakers. The control board has been praised by Republicans for turning Washington's fortunes around despite its sometimes cantankerous relationship with the mayor.
Hostility grew as the control board steadily shifted power from Mr. Barry to itself and its surrogates, leaving the mayor to supervise only a few marginal agencies.
District officials are now projecting budget surpluses for the 1998 and 1999 fiscal years. By law, the control board will be shut down after four consecutive balanced budgets.
An Administration official said that the White House did not anticipate any problems with Ms. Rivlin's serving dual roles, but added that the Administration might propose legislation that would remove any potential obstacle.
In a statement, Ms. Rivlin, 67, said, "I am delighted with the chance to serve the city as we build the foundation to return decision-making powers to the elected officials of the District."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Market Falls Again, Ending Worst Month Since October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated from early gains and ended lower yesterday, dragged down by weakness in technology issues. The selloff came as concern grew that continued turmoil in Asia could damage corporate profits in the United States.
"Things have to calm down in Asia before investors become more aggressive," said Joseph E. Stocke, a money manager at the Meridian Investment Company. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the fifth time in six sessions. It dropped 70.25 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,899.95. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.78 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,090.82. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.75 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,778.87.
For all of May, the Dow lost 1.8 percent, the S.& P. 500 fell 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq lost 4.8 percent. It was the worst month for the market since October, when Asia's financial troubles first rattled the United States stock market. In October, the Dow tumbled 6.3 percent, the S.& P. fell 3.4 percent and the Nasdaq slumped 5.5 percent.
Computer companies led the decline yesterday. I.B.M. fell 2 9/16 , to 117 1/2; Dell Computer dropped 2 7/32 , to 82 13/32 , and Hewlett-Packard declined 1 9/16 , to 62 5/16 .
Semiconductor companies were also lower. Intel was down 2 1/16 , to 71 7/16 ; Applied Materials fell 1 3/4, to 32; Linear Technology was off 1 1/2, to 69 15/16 , and Advanced Micro Devices dropped 9/16 , to 19 9/16 .
Analysts said concern was mounting over the earnings of technology companies.
"Technology has driven the market for the past seven years, and my sense is it won't lead this year," said John Rutledge, an analyst with the Keystone Investment Management Company. "Clearly the economic problems in Asia aren't over yet, and all of Asia accounts for about 25 percent of end-demand for technology products."
In other sectors, financial stocks rose as bond yields fell. Declining bond yields prompt more households to buy homes and take out mortgages. Fannie Mae, the world's largest buyer of single-family mortgages, rose 15/16 , to 59 13/16 .
Electric power companies like the Southern Company also gained. Those stocks tend to rise with bond prices because the value of their dividends increases as yields fall. Southern rose 7/8, to 26 9/16 .
Union Pacific declined 1 1/4, to 48 3/8, after the company, the nation's largest railroad surprised analysts yesterday by saying that it would report a second-quarter loss as congestion on its tracks persists. The company did not say how big the loss from continuing operations would be.
Shares of Centocor, which rallied on Thursday, fell 2 3/8, to 39, after the Food and Drug Administration recommended approving the company's Avakine drug to treat Crohn's disease but investors reacted to conflicting reports about the company's prospects, including concerns about competition for its heart drug, Reopro, and future earnings.
Treasury Prices Increase
By Bridge News
Treasury prices rose yesterday as investors bought to adjust their portfolios at the end of the month.
A weaker-than-expected manufacturing survey also bolstered prices. And financial and political uncertainty in Asia continued to drive buyers into the relative safety of the Treasury market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury edged up 10/32 , to 104 19/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.80 percent, from 5.82 percent.
Prices were helped after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity in the Chicago region, seen as a bellwether for the economy, fell to 56.3 in May, from 58.6 in April, a steeper decline than expected.
And while some investors took profits in the afternoon, the report and the effect of end-of-the-month positioning supported prices. Typically, portfolio managers who try to keep the duration of their holdings in line with bond indexes buy securities on the last day of the month.

HEADLINE: Race Track a Victim of Competition From Casinos

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: MAYS LANDING, N.J., May 27

 BODY:
After the second race today at the Atlantic City Race Course, the noisiest creatures in the grandstand were some sparrows chirping in the rafters. Jack Klein, a 71-year-old carpenter and loyal track patron for a half century, sat alone in the mezzanine, a solitary figure in a sea of orange and yellow seats.
"It's depressing to come out here now," Mr. Klein said. "It's too quiet." 
 And so went the final days of thoroughbred racing at the track, which is closing Saturday after 53 years. Long known in racing circles for its handsome one-mile turf course, some fabled races and, years ago, faithful crowds of 20,000 and 25,000, the track has finally succumbed after a 20-year struggle with the slot machines, blackjack tables and off-track betting parlors in the casinos just 10 miles down the road.
It probably should come as no surprise that a race track virtually in the shadows of Atlantic City would fail. For years, tracks across the country have been steadily losing fans. Industry officials say that from 1985 to 1995, attendance at all thoroughbred tracks in the country declined to 34.4 million from 51.1 million. Other tracks have fallen victim, too. Outside Chicago, Arlington Park, once a top-flight track, no longer offers racing. A track in Omaha, Ak-Sar-Ben, closed two years ago, and the Detroit Race Course plans to close later this year.
In New Jersey, competition for the gambling dollar has been particularly acute. Attendance at the tracks fell to 2.9 million last year from 6.1 million in 1988, and betting fell with it. The losses at Atlantic City Race Course have been greater than at the three other New Jersey tracks offering thoroughbred racing, the Meadowlands, Monmouth Park in Oceanport and Garden State Park in Cherry Hill.
Yet even as race tracks in the state stumbled, gamblers were pumping more and more into slot machines -- $32.45 billion in 1997, roughly double the amount bet in 1988 in constant dollars. In same period, lottery sales, also adjusted for inflation, held steady at more than $1.5 billion.
Richard Thalheimer, a professor at the University of Louisville, said his studies of New Jersey's tracks in the late 1980's and early 1990's found that if the casinos and lottery did not exist, total betting at the tracks would be 52 percent greater than it is today.
Horse players, Dr. Thalheimer said, become heavy players at the casinos. He said the action at casinos, particularly at slot machines, is fast. "They're not a game of skill," he said of the slots. "And they give a much higher rate of return for each dollar put in than for each dollar bet at the tracks." Casinos also entice players with free drinks, free parking and admission, and reasonably priced food in pleasant restaurants.
"Without getting some kind of gaming at the tracks, it's going to be a very tough road for the future," he said.
Indeed, slot machines at Delaware Park in Stanton, Del., once a lowly competitor of the Atlantic City track, produced a $90 million bonanza last year for its operations and purses, and helped the course lure better horses, trainers and jockeys. The administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has shown little interest in counterattacking by allowing the state's tracks to install slots. A few months ago, a slot-machine proposal was killed by coalition of Whitman cabinet officials and casino representatives serving on a commission that the Governor created to study the future of the state's tracks.
Philadelphia Park, another competitor, provides its fans with upscale off-track betting parlors, as well as the convenience of telephone betting. New Jersey officials are thinking about such amenities for the state's horse players. But first, state voters would need to agree in a special referendum to give the Legislature the green light to permit them.
"We just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," said James J. Murphy, the president of the Atlantic City Race Course. "There's just no magic trick we can come up with now."
So, even though the track calls its closing meet Five Days of Fury, its mood is one of melancholy and reminiscence.
Katie Seifried, the switchboard operator for 30 years, will be the last of her family to work at the track. The track was founded after World War II by John B. Kelly -- a prominent Philadelphia contractor and Olympic gold medalist, and the father of Grace Kelly -- working with his friends in show business, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Harry James and Sammy Kaye. Ms. Seifried's father, Thomas McGrath, was the track's first superintendent. Her husband, George, and brothers, Bob and Tom Jr., worked as carpenters.
"All we knew in the family was the race track," she said. "When I get into my car, it just comes automatically to the track. It's going to be very sad to leave."
Down by the finish line, Walter Sibson, 85, was sitting alone, like Mr. Klein up in the mezzanine. Earlier this spring, he said, he visited Churchill Downs and some horse farms in Kentucky. "I don't think Churchill Downs is as nice as this," he said. "Horses get in the back stretch there and you can't see them. I'm just watching one race today and leaving. I just wanted to roam around the place for a last time."
Loretta and John Dreyer, summer regulars for 25 years, were in the clubhouse dining room, with its tables draped in white linens, its pink napkins and a $9.95 buffet of pasta salads and sliced beef, turkey and salmon. Mrs. Dreyer said she would take one image away from her years at the track; of Grace Kelly, in a blue and white pinstripe suit on a Saturday night long ago.
The Dreyers, unlike many horse players, dislike simulcasting betting parlors. Watching live racing in the future, they said, will mean drives to Pennsylvania or Delaware.
"You know, people say casinos killed this track," Mr. Dreyer said. "But if people really liked live horse racing, they'd come to the track."
That sentiment has bedeviled the racing industry for years: how to win back horse players who have taken their gambling dollars to casinos or elsewhere, and how to attract a younger generation of fans.
Industry officials outside New Jersey say the best way to revive interest in racing nationally is improved marketing and fresh appeals to young families. Recently, the industry started a $20 million advertising campaign to capture new fans and lure back old ones.
Thomas Merritt, executive director of Thoroughbred Racing Communications, a Manhattan-based media-relations company for the industry, said New Jersey's Monmouth Park offers several attractions to entice families, including pony rides, playgrounds, face painting, a petting zoo and a jazz combo.
"All this introduces the track as a pleasant place to go," Mr. Merritt said. "Kids will think positively about that."
Mr. Murphy, the Atlantic City track president, said the Whitman commission's rejection of the slots was what persuaded track stockholders to close the track. During the racecourse's long struggle, it sold about 80 percent of its land for a mall and two big housing developments, and plowed the $12 million in proceeds back into operations and purses, Mr. Murphy said. Earlier this decade, it hoped to stay alive by having a developer build a 105,000-seat stock-car racing stadium around the track. But that idea foundered.
Two weeks ago, officials announced the sale of the track and its remaining 280 acres to a Michigan builder, Samuel Sobel. The land is zoned for commercial and recreational development, but plans for the site have not been drafted, Mr. Murphy said.
The sales contract sets aside a four-acre parcel for the track company to build an upscale simulcasting parlor that will offer wagering on races beamed in from the other tracks throughout North America. New Jersey law now permits such parlors only at tracks offering live racing and at the casinos. Exceptions to this law would have to be approved by the Legislature and by the voters in a special referendum.
In 1983, the Atlantic City Race Course became the first track in North America to provide simulcast races, Mr. Murphy said.
"That's our only bet left," he said of the proposed simulcast parlor. "If anybody has fought the good fight against the longest odds possible, it has been the principals of the Atlantic City Race Course."

HEADLINE: Taxi Vote's Aftermath

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

 BODY:
After seven hours of impassioned complaints from cabdrivers and owners on Thursday, the Taxi and Limousine Commission retreated into secret session to decide its vote on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new safety rules.
When the six commissioners emerged an hour later, they offered little comment as they rolled through a series of votes approving most of the Mayor's plans. Asked later why the discussion was not held in public, the commission's chairwoman, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, shot back, "There's no reason for that." 
 For the owners and drivers, this was a final bitter moment in a month of hostilities with Mr. Giuliani, the first Mayor in decades to make a determined assault on the industry's safety practices and finances. Even after the votes, contention remained, with legal experts saying the commission had probably violated state law by holding the private session.
Whatever the emotions that were aroused, safety experts say that most of the 15 new rules -- from higher insurance to probationary periods for new drivers -- could tame the worst drivers and help injury victims win more compensation.
Still, the measures would not solve all the problems. In one of the most important changes, taxi and livery companies would have to increase their liability insurance to $100,000 for each accident victim, from the current minimum of $25,000. But while that would help most victims collect more than they do now, it would not enable people with the most devastating injuries to crack through the industry's tough series of legal defenses and collect much larger judgments.
Taxi owners often split up their holdings into a series of smaller companies to minimize liability and borrow against the value of their lucrative licenses, leaving little for accident victims to collect.
Industry officials also warn that the regulations could change the economics of the industry, strangling some smaller operators and ultimately forcing a fare increase.
But polls showed that no matter how much the Mayor baited and pushed the cabbies, the public stood behind his efforts to transform the historically powerful industry, which has experienced a surge in accidents during the last several years.
"The fact is that what we're trying to do is reasonable, it's sensible, it's rational," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday. "It should have been done a long time ago in New York City.
"New York City allowed the taxi industry, because of reasons of political pressure, to dominate in ways that other cities had not allowed to happen, so we're making that change. Yesterday's change was a historic change of great proportion. And three or four years from now, people will appreciate it."
The new rules, to take effect in 30 to 60 days, would sharply increase fines and insurance requirements and make it much easier for the taxi commission to suspend drivers' licenses.
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie and Randy M. Mastro, a Deputy Mayor, both said yesterday that they also expected the commission to pass two hotly contested measures that were tabled Thursday because some commissioners opposed them. Two members of the commission were absent from the voting, and Mr. Mastro said that he was confident that when the full board voted the measures would pass.
One proposal dealt with how quickly drivers could be suspended for traffic violations. The other would require taxi owners to put up a $100,000 bond to guarantee that some accident victims could receive more than just an insurance settlement.
Given the huge cost of some of the proposals, it was natural that the drivers and owners would have fought them no matter how the Mayor brought them forward.
But as more than 50 industry representatives spoke at Thursday's hearing, it was clear that most thought Mr. Giuliani had been much more contentious than he needed to be and that he had given them the back of his hand.
After yellow-cab drivers held a one-day strike earlier this month, city officials blocked efforts by cabbies to stage caravan protests through city streets, saying they should go to Thursday's hearing if they wanted to speak out. Yet dozens of people who signed up to speak were turned away at the crowded proceeding, and even those who spoke with the greatest anguish felt their comments made no difference.
"Did you see how the vote went?" said Johan Nijman, an immigrant from Surinam who paid $250,000 for his taxi medallion two months ago and said he could be forced out of business by the additional costs.
"I thought these people had an agenda to push this thing through no matter what," he said. "And this was a very sad day in the history of American democracy. Tears came from my eyes, sir."
Industry leaders fared no better in complaining that the commission had rushed out the proposals without consulting them and without providing much in the way of statistics to support them.
At one point, Mel Miller, the former State Assembly Speaker who now lobbies for the taxi industry, said that to have a public hearing on the same day the commission was expecting to vote on the measures was unfair. "That's not input," he said. "That's like telling you to comment on a bill after the Governor has signed it."
Some legal experts said the commission's closed-door discussion may have violated the state's open meetings law. "A discussion regarding policy or rule changes would not fall within any of the grounds for entry into executive session," said Robert J. Freeman, executive director of the State Committee on Open Government. "This is the public's business that we're talking about.'
Allan J. Fromberg, the commission's spokesman, maintained yesterday that the board "did not meet in executive session."
He added: "The commissioners took two breaks and had discussions with their counsel, which is entirely appropriate. End of story."
But one commissioner, Marvin Greenberg, disputed Mr. Fromberg's account. "Everybody was talking to each other," Mr. Greenberg said. "We went over line by line to see what we could agree on and where the differences were and where we couldn't find agreement."
Out on the street, the controversy over the proposals seems far from over.
Some drivers thought they got a break when the commission tabled one proposed sanction -- a plan to suspend a cabbie's license after only 6 Division of Motor Vehicle points, rather than the current 11 -- because at least one commissioner questioned whether it was too harsh.
But what few drivers realize is that another measure that did pass will create a separate disciplinary system being set up by the commission itself that is even harsher. It could lead to a 30-day suspension for any driver who got one moving violation -- say, for following another car too closely -- coupled with an administrative infraction during an 18-month period.
Industry officials said they were likely to ask the City Council to review the new rules or file suit to try to block them. And while Ms. McGrath-McKechnie has said she sees no need for a fare increase, industry leaders said that they will push hard for one if they fail to change the new rules.

HEADLINE: A Spelling Champion for All Jamaicans;
12-Year-Old From Kingston Is a Hero for Winning in Washington

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Suddenly, Jamaica has a new hero: a 12-year-old girl from Kingston with a winsome smile and steely determination whose David vs. Goliath victory at the National Spelling Bee has enthralled Jamaicans both on the island and in the large immigrant community in New York City.
Jody-Anne Maxwell, with precise diction flavored by her lilting accent, spelled "chiaroscurist" before a packed hall in Washington on Thursday, becoming the Bee's first foreign champion in its 71 years. She defeated 248 other finalists, including a handful from the Bahamas and Mexico, the only other foreign nations represented. 
 At that moment, driving his delivery van in Queens, William Barnes was listening on his radio and could not believe what he was hearing -- an island girl had come to the capital of this vast and intimidating land and beaten America's best.
"I just feel overwhelmed," Mr. Barnes said yesterday. "My little country came through."
Watching an account of the Bee on the evening news, Troy Armstrong, a 13-year-old sixth grader from Queens, was stunned both at Jody-Anne's victory and his mother's sudden belting out of the Jamaican national anthem. She hugged him and said, "I hope you grow up to be just like that."
Troy, one of about 148,000 people of Jamaican ancestry who live in New York City, primarily in Brooklyn and Queens, said, "It makes me feel proud to be Jamaican for once."
Although Jamaican immigrants have a median income higher than the city average, pop culture, he and others said, has exaggerated the group's problems with gangs and drugs.
"They make it seem like the only jobs Jamaicans can get is selling drugs and being in gangs," Troy said.
And Una Clarke, a City Councilwoman from Brooklyn who was born and reared in Jamaica, said she was working with the Jamaican Embassy to try to bring Jody-Anne to New York to inspire Jamaican students who she said often struggle in school here because of cultural conflicts and differences in American and Jamaican dialects.
"This flies in the face of all the negative stereotypes about Caribbean students," Ms. Clarke said.
Jody-Anne, a polite, confident girl who wants to be a corporate lawyer and attends one of the top public schools in Jamaica, attributed her victory to God and to her coach, the religion teacher from her school. But many others -- from the vice principal at her school to high school students in Brooklyn and Queens -- said it exemplified what they consider the overlooked esteem of the island's education system.
Among Jamaican immigrants, island schools have a reputation for stronger discipline -- including corporal punishment in some cases -- and greater academic rigor than New York City's. A few have even sent their children back to the island to be educated, though neither the city's Board of Education nor Jamaica's Ministry of Education keeps statistics.
John Davis, 29, who came to Queens 10 years ago, said he was considering sending his daughter back to the island when she is ready for elementary school in three years.
"In Jamaica, they tend to concentrate more on what they are learning than what they look like and if their pants are baggy," said Mr. Davis, a real estate agent.
But Jamaica has its disadvantages, too, he said. "Although the school system is good, the economic conditions are hard," he said. "That is the biggest deterrent as to why most Jamaican parents won't send their kids home."
Jamaica's Minister of Education, Burchell Whiteman, said the nation's top schools send the majority of their graduates to colleges abroad (Jamaica has only two colleges). He acknowledged that school programs were uneven and that the country had a literacy rate of about 80 percent, well below that of the United States, at 96 percent. What he calls the "effective" literacy rate, those who read at or above their grade level, is an even lower 65 percent.
"In our schools that perform above normal, generally speaking they put you at an advantage when you enter schools in New York," Mr. Whiteman said. "But I concede at the same time that too many schools are not at the level where they need to be if we're talking about a 65 percent literacy rate."
Jody-Anne is in the seventh grade at Ardenne High School, which has produced the country's top speller for the last eight years, Mr. Whiteman said. In Jamaica, high school begins in the seventh grade.
Only last year did Jamaica begin testing its best against the Americans in the National Spelling Bee in Washington, which is open to English speakers 15 or under; contest rules bar anyone beyond the eighth grade.
"This shows the world -- especially you people, in the United States of America -- that Jamaica, although it is very small, is on top in areas other than sports," said Erma Hutton, vice principal at Ardenne High.
Jody-Anne, who won a $10,000 cash prize, a set of encyclopedias and two round-trip tickets from US Airways, spent yesterday hopping among television studios for a series of interviews so time-consuming she had to cancel a planned visit to see the White House, said her father, Lloyd Maxwell. Mr. Maxwell, a real estate consultant, and his wife, Shirley, a data processor, have four daughters, ages 8 to 30.
Jody-Anne's older sister Janice won Jamaica's national championship a few years ago, and Jody-Anne, a straight-A student who wants to emulate an aunt who is a lawyer, characteristically devoted herself to it, eventually winning the Jamaican spelling bee and heading for Washington on a mission.
"I came here along with my compatriots with the intention to win," she said, in the same firm but polite tone with which she entranced the audience when asking the moderator to repeat words or put them in sentences. "We decided from the beginning that this was not pleasure."
When the runner-up, Prem Murthy Trivedi of Lakewood Preparatory School in Howell, N.J., faltered on "prairillon" (he spelled it "prerillon"), Jody-Anne was given "chiaroscurist," meaning a painter whose style emphasizes the use of light and shadow to simulate depth. She knew how to spell it right away -- a slight smile showed this -- but asked the moderator to repeat it anyhow and put it in a sentence "because I wanted to make absolutely sure."
Yesterday afternoon, as the throng of students filed out of the halls of George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn to soak up the bright sun outside, a group of students from Jamaica leaned against a fence, excitedly discussing Jody-Anne's achievement.
"She showed me that I can do it too," said Sarah Childs, an 18-year-old junior. "I can go in front of the whole world and excel. She can have a positive influence on a lot of kids."
The students' enthusiasm and pride were echoed across Crown Heights, the heart of the West Indian community, where other people from the Caribbean also were elated at Jody-Anne's achievements.
Kevin Jack, 20, who was born in Trinidad, said: "A lot of people from other countries tend to look down on us, thinking we can't reach such heights. She proved a lot of them wrong. They didn't expect it."

HEADLINE: Bilingual Education Is Facing Push Toward Abandonment

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif.

 BODY:
Bilingual education, once widely hailed as a humane and sound method of immigrant assimilation, has fallen into disfavor, disparaged as a bureaucratic boondoggle, even by many of the people it was primarily designed to serve: the nation's increasing Hispanic minority.
On June 2, California voters are expected to endorse Proposition 227, which will eliminate the hundreds of bilingual programs in a state that is home to nearly half of the pupils in the United States with limited English proficiency, setting the stage for similar attacks on such programs nationwide. 
 If it passes, Proposition 227, which essentially limits help for non-native speakers to a year of intensive English instruction, will mark an extraordinary intervention by voters into classrooms to mandate teaching methods, a sign of the growing importance of education in the nation's political debate.
The shift in the fortunes of the nation's bilingual education system has been pronounced, the result of flagging support among its main constituents, Hispanic Americans, a growing political resistance to education bureaucracies, and the sense that, despite many studies, there was no conclusive evidence that it worked. Behind that erosion of support is a stubborn statistic: the high dropout rate of Hispanic youths.
According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, the school dropout rate recorded in 1995 for Hispanic students born in the United States remained at 17.9 percent, but that of Hispanic immigrants was 46.2 percent. This compares with a drop-out rate of 12.2 percent of blacks and 8.6 percent of whites. Foreign-born blacks and whites had lower drop-out rates than those who were born in the United States.
Because three-quarters of schoolchildren nationwide who speak limited English are Hispanic, and because bilingual education is often made to stand for the whole question of educating foreign-language children, the failure of the schools to educate Hispanic youths is often discussed interchangeably with bilingual education as if they were the same thing. But in fact, most Hispanic students do not study in bilingual classes because there are simply not enough classes to accommodate their rapidly growing numbers.
Moreover, most bilingual classes take place in underfunded school districts, adding to the difficulty of assessing their effectiveness. In California, only 30 percent of the students with limited English ability are in bilingual classes because there is a shortage of about 20,000 bilingual teachers in the state. And there is no known difference in dropout rates between those in bilingual classes and those of similar background studying only in English.
 
Crucial Division On Supporting Plan
While the California initiative is the work of a white Republican Silicon Valley millionaire named Ronald K. Unz, it is backed, according to repeated opinion polls, by at least half of the state's Hispanic voters.
In fact, Mr. Unz said his interest was prompted by a strike in 1996 by Mexican-American parents who protested that their children were forced into bilingual education classes.
Another Hispanic American against the initiative is Virginia Martinez, a former bilingual education teacher in Santa Ana, a town an hour south of downtown Los Angeles with the largest concentration of Hispanic immigrants and their offspring in the country, according to national census data.
Here, where the issues of immigrant absorption and bilingual education are particularly pronounced, Ms. Martinez tests for English competency at Taft Elementary School, which has foregone bilingual education for the past 13 years, favoring English immersion, the aim of Proposition 227.
"I kept seeing kids doing poorly in the upper grades after they had gone through bilingual education," Ms. Martinez said. "There was no transition to English. I felt that bilingual education was holding them back."
In the school, Hispanic and Asian children learn in English from the first day, with the occasional translation help of teacher aides. High scores reflect clear success, although Taft serves a more middle-class and ethnically mixed population than many other schools with bilingual programs.
At the same time, Pio Pico Elementary School, just a few miles away, is a reminder of what bilingual education was supposed to be. Built on a lot once overrun by gangs, now an oasis of learning and community involvement, Pio Pico serves a uniform population of low-income Mexican and Central American immigrants who believe deeply in bilingual education.
"With bilingual education, I am involved with my daughter's schooling," said Martha Leon, a housekeeper whose daughter, Lizeth, is in fourth grade. "My daughter is learning English, but because of the Spanish, I feel the school is mine."
 
Limits Were Enacted In Some Other States
 This issue is not confined to California. Backed by a broad range of politicians, including then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, today's bilingual education emerged from the civil rights era and was supported by its own Supreme Court decision, the 1974 Lau v. Nichols ruling. The court ordered states to give special help to students who did not speak English, but did not specify what remedy the states should use.
Aside from California, 10 states mandate bilingual education and most others permit it. Since 1968, when Congress first passed the Bilingual Education Act, the Federal Government has helped fund it. And while not one of those programs yet faces a broad initiative like that in California, all are under debate if not outright attack and curtailment.
In Chicago and Denver, school boards have recently limited bilingual classes to three years; in Arizona, the legislature has voted to limit funding for them to four years. In Albuquerque, N.M., parents are suing the school system, asserting that bilingual classes segregate their children, an accusation that had been leveled at New York State by Brooklyn parents three years ago. This followed a Board of Education report asserting that bilingual programs had failed to teach children as effectively as those in English-only classes.
 
Extra Factors Skew Statistics, Some Say
Supporters of bilingual education contend that the programs have never been adequately supported or implemented, and are thus unfairly blamed for the shortcomings of Hispanic education in this country. What is clear is that demographics will only add urgency to the debate. In California alone, 100,000 Mexicans arrive legally each year, a vast immigration from a single country that is slowing the Mexicans' assimilation. Within half a century, Hispanic Americans are expected to constitute 25 percent of the United States' population, making their education an issue of enormous long-term consequence.
Among scholars, views on bilingual education remain largely positive but even there, disillusion can be felt over the sloppiness of research and the difficulty of drawing conclusions. The programs' failings are acknowledged though they are not attributed to any theoretical weaknesses.
"I am fairly certain that if you control for all other factors -- rates of poverty, teacher training, school climate -- and just study the process of language acquisition, you have a slight edge for bilingual education. But that edge is extremely small," said Kenji Hakuta, professor of education at Stanford University and chairman of a panel that produced a recent National Research Council report on educating children with limited English.
"People are genuinely and appropriately dissatisfied, but they are misdiagnosing the problem," Professor Hakuta said. "The kids are learning English. The problem is that they are not progressing in school subject matters."
Professor Hakuta, like other opponents of Proposition 227, say that because it forbids bilingual education except under exceptional circumstances and requires all children to fit into one unproven method of educational transition, it is poorly conceived and dangerous.
Mr. Unz and his supporters counter that their plan is based on European models that do work.
 
Too Little Progress In Too Much Time
One problem in the debate is the varying definition of bilingual education and the many programs that come under its rubric, from English as a second language to so-called structured immersion, which is mostly English instruction with some subject content thrown in -- to true bilingual teaching.
In its most widely understood form, bilingual education teaches academic subjects to immigrant children in their native languages while, at the same time, gradually instructing them in English so that after a few years they join regular classes.
The idea is that instead of losing time learning English before entering school or having to struggle in English before they are ready, these children can keep up with their grade levels while gradually transferring into mainstream classes.
Important elements of the theory behind this plan were provided in the last quarter-century by Jim Cummins, a professor of education at the University of Toronto. He argued that learning to read in one's native language makes it easier to read in a second language and that the more children master in their first language, the more they will be able to master in the second.
Practical experience backed these theories in part. When children arrived in the United States well-schooled, they made the transition to English classes easily. They understood how a language worked and were able to transfer their skills.
The problems occurred mostly with children who were either born in the United States to Spanish-speaking households or had received inadequate schooling before immigrating. Teaching those children for years in their native language before allowing the transition to English seems to have done them little good.
As Charles L. Glenn, professor of education policy at Boston University, put it:
"Someone who plays soccer will learn to play American football faster than someone else who has never played a sport. But that does not make it efficient to teach soccer first if the goal is football. We should build on academic skills if a child already has them in another language but we should not make developing new ones in that language a priority."
Still, the research on bilingual education is notoriously inconclusive, and studies often seem to be done by scholars seeking to bolster their own views. The original theory of bilingual education was that students would move out of their native languages as rapidly as possible into English, normally in one to three years. But that approach has lagged, with many students staying six to seven years in primary language classes both because they were not yet fluent enough in English and because of more complex reasons.
Some Spanish-language teachers felt protective of students and feared that they would be mistreated in mainstream classes. Others simply found it easier to instruct pupils in Spanish and thus made insufficient effort to teach in English.
Still others believed that the longer native speakers were taught in their language, the more easily they would learn subjects in English.
For the backers of Proposition 227, the dragging transition to English is what is wrong with bilingual education. They also say it has developed its own bureaucracy and budgets -- replete with extra money for schools with students who stay in bilingual education and salary bonuses for bilingual teachers. They say it has lost sight of the children's welfare and that the country has historically, and successfully, relied on quick assimilation through English.
The truth is more complicated. Richard Rothstein, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington has written a book called "The Way We Were?" (Century Foundation Press, 1998) in which he demonstrates how poorly immigrants from Italy, Poland and Russia did in school in the early part of the century without bilingual education. For example, in 1931, only 11 percent of the Italian students who entered high school graduated compared with 40 percent for all students.
When bilingual education was established in the 1960's, it was boosted partly by the assertion that the American economy depended on its citizens' ability to do business abroad.
Today, English is the international language, far more dominant than it was 30 years ago. Parents across the globe are demanding more and earlier English instruction for their children and many foreign-born parents here consider mastery of English to be fundamental for their children. This, too, has weakened the case for bilingual education and driven voters toward Proposition 227.
But at Pio Pico, there is a feeling that all they have worked toward is endangered. When asked what they would do if the initiative passed, Judith Magsaysay, the principal, half joked that she would go to jail rather than stop using Spanish to help her pupils. When the parents around the table heard her, they said in chorus, "Don't worry. We'll bring you tortillas in prison."

HEADLINE: Taxi Reform Is Just a Band-Aid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's effort to curb taxi accidents through increased insurance coverage (front page, May 29) is merely a Band-Aid. As long as drivers have to work long hours for little pay -- and medallion owners operate as financial middlemen disconnected from day-to-day taxi service -- they will work fast and aggressively. 
 The Mayor should consider a radical plan to alter the medallion system that is forcing the economic costs to drivers higher, or start fining owners for the actions of uncontrolled drivers.

Retail credit grew by 50 percent in Poland last year and both the Czech Republic and Hungary recorded steady growth in consumer debt, fueling trade imbalances as a flood of imports swamps exports.

Support for Ethnic Albanians
President Clinton met with ethnic Albanian leaders from the Serbian province of Kosovo in an attempt to display American interest and involvement in Kosovo, as well as support for Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the republic of Kosovo. The Agency for International Development announced a $6 million increase in aid to Kosovo, seeking to bolster Mr. Rugova's position both with his people and with the Serbian Government. A4
 
France Recognizes 'Genocide'
The French National Assembly voted unanimously to formally recognize the killings of ethnic Armenians in Turkey from 1915 to 1923 as genocide -- a move that drew sharp protests from Turkey. If the motion passes the Senate, France would become the first major European country to use the term "genocide" to describe the deaths of one million or more Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in the years during and immediately after World War I.

To the Editor:
Re "Reducing Class Size" (editorial, May 25): You might note the results of a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, reported in the Sept. 30, 1996, issue of U.S. News & World Report, that "America is alone in having an educational establishment in which more than half the employees (58 percent) don't teach." Does this fact help in clarifying the problem of large class sizes, and the perennial quest for more money for "education"?

Cone Keeps Cool And Runs Follow For the Yankees

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
David Cone allowed a titanic 406-foot homer to Reggie Jefferson on his fourth pitch of the game last night. So what? Cone stayed calm. He knew, just as everyone else at soggy Yankee Stadium knew, that his pitching opponent, Derek Lowe, would have a difficult time suppressing the Yankees. Every other pitcher does. Why should Lowe be any different?
Besides, the Yankees have treated David like a king on the mound this season by scoring for him as if this this were Little League, not the major leagues. The relentless Yankees continued that offensive trend last night by beating Lowe and the Red Sox, 6-2, before a paying crowd of 47,160, most of whom waited 2 hours 13 minutes while the first pitch was delayed by a steady rain. 
 Once the game finally started, the Yankees quickly exhibited just how sizable the disparity is between them and the second-place team in the soon-to-be decided American League East. Well, maybe not that soon, but does anyone really think the Yankees will mishandle a whopping nine-and-a-half-game cushion? The Red Sox are fading fast and have lost six games in a row, including four straight to the Yankees.
The always-tinkering Cone incorporated a new wrinkle into his delivery last night by placing his right, or pushoff foot, on the extreme right side of the rubber instead of on the extreme left side. Cone said he felt that his fastballs and sliders were sailing too far outside to right-handed hitters and hoped the adjustment would enable those pitches to move toward the middle of the plate. It worked as Cone struck out seven and gave up only two earned runs and one walk in seven innings, his longest outing of the season. He tossed an economical 84 pitches.
Jefferson, a left-handed batter, homered off a hanging slider in the first inning and blasted a fastball into the right-field seats in the fifth. John Valentin doubled off the center-field fence in the second, missing a homer by a foot. But that was the only serious damage off Cone, who permitted only two other base runners in winning his seventh straight decision.
The Yankees have scored 88 runs in Cone's 10 starts, an average of 8.8 a game.
"He keeps telling me to not give up on him," Manager Joe Torre said. "I'm not about to give up on him."
Of course not. Cone is 7-1, but his earned run average is an uncharacteristic 5.59. But if Cone keeps getting stronger and pitching the way he did last night, the Yanks will be even more formidable -- if that is possible for a team whose 37-11 start is tied for the fifth best in American League history.
The 24-year-old Lowe had a decent beginning by retiring seven of the first eight Yankees he faced, but Lowe walked Joe Girardi, the worst hitter in the lineup with a .244 average, in the third and immediately rued the free pass. Chuck Knoblauch singled in a run to tie the score, 1-1, and after Derek Jeter singled to fill the bases, Paul O'Neill cued a double to shallow left to knock in two more for a 3-1 edge.
More misery awaited Lowe in the fourth. His legs quivered whenever New York had runners on, which happened quickly because Bernie Williams singled. Chad Curtis walked, Scott Brosius singled and, after a visit from Manager Jimy Williams, Lowe gave up a bloop single to Girardi that pushed home two more runs.Knoblauch finished Lowe's evening with a run-scoring single to make it 6-1.
How abysmal was Lowe with runners on base? He yielded six hits in nine at-bats in that situation and also walked two. No wonder Lowe pulled his cap down tight over his eyes after being removed. He is 0-4 with an 8.24 e.r.a. as a starter.
Cone was the antithesis of Lowe as he retired five of six batters who hit with men on base and breezed to his second victory in six days against Boston.
"I expect to be better," Cone said. "I expect to return to the form I had last year. I haven't gotten there yet, but I'm still trying."
 
INSIDE PITCH
Sweating and smiling, finally, TINO MARTINEZ stood near the bat rack after batting practice and pronounced himself ready to start. It was the first time the first baseman was in the lineup since last Friday in Boston. "It's definitely sore and there's pain there, but I can definitely play," said Martinez, who has been throttled by swelling between his right shoulder blades. "Yesterday, I couldn't play. Today, I feel like I can play, even with pain." Martinez, who was injured when ARMANDO BENITEZ of the Baltimore Orioles plunked him with a pitch on May 19, went 0 for 4. . . . The Yankees made a nice gesture to those fans who waited over two hours for the game to start by announcing they could exchange last night's ticket stub for a ticket to one of six games against Minnesota (Aug. 10 and 11) or Anaheim (Aug. 24, 25 or one of two games on Aug. 26). Fans must make exchanges by mail and must enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Today's game with Boston is a sellout.

Two Lucky People Memoirs.
 By Milton Friedman and Rose D. Friedman.
 Illustrated. 660 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $35. 
 The air is sweet up in the hills of New Hampshire, so it's no surprise that Milton Friedman should so fondly remember his younger days in a remote cottage: "I can recall many a pleasant summer evening discussing consumption data and theory in front of a blazing fire." Long chats on consumption data might not stir the souls of some, but as Milton and Rose D. Friedman reveal in their joint memoir, "Two Lucky People," they are econ-nerds through and through. They linger over memories of intense technical discussions. They describe friendships built on arcane talk of curves and functions and theorems. And while their public fame rests on books like "Capitalism and Freedom" and "Free to Choose," and their enormous influence on politicians like Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and the free-market leaders of Eastern Europe, they insist that this aspect of their careers is just a sidelight. It's the science of economics that has been central to their lives.
So while they do describe public crusades and the Nobel Prize ceremonies, their memoir is most moving when it evokes life in the community of scholars. "We reflected again on the wonderful dividend from graduate teaching of having intellectual children throughout the world . . . and on the emotional hold which the University of Chicago has on those who have been there," they declare in a characteristic passage. Milton insists he will be remembered more for his technical work than for his political activism, and he seems slightly aloof from the intense public controversies that have raged around him. The Friedmans come across as the last Enlightenment thinkers in a post-modern world, putting their faith in Science and Reason and exuding a happy confidence that truth will triumph. Their memoir reads like one of those Christmas letters you sometimes get from modest but superachieving friends: Met some wonderful people in Japan this past summer, found mice living in the vacation house, transformed the nature of economic thought.
Milton and Rose Friedman grew up in observant Jewish homes at opposite ends of America, Milton in New Jersey and Rose in Oregon. Those who are familiar with Milton's tendency to pursue arguments to their logical end will not be surprised to learn that until the age of 12 he "fanatically" adhered to the Orthodox dietary and other requirements. But he suddenly gave up religion, discovered mathematics and after college at Rutgers found himself at the University of Chicago studying economics along with another student, Rose Director. He calls his first year of graduate school the most intellectually stimulating of his life, but he is characteristically reticent about his emotional life. We do learn that after a day at the 1933 Century of Progress world's fair, Milton tried to plant a good-night kiss on Rose and she refused him. It's hard to know which is more amazing, that he didn't immediately formulate an argument on why she should kiss him, or that Rose didn't see that this was the guy for her. In the succeeding 65 years they have become a famously complementary pair.
Milton's talent as an economist is the invisible driving force of the book, taking them off to unlikely locations. He was recruited to Washington to do research for the New Deal. During World War II he worked in the Treasury Department to create the tax-withholding system that ever since has been the bete noire of free marketeers like himself. Later in the war he went to work at Columbia University's Statistical Research Group, figuring out, for example, how many pellets a shrapnel shell should burst into to create maximum damage. And then for the rest of his life, his ability took him to a series of ever more prestigious appointments, visiting fellowships and worldwide lecture tours.
Friedman entered an economics profession that was dominated by Keynesian thinking, but that now, thanks largely to him, recognizes the centrality of monetary policy. His public teachings in Newsweek, on PBS and in books like "Capitalism and Freedom," which has sold more than 400,000 copies even though, he says, it was not reviewed in any major national publication, have altered the political framework. And the policy ideas he invented or championed, including school vouchers, the negative income tax, the volunteer Army, the balanced budget amendment and drug legalization, continue to define political debate.
Yet his equipoise is as striking as his brainpower. We're used to flamboyant geniuses, but Friedman is relentlessly normal. It's hard now to capture how extreme his libertarian ideas seemed when they were propounded 50 years ago. In 1947, a small band of free-market economists met in Mont Pelerin, Switzerland. Many great thinkers were there -- F. A. Hayek, Karl Popper, Friedman -- but, as befits a fringe group, also a lot who were eccentric and temperamental. At the first meeting Ludwig von Mises stood up and shouted, "You're all a bunch of socialists," and stamped out of the room.
Friedman has been so persuasive because he expounds radical ideas with a sweet smile of reason. He charms and disarms his debating partners, and as the Friedmans boast -- the one boast in the book -- they have many professional foes but no personal enemies. Friedman doesn't seem to get downhearted when his views are unpopular, or elated when he is honored. When he was informed that he had won the Nobel Prize, he responded quite rationally that the award seemed to lead many laureates to expound on subjects outside their expertise.
In truth, "Two Lucky People" probably would have been a more exciting book if the Friedmans were a little more histrionic. Their narrative is clear, but it is artless. They do not draw detailed portraits of their friends (they truncate their descriptions of Nixon, Reagan, Thatcher and the other leaders they have known). They tell us next to nothing about what they think about beyond economics. Milton says that he regretfully has no taste for music, and they do not even say which novelists move them, or what historians or philosophers have been important in their lives.
In the end, however, this is a book that restores your faith in reasoned discourse. Amid all the wonks vying to get intimate with the powerful, and all the academic theorizing about how language is an ever-shifting deception, there really are people who believe in scholarly exchange as a way to discover truth. The Friedmans pursued their ideas. Influence -- in this case world-shaking influence -- just sort of followed.

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
Pedal to the Metal and Eyes on the Screen

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
Several television specials this year have commemorated the 50th anniversary of Nascar, the stock-car racing organization created in Daytona Beach, Fla., to bring order to what was up to then a chaotic, formless sport. Two of the latest will be shown tonight on TBS, one of a number of channels that now show Nascar's brand of stock-car racing.
The first, a segment of "National Geographic Explorer," beginning at 7 P.M., is a superficial look at the sport. That is followed at 9 by "Nascar at 50: Good to Go," which offers a closer examination of some of the struggles in a sport trying to retain its aw-shucks charm while striving to scrape the blood off its knuckles and the grease from its fingernails. 
 That's no small image rehab for a sport that began in the rural Southeast, on small dirt tracks usually bulldozed out of someone's farmland. One of the goals of William H. G. France Sr. in establishing Nascar (the acronym for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) in December 1947 was to make sure that the drivers of the postwar era -- many of whom had to be quick to deliver carloads of home-brew whiskey and still win the race against Federal agents to stay out of jail -- did not have to use fists or guns to collect their prize money before race-track owners could abscond with it.
Nowadays, as the TBS program points out, drivers like Jeff Gordon, the 26-year-old star who is already a two-time Nascar champion, need only outrun all the fans wanting autographs on the millions of dollars' worth of souvenirs bearing the drivers' likenesses. "They're accessible, they're open, they're modest, and they come out of a Southern culture that's respectful," said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports, in describing the stock-car racers' personality traits that attract many Americans who think that too many other pro athletes have lost the common touch.
At a time when most sports leagues are experiencing flat or declining television ratings, Nascar racing has produced steadily increasing viewership. Last year, for example, CBS had an average rating of 5.7 for the six major races it broadcast, an increase of 16 percent from 1996. (Each rating point represents 980,000 homes.)
The races are now shown on a total of five broadcast and cable networks -- one more than National Football League games. And on July 4, Nascar will reach another milestone: the first live network broadcast of a race in prime time, the Firecracker 400 on CBS.
The one-hour TBS show, by Turner Original Productions, illustrates the delicate balancing act that has brought Nascar to where it now is: operating a multimillion-dollar sport while maintaining the veneer of small-town charm. Charlotte Motor Speedway, in North Carolina, whose Winston Cup race last October is the setting for "Nascar at 50," is the perfect symbol: a glittering track whose infield was once a landfill. One of the main subjects of the program is H. A. (Humpy) Wheeler, who, as president and general manager of Charlotte Motor Speedway, has turned it into what he terms the "Taj Mahal of racing." Don't laugh. The condominiums overlooking the track went on the market in 1984 for $95,000, and 10 years later were selling for $375,000.
At one point in the program, Mr. Wheeler sits in his plush office and holds up a jar of 140-proof moonshine, a reminder, he says, of where the sport has come from. "This place has got to have a space for the person who works in the mill and the person who owns the mill," Mr. Wheeler says of his track.
Mr. Pilson, who now works as a broadcast consultant for several Nascar tracks, said the average Nascar fan was more affluent than a typical mill worker. "He's not at the highest level economically, like golf, but he is higher than the baseball and basketball fan," he said in a recent telephone interview from his Manhattan office.
Some of those fans are also nomadic, traveling hundreds of miles several times a year to attend races. Roaming the countryside in motor homes, beat-up vans and resurrected school buses, they watch the same performers over and over: kind of like Grateful Dead fans without the marijuana.
But what really attracts sponsors, Mr. Pilson said, is the Nascar fan's unique understanding that loyalty to a particular driver means allegiance to that driver's corporate sponsor. "What's most important is that the fans are buying the sponsors' products," Mr. Pilson said.
Excluding extravaganzas like the Olympics, the only sports programs that regularly deliver higher ratings than Nascar's Winston Cup Series (stock-car racing's big league) are professional football and the post-season playoffs in major league baseball and professional basketball, Mr. Pilson said. "College football is about equal to Nascar, in terms of ratings," he said, "and everything else is below Nascar."
Strong ratings are especially crucial to stock-car racing. For years, the sport has thrived by skirting the ban on televised tobacco advertising, and R. J. Reynolds has spent tens of millions of dollars to see and hear the name Winston on all those broadcasts. If, as expected, any major liability settlement with the tobacco industry brings an end to cigarette sponsorship in racing, Nascar's big television audience will make it much easier to find a replacement sponsor.
That sponsor will be buying the sort of viewer loyalty that is hard to find in an era of free-agent athletes who are million-dollar migrant workers. But it's a loyalty that may not be hard to understand after watching the "Nascar at 50" segment on Dale Earnhardt.
Mr. Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, distills the Nascar driver's charm down to its 140-proof essence. When he was 17, he found his father, a talented driver as well, slumped over dead after suffering a heart attack while working on a carburetor. That seemed to toughen his resolve, and Mr. Earnhardt soon got to the top of his sport with the nickname the Intimidator for his willingness to knock aside any opponent who would not get out of his way.
The segment begins with hundreds of fans lined up outside his car dealership waiting for him to autograph shirts, caps and even a windshield from one of his race cars. One female fan explains the attraction: Mr. Earnhardt commits the kind of mayhem on a race track that frustrated motorists like her can only dream about. "Plus, he's an attractive man,' she adds.
After a quick look at the horses, chickens and fish that live on his farm (with millions of dollars annually in souvenir sales, Mr. Earnhardt can afford to keep the fish in his pond well-fed, and they welcome his arrival as hungrily as his fans do), he displays almost two dozens bins of mail from fans seeking autographs. He will oblige all of them, apparently. Through it all, he comes across as a simple man aware of a simple truth: his wealth is derived directly from the deep emotional connection his fans feel for him.
That connection includes television executives, too. Mr. Pilson likes to tell a story about the time he was introduced to race drivers at a trackside chapel service as the man who first put the Daytona 500 on CBS, a decision made in 1979 that has greatly benefited Nascar and the network. "The drivers got up and gave me a standing ovation, and they came up to me one by one and shook my hand," he recalled. "Could you imagine that introduction getting that kind of a reaction someplace like an N.B.A. locker room?"

HEADLINE: The Soul and Spirit of Hilo

BYLINE: By JOCELYN FUJII; JOCELYN FUJII, author of "Under the Hula Moon" (Crown), lives in Honolulu.

 BODY:
I THINK of Hilo, rain or shine, as the unsung hero of the Hawaiian Islands. Residents of the town in eastern Hawaii, known for its abundant rainfall, have retained their spirit through the devastating tsunamis of 1946 and 1960 and the more recent economic struggles of sugar plantation closings. The engines of tourism and economic development raced past Hilo, creating, in a sense, a kipuka -- an oasis of green in a sea of lava. Modest plantation-style homes have yards full of gingers, orchids and other riotous blooms, as well as litchi trees that bulge with fruit during summer. If economic hardship has taken its toll, you won't see evidence of it in downtown Hilo, where the parking meters (once 10 cents an hour and now free) are covered with jaunty flowered cotton covers made by volunteers.
There is a Hawaiian saying: "Hana mao 'ole ka ua o Hilo" -- Endlessly pours the rain of Hilo. When I wake up in a Hilo waterfront hotel, the first thing I do is listen for rain and the gurgling of Hilo Bay, and the second thing I do is look out the window to see if the summit of Mauna Kea (Hawaii's highest mountain) is visible. 
 Yet during a recent visit to Hilo, which averages nearly 11 feet of rain a year, the skies were clear and the view unobstructed. I sat in a light-filled breakfast room at the Shipman House Inn, five or six blocks inland from the Hilo bayfront. The view was pleasantly altered by the ripple effect of the inn's 100-year-old hand-rolled windows. Outside, the palette of greens and blues was enhanced by an unexpected splash of crimson from a ti plant that leaned over the sill. Hilo Bay shimmered beyond.
My boyfriend, Brad, and I had stayed in Auntie Carrie's Room upstairs, which cost $140 and featured a private bath, an ornate antique four-poster bed made of koa (a native hardwood) and a 12-foot ceiling. We had just finished our breakfast of sweet starfruit, homemade papaya bread, still-warm corn bread, macadamia-nut granola and juicy orange-red Sunrise papaya when the proprietor of this year-old inn, Barbara-Ann Andersen, unveiled another marvel.
A friend had just dropped off some cuttings taken from the first vanda orchid plant brought to the Big Island, she told us, producing a tangle of roots and leaves. Vanda orchids are often used in leis and in fact were introduced to Hawaii in the 1800's by Ms. Andersen's ancestors.
Having worn countless vanda leis in my lifetime, and sitting in the heart of what is today known as the Orchid Island, I was having, as islanders would say, a "chicken-skin" (goosebump) experience. In the living room next to us sat a gleaming 1912 Steinway grand piano that Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last monarch, played on her visits to Shipman House.
"She was a friend of my great-grandmother's and would visit for poi luncheons," Ms. Andersen said. Family lore has it that the queen enjoyed smoking a cigar while giggling Shipman children fanned her, competing to see who could get closest to the queen without touching her.
OUTDOORS, on the five and a half acres surrounding the inn, a light breeze wafted through the 20 varieties of fruit trees that had produced most of the food on our plates. Soon after breakfast, Ms. Andersen found a home for the vanda cutting in the shade of a furry tree fern. She placed the orchid within easy reach of a hose until the drought that had been generated by El Nino was over.
Hilo, which in 1990, its wettest year on record, received nearly 18 feet of rain, had seen only 6.2 inches in the first three months of this year. (Nearly 9 inches more fell in April, but that month usually brings more than 15 inches.) Hawaiians have some 40 terms for rain, and Hilo residents know most of them.
Although the decrease in rain has devastated farmers, El Nino has been good for surfers and visitors. Hilo Bay waves are crisp, the parks dry and welcoming, and the snorkeling in the spring-fed shoreline along James Kealoha and Leleiwi beach parks, near Richardson Ocean Center, the best on the eastern side of the island. The main recreational area for Hilo beachgoers, Kealoha and Leleiwi are on a stretch of shoreline east of downtown Hilo and the bayfront, bordered on one side by vast acres of ponds and on the other by reef-protected ocean.
The weekend we visited, there was no rain and Mauna Kea's summit, 13,796 feet high, was always visible. As our plane approached Hilo on Thursday I saw waterfalls, arched bridges and the corrugated iron roofs of plantation homes, painted yellow, red, green and turquoise. From the air, the rock gardens and prim stone bridges of the 30-acre Liliuokalani Park looked like minimalist sculpture.
On Saturday morning, the Farmers Market downtown on Kamehameha Avenue teemed with elbow-to-elbow shoppers who scooped up fresh, inexpensive anthuriums, proteas, orchids, lettuce, herbs, homemade vegetable and chicken tamales, gourmet macadamia nuts, fruit breads and fleshy, ruby-hued tomatoes. While I reluctantly pay $3.50 apiece for green anthuriums in Honolulu, at the Hilo Farmers Market they cost $6 for a bunch, and the more common red ones, $3.50 to $5 a bunch.
The most popular greenmarket in the state, it is loved as much for its local color as for the quality and freshness of its produce, grown from sea level and up on the flanks of the island's five volcanoes. A leisurely whirl through the market is like a journey through the many ecosystems and ethnic traditions of the island.
Kamehameha Avenue also is lined with shops and restaurants in historic buildings such as the S. Hata Building, a 1912 structure in the Renaissance Revival style, and the S. H. Kress Building, a 1932 Art Deco structure that temporarily houses an exhibit from the Pacific Tsunami Museum. Photos show the extensive damage to Hilo from the 1946 and 1960 tsunamis. In June, the museum will move down the street to a larger space in the First Hawaiian Bank building, which was designed by C. W. Dickey and built in 1930.
I ducked into Sig Zane Designs a few doors away. Some islanders fly to Hilo just to buy the shop's aloha wear and Haiwaiian collectibles. The store's cotton shirts, dresses and home accessories depict the bold graphic designs of culturally significant Hawaiian plants like koa, breadfruit, taro and lehua blossoms. Aloha shirts cost $45 to $59 and the new long-sleeved linen shirts with koa patterns, $75. The store's salespeople are generous with their time and will explain the plants' meanings and uses.
Every year during the week after Easter, Hilo erupts in the cultural explosion known as the Merrie Monarch Hula Festival. Hotels that line Banyan Drive along the shore are sold out for the week. Employees and owners of businesses like Zane's, who are serious students of hula, get involved in creating costumes and rehearsing.
"Because we live on a volcano, we have a natural energy all around us, always percolating," said Mr. Zane, a dancer who is married to Nalani Kanaka'ole, a revered hula master and one of two sisters who lead Halau O Kekuhi, a local hula school. "The island itself is one of our biggest sources of inspiration. For Merrie Monarch, we're learning a chant about the creation of the islands. We are talking about land giving birth. Here, on this island of volcanoes, it's ongoing, it's real, it's tangible. Here it's a living culture, not one that's just spoken or read about."
Down the street from Sig Zane's, Hana Hou is a vintage buff's nirvana, awash in the tropical prints of retro clothing and custom-made quilts made from Hawaiian fabrics of the 30's and 40's. The mango wood bench in the dressing room, carved from the same tree as the desk near the entrance, is as distinctive as the $150 neckties that Michele Zane-Faridi, the shop's owner (and Sig Zane's sister), recently designed out of vintage aloha-shirt fabrics.
The kimonos at Dragon Mama Natural Fiber Futon Shop, a few feet away from Hana Hou, are vintage as well, but mostly the store sells fabrics. Bolts of extraordinary silks and cottons line one wall for those who prefer their clothing custom made. (When the Dalai Lama visited the island, Dragon Mama sewed his futon and bedding.) No kitsch in this store: The pillows, clothing, obi, futons and home accessories, of natural fibers, express a strong, quiet Japanese esthetic. Items range from a $12 pillow to $32-a-yard silk fabrics.
One block inland, or mauka (which means "toward the mountain") from Kamehameha Avenue, Mauna Kea Galleries on Keawe Street offers hand-colored lithographs, early Hawaiian maps, vintage Hawaiian china and paintings by Hawaii masters.
It is worth a jaunt a few blocks inland to visit the intimate Lyman House Memorial Museum, where you can learn everything from the geology of Hilo to its plantation past, Hawaiian gods and architecture.
Hilo also generates a lion's share of the cookies, candies and snacks given as omiyage in the local custom of gift-giving when flying between islands. In addition to the Puna papayas and macadamia nuts that are Big Island trademarks, there are renowned chocolate-dipped shortbread cookies made by Big Island Candies in Hilo.
Seafood lovers can't miss in Hilo. At the southern end of Hilo Bay, where Lihiwai Street meets Kamehameha Avenue, Suisan Fish Market's early-morning fish auction draws throngs of wholesalers who bid in pidgin, the local patois, for supplies of ahi and mahi-mahi that will soon appear on menus. Those who arrive earlier than 7:30 A.M., when the auction begins, can watch the fishermen unload their catch on the pier.
Ocean Sushi Deli, a year-old sushi bar with zero ambience that specializes in local hybrids like lomi salmon, opihi (limpet), and ahi poke (seasoned raw fish), was so crowded that it took us three tries to get in. The ahi poke sushi, and the lomi salmon with its flavors of salt, onions and tomato, made it well worth the wait -- at $2 an order. We also took advantage of the deli's catering services to order a platter of sushi for takeout -- something to consider on a sunny Hilo day, when the picnic tables on Hilo Bay or at Liliuokalani Park beckon.
Not all the fish in Hilo, however, comes from the sea. Two or three miles down the road from Suisan, past the Onekahakaha Beach Park, a Hilo institution called Seaside Restaurant serves fresh fish straight from aquaculture pond to plate. Because the dining room can get noisy, I like to go before dark and be served on the deck, where I can take in the view of the surrounding natural ponds, glassy and serene. The water reflects clouds and moonlight as clearly as the colors of sunset.
Inside, the restaurant is casual, with large windows and memorabilia from the 1946 tsunami. The room can get noisy when full. I had the aholehole, the silvery, bony fish in the perch family savored by island fish lovers, crisped to perfection and moist inside. Mullet and opakapaka (pink snapper) steamed in ti leaves are also signature items on a menu that also remains attentive to those not favoring seafood, with chicken and steak.
My favorite place for lunch is a simple lunch wagon on Hilo Bay called Island Grinds, north of the bridge. The wooden-sided lunch wagon is the quintessence of Hilo style. It sits under a willowy ironwood tree, with a table and chairs on the beach.
Lisa Werner and her partner, Norina Page, keep the wagon open from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. weekdays except Tuesday. They also run a thriving delivery and catering business. The food -- kalua style (slow-roasted, shredded) turkey, fresh fish, cajun taro burgers, black-bean-and-tempeh burrito, lilikoi (passion fruit) and macadamia nut cole slaw, taro potato salad and daily specials -- is health-conscious, and the servings are generous. And the fresh fish -- delectable every time I've ordered it -- always costs $5.50 with salad, regardless of market price.
Parked on the sand a few feet from shore, the tiny lunch wagon is stronger than it looks, having survived an eight-foot wave two years ago. The wagon and Ford truck were dredged out of the bay. Ms. Werner, who thought all had been lost, said, "When I gingerly opened the door, the inside was pristine, as peaceful and in order as day one."
What do you do when it rains? I asked.
"We stay," she said without hesitation. "We stay."

HEADLINE: What Happened On Horton Road

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves; Evelyn Nieves is a columnist for The Times

 BODY:
 Kelly ann tinyes's ninth annual 14th-birthday ceremony turned out much like the others.
It was another gusty March 5, the sky a cardboard gray. At 4 p.m., with rush-hour traffic starting to clog the tightly packed streets of Valley Stream, doors up and down Horton Road opened and neighbors began the walk to the Tinyes house. Outside their red Cape Cod, Kelly's parents, Richard and Victoria, and their son, Richie Jr., 17, waited on the square lawn with several of Victoria's relatives and about 50 pink and white balloons. 
 When 30 people had gathered in the street in front of the driveway, the balloons were handed out, and Victoria Tinyes, standing in the middle of the group, called out to the assembled crowd, "Is everyone ready?" Everyone was.
"Happy Birthday, Kelly!" they all shouted, letting their balloons go. They watched, heads tilted upward, as the balloons disappeared in the clouds. "This is the first year none of them got stuck in that tree," Mrs. Tinyes said, scanning the arching branches of a mature oak in front of the house. Everyone agreed. Then, with the quickest of goodbyes, the crowd was gone.
That was it. The one event of the year on Horton Road was over in 10 minutes.
It was very different here nine years ago, before Kelly was lured into a neighbor's house and beaten, stabbed and strangled to death on March 3, 1989, by one of Horton Road's own sons. This tract of post-World War II starter houses on Long Island -- where blue-collar families from Brooklyn and Queens settled down for the long haul, grateful to have landed in the suburban dream of Nassau County -- used to be a happy place. There were block parties and pool parties and garage-sale barbecues. The 19 families who lived on the street knew one another's in-laws and watched one another's kids; the 27 school-age children acted like cousins. It was like a working-class commune.
No one has moved (except an elderly woman, to a nursing home, and an elderly man, who died). Yet Horton Road now seems like any other street where neighbors say hello when their eyes meet but don't bother when they don't. It would be better if it were that way -- if it could be explained as just another neighborhood where people are too busy for one another. Instead, Horton Road is a neighborhood wrecked by a murder, where children grew up too soon because of it and lingering questions still surround the crime.
Even the brief ritual for Kelly's birthday, which comes two days after the anniversary of her death, causes consternation and division. There are those who think that the best way for Horton Road to get past what happened is to stop bringing it up, especially in public. Then there are those who are simply not welcome. They include the neighbors who have remained cordial to John and Elizabeth Golub, those who think that even though the Golubs' son Robert was convicted of murdering the Tinyes girl, the parents are still deserving of sympathy. And least welcome of all are the Golubs themselves.
This is no secret. In fact, while neighbors were gathering in front of the Tinyes house for the annual ritual in March, the Golub house, five doors away, was dark, as though no one was home -- despite the Toyota in the driveway.
At least half the children on Horton Road stopped playing outside after what everyone here refers to simply as the Murder. The Golub house, the first Tudor house in a row divided between that style and similar Cape Cods, has become the Murder House. Kelly, pretty and popular, a favorite baby sitter for many younger children on the street, has become the symbol of lost innocence. Friends still keep the presents they planned to give her at a surprise birthday party the day after she disappeared.
Almost since that day, people on Horton Road have been saying that the Golubs should move. (Shortly after the murder, nine families issued a news release stating, "The Golubs are not welcome back to Horton Road.") Neighbors still say that they don't know why the Golubs have stubbornly resisted the idea of leaving.
Others also wonder why the Tinyeses haven't moved. That way the hatred that has fueled the two families, sparking more than 50 harassment complaints to the police, and ruling the neighborhood for nine long years, might end.
"They should be the ones to move," Mrs. Tinyes said between answering phones at Victoria Collision, the auto-body shop the Tinyeses own by the Queens border and Kennedy Airport, just a few miles from home. Mrs. Tinyes has broad shoulders and, at 43, an open, unlined face, with big hazel eyes and a short mass of blond-highlighted curls. She works as a medical assistant in a doctor's office when she is not answering phones here. Above her, on a shelf, sits Kelly's final school photo, reproduced more than a hundred times in the newspapers. The girl in the photo has dark blue eyes, long dark hair and a spray of freckles across the nose. She is slightly smiling.
"The Golubs should've moved a long time ago," Mrs. Tinyes said. "In the beginning, they said they would."
Richard Tinyes, a burly 44-year-old with blond hair and a beard, sat at his desk a few yards away from his wife. "We would've moved a long time ago if we could afford it," he said. "But we couldn't. When Kelly died, for more than a year, I couldn't focus on the business. There was the tremendous emotional upheaval. I can't even calculate how much business we lost. Kelly's murder hurt us mentally, physically and financially."
The Golubs say much the same. They moved to Horton Road in 1967, when their first child, Adele, was 2 years old and Mrs. Golub was pregnant with Robert, the first of two sons. For the most part, the family stayed on the fringes of the neighborhood's social fabric. They spent much of their spare time at the nearby Keystone Yacht Club, where they kept a fishing boat. Neighbors say they began spending more and more time at the club after becoming pariahs on Horton Road. The Golubs haven't moved from the street, they say, because the house is about all they have left. They can't afford to sell.
Mrs. Golub, who is 56 and does clerical work in a Valley Stream office, is a short woman with a raspy, smoker's voice and jangly, nervous movements. She said her husband, who is 66 and runs a Getty service station in nearby Hewlett, has a heart condition worsened by stress. She will not say much more. "It is true that not just one family was affected by what happened," she said. "Publicity just makes it worse. So while we're still here, we'd rather not talk. Hopefully, one day when we're able, we'll leave."
Neither family wants to admit that they are locked in a battle of wills. The Tinyeses refuse to move because they believe that justice was only partly served in the case; they are hoping one day to see it through. They, and many others, remain convinced that Robert Golub, then 21, did not commit the murder alone. They think he had an accomplice: Robert's brother, John J., who was 14 then and who the police say was with friends in another part of the Golub house at the time of Kelly's death.
The Golubs have held tight to a position diametrically opposed to the Tinyeses': neither son had anything to do with the murder. Robert was framed, they say. He was given an inadequate defense in a trial marked by scant circumstantial evidence, frequent prejudicial outbursts from the Tinyeses, sensational media coverage and a jury swept away by the emotion of it all. John J., they claim, has been viciously maligned, his life ruined by innuendo. He was driven out of Horton Road, where he has not been seen since Thanksgiving 1989, and forced to use aliases to avoid harassment from people in the neighborhood. (Speaking for him, Mrs. Golub said that John J., who has never publicly discussed the murder since the day after, when he waved to reporters from his bedroom window and said he didn't do it, was "definitely not" interested in being interviewed now.)
The saga of Horton Road has just about exhausted the patience of the Nassau County Police Department. What so many in the neighborhood call a murder mystery, the police call a closed case. At his desk in police headquarters in Mineola, Sgt. Robert Edwards, who commanded the Tinyes case, sighed a long, deep sigh before he began what has become a frequent defense of the investigation.
"The facts, he said, "don't bear out the theories. We know the Tinyeses think John J. had something to do with the crime. We don't have a single shred of evidence to support that, and you can quote me on that. There was nothing tying John J. to the crime. There was evidence tying Robert to the crime. Blood evidence, a bite mark, a print. And he was the only one in the house who had the time to commit the crime."
Kelly Tinyes was last seen entering the Golub home at about 3:15 p.m. on March 3, 1989, after receiving a phone call from someone in that house. As far as anyone knew, she had never been there before. Her 8-year-old brother, for whom she was baby-sitting, had answered the phone and said the caller identified himself as "John." Both Robert and John J. denied making the call.
Four people were in the Golub house at the time Kelly entered: Robert, an unemployed bodybuilder; John J., a freshman at Hewlett High School, and two of John J.'s friends. Both friends passed lie detector tests ("with flying colors," Sergeant Edwards said), supporting their contention that they never saw Kelly. They described how they and John J. smoked pot together in a spare bedroom, had a snack in the kitchen and then left to go play basketball at about 3:45 p.m. John J., according to the boys, left them only a few times, to turn up the stereo in another room.
Everyone in the Golub house at the time Kelly entered, the police said, was a suspect at the beginning of the investigation. "We've been through this a hundred times," Sergeant Edwards said. "We've even had the Tinyeses come in and speak to the Chief." (The lead detectives in the case, Richard Wells and George Pierce, both retired, as well as the Nassau County District Attorney, Denis Dillon, declined to be interviewed.)
But it is impossible to talk to people on Horton Road without hearing the stories suggesting there is more to Kelly's death than the police will say.
Jaclyn DeLuca, 15, is haunted by her belief, widely known on Horton Road, that as a 6-year-old she watched Kelly being assaulted in the Golub basement through a jalousied window. She believes she saw more than one person doing it, perhaps even more than two.
Plagued by insomnia and depression, she has been in therapy since shortly after the murder. "I looked in and I saw things going on," she said, standing with her mother, grandmother and 17-year-old sister in front of her house, across from the Tinyeses', after Kelly's birthday ceremony. "I know what I saw."
Laura Panarelli, Jaclyn's grandmother, remembers Jaclyn coming home the afternoon of the murder and seeming distressed by something she had seen. "This was before we knew Kelly was missing," she said. "We didn't know what she was talking about."
Two days later, the police interviewed Jaclyn. Her mother, Pam, a close friend of the Tinyeses, said that while the police later discredited her account, they believed Jaclyn at first. "She told them things that blew them away," she said. "She said Kelly's hair was being pulled out. They had her draw pictures of the murder room and the cuts on Kelly's body. She knew things."
The police ultimately discounted Jaclyn's story as the product of a young child's imagination. They claim that her story was unpersuasive, and that other children contradicted her account of what she was doing that afternoon.
"The police are liars," Pam DeLuca said.
Jaclyn nodded solemnly. "They're all liars."
The DeLucas were among several families compelled to turn to long-term therapy to help their children cope with the murder. They include the Callahans, who have lived next door to the Golubs for 31 years. Carole Callahan said that her daughter Donna, 12 years old when Kelly was murdered, has spent years trying to overcome her shock and guilt over the crime.
Donna Callahan, along with Jimmy Walsh, a 6-year-old who lived two doors down, watched as Kelly entered the Golubs' house the afternoon she disappeared. Five minutes later, when Richie Tinyes came outside looking for his sister, Donna told him that Kelly was in the Golubs' house. Richie and Jimmy, who told the police he saw John J. open the door for Kelly, knocked repeatedly, but there was no answer. (Sergeant Edwards said Jimmy Walsh was "very young," and thus could have been mistaken about who let Kelly in.)
The police conducted a search of the Golub house the next day, where the body was found around noon. For years, Donna was racked with guilt for sitting on her stoop yards from the murder scene and being unable to help Kelly. "For a long time afterward, she wouldn't speak at all," Mrs. Callahan said. "We had to keep the blinds on the side of the house that faced the Golub house closed. She wouldn't go upstairs. We wanted to move, but she didn't want to, and her therapist said it would be better if we didn't."
It has been a while since the police have had to mediate a fight between the Tinyeses and Golubs. For four years, the two families were fighting each other's charges of harassment and menacing in court. But the last run-in between the two families was more than a year ago, when John J. Golub was arrested in Hicksville on drug charges. The Tinyeses went to his arraignment in Hempstead. Not a word was exchanged between the two families, but afterward, John Golub Sr. blamed the persecution on Horton Road for driving his son to drugs.
The Tinyeses live with the idea that someday they could perhaps get the case reopened. "We try to lead normal lives," Mr. Tinyes said, showing off his son's stock-car race trophies in his office. "But it doesn't make the pain go away."
"It's not getting any easier," Mrs. Tinyes said. "If anything, it's getting worse."
A copy of their daughter's official police file, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, is dogeared from readings. For years, they've been looking for some detail that will convince authorities to reopen the case.
Mr. Tinyes held up his daughter's autopsy report. "This could be a key," he said. Kelly was a big girl, five-nine and an athletic 120 pounds, and would have fought her attacker, he said. "Yet she had no defensive wounds. In an attack that lasted 20 to 30 minutes, how could that be?" He suggested that that could help prove someone was holding her while the other beat and slashed her.
But two experts consulted to examine the autopsy report for this article, Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City Medical Examiner, and Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, each said that the report does not provide any proof that two people committed the grisly crime.
"The bottom line is you can't tell," Dr. Baden said. "She had many, many wounds. Some of them could have been defensive."
On Horton Road, it is becoming clear that the questions about how -- and why -- Kelly Tinyes was lured into the Golub house and killed may never be answered. "The only way is for Robert Golub to talk," said Pam DeLuca.
He never has. From the time the body was found, he has sworn his innocence. After the trial, he expressed frustration that he had followed his court-appointed lawyer's advice not to take the stand. At his sentencing, he gave a jumbled, barely audible statement. He made cryptic remarks suggesting that someone from the Golub home made the call, but that it wasn't he. "Who called Kelly up on March 3 from our home?" he said. "Who met Kelly in our home? Who knew her birthday was the next day?"
Behind the massive stone walls of Attica Correctional Facility, where he is serving 25 years to life, Robert Golub has little to add.
"I don't see the point," he said during a brief and awkward interview. Small and soft-spoken, he no longer looks like the bewildered, baby-faced bodybuilder whom people saw at his trial. At 30, he wears his hair combed back, with a neatly trimmed beard and wire-rimmed glasses.
His appeal denied, his request for a transfer to a prison closer to home postponed, he spends his days working in the kitchen and his evenings reading and working out.
He hasn't seen his parents in more than a year, his sister, who is married, in three or four years, and his brother in "the whole time" he has been in prison, he said. For his parents and sister, he said, the drive from Long Island to this forlorn patch of upstate New York -- about seven hours each way -- is too long to make frequent trips. As for his brother, he said, "We don't really get along."
"I'm not really comfortable talking about this," he said. He tapped his fingers on the scarred little square table in the visiting room, politely waiting to be dismissed from his visit, clearly anxious to go back to the relative comfort of his cell.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dannel Malloy;
Stamford Offers Prekindergarten at Age 4

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
AS Mayor Dannel Malloy of Stamford sat through the lengthy meetings of the School Improvement Panel at the State Capitol he had an idea. Listening to the data about the importance of early education, he decided to create an opportunity for all 4-year-olds in Stamford to attend prekindergarten. By September, 360 children will be enrolled in the new school readiness program. Every 4-year-old child who lives in Stamford will be eligible, with fees charged on a sliding scale from $5 to $135 a week. According to the Mayor, Stamford will be the first city in the nation to offer a prekindergarten program to all its children. "What we want to do is guarantee all 4-year-old children in the City of Stamford a prekindergarten experience regardless of their financial circumstances," Mr. Malloy said. "It's the single largest step we can take to resolve disparity with other towns."
Stamford is a diverse city where the extremes of wealth and poverty co-exist. Stamford, which has many immigrants, has schools reporting 41 languages spoken by students. "Primarily for socio-economic reasons some of our children start at a lower level than other children and we want to address that," Mr. Malloy said. 
 The Mayor pointed out that in Connecticut the law does not require school attendance until the age of 7,
Mr. Malloy recently discussed school readiness in an interview. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Do you think that the preschool experience will have long lasting results?
A. We are cognizant of all the scientific research that the mind develops at a much quicker pace than once thought. The early development of the human brain is extremely important for setting the table, if you will, for potential future accomplishment.
If you wait until age 5 you are missing a huge opportunity to impact and to grow people's minds. In essence what I am trying to do is start kindergarten at age 4. For the time being we are looking at a combination of public and private providers with the private providers filling the gap for people who can't afford it. I would not be surprised if 10, 15 years from now school starts at age 4. I hope it does.
Q. What kind of numbers are we talking about?
A. We estimate there are 1,200 to 1,350 4-year-olds in the city. We are planning for 360 children full time to start.
We understand that some parents want a full-year program because it has a work component, or welfare to work. Some parents will only want a school year and some parents will want a part-time program. We'll design a program to accommodate those interests.
We'll come to understand better over the first year of operation how many slots will be devoted to part time versus full time. We do have more capacity in a number of buildings. We'll be able to meet the needs as we identify them.
We've estimated that 450 children will come to school in September without a prekindergarten experience. It's very bad for those children to not have that experience. It is also very difficult for the children in the class who have had the preschool experience. The teacher has to spend a disproportionate amount of time on covering ground that otherwise would be covered in a prekindergarten experience.
Middle class families pay for private providers. They are ready to go. They are ready to hit the ground running but they are slowed by the one third of the class who aren't ready. So this kind of program has a positive impact for those children who otherwise wouldn't have the access to prekindergarten and it is also very important to children who do have but would otherwise be held back.
Q. What about funding and organization?
A. The state will help us operate this program with two and half million dollars next year. We've also set up a very unique way of running this program. It is a partnership between the city itself, the Board of Education and the Child Care Center of Stamford, a private provider. The private provider will really be running the program. The Stamford Board of Education will supply eight master teachers who will be supervising the program. Otherwise, the private provider will be the operator.
Special education has been one focus of what were trying to do to make sure that special education children are thought about first and foremost in this context.
Q. Which children are you expecting to enroll?
A. We want a mix of children so the program has a certain quality, flavor, mix. Really we are trying to address the needs of children who otherwise would not find themselves a seat elsewhere. Either they can't afford it or the parents may not know enough to enroll their children in prekindergarten.
We also have some cultural divides to overcome. We found that Central Americans and Hispanics are somewhat reluctant to send their children off to school as early as Anglo-Americans born in this country. There are some cultural differences. We'll chip away at that over the next few years. We expect racial and economic diversity in the prekindergarten classes.
Q. What will the children learn?
A. First of all, they don't learn eight hours a day. We've come to understand that there's an educational need in a portion of each day but that much of the full day activities are socialization and child care.
On the other hand some portion of each day should be devoted to learning, so our program is designed to accommodate that. They will have art and drawing, their letters, the precursors to kindergarten that exist in every prekindergarten. My children learned colors, shapes, letters. They were exposed to gymnastics and music and dance. Those are the types of things that you want to make sure children are exposed to.
What we're doing is building children's potential for learning later in life. We are making those connections for them at a stage where their minds can evolve to a higher degree than if those connections are made later in life.
There's a difference between expanding someone's potential and expanding their actual performance. Performance may measure other things, whether one's culture supports education, other socio-economic factors. Some of those factors will be overcome later in life.
If you have not expanded that person's mind, if you've not created a better brain at a younger age, then their performance potential becomes limited. I think it's important to measure performance in grades. I think that scientific evidence is so clear that the mind's development needs to take place early and if it doesn't it's never going to. So you're missing opportunities. That's really what this is about.
Q. As Mayor why are you so concerned with educational matters?
A. Historically, mayors have not been involved in education. It is only a recent phenomenon over the last few years. I'm an advocate of mayors becoming more involved in education systems and improving education.
We created a very destructive model in the United States, this separation of education government from general government. Perhaps it made sense at one period in time, maybe it was a protection against cronyism or political payoffs. I don't know the exact history. But what has happened is its turned the system on its head.
Here in Stamford I want the city to maintain school buildings and provide custodial and maintenance operations for it. To put it in perspective. I have 10 engineers working for me in maintaining infrastructure. The Board of Education has none and yet they are maintaining 18 buildings that represent the bulk of our capital, with the exception of roads and sidewalks.
I think that looking at this divide between general government and education I see that American education had a period of time when it was not as successful as it should have been. The American people tolerated that because the system was not set up to hold anyone accountable. That's very different from general city government.
There's been a tremendous amount of pressure on general city government throughout the United States to reform and address modernization to a higher degree than has been applied to education. I would like to help the educational systems accommodate that change.
Q. Do you think schools should be funded in a different way?
A. Our reliance in the Northeast on property taxes to fund education is a bad system. Reliance on property taxes is one of the things that's killed some cities in the United States. In Connecticut I think Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford and Waterbury were damaged by the reliance on property taxes. It caused the taxes to rise in those communities beyond the ability of the middle class to afford thus driving the middle class out.
In Stamford, for instance, 7 percent of our money comes from state and Federal government. We're paying 93 percent, probably a higher percentage than any other city in the United States. Our source of funds is property tax and personal property tax.
New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport rely on other systems. The irony is that if the state had contributed historically to those systems at levels that they are now contributing, the cities would be much more successful today. So you have killed the golden goose, the goose that provided the jobs, the culture and education. Now the burden of supporting them is much greater.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Downtown;
At the World Trade Center, Things Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE leases were signed, one after another. Bankers Trust took 274,000 square feet, Aon Risk Services 396,000, Oppenheimer Funds 181,000, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield 461,000 and, finally, J&H Marsh & McLennan committed to 361,000 square feet earlier this month.
All the space is at one building complex, the World Trade Center, whose twin 110-story towers and other buildings have 10.5 million square feet of office space and an additional 300,000 square feet of retail space. 
 As the market for office space in midtown has tightened and rental rates increased, tenants have been looking to downtown as a cheaper alternative. Over the last year, those seeking large blocks of space have been finding them at the trade center, which had many vacancies as a result of the 1993 terrorist bombing and the shrinkage of the financial industry in the early part of the decade.
"In January 1997 we had about an 80 percent occupancy rate," said Cherrie Nanninga, director of real estate for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the complex. Twenty percent of 10.5 million square feet of space is 2.1 million, which would be a substantial building by itself.
But as a result of the last year's work, Ms. Nanninga, said the complex is over 90 percent occupied and expects to it reach the 95 percent mark by the end of the year. That, she said, would be about as full as the center is likely to get, since there is almost always someone moving in or out. "Ninety-seven percent occupancy would be full," said Ms. Nanninga, whose name is pronounced NAN-in-gay.
In all, the trade center reached agreements to lease 2.2 million square feet of office space in 1997, or almost a quarter of the 9.6 million square feet leased in the downtown district.
Real estate executives and brokers say the trade center has benefited from both the general resurgence of the downtown office market -- which was so depressed just a few years ago that the city offered a financial incentive program to lure prospective tenants -- and the Port Authority's newfound willingness to be more flexible than in the past.
Mary Ann Tighe, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, who helped broker many of the recent deals at the center, said Port Authority officials had become less bureaucratic and more entrepreneurial in recent years. "Now they are willing to give us things that could not have been discussed in the past," she said.
She said the deal with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield was an example of that new thinking. "Empire always had a subsidized cafeteria for its employees, which is very expensive," she said. "You have the cost of the real estate, plus the manpower and the subsidy and the economics were not working within the confines of the Port's standard proposal for leasing the space.."
To get around the problem, Port Authority officials agreed to expand the cafeteria it already had in the complex for its own employees to accommodate those from Empire. "That is showing immense flexibility for a government agency," Ms. Tighe said. "They were going to renovate it anyway, so adding the capacity was not that big a deal."
Bradley Gerla, a downtown specialist for Jones Lang Wootton, agreed that there was a new attitude at the Port, as the authority is usually called. "They have streamlined the entire process," he said. "I'm doing a deal for 10,000 square feet that would have been impossible five or six years ago. By the time they got finished negotiating terms, the tenant would have signed someplace else."
THE cafeteria expansion is just a small part of the renovations going on at the trade center, where all 240 elevators and 70 escalators will be modernized with new controls for better service and shorter waiting times. The Port Authority has already spent $325 million on the 25-year-old center and expects to spend $400 million more before the upgrade is finished.
The improvements include added communications capacity and increased electrical capacity to power the personal computers and fax machines that were laboratory projects when the trade center was designed.
Mindful that the bombing knocked out power to the buildings, redundant sources of power have been added, including a cable through the PATH tube to New Jersey in the building in case the power flow in New York somehow fails.
Security overall has been tightened, with guards checking employee passes at the elevators. There is still underground parking, but it is available only to tenants who have an electronic card to open the garage door.
Port officials have been upgrading the 300,000 square feet of retail space in the center, to make it more of a destination for shoppers, not just a service for tenants. A long-closed Alexander's is being converted into a Marche, a European-style market/restaurant; a Warner Brothers Studio Store has been installed in the underground plaza that unites the complex, and a Banana Republic store is going into a space vacated after to the merger of Chase and Chemical banks.
The center is a natural retail destination, Ms. Nanninga said. "We have 1.8 million visitors to our observation deck a year," she said. In addition, largely because of the conversion of nearby downtown office buildings to residences, there are 20,000 people who now live in lower Manhattan who add to the retail base.
Some brokers say the aggressive leasing campaign and renovation of the center are part of an effort to prepare for sale to a private investor, possibly a real estate investment trust. REIT's typically prefer to buy fully leased properties, so their income is predictable.
The Port Authority has been studying the possibility of a sale, but officials say no decision has been made. "The Port Authority has been doing all this work in leasing and retail to enhance the value of the center," said James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's broker. "They used to be 9 to 5 people, but now they are pushing through things they have never done before. I believe they will test the market at some point, and a REIT like Vornado or Mack-Cali would be logical candidates to buy."
Downtown locations are an alternative for companies unwilling to pay the higher rents of midtown, real estate executives say. "For a B building in midtown you are talking rents in the mid $30's" a square foot annually, said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate. "Downtown, it is more like the mid to upper 20's."
He said the residential conversion program had helped make downtown a more attractive location than in the early 1990's, when the streets were all but deserted on weekends and after business hours. "There are 3,000 to 4,000 residential units and a few new restaurants," he said. "There is a need for more, but the fact is there are people on the street."
As a result of the demand that is shifting from midtown, the vacancy rate in the downtown area has dropped sharply. According to John V. Wheeler, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield, the overall vacancy rate is 12 percent, with Class A space in single digits at 8 percent. The overall vacancy rate compares to 20.2 percent in 1995.
But Michael Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate, said that a word of caution was in order when thinking about the trade center and the downtown office market. "A lot of what we are seeing is growth in financial services," he said. "The firms are adding salesmen and staff as the Dow rises. That is very ephemeral absorption, because Wall Street sheds staff and space when the tide turns."
But for now investors appear to believe the good times will last, because they are paying prices unheard of less than a year ago, according to Howard Michael, chairman of the Carlton Group, a real estate investment banking firm.
"The guys who were paying $50 a foot to buy buildings six to nine months ago are paying $110 to $120 a foot now," he said. "Downtown is still the cheapest real estate in Manhattan, and it's the best opportunity for further growth."

It now has more than 90 percent occupancy, she says, adding that she expects 95 percent by year's end. That, she says, is about as full as it is likely to get since there is always an ebb an flow of tenants. (Jack Manning/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: ART;
The Animated Mind Behind the Mannequin

BYLINE: By STEVEN HENRY MADOFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CHARLES RAY is watching. His gaze may be following you from the big photographic self-portrait called "Yes," from 1990, in which his slightly zoned-out eyes (he was on LSD at the time) seem to wander after you. Maybe it is the "Self-Portrait" mannequin of the same year, in which a very stiff Ray likeness wears the artist's favorite sailing outfit (he loves to sail his 40-foot fiberglass sloop out of his home port in Oxnard, Calif.), the eyes just a little wall-eyed, following you across the room. Or maybe it is the eyes of one of the eight naked Ray-like figures that stare out from the onanistic proceedings in his most talked-about sculpture, the 1992 "Oh! Charley, Charley, Charley . . ."
But Mr. Ray is definitely watching. What interests him may not be you exactly. In the puzzlelike way that the artist thinks, his interest is perhaps more about the idea of what it is like to be looking at a piece of art that seems to be looking back, and what that does, not only for the viewer but for the disorienting force of the work. 
 Formal power and psychological power constitute the two elements in the equation of Mr. Ray's quirky art. That math has added up, with the artist's growing international reputation, a tenured professorship in studio art at U.C.L.A., prices for his sculpture climbing to more than $400,000, and now a retrospective of his sculpture, photographic and film works that opens Thursday and remains on view until Aug. 30 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
It is slightly disconcerting to meet Mr. Ray in front of the peeling one-story white house that he shares with the artist Jennifer Pastor in the working-class Marvista section of Los Angeles. To a stranger he looks like one of his self-portrait mannequins, only animate. But then "disconcerting" is a strategic element in his repertory. Slender, with tousled brown hair, his shirt untucked, his jeans wanting a few more fly buttons buttoned, Mr. Ray, 45, pushes past a bramble of bougainvillea that fairly blocks his front door and strides through to the sparsely furnished living room.
Sitting at a simple table, staring through thick tortoise-shell glasses, he says: "The thing about my work is that I try to keep it a little distant, a little stiff, in a sense, so that it doesn't give off too much specific meaning. Like with the mannequins, I wanted to make something sort of abstract but also real. Something almost invisible. So I thought if I lopped off the head of a mannequin and put a kind of generalized copy of my own on, the effect would oscillate between abstract and real, to startle, to get into your head.
"You know, I like the equation of the work to go both ways. Like in 'Oh! Charley, Charley, Charley . . . ,' it looks like I'm really vulnerable, revealing everything, but in the end I reveal nothing. The figures of me are so self-involved that it's a closed system, no expression, almost sad rather than erotic. On one level, I was dealing with the fear of AIDS, contamination -- the subjects of the day.
"But what I was thinking about was Rodin's 'Burghers of Calais,' the forms, the figures turning in space, wondering how do you make a figurative group sculpture today? It's not like I could do the City Council of L.A. The repetitiveness of my identity was a way to tie the piece together. The kinkiness of the sex was another way to do that with subject matter, with a patina of sensationalism."
That patina of the sensational and theatrical has been carefully applied by Mr. Ray since his student days at the University of Iowa and Rutgers University, where he first married performance art to a string of movements: minimalism, process art, conceptualism. He photographed himself in a wall-length series of deadpan pictures in which he dons all the clothes he owns, piece by piece. He folded himself over a plank leaning against his studio wall, playing up the threat of Richard Serra's propped sculptures of the time, but with a sense of the body as sculpture that was reminiscent of Bruce Nauman's art.
In Mr. Ray's work of the late 70's and into the 80's, he lay unclothed and seemingly squashed under metal slabs; shoved himself inside minimalist metal boxes, his arms and legs protruding; stood naked against a wall, with his head stuck through a shelf to seem disconcertingly -- in the spirit of the mannequins to come -- like another still-life object.
From the 80's on, Mr. Ray's art has only pushed harder at his practice of weird displacement and sculptural economy, with an increasingly trippy sense of what a little disorientation can do.
Consider "Ink Box" of 1986, in which a black minimalist cube brimming with ink tricks viewers into thinking its top is solid. (Viewers beware.) Or "Rotating Circle," from 1988, which is installed flush in a gallery wall and spins so fast that it seems to be still. (The motor's high-pitched sound is the giveaway.) Or "Tabletop," from the same year, whose six nondescript objects are rotated so slowly by hidden motors that the viewer who looks away and then back will find everything moved just enough to induce instant head scratching. Or Mr. Ray's "Firetruck," done for the 1993 Whitney Biennial: a toy red hook-and-ladder blown up spectacularly to life size, double parked in front of the museum to bring on double takes.
And then there is last year's "Unpainted Sculpture," a fatally wrecked Pontiac Grand Am whose every part was recast in fiberglass, put back together and painted a soft gray. As Richard Flood, chief curator of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the institution that bought the work, says: "It's all about disaster, and yet it looks like Bernini's 'Ecstasy of St. Teresa,' with all this shattered material like luxurious folds of cloth; so Baroque and so modern; so full of death and yet so abstract, the way the gray turns detail into a kind of haze. It almost floats." Trippy indeed.
FOR Mr. Ray, formalism and conceptualism, interior and exterior, physical and mental have become fluid properties. What goes on in the work is what Paul Schimmel, chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the organizer of Mr. Ray's traveling retrospective, calls "Charley sculpting his own psyche." Then he puts Mr. Ray into context.
"When you think about the prominent art of the late 80's and the 90's -- the work of Jeff Koons, Bob Gober, Damien Hirst, Katarina Fritsch, of Charley -- you see that it's a generation investigating their psyches and projecting them onto a broader cultural landscape. They do it through work that is disorienting, dreamlike and open-ended. There is a kind of end-of-the-century symbolism about it, where the artists are asking, as Gauguin did 100 years ago in the title of a painting, 'Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?' "
For three hours Mr. Ray has been explaining his work, getting up to point out titles from his living-room bookshelves -- "The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections," "What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason," "Shapes, Space and Symmetry." He's awkward and intent, encouraging, his voice emphatic, then trailing off. He talks about his love of science's disinterested cool in observing the world. He speaks of his childhood in Chicago, and of the brutality and discipline of his high school years at Marmion Military School, in Aurora, Ill. If Mr. Schimmel is right, then how does all this disorienting, distant, funny, disturbing art reflect the artist's psyche?
Looking around for a while, hesitating, starting, then starting again, Mr. Ray isn't sure what to say. "It's so slippery, what a work is really about, I don't want to sound like an idiot. You know, the sensational part, shocking Mom and Dad, that's a real boring little issue. It's easy. I use the topical like engineers use the sun's gravity to whip a space probe further into space with the extra momentum. That allows me to get the viewer in, but what's hard is to get the work to sit right, to get the syntax of a piece exactly, as Anthony Caro would say. It's a squishy, vibrant equation -- something where all the parts intersect perfectly, something that breathes psychologically."
"In all of it," Mr. Ray says, "I'm dealing with myself in relation to the institutions that define me. You know, my mother and father, school, the Catholic Church -- so that I don't accept those negative things that label me, don't follow those arrows into myself. That distance in my work, I suppose you could say it's to stay out on the porch instead of going into the house, psychologically."
He laughs uncomfortably and gets up. On the way to the door, he points out another book, one he admires for its subversiveness. Among all of his science and math books, it's by another doctor, Dr. Seuss. Its title is "Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!"

HEADLINE: Classical Radio Plays Only To Sweet Tooths

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHIFF; David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in Portland, Ore.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
CLASSICAL-MUSIC radio stations in the United States were once chock-full of nutty professors, eccentrics whose quirky opinions served to educate and inspire generations of listeners. In the 1950's and 60's in New York, for example, the obsessive Fleetwood, on WNCN, might play a selection four times in a row if he liked, and the outrageous Seymour DeKoven, on WFUV, proselytized fanatically for "barococo" music. Far more than purveyors of musical appreciation, they were models of musical devotion.
Today there are just a few strong personalities left on the air, like the durable and majestically ponderous Robert J. Lurtsema on WGBH in Boston, and their futures are imperiled by a bland format that has become the norm on commercial and public stations alike. (Mr. Lurtsema himself has been cut back to weekend mornings.) Station managers justify the new, smooth approach as "welcoming," but it is hard to imagine how it could ever instill a passionate concern for music in a new generation. 
 Across the country, station managers and programmers seem to believe that their audiences want a continuous and homogeneous flow of background music, interrupted as little as possible by announcements, let alone idiosyncratic bursts of opinion. Shows like Jim Svejda's "Record Shelf" and Peter Schickele's "Schickele Mix," both syndicated by Public Radio International, and "Performance Today," produced by National Public Radio, find themselves caught between, on one hand, a news and information culture with little interest in classical music and, on the other, classical-station executives for whom "education" has become a dirty word.
"The educational approach only leads to the graveyard," said Fred Child, the music director of WNYC in New York. But classical stations like WNCN and KFAC in Los Angeles have died in other ways, pursuing "lite" or crossover formats.
Station executives base their formats as much on the evolving function of radio as on musical concerns. Many people, they claim, listen only when in cars, and others leave a radio on as background music in the office. Choosing a specific program and listening to it from beginning to end -- "foreground listening," as those in the business call it -- is rare, and near-universal wisdom in the field holds that to demand concentrated attention is to risk alienating listeners.
Oddly, though, these same people who are said to listen without intention seem to care a great deal about their classical stations. Any change in format provokes angry protests and letters to the editor. Such outbursts, station executives argue, say more about demographics than about musical taste.
The loyalty classical-music lovers show to their stations, executives suggest, may be little different from that displayed by followers of political talk-show hosts or on-the-air psychologists. The station becomes an emblem of the listener's identity, and the identity of classical-radio listeners is distinctive. They are well educated, wealthy and, above all, older than other listening groups. The audience for "Performance Today," for example, averages about 50: not ancient but a decade older than the one that tunes in to "All Things Considered," also on NPR. No wonder station managers often describe their approaches to programming with words suited to a retirement community.
IN recent conversations with station directors and music programmers, two buzzwords kept recurring: "shelter" and "gateway." Suzanne White, the general manager of KBPS here in Portland, said that her listeners, 52 years old on average, were seeking a "haven of sanity"; Mark Kausch, the manager of music programming for Public Radio International, the main syndicator of classical programming in the country, said that listeners wanted a "warm blanket." When the radio blares with the political bile of Rush Limbaugh, the adolescent stunts of Don Imus and Howard Stern, and the quick psychological fixes of Dr. Laura Schlessinger, let alone pop music aimed at 12-year-olds and golden-oldies from the 80's for aging Gen-X-ers, a peaceful harbor of classical music certainly has its attractions for people over, say, 45, and the more peaceful the better.
But first you have to get listeners into the safety zone. The term "gateway" stems from the notion that as people get older, there is less radio programming addressed to them, so they may drift toward a classical station. This is the fringe audience. These listeners will stay, it is said, only if they are made to feel welcome.
"You can't be snooty" several station directors insisted, as if repeating a mantra. Mr. Child, of WNYC, formerly the municipal station in New York but now run by a foundation, demands that announcers be "smart and sassy and know their stuff," and not to be didactic, he said. "You don't have to announce the key and opus number when you play Beethoven's Fifth." Mr. Child proudly noted that WNYC's 900,000 listeners were, on average, eight years younger than the audience for its lone remaining commercial rival, WQXR, which is owned by The New York Times.
The metaphor of the safe haven and the desire to be "welcoming" have had powerful effects on programming. The station's identity must be kept consistent throughout the day, so the desired demilitarized zone will appear no matter when a listener turns on the set. Chat must be kept to a minimum: just a smoothly intoned mention of composer, title and performers between selections. And the selections themselves must never rock the boat. Contemporary music -- apart from movie music and, for some reason, works of Alan Hovhaness -- is almost universally banned from play, though it may survive if it pops up in concerts recorded live. Second-string composers like Telemann, Boccherini and Glazunov are played as often as the three B's.
Just as programmers express horror at the thought of educating the fringe audience, they tend to dismiss the idea of reaching out to the young. "We feel that the audience will come to us as they get older," said Ms. White, of Portland. This strategy may seem complacent, but with baby-boomers swelling the ranks of the elderly and living for decades past the average classical listening age of 50, passive receptivity and a welcoming tone may be all that is needed to double or triple the classical audience.
Mr. Kausch, of Public Radio International in Minneapolis, said that the defensive stance of classical stations is a result of the evaporation of support from the National Endowment for the Arts and the shift by many NPR stations, like WBUR in Boston, to an all-news format. Both KBPS and WNYC, as stand-alone public stations, must pay their own way. In many markets, the desire for an impersonal round-the-clock "haven" and economic pressures have led stations to use programming services offered by PRI (Classical 24) and WFMT in Chicago (Beethoven Service) to fill their schedules without having to staff the station during the night and on weekends.
Although these services usually provide as respectable a mix of less familiar pieces and well-known classics (though little opera or 20th-century music) as is heard on most in-house shows, their specific musical offerings rarely appear in station program guides or newspaper listings. These services also seem indifferent to performers. They play recent releases or older recordings by familiar or obscure players with no clear reasons given for the choice.
This haphazard approach, though, serves the desire for a continuous flow of classic music on demand. Listeners caught in traffic or fighting insomnia, industry wisdom suggests, just want to be able to hear some classical music: almost any will do. Like the dairy product "soft-serve," the music flows out in easily digestible form even if you are not quite sure of its ingredients.
On a recent morning, I realized just how much I had come to expect only "smooth" classics on the air. After dropping my daughter off at school, I switched the radio from the local Howard Stern wannabe back to KBPS. A noisy torrent of orchestral colors flooded the car. After a few seconds I realized that it was Sibelius, the suitably stormy music for "The Tempest": not exactly new music but a nice jolt of musical energy. When it abated, the announcer quickly apologized for playing such music during the "morning rush" and promised a swift reversion to Baroque music. A Bach concerto soon followed: smooth Bach.
At the same time that stations plan formats to avoid alienating fringe listeners, they know that their strongest supporters are the hard-core music lovers. Most stations provide for the essential needs of these listeners: Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and live recordings of orchestral concerts. These programs are typically the most interesting ones on a station, the only time you might encounter Benjamin Britten's "Peter Grimes" or John Adams's "Harmonium."
But these features usually appear in fixed time slots, like Saturday afternoon or 10 at night, when the fringe listeners are otherwise engaged. And the kind of quirky, personal programming that once turned listeners into devoted advocates is hard to find. Shows that could ignite a lifelong passion for music, like "The Record Shelf," "Schickele Mix" and "Performance Today," often find themselves at odds with their surroundings.
Mr. Svejda, of "The Record Shelf," and Mr. Schickele are the two great eccentrics on classical-music radio today. Mr. Svejda, whose show is produced by KUSC in Los Angeles, is perhaps best known for his use, or overuse, of dramatic pauses. You may learn the real subject of a show only several minutes in, after being teased and tantalized by musical excerpts and Mr. Svejda's portentously dropped hints. Still, no one on the air treats both composers and performers with such personal devotion or has such a fine ear for differences in inflections and interpretations. His show on the legendary Hollywood String Quartet sent me running to my local record store only to find that several speedier Svejda listeners had beaten me to the bin.
If you tune in to your classical station and hear a bagpipe band playing "Send in the Clowns" you have probably happened on "Schickele Mix." Mr. Schickele's radio persona seems a distant but equally deranged relation to his more familiar incarnation as P. D. Q. Bach, spawned by a freak collision of musicology and vaudeville. The show, designed for people with a lively interest in music, usually pursues a single musical concept, like the contrapuntal device of the ground bass or the rhythmic phenomenon known as hemiola, and tracks it down in an odd assortment of musical examples that may jump from Haydn to Bulgarian folk singing to heavy metal.
Although "Schickele Mix" is often more technical in its musical discussion than anything else on the radio, its mood is a throwback to classic radio comedy. Mr. Schickele, who was born in 1935, grew up in Fargo, N.D., where WDAY, like many other stations of the time, had a full-time staff of professional musicians. "Peggy Lee got her start on the station," he said. Mr. Schickele and his brother went to the studio before school to hear the musicians, who would play big-band swing during one program, switch to polkas in the next, then turn to country and western.
BUT diversity, which may be a plus in academic and political circles, gets Mr. Schickele into trouble on radio stations that are sensitive to image and format. In addition to worrying that potential listeners may not recognize their stations, managers fault the show for its thematic approach. "If you don't tune in at the beginning you don't know what he is talking about," Ms. White, of Portland, complained.
"Schickele Mix" does demand "foreground listening." Each show has a carefully constructed shape, for all the appearance of improvisation. Yet in the larger classical mix, that strength becomes a weakness. And despite its comic mayhem the show raises the specter of the E-word, education. Mr. Schickele has found that the show succeeds best when it is sold as an informational program rather than a musical one, and over the years he has increased the amount of talk and shortened musical examples.
"Performance Today," NPR's main musical offering, is similarly caught between musical and informational formats. It comes on between news programs like "All Things Considered" and talk shows like "Fresh Air" or "Talk of the Nation," but it attracts a different audience: notably older, smaller and more female.
In programming philosophy the show seems torn between its desire to attract the younger people who listen to Terry Gross's interviews with Gladys Knight or Mel Brooks and its need to retain its core listeners, many of whom see the show as their one connection to classical music. Benjamin Roe, the senior producer of "Performance Today," said that some of its strongest support comes from rural listeners for whom it functions as a surrogate concert hall. It has cemented its provincial support by broadcasting live recordings of concerts from halls around the country. Regional festivals and ensembles have come to count on the show for national exposure.
The essential element in the programming of "Performance Today" is live performance. Even though the show often broadcasts performances of standard repertory that can easily be found on CD, the live format offers not only a rush of adrenalin but also the presence of audience applause. In effect, "Performance Today" puts its listeners on the air, a tactic that has earned it a loyal following. Yet the program's strengths in the heartland may have hurt it in larger markets. It is not played in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco or Seattle. In New York and Washington, "Performance Today" follows "All Things Considered" in the evening but has not been able to grab the news audience.
Perhaps responding to pressure from NPR, "Performance Today" has taken a more active role in generating live concerts of an unusual and newsy nature. "We want to make classical music special," Mr. Roe explained. The program presented a live performance of Bach's B minor Mass conducted by Robert Shaw on Easter Sunday in Atlanta, and a benefit concert featuring four maestros, Pierre Boulez, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Kurt Masur and Seiji Ozawa the next day from Symphony Hall in Boston.
More problematic, at least for the core audience of "Performance Today," the program has strongly endorsed crossover endeavors, presenting concerts by Billy Joel and Paul McCartney. Martin Goldsmith, the show's host, interviewed the pop stars on the show with the same pious tone he accords the Emerson String Quartet, but it is not clear that the audience shared his respect for their symphonic efforts. Mr. Roe, a true believer in crossover, criticizes the siege mentality of stations that stick to the classics but admits that so far, "Performance Today" has had only small success in trying to woo a younger audience.
The average "Performance Today" listener -- to get back to age, as one always does in these discussions -- is 48 to 50, which puts Sir Paul, for one, over the average. Perhaps his arrival as a classical musician, rather than making a case for crossover, just confirms Suzanne White's prediction that the future of classical radio is just a matter of the coming of age. In any case, if Sir Paul ever had the time and inclination to share his enthusiasm for the classics with radio listeners, he might make a most engagingly nutty professor.

A Welcome Truce For Jazz Festivals

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous 

 BODY:
EVER since the Newport Jazz Festival moved to New York in 1972, the idea of a jazz festival in the city has been a sore spot for everybody involved, from the producers to the musicians to the fans. The oldest and best known of these gatherings in New York, George Wein's JVC Jazz Festival, successor to Newport, has traditionally elicited a storm of questions and doubts.
The most obvious question involves the advisability of mounting a festival in a city that is by definition a festival, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The second most obvious one concerns the possibility of putting on a festival in a city that is so utterly urban and opposed, bureaucratically and logistically, to bringing together large groups of people for a festival. Festivals here have always seemed compromised, and one needs only look at other festivals worldwide, whether the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Montreal Jazz Festival or the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy, for a telling contrast. 
 The recent announcement that Michael Dorf, the owner of the Knitting Factory, would open the upstart Texaco Jazz Festival tomorrow, several weeks earlier than usual so that it does not overlap with JVC, was a good sign. Until Mr. Dorf began his What Is Jazz festival, precursor to the Texaco Jazz Festival, in 1988, the only festival game in town was Mr. Wein's JVC Jazz Festival. Ever since, Mr. Wein and Mr. Dorf have been scrapping over bragging rights, and paying customers. Moving the Texaco Jazz Festival can be seen as an attempt to diffuse tensions between Mr. Dorf and Mr. Wein, whose JVC festival opens on June 15.
So the change in schedule comes as a relief. One can now spend the month grazing the best the two festivals can offer without being driven mad by conflicting possibilities. And to create a sense of a festival, Mr. Dorf is setting up a 1,500-seat concert tent by the Hudson River. The schedule change and the additional marketing potential created by the June Is Jazz Month concept, being promoted by Mr. Wein and Mr. Dorf, are further pluses, especially in light of the limited resources that the city spends promoting jazz internationally. Unlike New Orleans, which spends money in pursuit of tourists who are jazz fans, New York's clubs and festivals are virtually on their own with little governmental help or support.
And tourist dollars are extraordinarily important for the health of the club and festival scene in New York, with some clubs claiming that upwards of 90 percent of their business comes from tourists. A full club means that clubs will survive and musicians will be paid, and that, ultimately, is what is crucial to sustaining the music.
Like a reef attracting fish, the two festivals are already having a wider impact on the local music scene. The Cuban pianist Chucho Valdez will be performing a rare two-week stand at the Village Vanguard. The assumption is that he'll do well because of the increased level of tourism during the month. And the saxophonist John Zorn has already set up a festival at Tonic, a Manhattan club, running from June 24 through Aug. 16.
What else can tourists expect to find during the month? They'll find a jazz scene in flux, with the older generation of headliners vanishing and few new ones to replace them. They'll find plenty of promise and plenty of synthesizing going on, from both the musicians associated with the Knitting Factory and those who were once labeled the young mainstream. There's an explosion of activity by musicians who are hitting their 30's and beginning to try new approaches, things that have not yet been tested with time.
And they'll find a jazz scene in New York that probably more now than ever views festivals as mostly irrelevant to jazz musicians, outside of the paycheck. The sad fact is that Mr. Wein's festival no longer has the power or credibility to make stars. And Mr. Dorf's sprawling, bigger-than-ever festival throws so many people together that the concerts become a gray mass of events, with few distinguishing figures. Finally, they'll find that New York, with or without the jazz festivals, is so deep in jazz talent, that almost any conclusion about the state of jazz can be supported by the evidence -- that jazz is dead or that jazz is in better health than it has ever been. Regardless, the festivals will have been responsible for bringing people here, and that, ultimately, is good for the state of the music and its economic health, and for that Mr. Wein and Mr. Dorf deserve thanks.
And for those of us here who have to live with all the festivals' faults, we can only dream of the possibilities. We can imagine better concert programming on the model of Montreal, with its stars playing long stands with a revolving cast of musicians. Or better political support, on the model of Umbria, which turns over to the festival the town of Perugia and all its various concert spaces. We can also imagine audiences that are less narrow-minded, more willing to embrace a broader range of musics and styles. We can imagine turning Central Park into the home of the jazz festivals in the way that New Orleans uses a race track for its festival site, or a city with better concert halls, or a jazz scene with bigger names that can fill the larger spaces. But first things first, and June Is Jazz Month is a good start.

HEADLINE: The View From/New Haven;
The Abused Urban Tree Finally Gets Some Help

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
IN the absence of human activity, 90 percent of Connecticut would be forest. "We have inserted ourselves into this forest ecosystem," says Fred Borman, Connecticut's Urban Forestry Coordinator. "People do not give the trees the attention they deserve."
But some Connecticut communities are paying more attention to their trees, as was evident on a recent Sunday, when volunteers spent the day mapping and assessing trees in the initial outing of the New Haven Street Tree Inventory, which will be used to develop a tree care plan for the city. 
 For many years, the city's tree program has simply reacted to requests and complaints, said Pamela Kressmann of the New Haven Department of Parks, Recreation and Trees. "We just don't know how many street trees there are in New Haven," she said. No database had been created for planning preventive maintenance or for determining where new trees were most needed.
The street tree inventory, which is being conducted by the city in cooperation with the Urban Resources Initiative of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, relies on volunteers said Dr. David Bloniarz, director of the Northeast Center for Urban and Community Forestry. The volunteers participated in an all-day training session in late April.
Street trees, about 10 percent of urban trees, are in the strip between the curb and the sidewalk, in pits within the sidewalk corridor and on traffic islands and median strips. On streets that do not have sidewalks, they are the trees within 10 feet of the curb or pavement edge.
Dr. Bloniarz, who helped conduct the training, explained that street trees need special care because they are under considerable stress. They are planted in a constricted space, pruned away from utility wires into unnatural shapes, struck by vehicles, vandalized, exposed to toxic exhaust and road salt, and damaged by construction such as sidewalk repairs.
Yet trees provide a host of benefits, said Jonathan Wagar, also one of the trainers. In addition to their beauty, trees provide shade, help cool homes, protect against storm water runoff, control erosion, attract wildlife, reduce noise, filter air pollutants, and form windbreaks.
Mr. Borman, the urban forester, said that Middletown, which inventoried 4,000 trees in its downtown business district and surrounding residential areas, determined that the trees were worth more than $4 million.
But most communities do not know the value of their street trees, either in dollars or in esthetics. A decade ago only five Connecticut communities had tree inventories, Mr. Borman said. "Two of those were computerized, two were on index cards, and one was in the head of the tree warden in Stamford." Since then, about 35 communities have conducted partial or complete inventories, including Middletown, Stamford, Hartford, Danbury, Madison and Southbury. Though Greenwich does not have an inventory, it spends more than a million dollars a year on its tree program.
The Washington-based organization, American Forest, determined the optimum tree canopy for a community to be 40 percent of the overhead space. Mr. Borman estimates that most communities in Connecticut range between 15 and 20 percent.
That percentage will be difficult to increase, explains Mr. Borman. A large portion of Connecticut's street trees are between 60 and 90 years old. "For street trees, you're pretty much at the point where the urban forest is going downhill," he says. "Tree removals still outnumber tree plantings two or three to one." In New Haven, the tree division is attempting to turn those numbers around. The division's capital budget, which includes money to buy and plant street trees, increased to $375,000 in fiscal year 1998 from $50,000 in 1997. About 150 street trees were planted in 1997, and plans are in place to plant 600 more in 1998. A new contract soon will go out for bid for 1,000 additional street trees to be planted in the fall of this year as well as next spring.
The New Haven street tree inventory was started in the city's Newhallville neighborhood. Volunteers spread across the neighborhood carrying clipboards, data sheets, block plan maps, measuring tapes and tree identification books.
Each tree was assigned an identification number. Volunteers recorded the location, species, size, condition, and pruning needs of each tree. Species identification when a group first encountered a new species was occasionally time-consuming; then the pace quickened as many subsequent trees turned out to be the same species.
Size was determined using a measuring tape placed around the circumference of each tree at a point four and a half feet above the ground. The condition of each tree was rated as good, fair, poor or dead. Some of the factors indicating that a tree was in less than good condition were the presence of cavities, wounds, dead or dying branches, vertical cracks and insect infestations.
Trees that appeared to pose a threat to public health and safety or to property were flagged. These included dead or dying trees, those with dead limbs that were likely to fall onto the street or sidewalk, and trees blocking the view of traffic signs or signals.
The preliminary findings of this first outing were encouraging, said Leigh Shemitz, executive director of the Urban Resources Initiative. Only 7 percent of the 427 trees catalogued were found to be trees with problems. There was a good mixture of young and old trees, as expected from the neighborhood's history; in the early 1990's, the city did a major planting in the neighborhood to replace the trees struck down by a 1989 tornado.
Among the 15 species identified were several types of oaks and maples, sycamores, honey locusts, Japanese zelkovas and Bradford pears. A given block tended to be planted with one or a few species, with the species varying across the neighborhood.
This is the preferred layout for tree management, said Ms. Shemitz. Species uniformity by block is favored for esthetic reasons, while species diversity in a neighborhood prevents an insect or disease infestation from wiping out the neighborhood's entire forest. Uniformity by block, though, also helps because it is easier to spray an entire block for an infestation than to spray individual trees, one by one.
This summer, the data collected in the Newhallville neighborhood will be entered into a computerized geographic information system for more detailed analysis. And additional volunteers will be trained in the fall, when the inventory continues. It will take several years to complete.

HEADLINE: Public Relations Firm Helps the Disabled

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
IS helping people with disabilities any way to build a public relations company? Susan and Robert Cole think so. When the Coles started Cole Communications, they did it with the understanding that they would devote a third of their practice to working with organizations serving people with disabilities.
"Our interest in people with disabilities goes back years to the time when we became the parents of a daughter who was born deaf," Mr. Cole, a former journalist and banking executive, said. "Debra was 6 months old when we noticed she was not reacting to sounds. And then the testing and the search for help began. At one point I took a year's leave from Chase Manhattan bank, where I was in public relations, to raise funds for the Deafness Research Foundation." He is also the author of "The Practical Handbook of Public Relations" (Prentice Hall). 
 Susan Cole, who formerly worked as a researcher at the Hudson Institute, left her job so she could to teach a class in sign language to her daughter's playmates. "Bob and I and our son, Peter, learned sign," she said. "Debbie was being taught total communication, which is simultaneous speech and sign, but we realized that lack of communication with other children would isolate her, which is why I gave the classes. And the children in the neighborhood were very good about coming. Learning sign was exciting to them."
Eventually, Mrs. Cole went back to work, first as an editor of a research journal for a nonprofit scientific group, then for a bank and finally as managing director and corporate affairs group head for the Ogilvy & Mather public relations agency in Manhattan where her clients included a number of nonprofit organizations. Four years ago, she set up an office in her Bronxville home and started her own public relations firm, Cole Communications.
"Not-for-profits have been an interest of mine, which dates back to my being a researcher for Herman Kahn at the Hudson Institute, which was a major think tank of its day," she said. "Handling not-for-profit accounts is a challenge, especially since most of them operate on a limited public relations budget, yet they need top-quality professional help. I decided to divide my practice in thirds: corporate, nonprofit and organizations serving people with disabilities."
Today the client mix is just that. Last year, when Mrs. Cole landed the American Express Financial Advisers account, Mr. Cole left his job as vice president and manager of external relations for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to become his wife's partner.
True to their plan, the Coles are handling public relations for the C.W.I. Workshops in Glens Falls, N.Y., and the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens in White Plains.
"Both are organizations that train people with disabilities for the work force," Mr. Cole said. "Unfortunately, in most corporate programs that support diversity in the workplace, one minority, the disabled, are still overlooked. Ironically, since the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in the early 90's, the percentage of physically and mentally disabled people with jobs has declined. In 1990 it was a pitiful 35 percent. Now its down to 33 percent. Yet there are 53 million disabled people in this country who should be getting some attention from those who claim to care about broadening entry into the economic mainstream."
As public relations advisers, the Coles hope to make the business community aware of the poor job it has done in tapping the disabled market for employees and customers. "Do good, be smart: that's our message to business," Mr. Cole said. "The disabled make up a huge market. They have $175 billion in disposable income, triple the spending power of teen-agers, yet they are ignored by most of the corporate sector."
Speaking from experience, Mrs. Cole added that the parents of the disabled are also a factor, since they are often the ones who influence buying decisions. "This is a group that knows who are the good guys and the bad guys," she said. "Take television commercials: in our house we always tune into the ABC channel because it provided captions for the deaf, as do all families who have a family member who is deaf. And 66 percent of them buy the products advertised on that station. Another 53 percent look for that product, and 35 percent will switch brands to the product advertised with captions. This is an economically powerful market, and the companies that are aware of it are thriving."
Embassy Suites, for one, Mrs. Cole said. Embassy Suites' Open Doors program -- rooms specially fitted for disabled guests -- earned the company an additional $13 million in gross revenues. "And when McDonald's ran a commercial showing two young people signing, they won a lot of new business," she added.
The Marriott Foundation, based in Washington, is another one of the good guys. "They have a work-bridge program, which offers disabled people on-the-job training and internships," Mr. Cole said. "And 85 percent of those who have gone through the program have received permanent job offers from a variety of companies."
Debra Cole, who is now an adviser to students at Arizona State University in Tempe, was formerly a recruiter for her alma mater Gallaudet University in Washington. "She found that most hotels and motels had a one-size-fits-all philosophy," Mr. Cole said. "Often when she was told that she was being given a room that could accommodate those with disabilities, the only thing she found it had was railings in the bathroom."
The Coles, who have conducted seminars in reaching out to people with disabilities for many businesses, would like to become corporate consultants. "There's still a lot of misinformation about hiring people with disabilities," Mr. Cole said. "Too many people still experience a kind of discomfort when dealing with the issue. The reality is that hiring those with disabilities makes good business sense, and this large group -- one out of six Americans -- makes up a largely untapped source of talent and a largely ignored market for goods and services.
"We have to separate the myths from the realities, the most damaging being that people with disabilities are not normal. The reality is that they are just like everybody else in terms of differing likes, dislikes, personality traits, emotions, strengths and weaknesses."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
REIT's the Big Buyers in a Strong Industrial Market

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
BOLSTERED by a strong economy, New Jersey's industrial sector showed signs of steady improvement over the last year and the forecast is for more of the same through the rest of 1998.
"The market," said David T. Houston, of Colliers Houston & Company, a commercial brokerage in Teaneck, "is on a firm course of consistent, if unspectacular, growth." 
 Leasing activity in the northern and central New Jersey marketplace has whittled down the supply of available space over the last year by 20.5 percent, or some 13 million square feet, to 50 million square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage.
The conversion of buildings to alternative uses like office space or housing also contributed to the decrease. In turn, the vacancy rate dropped to 7 percent from 8.9 percent a year ago.
Sales activity was also strong. The big buyers are real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, including First Industrial Trust of Chicago and Security Capital Industrial Trust of Aurora, Colo. And with more capital flowing into the market other REIT's are expected to follow.
At the same time more speculative and build-to-suit construction, by developers as well as REIT's, is expected to sprout as growing companies continue to consolidate scattered distribution centers under one roof. There will also be new construction to meet needs for modern space, said Stan B. Danzig, a senior director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Houston said there would be "a strong landlord's market for the next 12 months" with "resistance to rent increases in some markets."
Tenants' flight from the old to the new is what developers with sites along such traditional magnets as the New Jersey Turnpike corridor are banking on. At Exit 10 in Edison and around Exit 8A in Cranbury, Monroe and South Brunswick Townships, a crop of big boxy distribution centers, together totaling some 4.2 million square feet are under construction or about to begin and more are planned. Brokers said the competition in the turnpike corridor -- particularly at Exit 8A where many of the new buildings are rising -- will keep the lid on rents, now averaging $4.38 a square foot.
Meanwhile, in the Meadowlands, where land for new development is scarce, rents are creeping up as existing space is filling with companies that want to be close to Manhattan. As a result that market, as has traditionally been the case, is achieving the highest average rental rate -- $5.24 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
"After eight lackluster years the available inventory is now being absorbed," said Emanuel Stern, president of the real estate division of Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus. Of the 12 million square feet of space his company controls in the Meadowlands less than 5 percent is vacant, Mr. Stern said.
Still, renovations and limited new construction are occurring. A case in point is the former 581,000-square-foot New York Times printing plant at in Carlstadt, which was updated by Security Capital Industrial Trust, a REIT that has acquired some 3.5 million square feet of industrial space since it entered the state just over two years ago.
Security Capital reduced the old plant to 489,000 square feet and spent $4 million to renovate it into warehouse space, which was then leased to Allied Beverage Group, said Michael Nachmankin, vice president of the New York metropolitan region for the company, which has offices in Edison. Security Capital will start construction this summer on a 175,000-square-foot speculative distribution center on the rest of the 30-acre site "because the demand is there," Mr. Nachmankin said.
Early this month, Coca-Cola purchased 41 acres of the 50-acre former Englehardt Metals research and development center refinery plant on Delancey Street in Newark, not far from Route 1 & 9 and the New Jersey Turnpike, where it plans to build a bottling and distribution center. The company, which is also seeking to buy the remaining land of the mostly vacant plant site, has not yet determined how big the center will be or when construction will start.
W HILE the focus is on warehouse distribution centers, a smattering of high technology, or flex, buildings are also planned. Next month Kessel Associates of Bergenfield will begin two speculative flex buildings, each with 12,800 square feet, in Sparta in Sussex County. And by this summer First Industrial Trust, which has acquired 3.5 million square feet of industrial space since it entered the state in January 1997, will construct two buildings, each with 40,000 square feet, in Franklin Township in Somerset County.
"In some markets it is more prudent to develop than to buy," said Jan A. Burman, senior regional director of the northeast region for the company, which has offices in Syosset, L.I.
Dan Frankel, a principal at the Woodbridge-based brokerage of Jacobson, Goldfarb & Tanzman who specializes in the industrial market, said the pressure for new construction would continue for the next nine to 12 months and then slow by mid-1999 so the additional space can be absorbed. Though all the major developers and REIT's are optimistic, they are still cautious, he said.
Until then construction continues. At Exit 10 in Edison, Heller Industrial Parks is constructing a three-building, 1.3 million-square-foot speculative warehouse, distribution and office center on 57 acres within the company's 410-acre park at the foot of Mill Road.
"The market is healthy," said Jeffrey J. Milananik, the company's president. "We maintain the philosophy that if we build it and people see it the space will lease."
The first 250,000-square-foot building will be completed by October and the other two larger buildings will come on line by next year. The company, as it has done before, will offer its new space at a below-market price -- an annual rate of about $4 a square foot, said Mr. Milananik.
Elsewhere in Edison Reckson/Morris Industrial Trust, a joint venture of the Morris Companies of Secaucus and Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a REIT based in Melville, L.I., expects to begin construction next month on an 830,000-square-foot distribution center.
The partners also are building an 845,000-square-foot center on Cranbury South River Road in Cranbury, within the Exit 8A region. More than half of the center, to be completed in October, was preleased to two tenants -- Cosmetics Essence, a fragrance company that has taken 485,000 square feet, and Setco, a division of the McCormick Spice Company, which has leased about 120,000 square feet.
T HERE is some possibility of overbuilding at 8A," said Ron Schram, senior vice president at the partnership. "But right now the buildings are coming onto the market in a seesaw fashion so developers are not stepping on each other's feet."
Mr. Nachmankin of Security Capital agrees with that assessment. His company has two buildings, together totaling 616,000 square feet, under way on Cranbury South River Road. They are part of a 150-acre industrial park the company is developing, which eventually will contain 2.2 million square feet of space.
And the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury, with partners, is developing 900,000 square feet of new speculative space in the region in two projects. One is a 260,000-square-foot building now rising at 1 Matrix Drive in Monroe Township. The other, a 650,000-square-foot existing building that the company reduced by 100,000 square feet, renovated and then expanded by 650,000 square feet, is on Docks Corner Road in South Brunswick.
About three-quarters of the 1.2 million-square-foot distribution center has been leased, 268,000 of it to Cooper Tire, which is consolidating its scattered locations into the site. The center is scheduled for completion in July.
"There are many contenders and some pretenders in this location," said Alexander B. Taylor, a partner at Matrix, referring to the competition. "But the fundamental tenets of the market are still strong, and for the time being there are more users than good space available."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Re-using an Industrial Area on Stamford's Fringe

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
FOR three decades, businesses of all sorts have sought out the prestige of tenancy in the imposing office buildings in the heart of this city.
Now, with first-class commercial space extremely tight, Stamford's dormant and underutilized industrial buildings in fringe areas of the city are being salvaged for re-use as nontraditional locations for offices, shops, health clubs, art galleries and even a trading floor. 
 Edward Tonnessen, a broker in the Stamford office of Albert B. Ashforth, commercial realtors, has arranged a deal that ratchets up by several notches the level of use to which old industrial buildings can be converted.
Sempra Energy Trading Corporation, which deals in contracts in oil, natural gas and electric power in the United States, Canada, Mexico and parts of Europe and Asia, has taken a 10-year lease on a 35,000-square-foot warehouse in Stamford's 30-acre Commerce Park, a former industrial complex at the Greenwich border, off Exit 6 of I-95. It will spend $5 million on converting the building into a trading floor, offices, conference rooms, a fitness center, cafeteria and library.
"When rents get very high in prime space there is a niche created for gentrifying these older forsaken locations," said Mr. Tonnessen, "and they take on a higher use. In reverse, when rents drop below $25 a square foot you can't move this kind of space."
Warehouses are easily transformed into trading floors because they possess three essential components: high ceilings, unbroken open space and a heavy-duty supply of power.
"Trading and high-tech companies have tremendous power requirements for satellite dish communications and backup generators," said Mr. Tonnessen. Ceiling heights of 12 to 16 feet allow room for the vast amounts of communications apparatus that must be installed under a false trading floor elevated two feet above the actual floor.
Warehouses are also desirable because they are exempt from zoning restrictions on numbers of employees. Trading companies have more employees per square foot than other businesses. Because the number of employees allowed by zoning is based on the number of parking spaces per square foot of building, most office buildings could only accommodate a portion of the staff needed on a trading floor, said Mr. Tonnessen. The rest, he added, "would have to scramble around the neighborhood for parking spaces."
As a former division of AIG Trading Corporation in Greenwich, where a trading floor was installed with some difficulty in a traditional office building at 1 Greenwich Plaza, Sempra will continue to lease its existing space from AIG until the Stamford renovation is completed at the end of this year.
Then Sempra will join some 20 tenants in a variety of converted industrial buildings at Commerce Park who have gradually replaced such former manufacturing users as Barnes Engineering, Pitney-Bowes and Ronson Lighters.
About six years ago the half-century-old park began emerging from a long period of vacancies and short-term leases on its way to nearly complete gentrification. Among its occupants are the New York Sports Club, formerly Gold's Gym; Fine Art 2000, an art studio and gallery; Michael Kessler Antiques; Osborne & Little, an English fabric and wallpaper showroom; Cablevision's new phone service division; Syed Sports Medicine Clinic, Prime Time Limousine, an Ethan Allen furniture store and design center and, soon to be added, a new 70,000-square-foot Shop Rite supermarket.
"This animal has formed itself," said Matthew Tenney, president of Stampar Associates, L.L.C., owners of Commerce Park. "The mix of tenants has realized lower rents in the $10 to $15 a square foot range, in a neighborhood close to Greenwich and downtown Stamford, with turnpike access to New York City only seconds away."
"The city likes this," said Irene Korin, Stamford's business recruitment manager. "It doesn't want to be wall-to-wall office towers. Some people would never look at anything but Class A space, but others want something nontraditional. Traders and high-tech firms often work all night. Their people are young, make a lot of money, but they don't wear suits and they can stick out like sore thumbs in a formal office setting."
Most Sempra traders are 35 or younger, said David Messer, president of Sempra. "We are very excited about having a building that is conducive to the type of creativity that's required in the trading business," he said. "Our desire is to create a space that's airy and open, but very comfortable, because our people spend long hours sitting at their trading desks. There will be very few private offices. Everyone sits out in the open, in what we call the bullpen."
Unlike the majestic new $145 million SBC Warburg Dillon Read trading floor and offices formerly known as Swiss Bank, located so conveniently across from the Stamford railroad station, Sempra is about a mile from the station. So it will have to run shuttle buses for many of its 150 employees.
"I think Swiss Bank opened the door for other trading floors to feel comfortable out of New York," said Cindy Zuckerbrod, broker with RAND Real Estate Services in Westport. "Sempra looked for a year and found nothing in the traditional office market. I approached them with the idea of converting a warehouse -- something they had never thought about. They loved the concept and they found something -- too bad it wasn't with me."
Roger Ferris, head of Roger Ferris & Partners of Westport, is designing the Sempra project, as he did the AIG trading floor.
T HERE has been a definite uptick in reusing old buildings," he said. "These sites are real opportunities. They're immediately available because nobody knows what to do with them. They don't serve a warehouse purpose, and they're not going to work for lawyers. With minimum columns and 15-foot ceilings, you couldn't build anything better if you started from scratch."
His company has designed half a dozen trading floors in London, Manhattan, Tokyo and Greenwich and it has contracts for two more.
"The need for trading floors is expanding rapidly," he said, "and not just for trading companies. Trading today is so instantaneous -- businesses want to be in communication with their investment people, they are part of the deal and need to be on the line."
Other tenants in the park have been quite sanguine about exchanging a chic address for other perquisites. Mr. Kessler's antiques gallery was in downtown Greenwich until last fall, when he moved it to a 5,000-square-foot building in Commerce Park, a structure he characterized as "a rundown disaster."
"But," he said, "the landlord was willing to renovate to suit and I had had enough of parking problems in Greenwich." The landlord gutted the interior, installed picture windows and, after fencing off one side of the lot for garden furniture and fountains, still left plenty of parking space.
"I'm happy I made the move," said Mr. Kessler, "and it was good for the landlord having me create a classy business for other people to follow suit."
R. C. Johann is vice president of United States operations for the British firm of Osborne & Little, overseeing showrooms in the Designers & Decorators Building in Manhattan, the Merchandise Mart in Chicago and the Design Center in Washington, D.C., as well as in its Commerce Park space. "At one point we had offers to move to White Plains or Long Island City for less rent," he said, "but the city and state made it financially very attractive to stay here with tax abatements. And the landlord has invested a lot of money in upgrading the place with new roadways, brick pillars flanking the driveways, painting and landscaping."
Mr. Ferris's plans for turning Sempra's ugly duckling into a swan include removing the west wall and replacing it with a 150-foot expanse of glass containing a new entrance approached through a broad area of plantings. The roof will be raised on the same side in a shed configuration, and the space below the new roof line will be faced with glass and merged with the new glass wall.
A vista of landscaping seen through the glass and extending into the new entrance "will give the traders something to look at," said Mr. Ferris.
"People in this industry get burned out," he said. "They sit all day in close proximity, so they are inclined to like working in an imaginative space."
The remaining exterior brick walls will be cleaned and repointed, the existing entrance on Commerce Road will be closed and bricked over and parking will be provided on both sides of the building. "We want to keep the aesthetic of the place," said Mr. Ferris, "not mask it. It's not a Park Avenue corporate environment."
"Stamford has an opportunity to create a different kind of space. Software companies, new media, cable TV production operations want a more soft-collar type of environment, said Kip Bergstrom, the recently resigned director of economic development for Stamford, who has a similar job in Providence, R.I.
"If Stamford doesn't do it, it will wind up with a one-dimensional economic base. You can't do better than what Sempra is doing, and it isn't that these companies are just looking for something cheap. Sempra, with renovations, will end up with Class A space."

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A/Dr. Stuart A. Newman;
Drawing a Line in Genetic Engineering

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
DR. STUART A. NEWMAN, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College, wanted to do something controversial to evoke public and scientific debate on the morality of genetic engineering. So Dr. Newman and a colleague filed a patent for a process to make "chimeras," creatures that are part human, part animal.
A resident of Pleasantville, Dr. Newman and his colleague, Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, do not want to make the creatures. In fact, Dr. Newman does not think anyone should be allowed to make them and thinks these kinds of patents should be rejected. But he wants people to talk more about the issues so laws and ethics can be established before science delivers a done deal. 
 Dr. Newman has a doctorate in chemistry and has done research in development biology. He is a founding member of the Council for Responsible Genetics, based in Cambridge, Mass. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:
Q. How did you get involved with Jeremy Rifkin and the patent for "chimeras"?
A. Jeremy Rifkin has been involved in a critique of biotechnology and genetic determinism, and so on. So I've been interacting with him over the years. About five years ago, he approached me with the idea of thinking about something that would be patentable within the current patent law but would be shocking enough to the general public so that it would raise some questions in a very vivid way: What should be patented? Is it not the case that living systems are being turned into commodities? And is human biology being commodified?
We were both concerned about the notion of perfectibility of humans -- the use of technology to basically turn people into something superior to what they are now. So I thought about it for a while and came up with the idea of a chimeric organism -- basically a composite between human and animal tissues.
Such chimeras have been made before using nonhuman animals, like sheep and goats. There was one called a "geep" that was reported on back in the 1980's. And these have been studied as experimental models. So the novelty here was introducing a human component into the mix.
Q. These animals could not breed together on their own? Does it take biology to make a geep?
A. Different species can mate. You have mules arising from the mating of a donkey and a horse, for example. But this is something different. You can take even more distant species. And it was found that by taking the cells of early embryos and mixing them together you wind up in certain cases getting cooperation between the cells of the different species. So you wind up with an organism whose tissues are a mixture of cells of the two species. It's not the genetic material that mixes, as it would be in a hybrid. The tissues of the body are a mosaic of cells from the different species.
Q. Please explain the distinction.
A. The tissues of a geep, for example, are partly sheep cells and partly goat cells. Each tissue of the body is a mixture. In a hybrid, since the genetic material mixes in the fertilized egg, then all the tissues in the body consist of cells that are hybrid cells. The thing is that in the chimera, you retain the identity of the cells of the originating species.
So a chimera between a human and a chimpanzee, for example, could have a brain that would contain some human cells and some chimpanzee cells. And the heart could contain some human cells and some chimpanzee cells. So, of course, this organism could not breed true, because its reproductive cells would be either one type or the other. You're not creating a new species; you're creating an organism that is a mixture or a composite.
Q. What's so bad about that?
A. Well, let me present a hypothetical. By this method it would be possible to make an organism that would be 90 percent human and 10 percent ape. I think this would be disquieting to some people, particularly if you were using such an organism to do experiments on. If I were to present to you something that was 40 percent human and 60 percent gorilla or chimpanzee, how would you feel about that? There's certainly a point where I think everybody would say a line has to be drawn.
Now, already, people have obtained patents for organisms that contain some human genes, say a pig in which all the pig cells have some human genes in them. This is a step in that direction. Maybe most people wouldn't say the line should be drawn there, maybe that's not human enough. But there certainly comes a point where you can put many, many genes in or make organisms like the one we propose, which is a composite in which a certain percentage of the actual cells are human cells.
I think that the issue we're raising by doing this is that there must be limits to this kind of work, it can't be done in a completely unregulated fashion. It can't be driven only by scientific curiosity and commercial viability. There have to be some other values that are brought to bear on this kind of enterprise.
Q. You have a particular method, which is how you have something that can be patented?
A. Yes. According to the patent office it is, and this is something that many of us from the council and Jeremy Rifkin's organization and many other organizations around the world dispute -- the idea that organisms are inventions.
The Patent Office refers to genetically modified organisms as compositions of matter as if they were simply a modified chemical. By their definition, something that shows inventiveness and novelty and hasn't been described before and represents a new composition of matter is patentable.
We would like to see a situation where there is public discussion about this, and we would like to see the legislatures at the national and international levels saying that organisms, particularly those with human tissue, are not simply compositions of matter and are not inventions. They are really a part of nature or if they're not a part of nature they should not be patentable because of these other disquieting questions.
Q. So, ideally, you'd like to see your patent rejected because they've changed their policy?
A. Right.
Q. Does the decision from the United States Patent Office have any legal impact on the rest of the world?
A. In Europe already there are statutes that exclude things like cloned human beings from being patented. Not only is it dealt with at the level of patenting but it is considered to be just against the law.
Q. Where in your professional judgment is the line between acceptable biotechnology and the unacceptable?
A. I think there are many benefits to biotechnology. There has been a lot in the newspaper lately about the progress against cancer, and that was remarkable. And this sort of thing involves some sort of biological research.
Personally, I accept experimentation on transgenic animals -- that is, genetically modified animals. I think this advances research on health care, and so on.
I personally have great reservation and am against the genetic modification of humans in a prospective sense. What I mean by that is the idea of making genetically modified human embryos so the resulting individuals develop in some predetermined way.
I'm also against the idea of cloning humans because I think that producing people according to predetermined prototypes is really culturally a very negative thing.
On the other hand, if some already existing person is sick, has some life-threatening illness and can be helped by what's called somatic modification -- that is genetic modification of the body cells of an already-existing person -- I think that is fine.
I'm against what's called germ line modification -- the modification of an individual that does not yet exist so that the individual develops according to some predetermined design.
What medicine does traditionally is cure people who are ill, not make people according to some predetermined plan.
Q. Is the patent process long?
A. Yes. A normal, uncontroversial patent might take a year or a year and a half. I think there will be a long delay in this patent decision. The Patent Office will be scrutinizing this in a thorough fashion and will look for advice from other avenues.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/The Lower East Side;
Reinventing the First Stop for Immigrants

BYLINE: By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
THIS summer the Lower East Side, long the first home of immigrants, will mark the centennial of the consolidation of what is now New York City.
There will be live performances and other events in trendy clubs and restaurants and on its newly cobblestoned Orchard Street between Broome and Delancey Streets -- dubbed Centennial Block for the occasion and lined with old-fashioned street lights. In keeping with the anniversary, storefronts will have displays depicting the neighborhood's history. 
 The area is being rediscovered by new immigrants -- artists who are joining earlier homesteaders from the late 80's and are moving from the East Village or reeling from SoHo prices.
"The community keeps reinventing itself," said Susan Fleminger, director of visual arts and arts education at the Henry Street Settlement, whose main house is at 265 Henry Street, near Montgomery Street. "Just when you think it's over, it revives itself." Henry Street is one of six century- old settlement houses that continue to help new immigrants, providing day care and programs for the young and old, as well as cultural activities in Henry Street's Abrons Arts Center.
Another center for the arts is the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center at 107 Suffolk Street near Rivington Street in a century-old former school. It has four theaters and 45 artists' studios, according to Edgardo Vega Yunque, the center's director.
Tenements built in the 1860's to the early 1900's were boarded up in the mid-1930's when owners felt new requirements for renovations to bring in more light and air too costly to undertake during the Depression. Ground-floor stores remained opened.
"They couldn't rehabilitate them, they didn't have the money," said Matthew Bauer, executive director of the six-year-old Lower East Side Business Improvement District (BID).
Now the upper floors are being renovated, preserving such elements as window surrounds and cornices and bringing closer-to-market-rate prices to the neighborhood.
BUT what some people view as a renaissance others see as displacement of the poor. As the middle class moves in and prices rise, some locals fear gentrification is driving out poorer residents of the neighborhood, stretching from Houston Street to the Brooklyn Bridge and the Bowery to the East River and taking in a large part of Chinatown, including the 44-story Confucius Plaza, just south of the Manhattan Bridge ramp. "It's a very divisive issue," said Ann Bobco, a resident and a member of Community Board 3.
"People are screaming about gentrification," said Lyn Pentecost, chairwoman of the Lower East Side Coalition for Housing Development. But Ms. Pentecost, a 35-year resident who teaches metropolitan studies at New York University, said that for every market-rate apartment, there's low-income housing coming on line. "There's a strong nonprofit sector in the neighborhood keeping affordable housing here," she said.
On Ms. Bobco's Suffolk Street block, for example, the Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE), a community development organization, is building 12 four-story houses with 48 for-sale units. Their two- and three-bedroom units will sell for $125,000 to $140,000. The units will be limited to households earning $40,000 to $70,000.
AAFE, which builds low-income housing as well, acts as a tenant advocate, and refurbishes existing buildings. Forty percent of its tenants are Asians, 30 percent are Latinos and 30 percent are others.
O WNERSHIP gives residents a stake in the community," said Christopher Kui, executive director of AAFE. "Why should people have to move out to Queens to own a home?"
Originally, Irish and German immigrants came here, followed by Eastern Europeans and Southern Italians. "By the 1890's, the residents were mostly Eastern European Jews," said Sharon Seitz, during a tour of the Tenement Museum, at 97 Orchard Street, near Delancey Street, which occupies a building built in 1863. Today, Dominicans, Mexicans, Colombians, Bengalis and Chinese are among the residents.
Schools are a problem. In Community School District 1, five of nine schools have been cited for corrective action for poor performance. Sonia Diaz Salcedo, who became superintendent in August 1997, has removed three principals from troubled schools, instituted professional development programs for assistant principals and staff, and is focusing on improving the physical plants of schools.
But at the pre-k to 6 P.S. 20, the principal, Dr. Leonard Golubchick, said that 90 percent of his 1,010 pupils scored at or above the 90th percentile in state reading and math tests. Moreover, he said, grades 4, 5 and 6 are connected to the Internet; all classrooms have at least one computer, the technology lab has 34 Macintosh terminals, the library five computers and a multimedia center with computers is imminent.
Last spring the school received a $75,000 Annenberg grant for each of five years for arts programs, provided through the Henry Street Settlement.
Among the school's graduates are the Gershwin brothers, Louis J. Lefkowitz, a longtime New York State Attorney General; George Burns and Edward G. Robinson.
I.S. 131, one of six schools in District 2 that serve the community, is known as the Dr. Sun Yat-sen School. It enrolls 1,400 students of whom 85 percent are Chinese, said Alice Young, its principal.
"English is a second language for most kids here, even the native born, because they speak Chinese at home," she explained. The school offers a Saturday program to inspire literacy. Called "Walk, Talk, Think, Write," it exposes students to their community and beyond. A recent program included a tour of the uptown and SoHo Guggenheim Museums for children and parents.
The 2,300-student, 70-year-old Seward Park High School has long been regarded as a troubled school. In 1993, said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, she attended the funeral of a student who had been knifed to death. But now, she added, there is an effort to turn the school around.
"Our printing and publishing program includes tours of printing presses and teaches word processing, computer graphics and desktop publishing," said Kenneth Harvey, assistant principal for guidance. And, he said, a medical technology program offers internships for seniors in labs at New York Downtown Hospital and Bellevue.
AMONG the private schools are Tifereth Jerusalem, a k-12 yeshiva with 150 students, where tuition is $3,900 a year, and the pre-k-8,210-student Roman Catholic St. James School, where tuition is $1,930 to $3,500, depending on the number of children in a family.
There are seven public housing projects in the neighborhood with a total of 9,465 apartments. And running along Grand Street from Essex Street to the river are 28 12- to 20-story co-ops with a total of 4,400 units, many with spectacular views. Celia Honig, assistant principal at I.S. 131, who grew up in the area, now lives in a one-bedroom co-op at East Broadway. "They were originally financed by garment industry unions," said Ms. Honig, referring the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers.
The co-ops were built from the 1930's to the late 1960's as affordable housing for the middle class, added Joel Kaplan of the United Jewish Council. "Co-ops could be bought for $3,000 a room and had to be sold back to the co-op," he said. "But in November 1996 co-op members voted to reconstitute the cap to $15,000 a room and allow sales to outsiders."
 BUT demand far outstrips supply, said Sion Misrahi, owner of a real estate firm by the same name. "One-bedroom co-ops cost from $45,000 to $57,000 but they're hard to come by," he said.
Heshey Jacob, general manager for three of the co-ops, Seward Park, Hillman and East River with 4,200 apartments, said that 150 apartments had sold in nine months "so you can see the turnover rate is not high." He cited sales of two-bedroom units for $60,000 and three-bedrooms for $85,000.
"Rentals of one-bedroom apartments in refurbished tenements are going for $1,100 to $1,500, while two bedrooms run from $1,500 to $2,000," noted Mr. Misrahi.
Mr. Misrahi's own life mirrors the neighborhood's. "I was a merchant on Orchard Street and my father also had a store here," he said. Then in August 1994, he opened his firm as its only employee and now has 17 people working with him. "My office played a role in pushing for renovations as buildings became valuable." He was the founding president of the BID.
Buildings being bought for renovation for market-rate rentals or co-ops are selling for $80 and $120 a square foot, Mr. Misrahi added. The stores themselves, which five years ago ran anywhere from $20 to $80 a square foot, now go for as much as $120 a square foot. "If on Orchard Street between Delancey and Rivington Streets or Essex and Delancey, there's more shopping traffic and the price is higher," he explained.
Three buildings on Hester Street presently on the market together are priced at $2 million.
The higher prices reflect the influx of designer clothing stores and trendy restaurants such as the Living Room Cafe, which features folk music. They join such institutions as Katz's Delicatessen, at 205 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, and Ratner's, the kosher dairy restaurant, at 138 Delancey Street, near Suffolk Street, that itself has become a part of the 90's Lower East Side by opening Lansky's Lounge, a hip night spot suggesting a speakeasy.

HEADLINE: Staying Put and Caring For the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN 

 BODY:
IN a world full of fence-sitters, Evelyn Schatz is about as subdued as a whirling cannonball. Friend and foe alike in New Haven have labeled her irrepressible, tyrannical, bumptious, blunt and brassy. In short, she is considered a dogged persuader who gets things done.
Mrs. Schatz's tactics are simple and well-known: hound city officials and the police until they take action, badger slum landlords until they go elsewhere, convince residents to take action, nag business and property owners until they see beyond their own interests. 
 "Evelyn could pester anyone to death," said Tony Bialecki, economic development officer for the city of New Haven. "She never lets up."
For the most part, Mrs. Schatz said she has fueled her campaign on pure conviction. These days she earns a modest salary by heading the Chapel West Special Services District, one of three such organizations established by the city in the 1980's to improve conditions in the neighborhoods. With an annual budget of $120,000 and the help of an eight-member board, she oversees activities within a large swath of the city's downtown and surrounding business district, including the Hospital of St. Raphael and parts of Yale University.
Her work force consists of two people who tidy the district with a street sweeper, weed whackers, hedge clippers and lawn mowers. For her part, Mrs. Schatz works nearly round the clock maintaining a tight vigilance over everything from criminal activity to property acquisition.
Those interested in buying property in Mrs. Schatz's district had better think twice. "I make it clear to anybody who comes here, 'We don't want any nonsense'," she said. "So far," she added beaming, "it seems to be working." After years of battling crime and decay in a once-notorious area, Mrs. Schatz says she is finally seeing results. Granite-bricked sidewalks, old-fashioned street lamps and trash containers line many blocks; abandoned buildings once filled with crack dealers, have been demolished or refurbished by a new generation of community-minded homeowners or landlords.
One of the more recent arrivals is Arnie Lehrer, who owns rental properties in the neighborhood and serves as a board member for Chapel West, said he has seen "dramatic improvements" in recent years. "It used to be that you couldn't even count the number of johns cruising up and down these streets," he said. "Now most of my tenants say they feel safe."
Nevertheless, Mrs. Schatz said, it is no time to become complacent. More than ever, she said, she must keep a watchful eye over city officials and boards that for years have allowed poorly managed prison release and drug rehabilitation programs into the area, which she says contributed to its decline.
"I'm not one of these 'not in my backyard,' fanatics," she said. "Because I've already got enough in my backyard." She continued: "Instead of busing some of these programs to other parts of the city like Morris Cove, where I was raised, or Westville, they think we're mincemeat or something and always dump them here. As everyone knows, I've had enough already."
Though she has had enough already for years, unlike many residents who long ago fled the city for the suburbs or retirement communities, since 1958 Mrs. Schatz and her husband, Morris Schatz, have stayed and fought. For 20 years, the couple has lived above Schatz Furriers, a business started by Mr. Schatz's father at the turn of the century on the corner of Chapel and Howe streets. The building sits a few doors down from Chinese and Indian restaurants on one side and the Y.W.C.A. on the other, where the couple met at a dance in the early 50's. "He was standing by the coffee machine with a pipe in his mouth and looked so cute," Mrs. Schatz recalled.
But because of their backgrounds -- Mr. Schatz is Jewish and Mrs. Schatz is Italian -- the couple had to iron out family frictions before getting married nine years later. Later, Mrs. Schatz gave birth to a daughter who died soon after from a respiratory ailment. For several years following the child's death, Mrs. Schatz said she went to the cemetery three times a day to visit the grave. One day, she said, she received a revelation that the child was at peace and that she should get on with her life. "We did a lot of crying for many years," she said.
After that, she said she and her husband funneled their passions into their deteriorating neighborhood. One of the major problems was a series of social service programs housed in the Y.M.C.A. and adjoining Y.W.C.A., which drew much of the drug and prostitution traffic, she said. As a result, long-time residents moved out of the area, many leaving their properties neglected and abandoned. The escalating crime drove customers away from businesses like her husband's, and many of them failed.
"There used to be this joke," Mr. Schatz, a loquacious man with a wry sense of humor, said. He tells about a dead man who was put to rest in a casket at a nearby funeral home. When the man's relatives filed past him, they mentioned that the funeral home was near Chapel and Howe streets. "Suddenly the guy jumps up out of his casket and starts yelling, 'Get me outta here, I could get killed in this neighborhood!' "
Yet living under those circumstances was not a joke. For years, the couple said, Saturday nights surrounding their house looked like 42d Street, where prostitutes often walked naked from car to car and drug dealers conducted business out in the open. As the Schatzes and other residents pressured the police, one pimp threatened to bomb the house next door, she said, and prostitutes trailed her as she walked down the street. "I used to run outside screaming at them," she said. "They'd tell me that my days were numbered. Of course I was scared."
In 1970, the Schatzes along with other residents and merchants, formed the Upper Chapel Street Neighborhood Association, to help regain and improve the area and to strengthen their clout with the city.
The next 10 years, she said, were fraught with frustration but that she learned a powerful lesson.
"One thing you realize is that by the time you go in front of all these city board members, their minds are already made up," she said. "Sometimes if you bring in enough people it helps but not always.
"So I figured out long ago that the only way to deal with politicians is to threaten them."
One of Mrs. Schatz's targets was a local judge who, she said, "gave the prostitutes a slap on the wrists and they were out on the streets in no time."
One weekend he took a holiday in upstate New York. After tracking down the telephone number for the lodge where the judge was staying, Mrs. Schatz said she called him and said, "I invite you to stay in my house for two weeks so you can see what I have to deal with." She continued, "of course, he slammed the phone in my ear, but after that, he wasn't as lenient with the hookers."
In the late 70's, she made local headlines after buying a life-sized inflatable doll, dressing it up as a prostitute, then fastening it to the front of a bus filled with residents of the neighborhood. The bus and its occupants then went across town, to Mayor Frank Logue's home and confronted him in front of television cameras.
"I made it clear that if he didn't help us clean up our neighborhood we were going to load up the bus with prostitutes and all the other riffraff from our neighborhood and drop them off at his house."
After the incident, Mrs. Schatz said she began pouring her efforts into canvassing thousands of residents for the mayoral campaign of Biagio DiLieto, the city's police chief who had run several sting operations in her neighborhood. Mr. DiLieto, who went on to serve five terms as mayor from 1980 to 1990, said, "she drove me absolutely crazy. She was a constant bother and the only constituent who ever hung up on me."
The former mayor had worked as a police officer in New Haven since the late 1940's and described the upper Chapel Street district as a "persistent problem." He added, "but when Evelyn Schatz came on the scene she put up a tremendous battle and won."
Sgt. Ray Hassett runs the community police substation on Edgewood and Day streets, around the corner from Mrs. Schatz's home. As he leaned against his police car one day recently, he said the neighborhood is "not as dangerous as it used to be," because of community policing tactics and more involvement from residents no longer afraid to report criminal activity. Yet, he added, career criminals continue to linger. He said he too receives his share of calls from Mrs. Schatz, but he said their relationship has made parts of his job less complicated. "She has a tremendous history of relationships in this community," he said, "and if I need access or information, she can open doors." As for the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., the old managers have vacated and Mrs. Schatz's organization has lobbied hard to make certain the new clientele doesn't cause problems. Though the building still houses rehabilitation programs, she said she is working closely with the new management to maintain control over the destiny of her neighborhood.
"At first I fought them and fought them," she said. "Now I join them; that way, I can keep an eye on them." This summer, she added, the new management of the Y.W.C.A. plans to dedicate the ballroom of the building, where the Schatzes first met, to her and her husband.
Each morning, Mrs. Schatz will rise, eat a breakfast of one egg, toast and grapefruit, then trek to her paneled office where the windows face an old stone church and begin her 16-hour day. Most visitors, and there are many, can find her behind her desk with the telephone receiver suctioned to her ear, snapping away at city officials and fulfilling requests.
Within a half-hour span on a recent morning, someone called to find out where to get a birth certificate, another caller wanted to know how to get rid of an aggressive panhandler, another needed some house paint and someone else needed their street cleaned after revelers smashed bottles on the sidewalk.
"They call me for everything," she said. She then cut away and began dialing the phone. Mr. Schatz, who had been listening to Frank Sinatra in the next room, walked into the office to point out a collage of photographs from Democratic Party fund-raising and other events Mrs. Schatz has helped organize over the years. "There's Evelyn with Joe Lieberman, with Barbara Kennelly, with Bill O'Neill," Mr. Schatz said.
Most recently she organized a 75th birthday party for Mr. DiLieto that drew 500 people. Flipping through the photographs of the event, Mrs. Schatz -- who was on hold -- said matter-of-factly, "Yeah, Dodd, De Stefano, Blumenthal, they were all there."
In turn, a group of Mrs. Schatz's friends have organized a party to celebrate her 70th birthday on June 30. More than 350 people are expected to attend. That week, the city of New Haven will place banners along Chapel Street proclaiming it "Evelyn Schatz Way" ("they're calling it that because I always get my way," she said with a big smile.)
Mrs. Schatz is preparing for the party by working with a nutritionist to lose several pounds. Saddled to three telephone lines all day doesn't give her much of a chance to exercise. "Let's face it," she said. "If I exercised the rest of my body the way I do my mouth I'd be Twiggy!"
She took a deep breath and released it with a sigh. "I'm burned out," she said while dialing the phone. "But, oh, my God, I've got so much to complete."
Each day she goes through The New Haven Register looking for people in the newspaper that have even the slightest involvement in her district. She'll cut the piece out, laminate it and send it to the person or their family. "People like those kind of things," she says, showing her visitor a laminated obituary.
As for plans to run for political office, Mrs. Schatz simply shoos the question away.
"Are you kidding? I have absolutely no taste for politics."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
The Last Season for the Last Drive-In Picture Show

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: WESTBURY

 BODY:
TWO days ago the three giant screens of the Westbury Drive-in Theater on Brush Hollow Road, dark since last November, came alive for the theater's final season.
After 46 years of continuous operation by United Artists Theater Circuit, this last survivor of the dozens of drive-ins that once operated throughout the New York metropolitan area is scheduled to close its gates permanently sometime after Labor Day. 
 Replacing it on the 23.59-acre site will be a 14-screen, 3,000-seat multiplex, also to be operated by United Artists, and a 116,700-square-foot BJ's Wholesale Club.
A nearby Home Depot, a Staples and other large stores along Jericho Turnpike, along with motels, fast-food restaurants and gas stations, make this sprawling drive-in, which speaks more of rural countryside than built-up suburbia, a quirky anachronism.
The question long embroiling the surrounding community of quiet residential enclaves built on farmland in the 60's has not so much been if the drive-in would ever close, but when it would close and what would replace it.
The multiplex and warehouse store were first proposed almost a decade ago. But opposition by local residents who fear increased traffic and the consequent refusal in 1993 by the Oyster Bay Town Board to issue the necessary special-use permit to the developers kept the plan in limbo until now.
The two owners of the drive-in, Howard T. Hogan Jr. of Locust Valley and Eleanor Lerner of Delray Beach, Fla., sued the town. In a New York State Supreme Court decision handed down in 1996, which was upheld by the Appellate Division last year, the town was ordered to grant the construction permit. The final legal victory for the owners came May 12, when the Court of Appeals denied the town's motion for a further appeal, clearing the way for construction to begin in the fall.
Long Island once had drive-in theaters in Commack, Rocky Point, Melville, Bethpage and Bay Shore, among other locations. But one after the other fell victim to skyrocketing land values and property taxes, which have been the death knell for thousands of others.
The nation's first drive-in opened in Camden, N.J., in June 1933. By 1954, there were almost 4,000 drive-ins throughout the United States. But by the end of last year that number had dwindled to 577, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. None are left in New Jersey, where the last drive-in closed in 1991; there are six in Connecticut and 28 still exist in New York, all upstate except the Westbury theater.
"The reason drive-ins are closing is not for lack of business," said Frank Seeber, the owner and operator, along with his wife, Ann, and daughter, Beth Wilson, of three upstate drive-ins. They include the Middletown Twin, which opened in 1953, the same year as the Westbury; one in Newburgh and one in Maybrook. "The real estate they're on just becomes too valuable," Mr. Seeber said.
The Westbury is no exception. The site, which is bounded by Brush Hollow Road and Cantiague Rock Road, is one of the most desirable undeveloped real estate parcels in Nassau County, with the Long Island Expressway just to the north of it and the Northern State Parkway less than half a mile to the south.
Except for the ticket booth and concession stand and the three 35-foot-high and 75-foot-wide screens (which Mr. Seeber plans to purchase when the theater closes), the property is empty.
He said that the land was worth $1.1 Although there is parking for 950 cars, United Artists was losing $100,000 a year on the theater, said Kurt C. Hall, its president.
Mr. Hogan, whose family built the Westbury, said that the land was worth $1.1 million an acre, and that real estate taxes, which United Artists has been paying under its land lease, were $385,000 a year.
"A lot of people have nostalgic feelings about the drive-in, and I am one of them," said Mr. Hogan. "It has been part of my family, it was part of my youth, and I have very fond memories of it. But it's just not viable any more."
The new project will be a "state-of-the-art development costing $20 million," he said. "It's going to take what is now an eyesore and turn it into something that will be esthetically and economically an asset for the community." He said that the new development would generate $19 million annually in various tax revenues and that it would create 300 jobs.
Mr. Hogan, who was represented in the legal proceedings against the town by Jeffrey Forchelli of the Forchelli, Schwartz, Mineo & Carlino law firm in Mineola, said very careful planning went into his selection of the multiplex and BJ's Wholesale Club, since the 14 screens would have different show times and the store's peak hours would be different from peak traffic hours at nearby office buildings.
But residents buy none of that and have battled along with the town against the redevelopment plan fearing the traffic impact on an elementary school and firehouse substation on Cantiague Rock Road, and further degradation of air quality in their community. Their preference is light industry, for which the property is zoned, or housing.
THE proposed project "was a bad idea from Day One, and we really had right on our side including getting all kinds of expert testimony on the affect this project would have," said Leonard A. Gutterman, the past president of the West Birchwood Civic Assocation, a group representing the homeowners of a 828-home residential enclave just east of the drive-in property.
Other multiplexes on Long Island are all on major roads like Sunrise Highway and Route 110, not on secondary roads like Brush Hollow, Mr. Gutterman said. BJ's also usually builds its operations on major roadways, he said.
"Some terrible, terrible planning went into this from the very beginning, and for me the decision of the courts was justice at its worst," he said. "Neither the Appellate Court judges in New York City or the Albany court had any understanding of the issues out here."
John Venditto, the Oyster Bay Town Supervisor, and formerly the town attorney who litigated the case for the town, said that the State Supreme Court in Mineola had recognized there would be a traffic problem, but had reversed the town board's decision nevertheless, ordering the town to find solutions instead of leaving that up to the applicants.
"We were always unhappy over the fact that the burden was placed on us to prove our position and we were hopeful we would get the attention of the Court of Appeals with the issues we raised," said Mr. Venditto. "But unfortunately that wasn't the case."
Opposition to the demise of the drive-in also came from those who consider the last open-air movie theater on Long Island just as worthy of landmarking as original diners and other icons of what has come to be known as roadside culture.
"We felt the Westbury was special because of its historical significance to LongIsland," said John Giordano, the Farmingdale village clerk, who privately worked on the restoration of his village's Long Island Rail Road station and other historic preservation projects. "Uniqueness is one of the qualifying factors for landmark status, and this drive-in is unique."
But the Landmarks Commission of the town of Oyster Bay turned down the application earlier this year, voting 4 to 3 against the proposal.
"To qualify as a landmark something has to have some architectural significance, and a drive-in doesn't have that -- it's basically an empty field with a screen," said Edward J. Smits, the Nassau County historian, who spoke against the designation. "The other question would be what was the drive-in's impact on cultural history and as far as I can see the drive-in had no cultural significance in general and neither did this one specifically."
But the Westbury's imminent closing is a wrench for its patrons. Many are families on a budget who spend a relatively inexpensive night out without getting a baby-sitter.
Cindy Rubin, who was stringing balloons outside the West Birchwood home of her sister Tammy Cohen to celebrate the birth of her sister's baby, said she was sorry to see the drive-in go.
She and her husband, Glenn, live in Glen Head, but they go to the drive-in, Mrs. Rubin said. As a couple they went there on dates; now they pack some snacks and go there with their 3-year-old son, Ryan. "It's different, it's fun, it's a romantic place," Mrs. Rubin said.

HEADLINE: Where the Bad Air Comes From

BYLINE: By JAY AXELBANK 

 BODY:
WHEN many new residents arrived in Connecticut they thought they were getting away from the noise and pollution of the Big City and that they would be enjoying rural landscapes and picturesque towns. One would be able to throw open a window to take in a deep breath of fresh air. Ah were it but true; unfortunately the state has some of the smoggiest, most unhealthful air in the entire country.
"There's so little pristine quality left here," lamented Dr. Thomas Godar, a doctor with the American Lung Association in Hartford who is bracing for a rash of warm-weather health alerts. "Until we clean up our air, we can't fully enjoy the outdoors in the summer." 
 As the state tracks ground-level ozone concentrations at its dozen monitoring stations scattered from Greenwich to Stafford, and long-suffering residents can expect far more health-warning announcements this summer than last. If weather and other conditions resemble 1997, there could be twice as many ozone alerts as last year's total of 12, according to Carmine DiBattista, head of the Bureau of Air Management of the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
It's not that air quality is expected to be any worse, he explained. It's because the Federal Government, acting on a mass of new medical evidence, has just "raised the bar."
Starting in 1998, health standards for ozone, a lung irritant also known as smog, have been made more stringent than those in effect up to now. Since April 1 when the state began ozone monitoring, there had already been two smog-alert days as of last Wednesday. Unhealthful conditions were recorded in Greenwich, Westport, Danbury and Torrington on May 16, when the temperature reached 90 degrees, and in Torrington on May 20, when the temperature was in the low 80's. Under the less rigorous standards, smog alerts did not usually occur until mid-June.
The new ozone standards are at the center of a campaign at the Federal and state level almost 30 years after passage of the Clean Air Act. The drive, led by Connecticut and seven other Northeastern states, targets ozone-causing pollution, mainly from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and South, that sweeps into this region. To help combat ozone, the Environmental Protection Agency disclosed in April that it is considering even tougher emission controls on new cars.
The E.P.A. has also embarked on a parallel anti-pollution drive, taking aim at fine particulate matter or soot -- which is considered as serious a health threat as ozone and is responsible for haze in the atmosphere. The E.P.A. last year announced first-time health-safety criteria for these microscopic particles and has begun setting up a nationwide monitoring system to measure the extent of the problem.
Connecticut, for its part, acted to curb power-plant pollution as part of the just-passed utility-deregulation bill, which was signed into law by Gov. John G. Rowland at the end of April. A future provision of the law will set strict emissions standards for out-of-state and Connecticut power plants selling electricity in the state.
Despite the multi-pronged clean-air campaign, there is a long way to go. It will take until 2007 to 2010, on the basis of E.P.A. projections, for Connecticut and the rest of the nation to breathe air that meets Federal ozone standards. And reducing airborne soot will take even longer, until 2015 at the earliest.
Even if Connecticut were to shut down all industry next week and halt all vehicular traffic within its borders, according to Mr. DiBattista, the state would still not comply with the new E.P.A. requirements. "The problem is power-plant pollution that comes mainly from the Midwest and South," he said.
Prevailing easterly wind patterns, he explained, not only push ozone components and soot across Connecticut's borders from New York and New Jersey, but also from Pennsylvania and states as far away as Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia.
Even though Connecticut ozone levels have been reduced by approximately half since 1970, the state still officially ranks among the three or four most smog-ridden areas in the entire nation, behind such industrial regions as Los Angeles, New York and Houston. In the 1970's and 80's, health-warning advisories based on the older, less exacting ozone-danger standard, averaged above 35 days during the summer season, twice reaching 60 days. By the 1990's, the average had fallen to 12, but even this number reflects the fact that the state is still far out of E.P.A. ozone compliance.
Ozone exceedance figures for 1997, compiled by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, list the highest number of ozone "hits" in the state for Westport, Stratford and Madison, with six each. Danbury and Groton had four apiece, Greenwich three, and East Hartford, Middletown, New Haven, Bridgeport and Stafford, all had two. Torrington was the unofficial clean-air champion of monitoring sites, registering zero. Overlapping alerts in the various locations accounted for the state total of 12.
Ground-level ozone is the prime ingredient of smog. The term smog, which meant a combination of smoke and fog, is now used by environment officials to refer to ozone -- even though the gas is invisible. Ozone is formed when pollutants -- mainly from power plants, factories and automobiles -- combine in the presence of sunlight -- usually when temperatures reach the high 80's. (Ground-level ozone is distinct from the beneficial, stratospheric variety that shields the earth against ultra-violet rays.)
Scientists point out that ozone's invisibility can mislead people into thinking the air is pure just because the sky is sunny and blue. Only when accompanied by a pall of haze from heavy concentrations of fine particulate matter does ozone acquire a "marker." Beyond the pockets of haze over some of Connecticut's largest population centers, the entire state might resemble Los Angeles in the summer if mountains blocked the outward air flow as they do in California.
The smog buildup means that Connecticut residents such as Bridget and Monica Kelly -- 12-year-old twins who both have asthma -- feel acute discomfort when they shoot baskets on the driveway of their Stratford home during July and August. Barbara Wasko, 67, of Bridgeport, who has a lung disorder, complained, "I have trouble even walking on those smoggy days -- I have to stay inside."
For Renee Idone, 38, of Roxbury, who has competed in several Boston marathons, a 10-mile run is extra taxing on high-ozone days. "The air can seem so fresh and clean -- yet I know it's really not healthy to be outdoors," she said.
Richard Straub, of the American Lung Association of Connecticut, said those most vulnerable to elevated levels of ozone and particulate matter are children and elderly people, particularly those with asthma, emphysema or other cardio-pulmonary conditions. He added that there are an estimated 181,000 asthma sufferers in the state and the number is accelerating in the state and nationwide.
Even healthy individuals, including outdoor workers, swimmers and youngsters who spend a lot of time in the summer sun, can experience irritant effects from smog, according to Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist with the state's Department of Public Health in Hartford. "If people inhale smog and soot they can temporarily diminish lung capacity and have trouble breathing properly. But prolonged exposure can permanently impair or prematurely age anybody's lungs," he added. High levels of ozone not only harm people but can also affect crops and vegetation, stunt trees and contribute to algae in lakes.
Hundreds of scientific studies since the 1980's, according to the E.P.A., have underscored the serious health impacts of polluted air in the United States and have given added momentum to the current anti-pollution campaign.
The national effort got underway last year when Connecticut and seven other Northeastern states took the lead after decades of being on the receiving end of upwind dirty air from the Midwest and South. They embarked on legal action under the 1990 Clean Air Act to curb dirty coal-burning electric power plants in Midwest and Southern states.
The E.P.A. was asked to mandate that these states order such plants to sharply reduce emissions that drift to the Northeast. These high-polluting utilities, many of them built decades ago in the Ohio River valley, were, in effect, grandfathered. They were not required under the 1970 Clean Air Act to adhere to the same emission limits as modern and cleaner electric utilities built after the 1970s.
"Up to now those states, ironically, have been in ozone compliance," observed Jason Grumet, director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, representing the environmental agencies of the New England states and New York and New Jersey. "Their pollution immediately gets dumped across their borders by the prevailing winds. And if your state had acceptable air quality, you were in compliance. You didn't have to worry about reducing your pollution."
But no more. The Northeast states' initiative resulted in an agreement with the E.P.A. -- announced in February -- that would require all 22 Eastern states, including Connecticut, to put controls in place by 2003 for reducing ozone-causing nitrogen oxide emissions. Each state would be assigned a pollution-reduction budget.
States such as Ohio and Kentucky, with many coal-burning power plants, would not be exempt from emission reductions even if their own air quality was considered in compliance.
Some of the nation's filthiest power plants and other pollution sources in the Midwest and South would be required to scale back up to 85 percent. Connecticut and the other Northeast states, however, which have already substantially cut smog-causing emissions in the last few years, would not have to make such severe reductions.
The significance of the E.P.A. proposal, Mr. DiBattista says, is that "it would give Connecticut a level playing field in fighting smog."
By 2010, in this scenario, the resultant air quality in Connecticut and other Northeast states would comply with the E.P.A.'s safe-ozone requirements -- based on the assumption that, besides the power-plant cleanup, the bulk of the nation's auto fleet would be phased out and replaced by cleaner-burning vehicles. If the timetables are met, Connecticut could say goodbye to summer ozone alerts.
Experts in the field of air-quality control say it has taken this long to clean up the nation's air because the bright hopes and resolve of the 1970 Clean Air Act kept colliding with economic and political realities. In addition to frequent resistance and repeated delays in meeting compliance dates, there was a period of indifference in Washington. Moreover, before 1990 the focus was on reducing sulphur dioxide emissions to fight acid rain.
Overarching all these hurdles were two other harsh realities. Even though dirty air respects no borders, the authority to implement federally mandated cleanup programs resides within each state, making cooperative regional efforts difficult. And dealing with air-quality issues poses significant technical challenges.
A few days ago, as Renee Idone left her Roxbury home for her usual l0-mile run, she said, "Why should we have to wait so many more years to clean up pollution. Doesn't everybody want to breathe clean air?"

HEADLINE: Making Technology Fit Easily in Schools

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY in the schools frequently resembles presents under a Christmas tree: shiny and bright. But once the new-toy stage passes, machines are all too often relegated to the back of the classroom.
Learning to make computers work as efficiently, effortlessly and automatically as, say, pencil sharpeners, has been a challenge for teachers and administrators who recognize that computers cannot be perceived as merely add-ons to the curriculum or game-playing rewards for students who have finished their regular work. 
 "The direction now is how to use technology as a way to advance your curriculum goals so it's of a piece," said Dr. Judith Fox, Superintendent of the Byram Hills school district in Armonk. "The idea is using technology for multidisciplinary problem solving."
In Mount Vernon, for example, some fifth- and sixth-grade students will be using laptop computers for classroom work and homework assignments instead of conventional notebooks starting in September. The change is part of the Anytime Anywhere Learning program developed by Microsoft and Toshiba and will be financed with district money and a grant from the Toshiba America Foundation.
In Irvington, the strategy behind the new technology initiative is to help students become more active learners who pursue their own research and solve problems.
And at the College of New Rochelle, four students studying Latin are doing so by way of the Internet, where they can converse with students around the world.
Such endeavors -- and how similar programs can be integrated in the schools -- was discussed at a conference here earlier this spring sponsored by the Westchester Education Coalition. Among the workshop topics were "Technology in Support of Instruction: A Bridge From the Classroom to the Real World," "Developing Skills to Thrive in the Information Economy," "Video Conferencing in the Classroom" and "New York State Standards: Technology Activities Database on the Web for Teachers and Students." They were designed to help teachers and administrators make technology work for the curriculum instead of the other way around.
"If we don't give benchmarks, we are depriving schools of the opportunity to succeed," said Robin Willner, director of corporate social policy and programs for International Business Machines. "If we accept the fact that standards will be higher, then we can't teach the same way. You can't prepare teachers the same way. It's not about the technology. It's about the teaching."

HEADLINE: New Housing Favors Manhattan In Uneven Pattern

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
CITY COUNCILMAN ARCHIE SPIGNER wanders through the streets of southeast Queens these days and marvels at the scatterburst of new housing that has been or is being built -- even in neighborhoods that were struggling only a decade or so ago.
Over the last two or three years, said Mr. Spigner, a Democrat and chairman of the City Council's Housing Committee, "a lot of new construction has occurred" in neighborhoods like Jamaica, South Jamaica, St. Albans and Laurelton. 
 "Wherever there was space, a house has been constructed," Mr. Spigner said. "So much so that we've seen some unique architectural features to conform to oddly shaped lots -- long buildings, wide buildings, some with no side yards -- not the traditional 100-by-40 lot."
"Everything is going," he said.
Indeed, from 1990 through 1996, according to the New York City Department of Planning, 2,050 new housing units were completed in Queens Community District 12 -- a major portion of Mr. Spigner's constituency -- making it one of only 7 among the city's 59 Community Districts to pass the 2,000-unit mark in the first seven years of the 90's. And there's the rub.
While housing construction in the city is showing clear signs of revival, coming off the laggard years of the early 90's, increases in the numbers of completed units have been spotty, leaving many communities behind. The increases have been particularly evident in Manhattan below 96th Street.
And, significantly, they have not been enough to address the city's chronic housing shortage.
So far this decade, building permits for the construction of 48,000 new units, or 6,000 a year, have been issued by the city -- by one estimate, half as many as necessary to meet the rising need.
Although his community is among the favored few, Councilman Spigner sees the bigger picture.
"The deficit is still plain," he said. "There's a moderate-price housing shortage. It's probably better than three, four years ago. But if you put out an apartment for rent for $800, $900, you're going to get a long line of takers, a hot response. It's good if you're the landlord, but not if you're on the line.
"Short of being in the upper reaches of the middle class," Mr. Spigner said, "you have to make hard choices about your rent and where you live. And the poor people are hurting."
For Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, "The real question is why, when the market is this tight and rents are increasing so rapidly, we are not seeing a burst of construction in the boroughs as well as in Manhattan.
"Normally, when vacancies are as low as they are in New York and market rents are as high," Professor Schill said, "we would expect to see developers fighting each other to bring new supply onto the market. Instead, what we see are rates of new construction that do not even keep us even with losses to the housing stock."
For the builders, the barrier to production is, simply put, that the market in the boroughs outside of Manhattan will not bear, they say, what it takes to cover construction and operating costs. "It gets down to marketability," said Jerome Belson, president of the 850-member Associated Builders and Owners of New York. "To meet the needs of the middle-income earner who cannot afford to pay $2,000 a month, you need subsidies. Without subsidies, you're not going to make up that deficit."
It is not as though the city will ever -- nor does it need to -- achieve the production peaks of the past.
In the 1920's, as subway branches reached through still-verdant boroughs and budding communities opened like leaves along the lines, the number of new housing units mounted at an unprecedented rate -- 76,000 a year. But in the Depression-era 1930's, production declined by almost 75 percent, to an annual average of 20,700 units.
During the first five years of the 40's, with the nation concentrating its resources on World War II, production further declined, to 16,500 units a year. But then, as the boys came home, construction steadily increased, reaching 34,413 new units in 1950. Potato farms along Queens Boulevard, for example, gave way to phalanxes of apartment buildings and the stately Tudors and Federals of Forest Hills.
Throughout the 1950's and 60's, an average of 31,700 units were completed each year, reaching a postwar peak of 60,031 in 1963. One reason for the increase was the large number of units built with subsidies under the public housing and Mitchell-Lama programs -- the latter specifically supporting middle-income projects. Subsidized housing accounted for 29 percent of the 634,375 units built during the 50's and 60's.
OVER the next two decades, however -- and even during the hot real estate market of the mid-80's -- production levels were less than half of what they were in the 50's and 60's, dropping to an average of 13,600 a year. One reason for that drop-off was the virtual cessation of construction under the government housing programs.
There has been no rebound.
As the city weathered a deep real estate recession during the first five years of this decade, average annual production plummeted to 7,100 units. Indeed, the 5,512 units built in 1993 constituted the lowest production since 1946, when 4,571 units were built.
But for the last three years there have been glimmers of resurgence.
"The numbers are rising," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "They have risen substantially in every borough, especially in Manhattan."
"One point to be kept in mind," Mr. Rose said, "is that the sites, the availability of land for development, is less than in previous eras." In fact, the city is now so built up that just about the only significant semirural remnant is the southern tier of Staten Island, which is under intense development pressure. "So the numbers are necessarily never going to be at the scale of the development peaks," Mr. Rose said.
There are two related indicators of housing production in the city. The more precise measure is the tally of completed units; the other is the number of units for which building permits have been issued for proposed construction. Data on the number of units completed in Manhattan -- and, hence, totals for the whole city -- were incomplete for 1996, Planning Department officials said.
The city has, however, tracked the number of units authorized by building permits. And those numbers indicate that, while authorized production levels started to rise during the last two years -- by 8,632 units in 1996 and 8,987 in 1997 -- they still lagged behind even the relatively low levels of the 1980's.
From those permit numbers, Professor Schill at N.Y.U. has calculated an estimate of the continuing housing shortage.
Although permits for construction of new housing approached 9,000 units last year, the city loses about 12,000 units annually because of abandonment, deterioration and the combining of apartments, according to the city's Housing and Vacancy Survey -- creating an annual deficit of about 3,000 units.
At the same time, according to the most recent Census Bureau estimates, the city's population is growing at a rate of about 7,800 people -- or 3,200 households -- each year. And so, despite the recent increases in construction, the combination of units lost and increased households leads to an annual deficit of about 6,000 units.
That estimate, however, is complicated by two counteracting factors, for which no comprehensive statistical data are available. One is the number of units that are completely rehabilitated each year -- "gut rehabbed" in the industry parlance. The other is the number of families -- hundreds, if not thousands -- living doubled up in the same unit. So Professor Schill's calculation of a 6,000-unit annual deficit is closer to a well-founded estimate than an absolute number.
The N.Y.U. real estate center, in conjunction with the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, will soon begin a study examining whether the cost of construction in New York "is one of the reasons why we have such a ridiculously low rate of new development," Professor Schill said.
"Although there is certainly a lot of anecdotal information about the high cost of building in New York City, and particularly Manhattan," he said, "there has been no careful analysis of the extent to which construction costs are out of line with other large cities.
"Nor, for that matter, do we know definitively whether government subsidies are absolutely necessary -- and how much those subsidies need to be, if they are needed -- to promote new construction."
There appear to be only shades of difference among parties to the debate over those questions -- whether it simply costs more to build in New York and whether construction in the boroughs outside of Manhattan is impossible without government subsidy. In general, the answers have been yes and yes.
The slivers of contention have been: Do the high construction costs of Manhattan inordinately inflate those costs for the other boroughs? And what is the proper balance between the necessary protections provided by New York's stringent land-use, environmental and building codes and the need to house people?
As far as Mr. Belson of the Associated Builders and Owners is concerned, Manhattan is not to blame for difficulties in the other boroughs. "Building is building," he said. "If you're putting up a 10-story in Manhattan, it is, in effect, the same cost to build it in Brooklyn or Queens. A porter in Manhattan costs the same as a porter in the outer boroughs.
"So, if construction costs are similar and operational costs are similar, where would you rather try to get that rent, in Manhattan or the outer boroughs?"
But for Joshua Muss, president of the Muss Development Company, there is a divide far wider than the rivers between Manhattan and the rest of the city. For four generations, Mr. Muss's family has been building in New York, but only outside of Manhattan. "As far as I'm concerned, the boroughs, unfortunately, always seem to be fighting against Manhattan's success," he said.
The regulatory codes, the environmental reviews, the labor contracts -- all skewed by a market-domineering Manhattan, in Mr. Muss's view -- make it increasingly prohibitive to build in the other boroughs.
AND so, "particularly for the middle-income New Yorker who makes $50,000 to $80,000, about enough to afford a two-bedroom at $1,800 a month, there is no new housing," he said. "It's not being built."
Mr. Muss sees three groups unable to find the kind of housing they want: "Young people getting married, trying to live in the neighborhood from which they came. Immigrants working for a year or five. Young people from all over America, seeking fame and fortune; they find themselves in a railroad flat in downtown Manhattan, the renovation district, three and four people in apartments that cost $2,500 a month."
Eventually, they get promoted, or want to get married. "They're moving right past the boroughs because there's nothing to attract them," Mr. Muss said, "and all of a sudden they become New York City's competition because they get jobs in the suburbs."
The preponderance of construction in Manhattan is borne out by the building-permit data, with the relatively open spaces of Staten Island running second. Although it has 20.9 percent of the city's population, Manhattan was issued 40.5 percent of all new building permits in 1996 and '97. With 5.5 percent of the population, Staten Island received 22.7 percent of the permits.
Queens, with 26.9 percent of the population, received 13.9 percent of the permits. And the Bronx, with 16.2 percent of the population, got 11.6 percent.
Brooklyn fared worst. With 30.5 percent of the population, it was issued only 11.4 percent of the permits.
It may be broadly true, as Mr. Belson points out, that building in the other boroughs is not essentially different from building in Manhattan. But it is also true that New York City has set regulatory standards -- often based on high-rise Manhattan requirements -- that are more stringent, and therefore more costly, than those in other cities. And that boosts costs in the other boroughs.
Building codes, for instance, mandate the use of certain materials and labor practices. "Construction must conform to complex rules of safety, which the city is properly unwilling to compromise," said Roger Starr, a housing specialist with the Manhattan Institute. "And the high-rise buildings in Manhattan require especially qualified workers as new techniques become available."
For example, Mr. Starr pointed out that the strength of concrete depends on the proper mix of cement and water. "The more water, the weaker the concrete," he said, "but the less water called for in the code, the more difficult it becomes to place the concrete where it's needed and to insure that it is packed solidly." And so, because of the greater complexity of design in Manhattan's towers, he said, "labor costs in Manhattan go up and pull labor costs outside of Manhattan along with them."
For Mr. Muss and his family, it was the city's arduous zoning process -- and the recession -- that had them yanking their hair while trying to develop Captain's Quarters, a 269-unit complex of town houses in the Prince's Bay section of Staten Island.
The land was purchased in 1963, with plans once calling for a project -- including an adjacent site -- of 1,200 units. "But we redesigned 26 times at the Planning Commission's insistence," Mr. Muss said. "Finally, we got into the ground in 1985."
Sales of the $225,000, three-bedroom homes started in 1986, Mr. Muss said, but came to a halt two years later because of the recession. "The last house was completed last year, and the last house was sold two months ago," he said.
"You're talking about an odyssey for 269 units that started 35 years ago."
Because of those kinds of obstacles, Frank Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a policy research organization, estimates that "to build unsubsidized housing, the rents have to come in at about $1,200 for a one-bedroom and $1,600 for a two-bedroom in order to cover your costs."
Mr. Braconi cited several other factors that add to construction costs. "Environmental cleanups, that's part of it," he said. "The legal difficulties in relocating tenants; they're greater than in nonregulated cities."
In Chicago, for example, Mr. Braconi said: "If a builder wants to redevelop a site with new or more housing, he lets the current leases expire, empties the building and builds. But in New York, you can't do that because of our rent regulations.
"I'm not a big critic of rent regulation," he said. "I think, overall, it's a good thing that people have protections. But that doesn't mean that the protections aren't an obstacle to new housing."
As far as Mr. Belson is concerned, there are currently only two ways to build in the other boroughs without subsidies. The first is to rehabilitate an existing site, "so that the construction costs would be 50 percent below new construction costs," he said.
The second is what Mr. Belson calls "creative compaction."
"It means that instead of having a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom apartment, you'll now have 775 square feet," he said. "You're not going to get the old-fashioned foyer at the exterior door. You have to creatively compact to reduce the ultimate cost to the tenant." Mr. Belson agrees that, because of the constraints, "we're losing the middle class."
"Like when you squeeze a tube of toothpaste," he said, "people leave the five boroughs. You've got Jersey City, Hoboken; that portion of New Jersey will become the sixth borough."
To ease the squeeze on the middle class -- a bit -- the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has launched a Middle-Income Housing Initiative. Under the program, the city's Housing Development Corporation is issuing taxable bonds to provide subsidies of up to $20,000 a unit to help develop housing above 96th Street in Manhattan and in the other boroughs.
BUT it is just a start. And, to begin with, the initiative will subsidize only about 1,000 units. Still, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, Richard T. Roberts, is hopeful of a sustained impact. "It's the first concentrated effort the city has made to spur development of middle-income housing since the end of the Mitchell-Lama Program," he said. "Depending on its success, we hope to be able to pursue and expand the program."
Mr. Rose, the city's Planning Commissioner, is also optimistic.
Asked if housing can be built in the boroughs outside of Manhattan without subsidies, he said, "The answer is yes, it can and is being done."
"We're already seeing interest in the construction of new multifamily housing in the boroughs," Mr. Rose said. "Yes, market-rate stuff that's a function of the real estate market in those boroughs coming back to where it once was.
"It's not going to match Manhattan prices," Mr. Rose conceded, "but there is a great deal of interest" in building in Flushing, Staten Island, Williamsburg and southern Brooklyn.
Of the deficit in completed units, Mr. Rose said, "Clearly, we can and should be doing better than even our current improved numbers."
And asked what it would take to create a sustainable, healthy market that keeps that gap closed, he said: "We have to make significant reforms to the regulatory obstacles. We have to make available for residential use whatever unused land we do have, much of it now in abandoned manufacturing areas" -- an initiative that would have to address the fears of adjacent residents about high-rise development.
"And with a little bit of assistance through existing mechanisms, the market can achieve numbers that meet that test."
"Of course," Mr. Rose added, "the availability of financing is crucial."

With Proposed Gas-Tax Boost, a New Push for Self-Service

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
New Jersey was not alone when it banned self-service gasoline in 1949. Many states decided that they did not want to encourage this oil-company innovation, citing safety issues. In 1968, 23 states still had bans; by 1977, with the development of safer pumps, all but New Jersey and Oregon had dropped their objections.
For the moment, New Jersey and Oregon are standing firm. A legislative assault on Oregon's ban withered last year. Trenton has decided to keep the ban several times in the last two decades, debating it usually when gas prices are increasing at the pump and consumers cast about for ways to save. 
 But even though gas prices have dipped below a dollar a gallon, the issue has started to simmer again because of Governor Whitman's request for a referendum on raising the state's gas tax by 7 cents per gallon. The increase would be used to improve the state's roads and bridges and to safeguard its dwindling open space.
Asked about the proposed tax increase, Jim Minugh, a Sayreville steel worker who was putting $10 worth of gas in his Toyota pickup at a New Jersey Turnpike rest stop last week, said: "I don't have a problem with that. But as far as self-serve, only if they cut the prices. If they don't they might as well keep service."
Mr. Minugh also said he was mystified about how gasoline prices were set now.
In fact, the price at the pump reflects several elements. Federal taxes of 18.5 cents per gallon are standard, but state gasoline taxes vary. New Jersey has one of the nation's lowest, at 10.5 cents per gallon, to which it adds a gross receipts tax of 4 cents a gallon, making the total state take 14.5 cents. The Governor's suggestion would bring the tax to 21.5 cents per gallon.
But taxes are not the only source of price differences. Gasoline companies charge varying prices depending on octane, additives, region, demand, and competition. Distributors and dealers do the same. None want to let the public entirely in on their costs and profits, so the picture of the system remains hazy in the corners. As a spokeswoman for Coastal, Vicky Gunnewig, put it: "We don't discuss any price-related issues. It's a very volatilely priced commodity."
The price starts with crude oil, which is cheap these days at less than $15 a barrel, compared with about $25 a barrel last year. The low price is a result of surpluses, according to James Van Alen, an oil analyst for the investment firm of Janny Montgomery Scott. Mild weather allowed stockpiles to increase, Mr. Van Alen said, and the Asian economic crisis depressed demand.
The wholesale price of refined gasoline, before state and Federal taxes, can vary significantly from region to region, which most analysts say is the result of differing transportation costs and competitive environments. William Dressler of the New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association said a pre-tax gallon of regular Mobil gas is 54.10 cents for a dealer in Newark but 50.10 cents in Paulsboro, a Philadelphia suburb.
Gasoline companies, sometimes via a distributor, send their gasoline to one of three kinds of gas station: those that they operate directly, those that they contract managers for, and, most common, the independent franchisee. (There are also unbranded stations that buy daily or weekly from different distributors, sometimes directly from tankers in New York Harbor.)
Dealers pay the pre-tax price, additional markups, and Federal and state gas taxes. Buyers at the pump pay that price plus the dealer's markup, which can be as small as one or two cents a gallon up to a dime or more. That's where self-service is supposed to reduce prices: if the dealer doesn't have to hire attendants, the thinking goes, his overhead goes down.
That is the point of view of gasoline companies represented by the New Jersey Petroleum Council. The council says customers deserve a choice, and prices would drop by several cents per gallon. "It seems to work in 48 states," said John Maxwell, the council's associate director.
But the independent operators of gasoline franchises, represented by the Gasoline Retailers' Association, fear that self-serve would not reduce their costs as much as competition would require. Mr. Dressler also talks about "pretty ladies" who might spill gas on their "nice dresses," or who might get attacked at a self-serve pump "with no attendant around to protect them."
But he also has arguments that don't evoke images of an inept June Cleaver or "Nightmare on Elm Street." The association estimates that the state's 3,800 independently operated gas stations employ an average of four attendants each, a total of 15,200 jobs that would be jeopardized by self-service. Self-service adds physical barriers for elderly drivers and those with disabilities, and can add financial barriers, too, because the price differential escalates rapidly when full-service is just an option.
The average differential is 10 to 20 cents, according to a national study by Charles Romeo, an assistant professor of economics at Rutgers. But the range can be much greater. In Pennsylvania, according to Ross DiBono, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Gasoline Retailers Association, the difference runs from 8 cents to 40 or 50 cents per gallon.
In a measure of the complexity of the issue, the state's two large drivers' groups are split.
"We've never been able to get a commitment that the prices would actually drop," said Pamela Fischer, a spokeswoman for AAA New Jersey, which has fought to keep the ban. "And unless it's going to benefit the motorist's pocketbook, what good is it?"
The New Jersey branch of the the National Motorists Association wants to remove the ban. Steve Carrellas, an association spokesman, said speed and control are more important than price.
"I think people do want the choice," he said. "You can still have a law requiring the station to have someone there to handle the pump, which would be good for seniors and the handicapped. And you could make it that the dealer can only charge one price per grade of gasoline, and that price would reflect the cost of the station owner to maintain some level of full service."
One way or another, many people are convinced that New Jersey can't hold onto mandatory full-service forever. Even Anthony Smith, a third-generation station owner in Newark who makes sure his customers get their windshields washed and their oil checked, said he thought self-serve was inevitable.
"I don't think it's price," he said. "It's the option to serve yourself, or be served."

Lamb, Succulent With Spices and Figs

BYLINE: By MOIRA HODGSON

 BODY:
WHEN I was growing up in England, the traditional dish for a spring Sunday lunch was roast lamb. It was, of course, served well done (the children always fought over who got the crispy bit at the end of the joint -- and very crisp it was, too). The meat was gray and rather dry, and with it fresh mint sauce, peas and new potatoes from the garden were handed around the table. It was one of my favorite meals.
But several years later, in a modest French bistro in New York City, I made the startling discovery of roast lamb served pink. The meat was not accompanied by potatoes but by flageolets, and instead of mint sauce, there was lamb just flavored with red wine. The whole plate reeked of garlic, and it was wonderful. 
 From then on, roast lamb entered the repertory of my no-fail dinner party dishes, and it was always larded with a good deal of garlic. Sometimes I wrap the leg in anchovies (which lose their sharp taste when cooked) or in a paste of mustard, yogurt and olive oil, sometimes both. Roast lamb was -- and still is -- both easy and economical (especially since a cheaper grade of meat like choice, which has less fat, can be used).
When the weather is warm enough for the outdoor grill, leg of lamb can be boned and cooked over the coals. It is especially good marinated in a mixture of Moroccan spices, which make a smoky crust, and served in slices on a bed of mint leaves.
Matthew Kenney, the chef and owner of Matthew's and Monzu Restaurants in Manhattan, also uses Moroccan spices with lamb, cooked in a tagine. He stews the shank with spices and figs and sprinkles it with cilantro, toasted almonds and sesame seeds. This is a great party dish, served on a bed of couscous with grilled vegetables or salad on the side.
 
Roast Marinated Leg of Lamb
Total Time: 1 1/2 hours cooking
plus overnight marinating
 
 1leg of lamb, about six pounds
 2tablespoons Dijon mustard
 1cup plain yogurt
 2tablespoons soy sauce
 1/4cup olive oil
 6cloves garlic, minced
 2tablespoons grated orange peel
 1/2cup fresh rosemary leaves
 Freshly ground pepper and coarse sea salt to taste.
1. The previous evening, wipe the lamb dry with paper towels and scrape off any blue markings and fat. In a small bowl, combine mustard, yogurt, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, orange peel, rosemary and pepper. Spread mixture evenly over the lamb, then wrap it in foil in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Bring lamb to room temperature before cooking it. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Season lamb with salt and put on a rack. Roast it for 15 minutes. Turn heat down to 375 degrees and roast it for 9 to 11 minutes a pound for rare, 12 to 15 minutes a pound for medium.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
 
Butterflied Leg of Lamb Grilled Moroccan Style
Total Time: 30 minutes plus marinating
 
 16- to 7-pound leg of lamb, boned so that it lies flat
 1/2cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1tablespoon ground ginger
 1tablespoon ground coriander
 1tablespoon ground cumin
 1tablespoon Hungarian paprika
 3cloves garlic, minced
 Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 3cups fresh mint leaves, left whole but with stalks removed.
1. The previous evening or at least two hours before cooking the lamb, wipe it dry with paper towels and remove as much fat as possible. In a small bowl combine olive oil, ginger, coriander, cumin, paprika and garlic. Spread mixture evenly over lamb. If marinating overnight, wrap it in foil and refrigerate it, otherwise leave at room temperature.
2. Preheat grill or coals until they are very hot. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and put on rack to cook. Do not be alarmed if flames erupt, caused by lamb fat pouring off. Cook the lamb for seven to eight minutes on each side. The meat should be done then if you like your lamb on the rare side. If you like it more well done, cook it longer (about 12 minutes on each side). The lamb should be browned on the outside but remain pink in the middle. If you cook it too long, the meat will turn out gray and dry.
3. Let the lamb rest for five minutes, then cut it in thin slices with a sharp knife. Spread mint leaves over a serving platter and arrange the slices of lamb on top.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
 
Lamb Tagine With Dried Figs And Almonds
Total Time: 2 1/2 hours
 
 1/4cup sesame seeds
 1/2cup sliced almonds
 2tablespoons olive oil
 2 1/2pounds boned lamb shoulder, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
 Coarse sea salt and freshly
 ground black pepper
 2cloves garlic, minced
 1medium onion, chopped
 1teaspoon ground cumin
 1teaspoon ground cardamom
 1teaspoon turmeric
 1teaspoon ground chili pepper like Ancho, or chili powder
 1cup dried figs, quartered
 4tablespoons chopped cilantro plus 8 sprigs cilantro.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put sesame seeds on a small sheet pan or pie plate and toast in oven for six minutes. Add almonds and toast another 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Set aside.
2. Put olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Brown on all sides in two batches, about 10 to 12 minutes total. Add garlic, onion, cumin, cardamom, turmeric and chili powder to the lamb. Stir well and reduce heat to medium low. Cook for five minutes. Add two and two-thirds cups water and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for one and a half hours, or until meat is tender. It should be slightly springy but easy to pull apart with your fingers.
3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Strain liquid from the stew into small saucepan or bowl and skim fat. Adjust seasoning and keep warm. Mix meat and figs and spread in a single layer in an ovenproof serving dish. Pour sauce over meat and figs and sprinkle with almonds. Bake 12 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped cilantro and garnish with cilantro sprigs. Serve from hot dish.
Yield: 4 servings.

The meat was not accompanied by potatoes but by flageolets, and instead of mint sauce, there was lamb just flavored with red wine. The whole plate reeked of garlic, and it was wonderful. 
 From then on, roast lamb entered the repertory of my no-fail dinner party dishes, and it was always larded with a good deal of garlic. Sometimes I wrap the leg in anchovies (which lose their sharp taste when cooked) or in a paste of mustard, yogurt and olive oil, sometimes both. Roast lamb was -- and still is -- both easy and economical (especially since a cheaper grade of meat like choice, which has less fat, can be used).
When the weather is warm enough for the outdoor grill, leg of lamb can be boned and cooked over the coals. It is especially good marinated in a mixture of Moroccan spices, which make a smoky crust, and served in slices on a bed of mint leaves.
Matthew Kenney, the chef and owner of Matthew's and Monzu Restaurants in Manhattan, also uses Moroccan spices with lamb, cooked in a tagine. He stews the shank with spices and figs and sprinkles it with cilantro, toasted almonds and sesame seeds. This is a great party dish, served on a bed of couscous with grilled vegetables or salad on the side.
 
Roast Marinated Leg of Lamb
Total Time: 1 1/2 hours cooking
plus overnight marinating
 
 1leg of lamb, about six pounds
 2tablespoons Dijon mustard
 1cup plain yogurt
 2tablespoons soy sauce
 1/4cup olive oil
 6cloves garlic, minced
 2tablespoons grated orange peel
 1/2cup fresh rosemary leaves
 Freshly ground pepper and coarse sea salt to taste.
1. The previous evening, wipe the lamb dry with paper towels and scrape off any blue markings and fat. In a small bowl, combine mustard, yogurt, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, orange peel, rosemary and pepper. Spread mixture evenly over the lamb, then wrap it in foil in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Bring lamb to room temperature before cooking it. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Season lamb with salt and put on a rack. Roast it for 15 minutes. Turn heat down to 375 degrees and roast it for 9 to 11 minutes a pound for rare, 12 to 15 minutes a pound for medium.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
 
Butterflied Leg of Lamb Grilled Moroccan Style
Total Time: 30 minutes plus marinating
 
 16- to 7-pound leg of lamb, boned so that it lies flat
 1/2cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1tablespoon ground ginger
 1tablespoon ground coriander
 1tablespoon ground cumin
 1tablespoon Hungarian paprika
 3cloves garlic, minced
 Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 3cups fresh mint leaves, left whole but with stalks removed.
1. The previous evening or at least two hours before cooking the lamb, wipe it dry with paper towels and remove as much fat as possible. In a small bowl combine olive oil, ginger, coriander, cumin, paprika and garlic. Spread mixture evenly over lamb. If marinating overnight, wrap it in foil and refrigerate it, otherwise leave at room temperature.
2. Preheat grill or coals until they are very hot. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and put on rack to cook. Do not be alarmed if flames erupt, caused by lamb fat pouring off. Cook the lamb for seven to eight minutes on each side. The meat should be done then if you like your lamb on the rare side. If you like it more well done, cook it longer (about 12 minutes on each side). The lamb should be browned on the outside but remain pink in the middle. If you cook it too long, the meat will turn out gray and dry.
3. Let the lamb rest for five minutes, then cut it in thin slices with a sharp knife. Spread mint leaves over a serving platter and arrange the slices of lamb on top.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
 
Lamb Tagine With Dried Figs And Almonds
Total Time: 2 1/2 hours

Lamb, Succulent With Spices and Figs

BYLINE: By MOIRA HODGSON 

 BODY:
WHEN I was growing up in England, the traditional dish for a spring Sunday lunch was roast lamb. It was, of course, served well done (the children always fought over who got the crispy bit at the end of the joint -- and very crisp it was, too). The meat was gray and rather dry, and with it fresh mint sauce, peas and new potatoes from the garden were handed around the table. It was one of my favorite meals.
But several years later, in a modest French bistro in New York City, I made the startling discovery of roast lamb served pink. The meat was not accompanied by potatoes but by flageolets, and instead of mint sauce, there was lamb just flavored with red wine. The whole plate reeked of garlic, and it was wonderful.

Will a New Association Give Insurers a Kinder Face?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
WITH trumpets and drum flourishes, the life insurance industry has rolled out a new organization intended to burnish its soiled reputation and convince Americans that it really is safe to do business with its agents.
Most of the industry's leading companies have joined the group, called the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association. Members gain the right to include in their advertisements the organization's bull's-eye logo, which the group hopes will come to be regarded as a kind of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on policies. 
 But consumer advocates are skeptical that the group will change the way insurance agents operate or succeed in diminishing an image of scheming, cheating rascals that has haunted the industry with millions of unhappy policyholders seeking redress through lawsuits. "I'm afraid it's just going to be cosmetic," said J. Robert Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner who is now director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America.
There may be good reason for the skepticism. The guiding principles of the association boil down to these: treat customers fairly, don't criticize the competition and assign someone to make sure the company is following the rules. Most insurance companies always espoused these goals, even as some agents were selling policies that delivered considerably less than promised.
Moreover, while individual companies must establish written policies and assign people to monitor compliance, the association has no mechanism to discipline members that fail to live up to its standards. It relies on a company's self-assessment and a review by a team of outside examiners -- paid by the company -- to determine eligibility. And so far, it has not rejected any of the 170 companies that have applied.
"Given the recent history of the insurance industry," Mr. Hunter said, "if you're not saying some people don't meet our standards, something's wrong."
Some of the biggest life insurers have paid millions of dollars in settlements arising from customer complaints. Some customers said agents had disguised insurance as retirement plans; others said they were falsely promised that they could receive added coverage at no extra cost or that, in a few years, premiums would vanish and policies would pay for themselves. In the biggest case, the Prudential Insurance Company of America has paid more than $70 million in fines and expects to pay customers up to $2 billion in settlement claims.
Robert R. Googins, executive director of the association, acknowledged that its guiding principles were not new to insurance or commerce in general. But he said he thought that formally pledging honesty and service to customers, rather than assuming them as vague, historical virtues, would reassure the public and lead companies to re-examine whether they were practicing what their founders preached.
Some 170 companies -- representing 64 percent of the individual life insurance business and 54 percent of annuities -- have joined the group since it started in April. Mr. Googins said there were signs that attaining membership in the group had improved sales and service procedures.
To get started, companies have to work their way through a 191-page handbook, create or update policies, assign specific responsibility for the policies and ultimately be able to answer "yes" to 162 questions.
"When people started turning the pages of the assessment handbook, they found things that they weren't doing all the time or that they weren't doing at all," said Mr. Googins, a former insurance commissioner in Connecticut. "It was kind of an eye-opener in terms of, 'Gee, we just assumed we were doing these things.' But there were a lot of gaps."
The reviews have taken months, Mr. Googins said, and the independent assessments for each company have cost as much as several hundred thousand dollars. The group requires that both examinations be repeated every three years. But, he said, "the real cost of this program is all the effort and time required for the continued maintenance of the policies and procedures and the staffing."
Mr. Googins considers it a virtue that no one who has applied has been turned away. Under the association's rules, companies do not apply and then go through the examination. Instead, they see whether they measure up, then apply -- or not, if they don't. "But," he said, "if a company is serious, it would make the necessary changes and then apply."
In keeping with the glacial pace of the industry, it took four years to create the association and work out the guidelines.
The new standards apply exclusively to life insurance and annuity sales and do not include other products sold by the companies, like health or disability insurance. They also do not address the perennial complaint of customers that policy language is impenetrable.
Joseph M. Belth, a professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University and the editor of The Insurance Forum, a monthly newsletter about the industry, said he doubted that the association would have much effect because it failed to address what he regards as fundamental shortcomings: companies' persistent unwillingness, for example, to disclose the annual cost of insurance for every $1,000 of coverage, or the extra cost of paying premiums monthly or quarterly instead of annually.
Even organizations that work closely with the industry are cautious in their assessment of the association. "It's a step in the right direction," said Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A. M. Best & Company, an insurance company rating agency. "But there is a difference between having a structure in place and making sure that structure is effective. Time will tell whether the structure and controls are effective."


GRAPHIC: Advocates of a trickle-down economy may have found a new reason to crow: Largely because of the booming financial markets, charitable giving rose 7.5 percent in 1997, the biggest increase this decade.
Chart: "Giving More, But Not Till It Hurts"
 According to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy, Americans contributed $143.5 billion to nonprofit organizations last year, up from a revised $133.5 billion in 1996. Moreover, giving rose in all four donor categories: individuals, up 6.8 percent; bequests, 10 percent; foundations, 11.4 percent, and corporations, 7.5 percent.
 Personal giving -- combining individual giving and bequests --constitutes 85 percent of the total.
But that is at the low end of the range for the last 30 years; in 1975, such donations peaked at 90.2 percent of total giving.
 Similarly, the $143.5 billion in total giving, while a record, represents 1.8 percent of the gross domestic product, below the top of the 30-year range: roughly 2.1 percent from 1967 through 1972. Had last year's giving equaled that rate, total giving would have neared $170 billion.

Revival Yes, Parking No

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
Late last year, the city opened a one-stop payment center for people to pay tax bills, parking fines and the like in a vacant factory on 94th Avenue. But there was limited space for parking -- only 50 spots for an estimated 251 employees and 1,200 daily visitors, many of them drivers headed to a Parking Violations Bureau hearing room.
"These people come to pay fines and they can't find parking, so you get a ticket while paying a ticket," said David Boord, co-chairman of the Coalition for Public Parking, a group formed six months ago to lobby for more parking lots and garages in downtown Jamaica. 
 Richard LoConte, a spokesman for the Department of Finance, said that he was aware of the parking problems but that the lot for 50 cars was the only space available there. Besides, he said, the area is a transportation hub, so people can get there by train or bus.
Mr. Boord and others say the government offices that have moved in, helping rejuvenate downtown Jamaica in the last five years, are competing for parking with businesses, an issue first reported in The Queens Tribune.
In the 56 square blocks of Jamaica's business district, there are a total of 41 city, state and Federal agencies, with more on the way. Yet many of these agencies have provided minimal or no parking for their workers and clients, forcing them to use the metered municipal lots that businesses rely on for customers.
A study last year done for the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a nonprofit economic development group that oversees some parking lots, found that a shortfall of 221 parking spaces downtown. And in five years, the study said, the area will have a shortage of 1,500.
"It's a horrible situation for merchants," Chuck Wallace, the director of a Toys "R" Us on Jamaica Avenue, said. "With limited parking, you don't get that big-ticket item going out the door. It's kind of hard to take a bike or jungle gym on a bus."
Until Borough President Claire Shulman intervened this month, 86 of the 256 spaces in the municipal lot behind the toy store were used by police officers from the 103d Precinct. They now park their personal cars at a former tow pound nearby. But the municipal lot is still often full, especially on weekdays. Some 2,000 people either work at or visit the state offices that are in the same building as Toys "R" Us.
Two weeks ago, members of the Coalition for Public Parking met with people from the Mayor's office. Curt Ritter, a mayoral spokesman, said the city was working on a plan, but would not reveal details.
The coalition has also written to other government officials, urging them to consider the need for parking when agencies move into the area. The new Civil Court on Sutphin Boulevard, for example, resulted in a net loss of more than 238 parking spaces, the group said.
"I know people from Jamaica who travel out of the city to take advantage of the free parking," Mr. Boord said. "And jobs and tax money go with them." RICHARD WEIR

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Insider Sales Don't Always Burn Outsiders in I.P.O.'s

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
IF the cockpit crew dons parachutes before the plane even leaves the gate, prudent passengers may want to avoid the flight. But such logic doesn't necessarily apply to investments in new stock offerings.
The rush of initial public offerings in recent years has included substantial amounts of insider selling -- sales of stock held by corporate executives and private shareholders who are bailing out or greatly reducing their stakes. Such sales are often taken as a sign that insiders know something horrible lurks ahead that could trounce the stock. 
 Yet a study of offerings since 1993, compiled by Commscan, an investment research firm in New York, shows that shares of these I.P.O.'s have, as a group, outperformed initial offerings in which all the stock offered was newly issued by the companies.
The effect is not limited to initial offerings. Subsequent stock offerings that included insider selling of shares also outperformed those that did not, the study shows.
Michael Kim, the Commscan analyst who conducted the study, said the results surprised him. "Contrary to everyone's assumptions, a deleterious effect from insider selling can't be assumed," he said.
The study's data base "doesn't point to any specific factors, nothing about the companies themselves" that could account for the surprising results, Mr. Kim said, and he was unwilling to speculate about causes. "There could be hundreds of different reasons," he said.
Analysts said they found the Commscan study's results intriguing and contrarian, especially given other studies showing that many initial offerings disappoint investors.
"Three out of four I.P.O.'s trade below their offering price within the first 12 months," said Michael Murphy, a technology-stock investor and money manager in Half Moon Bay, Calif., who publishes a newsletter on stocks he considers overvalued. "Performance from either the offering price or first trade has been pretty poor."
Others said the Commscan study might have unintentionally masked some important distinctions among insider sales in offerings.
Some spinoffs, for example, are counted as insider-included sales. When a company separates out a business and hands it over to shareholders, the main aim is to unlock or improve the value of the business, and some recent spinoffs have been huge successes.
And company executives or large shareholders who put their shares on the block in initial offerings could have many reasons for bailing out: portfolio diversification, personal cash needs, a child's tuition.
"Insider selling covers a whole lot of variables when talking about I.P.O.'s," said Robert Mescal, editor of New Issues, a monthly newsletter about new offerings published by the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield Beach, Fla. "It may be that the chief executive has agreed to leave with the I.P.O. That's insider selling, but it isn't done with malice."
NONETHELESS, Mr. Mescal said, prospective buyers should scrutinize insider selling. "My first question is, 'What do you know that I don't know?' " he said. "My thought always is that retail investors, the little guys like you and me, are at the mercy of everything. Read the prospectus if there's any doubt in your mind."
The prospectus will not specify why inside shareholders are selling, only whether the proceeds of the sale will go to the company. But the prospectus reveals other useful information about the insiders.
John Fitzgibbon, editor of IPO Reporter, a weekly newsletter based in New York that focuses on the new-offering market, said it is important to look for the number of shares that insiders keep after the offering, which can be a good indicator of their confidence in the company's future.
Perhaps more important, Mr. Fitzgibbon said, is the so-called lockup period, or how many days after the offering insiders are prohibited from further selling. That period is normally 180 days, but insiders can seek a waiver. "That's the big cautionary flag, if these insiders come back and say, 'I want to sell,' " he said. "It sets off the alarm bells, like that old gauge in the boiler room. You'd best look at it."
Dan Dykens, an analyst at the Renaissance Capital Corporation in Greenwich, Conn., which runs a mutual fund that invests in new offerings, said smart investors were likely to be wary of insider selling regardless of the reasons given.
"I think the classical or traditional outlook is, if they own the business, and they're confident it's such a great business, then why are they selling?" Mr. Dykens said.
These assertions were not disputed by Mr. Kim of Commscan, who said his study merely showed that insider selling wasn't necessarily a bad omen.
"Just because you hear that a large shareholder is selling, you can't assume the company's stock will do poorly because of that," he said. "I think that's the only reasonable conclusion you can draw."

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Herald Square, Swing District

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
THE portly man struck the golf ball with a stiff swipe, and the sound of metal striking plastic brought to mind green fairways, wind in the trees and money. But the man was not on the seventh hole of some exclusive country club. He was at the New York Golf Center on 35th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway.
"I will buy this," the man, Ignacio Cruz, an insurance executive from Madrid, said as he pointed to the club he was using -- the Biggest Big Bertha, $290 from Callaway. "I'm a regular client of this store." 
 There are successful golf shops all over the city, but in recent years the Herald Square area has become a particular hotbed. There are five retailers between 32d and 35th Streets, all small oases of green carpeting for tourists from foreign countries where equipment is either scarce or extremely expensive, and for city dwellers marooned far from a regulation course.
Available in each store are shiny new clubs fanned out against the walls, stacks of brightly colored boxes of balls, small putting greens, and areas for taking practice swings. There are usually a few female shoppers, but it is men who use the stores as hangouts, hefting clubs and exaggerating their weekend exploits. Many prefer not to be identified, saying their bosses and wives might not understand.
But on Wednesday Peter Amoruso was happy to talk. "My golf clubs are my girlfriends," said Mr. Amoruso, who lives and works in midtown and pops into the Golf Center five days a week. "Coming here, it gives you a big-time fix. You see friends, you say hello and talk about equipment."
"They know I do this at the office," he went on. "It's therapy. If I don't do this, I'm pulling my hair out."
The West 30's wasn't always a golf neighborhood. The pioneer was Golf Trading, which opened in the 1960's on 35th Street west of Fifth Avenue. In the early 80's, the name was changed to Larry's Golf, after the owner at the time, Larry Zimmerman, who has since retired to Florida.
In the beginning, as now, the West Side's lure for owners was cheaper real estate than on the East Side, and the fact that the West 30's, also home to the Empire State Building and Macy's, is well traveled by two golf-loving constituencies: tourists and business people.
"It's because of the tourists," said Rangsima Naganidhi, whose husband, Nick, took over Larry's Golf in 1996 and changed the name to Nick's Golf. "Most of the customers we have are regulars from Asia and Europe."
After Larry's came the Golf Center, which opened in 1983. Golf Town followed in 1990, on 32d Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Eagle Golf opened in 1992 on Avenue of the Americas between 36th and 37th Streets. Three years ago, Fifth Avenue Golf Trends opened, just east of the avenue on 32d Street. For the last year the neighborhood has even had a golf teacher, Mark Lozier, who works out of a studio on 32d Street.
Part of the explanation for this cluster of golf activity is cultural. The West 30's is often referred to as the city's Koreatown, and all five shops are owned by people of Korean, Japanese or Thai descent who said that about half their business comes from Asian and European customers.
Peter Choi, a Korean-American who owns Golf Town, said that the Asian ownership was no coincidence. "Koreans, Japanese and other Asians are crazy about golf," he explained. "When they come here they buy the house, then the car and then the golf clubs."
Spend a few hours at any of the stores and you will see customers spending $1,000 for a set of irons or $400 for a single driver, or both. Some of the owners estimated that they average about 150 transactions a day, with more during the summer and Christmas seasons.
But several owners complained that business had become more difficult in the last five years. And having so many stores so close together does not make it any easier.
"There is a lot of competition among the stores," said Herb Rhee, who with his brother, Charles, runs the Golf Center, which is owned by their father, Sam. "Then all the stores lower their prices and no one can make a profit from selling clubs. The stores are being stupid, and no one can make any money. It is getting saturated like the electronics business."
Ms. Naganidhi of Nick's Golf agreed. "People shop around, so you have to bargain, and the profit margins are very small," she said, adding that her store concentrated on selling used clubs, something that the others don't much do.
Asia's recent economic problems have made matters worse, reducing the number of customers throughout the West 30's golf hub, the store owners said. Although all said they were doing fine, no one would discuss sales figures. And Golf Town's owner, Mr. Choi, said of the five stores: "I think one or two may go. Or they may sell to someone else."
"People get into this because they love golf," Charles Rhee said. "Then they find out that this is a tough business."
But to the customers, the stores' bottom lines are beside the point. They visit to forget about business. "I'm thinking maybe I'll get my wife to buy me this putter," said Murray Sarway, a tan executive in a tan suit who was looking at a $399 club at the Golf Center. "I find that golf soothes my mind. It takes away the pressure."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
An Emerging-Markets Bog: Time to Wade In Again?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
MAY was a rough month for emerging markets, which are proving once again that they can turn sour on a dime.
The Russian RTS index fell 38.8 percent. In Indonesia, the Jakarta composite index was off 8.6 percent after dropping 15 percent the month before. The South Korean Kospi index dropped 20.5 percent. And the contagion spread to Latin America, where Mexico's Bolsa dropped 11.2 percent. 
 So what was Mark Mobius, the managing director of Templeton Asset Management, doing?
He was in Moscow last week, beginning to sift through the rubble of the stock market there to find bargains for his closed-end Templeton Russia fund, whose share price is off 32 percent this year after a 78 percent gain in 1997. He was also snapping up Russian GKO's, akin to Treasury bills, that were paying annual interest rates of 70 percent and more.
That is Mr. Mobius's job. He is supposed to make the best of a crisis. And he would be happy for investors to send money his way. But heed what he says about the values that he thinks he can find now, in Russia and in other emerging markets that have recently collapsed: "These returns may take a year or two to materialize."
And though he is sifting, he remains cautious about the outlook. Before Russia's market crashed, Mr. Mobius thought the market was overpriced, given the risk involved. So he had a third of his Russia fund's assets in cash, an unusually high percentage for a closed-end stock fund. He is usually fully invested in stocks.
In the big picture, it is not important that Russia appeared to set off the latest round of routs in emerging markets. Many face serious problems, and ripples from any one market are usually felt near and far.
But it was the Russian central bank's move to raise official interest rates to a staggering 150 percent that got the most attention last week. The bank made a bold effort to defend the country's currency, the ruble, and stave off economic chaos; the jury is still out on its effectiveness, and the outlook remained dicey at week's end.
Traders and strategists continued to debate whether the International Monetary Fund, the United States or others would come up with a new rescue package to avoid a crippling currency devaluation. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Russia's credit rating. Monetary fund officials released $670 million in previously promised cash but said they were not considering a separate new package of money for Russia.
Constance Hunter, a portfolio manager for Firebird Management L.L.C., which runs three hedge funds investing in equities and bonds in the countries of the former Soviet Union, said investors believed that "if the currency goes, it is going to go in the next two or three weeks," judging by the high levels that short-term interest rates have reached in recent days.
Ripples were coming from other markets, too. Thousands of workers went on strike to protest growing layoffs in South Korea. Indonesia's new president, B. J. Habibie, struggled to win confidence in his approach to reform. Pakistan set off five underground nuclear tests, heightening tensions with India and disapproving Western nations. The continued weakening of the Japanese yen cast more doubt on Japan's ability to lead Asia out of the economic doldrums.
But some investors may decide that caution is not the wisest course. Emerging markets have a habit of rebounding sharply.
Investors were warned away from the developing world after the Mexican peso was devalued and emerging markets collapsed at the end of 1994. The United States worked out a bailout package in March 1995, and by July the Bolsa recouped all it had lost since December. A cautious investor might have missed much of that rally.
Many bullish investors seem to be assuming the same will happen in Russia: The I.M.F. and the United States will not let the ruble be devalued, they say, and will do whatever is needed to sustain it.
"The market is leaning toward believing that the I.M.F. will come up with another bailout," said Richard Segal, the fixed-income strategist in the proprietary trading unit of Santander Investment Securities in London. He said investors, traders and strategists considered Russia so important that the United States and its allies would dare not let it fail, and the I.M.F. would have a hard time turning Russia down after making loans to Indonesia and South Korea.
But he said a Russian bailout would mean "more investors will invest in risky countries," a criticism leveled at other bailouts.
Mr. Mobius, not counting on such a bailout, said he was looking for stocks that would not be seriously hurt by a devaluation of the ruble. Such companies would include exporters that are paid in foreign currencies and domestic companies with little foreign-currency debt.
A bailout would probably lead to a quick rebound in Russia. But the other bailouts the I.M.F. undertook in Asia last year benefited markets only temporarily.
Since a bailout of Thailand was announced in August, the main stock index there has fallen almost 50 percent. In Indonesia, the stock market fell after the first outlines of a rescue plan emerged at the end of October. The market then rallied early in the year but is now down 24 percent from its February high. In South Korea, the Kospi index traveled a similar road, falling after a bailout was readied in December, then rallying strongly at the beginning of the year, only to sag 42 percent since March.
Desmond Lachman, the head of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney, is more worried than many money managers. "My view on emerging markets is fairly bearish, but not because of Russia," he said.
"Russia gets bailed out," he predicted. "It is Asia that is the problem."
He said he expected the yen to keep sliding, making the stabilization of the rest of Asia more difficult because Japan would not be the buyer that helped lift the other countries out of their slumps.
Ms. Hunter of Firebird Management said investors should remember how quickly things can change in emerging markets.
At the beginning of the year, betting that the Russian market would decline, she made money selling some stocks short so she could buy them back later at lower prices. She had a 15 percent gain in the first quarter. But she started betting on a rally in March. "In retrospect, we should have waited," she said. "But in March things looked better."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Declarations of Independence;
The New American Spirit: Divided We Stand

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
MERGER mania may be running amok in the world of commerce, but in the world of civics the opposite seems to be happening. Cities and counties dotting the country are in the grip of secession fever.
In California, the San Fernando Valley has been brazenly unfaithful to the city of Los Angeles, doing all it can to get a divorce. 
 Last month in New York, the rural East End of Long Island filed suit, trying to force the State Legislature to allow it to secede from Suffolk County and form Peconic County.
In Maine, a legislator submitted a bill last year seeking to study the feasibility of making northern Maine the 51st state.
A Maryland lawmaker recently asked his Legislature to let Eastern Shore residents decide if they want to form their own state.
And in March, seeking attention over a nettlesome fishing dispute, people in a sliver of Minnesota called the Northwest Angle got their Congressman to propose a constitutional amendment allowing them to secede from the United States and join Canada.
Taking a cue, perhaps, from places like Scotland and Quebec, break-up talk is bleeding into legislatures and city halls. Some of it is intended to draw attention to neglected issues. But most of it stems from a serious desire for more local autonomy.
 
Breaking Away
Even so, as Staten Island learned in its failed secession battle five years ago, these movements have dim prospects because they usually must be approved by governing bodies of the very places they want to leave.
The only movement currently given a fighting chance is in the San Fernando Valley, the suburban sprawl of 1.4 million people that spawned the nasally hip Valley Girl. An organized campaign by constituents who believe they receive too few city services for their high taxes is seeking to create what would be the nation's sixth-largest city.
The effort gained ground in October with a law that bars city councils from vetoing secession initiatives, though there are still hurdles: petition signatures of 25 percent of registered voters, a viability study and a majority vote for secession in both the Valley and Los Angeles.
"People feel that they're not getting a fair shake in the existing arrangements," said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia University Law School who has written about legal issues in secession but is neutral on its desirability. "Usually, it's a group that's a population minority in the larger entity. They are also different in some significant way, whether it's based on ethnicity or based on politics or based on economics."
In Maryland, the conservative Eastern Shore has chafed under state laws on gun control and wetlands preservation, but "the straw that broke the camel's back," said State Senator Richard L. Colburn, a Republican, was the response when a toxic microbe killed thousands of fish in Chesapeake Bay last year.
 
The Backlash Factor
Tracing the problem to manure runoff at chicken farms, the major Eastern Shore industry, the Governor proposed stricter environmental regulations costly to the poultry industry.
"We feel we should control our own destiny," said Mr. Colburn, who introduced a bill this session that was buried in committee but may resurface. Mr. Colburn wants to call the new state Delmarva (after the peninsula shared by Delaware and Virginia), and said it would have no sales tax, loose environmental regulation and a blue flag with one star like the Bonnie Blue flown by some southern states in the Civil War.
Some activists and politicians see secession as a movement whose time has come, a welcome backlash to the consolidation that began earlier in the century, when most cities grew by annexing territory. A few cities, like Indianapolis and Nashville, have merged with their suburbs in recent years, but some experts say the pendulum is swinging the other way. In Los Angeles, which has always been a diffuse collection of neighborhoods, Venice, San Pedro and other communities are also talking secession.
"Fracturing cities might be the best way to form more efficient governments," said Howard Husock, director of case studies and public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He also favors a "quasi-secession" movement in Dade County, Fla., where four unincorporated areas near Miami have voted to turn themselves into municipalities.
"Small municipalities can control things like schools, zoning and other functions, and form compacts with other communities for other services, like fire departments," Mr. Husock said.
 
Shock Therapy
Tom McClintock, a Republican Assemblyman who co-wrote the California law opening the door to secession movements, puts the argument in grander terms.
"Large, centralized command-and-control structures were very much a 20th-century phenomenon, actually a throwback to medieval governing modalities," he said. "We have been re-learning the lessons of the Enlightenment, that human institutions produce far more satisfactory results when powers are decentralized and disbursed."
Kevin Starr, a California historian who is the state librarian, fears that breaking up Los Angeles would leave behind a shell of a city. He said he saw some secession movements as "a kind of shock therapy."
"It's like a married couple when one person doesn't really want a divorce but moves out," he added. "Everybody starts rethinking the relationship."
Some proponents claim they reap benefits even if they don't gain independence because the media attention forces elected officials to take notice.
"Even without Peconic County being formed, we have seen a lot of attention," said Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican from Sag Harbor, N.Y., who twice introduced legislation asking for a binding referendum on forming a new county, to no avail. Mr. Thiele believes the threat of secession has prompted politicians to favor his constituents on issues like farmland preservation and real-estate transfer taxes.
In Maine, State Representative Henry Joy, a Republican who introduced the secession study bill, said forest and land regulations were restricting economic growth in northern Maine. He said the bill generated "hearings around the state to discuss the feasibility of economic development in rural areas."
It also convinced Mr. Joy to run for governor this year.
 
A Cry for Attention
Representative Collin Peterson, the Democrat who introduced the constitutional amendment in Minnesota, said the 100 residents of the Northwest Angle didn't really want to leave the country -- only to solve their problems with Ontario over regulation of the Lake of the Woods, which dips into Minnesota. He acknowledged that secession publicity got him a meeting with Canadian officials.
"The people in the Northwest Angle decided the only way to get something resolved was to create an international incident," Mr. Peterson said. "Initially, their idea was to blockade a train."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Avoiding That Sinking Feeling

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Uncharted waters. That's where United States equity investors found themselves last week.
For more than three years, corporate profits have risen as the economy expanded. Those earnings gains, in turn, fueled stock prices. The rising tide lifted all boats. 
 But this week, the situation was very different: Profits were shrinking -- down 2.2 percent in the first quarter -- even as gross domestic product stormed ahead 4.8 percent. It was the second quarter in a row that profits fell. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 2.4 percent.
Then there was the distress in Russian, Latin American and Asian markets.
What's a nervous investor to do? Forget about retreating to the old investment havens. They ain't what they used to be.
In the not-so-distant past, defensive shares in electric utilities, telecommunications companies and tobacco companies were good bets for bleak times. No more.
Big tobacco is under siege from the government, and the stocks show it: Philip Morris is down 22 percent from its January high, and Loews, which owns Lorillard, is down 17 percent. Telecommunications companies and electric utilities were old standbys because their businesses and revenues were highly regulated and predictable. Deregulation has made investing in these stocks much more of a crapshoot.
So how can stock market investors act defensively today? Given the profit picture and the economy's continued punch, investors should look for companies that can raise their prices to consumers. As long as the economy remains strong and interest rates low, stocks with pricing power will do well. Only one thing would wreck that picture: an interest rate increase by the Fed.
Jason Trennert, economist and vice president at International Strategy and Investment, an economic consulting firm in New York, has identified the industries that will be able to raise prices in coming months, and there are just a few. "What's great for consumers -- high wages, low inflation and heated competition -- is not great for most companies," Mr. Trennert said.
In his view, only two industries can raise prices: airlines and home builders. Airline stocks have had a nice run this year, but are down 9 percent from their March highs. At 17 times earnings, the group trades at a big discount to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which has a multiple of 26.
Although home building stocks would seem vulnerable to a rate increase, Mr. Trennert said that even if rates blip up, they will remain low enough to keep mortgages attractive. The stocks are cheap; well off their highs of earlier this year, they trade at multiples roughly half that of the S.& P.
Heading the list of industries that cannot raise prices is the heavy-manufacturing group: makers of automobiles, technology equipment and other capital goods. According to ISI's survey, in which a score of 100 represents strong pricing power, manufacturers' ability to raise prices plunged from more than 60 four years ago to 12.5 this week.
The profit vise in which these companies are caught will only tighten as the Asia crisis deepens. That's because margins on their goods that are sold abroad are often higher than the margins on those sold domestically. Yet these stocks continue to trade at astonishingly rich premiums. The price-to-earnings ratio on the group, as measured by the S.& P. Capital Goods index, is 33. Go figure.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
When Overtime Doesn't Feel So Fine

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
WHEN a winter storm destroyed the Albertson's store where Debra Chard used to work as a deli manager, she called it divine justice. She was relieved to get away from managers who, she said, pushed her to work before and after shifts and demanded that she work long hours with no breaks.
"They'd say, 'Don't expect to have a job if you don't get it done,' " said Ms. Chard, of Bremerton, Wash., who has gone on to work for a different grocery store company. "If I said 'I haven't punched in yet,' they'd say, 'Well, I'll fix that.' " But, she said, they never did punch her in. 
 Ms. Chard, 33, is a plaintiff in one of eight lawsuits against Albertson's, the giant supermarket chain based in Boise, Idaho. The suits, all of which are seeking class-action status, assert that the company has cheated employees and managers of overtime pay, that it has not paid for off-the-clock work done before or after shifts or during breaks and that it has wrongly considered managers to be exempt from overtime pay.
An Albertson's spokesman, Michael Read, denied the allegations. "We are committed to treating our employees fairly, and we do and always have paid them in full for all the time they have worked," he said, adding that employees rarely work off the clock.
Albertson's is unusual in the number of lawsuits it is facing, but many companies are confronting worker complaints about the amount of time expected from them.
In pursuit of lower labor costs, many companies have pared staff in recent years. As a result, some labor experts say, overtime and uncompensated work have become the workplace conflict of the 1990's.
"There are more and more instances where the drive for increased profits results in a company's deliberately denying workers basic economic protections," said Michael Rubin, a partner at Altshuler, Berzon, Nussbaum, Berzon & Rubin, a law firm in San Francisco specializing in labor and employment issues. Mr. Rubin is representing workers for sewing contractors of Guess Inc., the Los Angeles apparel maker, in a suit contending violations of overtime law.
In the early years of the current economic boom, labor experts say, workers felt uncertain about pursuing lawsuits -- they feared for their jobs. But recently, in an increasingly robust labor market, employees have felt secure enough to press on overtime issues and to leave work they see as exploitative.
"In the old days, if you sued your employer, you wouldn't get another job," said Michael F. O'Malley, author of "Are You Paid What You're Worth?" (Broadway Books, 1998) and a compensation expert at William M. Mercer Inc., a consulting firm in New York. "But now you could still be hired the next day by somebody else. I think the fear of not being employable because you have sued an employer is probably not as strong right now."
IN lawsuit after lawsuit, corporations, particularly those that pay lower wages, have been accused of not paying overtime even as they make employees work beyond their shifts, and of keeping managers who spend most of their shifts in nonsupervisory roles from receiving overtime pay to which they are entitled.
The exact number of overtime-related lawsuits cannot be determined. In addition to class-action suits and those brought on behalf of employees by the Department of Labor, many other suits are brought individually. Still, from 1993 through 1997, the Department of Labor recovered roughly $450 million for nearly 900,000 workers. During the same period, more than 61,000 civil suits were filed in Federal courts concerning the Fair Labor Standards Act, though those could also have involved minimum-wage issues.
Amy Kohn, an employment law consultant at Hewitt Associates of Lincolnshire, Ill., said she expected the lawsuits to keep coming.
"There's nothing right now to indicate that they would slow down," she said. "With the labor market being what it is, there's little incentive for employees not to pursue claims if they think they're viable."
The 40-hour workweek was established six decades ago, as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act; under it, hourly employees whose duties are primarily nonsupervisory must receive one and a half times their regular wage for hours worked beyond 40. And some states have adopted even more stringent rules.
To many businesses, the trade-off of more money for more work seems reasonable enough. "If people are being forced to work off the clock, that's illegal and the Department of Labor has an enforcement role there, and employees are free to bring private lawsuits," said Randel Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The concept of overtime, however, can still incite strong debate. Dozens of bills now circulating in Congress address the issue. Last year, a bill sponsored by two Republicans, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri and Representative Cass Ballenger of North Carolina, would have allowed private employers to offer employees the option of converting each hour of overtime to one and a half hours of compensatory time -- that is, time off. It passed the House, but Democrats blocked the bill from consideration in the Senate, saying it left too much discretion to employers.
Labor Department investigators say overtime violations tend to be concentrated in the retail, construction and garment industries. Union officials contend that many employers expect workers to complete a specific number of tasks in a shift, without considering the amount of time required.
For employers, it's "economically rational" to try to get the most work out of current employees, said Lawrence Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group.
Particularly in times of low unemployment, when new workers are harder to find, Mr. Mishel said, employers usually prefer to give current employees overtime work rather than hire new employees.
"If you use people on overtime, you don't pay more for health insurance, pensions and various fixed fringe benefits packages," he said. "You don't have to train new people, and you don't have to lay people off when the demand slackens."
MORE than 4,000 unionized and nonunionized employees have filed wage claims against Albertson's, which operates 865 grocery stores and drugstores in the West, Midwest and South. In California and Washington alone, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents workers at about a third of the company's stores across the country, estimates that Albertson's owes workers $189 million.
Mr. Read, the Albertson's spokesman, said: "In the past two years alone, there's been over a quarter of a billion dollars paid in overtime. If it's needed, we allow it and we pay for it. It's as simple as that."
Still, plaintiffs in the suits say managers gave them few choices: If they were caught working off the clock, they could be dismissed, and if they did not finish the work assigned them during their regular working hours, they would be replaced, they said.
James E. Restivo, 28, of Boynton Beach, Fla., said managers expected him to work off the clock from the day he started working three years ago as a member of the night crew at an Albertson's there.
"I've been told by store directors to work 50 or 60 hours, whatever it takes," he said.
Workers were expected to continue their duties unpaid after punching out at the end of an eight-hour shift, many plaintiffs in the suits say. Moreover, they contend, the company's compensation system for its top supervisors encouraged such pressures.
"Whether the department managers and store director receive their bonus is greatly dependent on keeping labor costs low," said Joe Peterson, special assistant to the union president. "It's a built-in system for employees not to report all their work time because if they do, their boss has his or her bonus reduced."
Mr. Read, the Albertson's spokesman, said that was untrue. "The bonus is tied to the overall profitability of a store, and labor is only one little piece," he said. Besides, he added, allowing or encouraging off-the-clock work is against company policy and against the law; any managers doing so "would lose their entire bonus for the quarter and be subject to other discipline up to and including termination."
Mr. Read noted that some of the suits against Albertson's were financed in part by the union.
"They want more of our employees to be represented by their union," he said. "That's their primary motivation."
But plaintiffs say the suits are not about unions. Mr. Restivo, who now works in the dairy section at another Albertson's, in Jupiter, Fla., said a 40-hour week is strictly enforced at the new store.
"The grocery manager we have there, he doesn't let us work off the clock," he said. "He's against it 100 percent. We basically do our 40 and that's about it.
"Nobody is pushing for a union," Mr. Restivo continued. "It's about the way they treat people. Let us come in and do our job and go home."
 
Time Is of the Essence
DOZENS of companies in the past few years have faced lawsuits on uncompensated overtime. Here is a sampling:
Southern New England Telephone was ordered by a Federal appeals court last fall to pay $10 million in back wages to 1,500 employees as a result of a suit by the Department of Labor. The suit contended that phone-line workers were not appropriately paid for lunch breaks -- that when at lunch in the field, they were required to secure their work areas, depriving them of free time.
"We reviewed the decision and decided not to appeal," Kevin Moore, a company spokesman, said. "We considered it an internal matter."
Longs Drug Stores agreed in a settlement earlier this year with the Labor Department to pay $3.1 million in uncompensated overtime to 1,300 pharmacists formerly or currently with the chain. According to the company, there was a disagreement over whether the pharmacists were eligible for overtime pay.
"The pharmacists were paid for every hour they worked," said Clay Selland, treasurer for Longs, just not time and a half. The settlement covered the difference. A suit brought in February in Federal court concerning off-the-clock work is pending.
IBP Inc., formerly Iowa Beef Processors, was ordered by a Federal judge late last year to pay $7 million to 23,000 cutting-floor workers in the Midwest who were not compensated for time spent before and after their shifts preparing or storing knives and protective equipment. The order was a result of a Labor Department complaint.
"Most companies in our industry didn't consider those duties compensable, but the judge agreed that they were," said an IBP spokesman, Gary Mickelson.
Guess Inc., the Los Angeles clothing maker, faces a suit in California state court by garment workers contending that it should be held responsible for what they say were violations by its sewing contractors.
Glenn Weinman, general counsel for Guess, called the suit part of an organizing campaign by the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, which is helping to finance the suit. TINA KELLEY

HEADLINE: Men on a Mission

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
RUSSELL PRATT knocked on the door of Apartment 18A, delivering a firm, fearless rap that echoed down the dim, graffiti-scarred corridors of the Taft Houses in East Harlem. When the door finally opened a crack, he found himself facing a snarling dog and a leery, unwelcoming glare.
"Good morning, sir," Mr. Pratt said as the man sized up his white shirt sleeves, charcoal trousers and dark tie, which made him look like an insurance salesman or an investigator from the Internal Revenue Service. Pointing to the plastic name tag on his breast pocket that read "Elder Pratt," the 22-year-old missionary from Tooele, Utah, flashed an eager smile. 
 "I'm from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," he told the man, "and I was wondering if. . . ."
The door slammed shut. Mr. Pratt stifled a wince, uttered a cheery "Bless you," and moved on to the next apartment.
And so it went on a recent Wednesday as Mr. Pratt and his partner, Shon Denning, worked their way through the housing projects and tenements of El Barrio. In their effort to draw converts to Mormonism, one of the nation's fastest-growing religions, they have become inured to curious stares, cold indifference and the occasional unkind word.
"This is New York City," Mr. Pratt said, taking a quick lunch break in his 12-hour-a-day proselytizing routine. "You expect people here to be a little suspicious."
Still, despite a spate of morning rejections, the two found their way into a half-dozen apartments that day, secured a handful of follow-up appointments and returned to their East 110th Street apartment that night with eight fewer copies of the Book of Mormon, which they had given to anyone who showed a glimmer of interest. A crossing guard, a nurse's aide and an unemployed handyman were among those who allowed the men into their homes.
"It's amazing how many people will listen to us," said Mr. Denning, 21, his cheeks burnished red from a long day in the sun. "New Yorkers are hungry for what we have to offer."
The Mormon Church, based in Salt Lake City, has found New York fertile ground for new converts, doubling its membership to 20,000 since 1988. To accommodate the city's growing congregations, the church built a sparkling $8 million meeting house just off the Grand Concourse in Kingsbridge, the Bronx, last year. Another is under construction in Inwood, and a recently formed branch that meets at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem is scouring that neighborhood for larger quarters. Last month, the president and prophet of the Mormon Church, Gordon B. Hinckley, filled all 24,000 seats in Madison Square Garden for a "fireside chat."
"It's amazing what's happening in this city," said Ronald A. Rasband, who oversees 240 unpaid missionaries in New York, most of them men between 19 and 23 years old. "We are a church on the rise."
Worldwide, the church has grown to 10 million members, up from four million in 1978. Most of that growth has taken place beyond Utah, where Mormonism has long had a powerful presence. "We're growing so fast, we have to build a meeting house a day just to keep up," Mr. Rasband said.
Church officials and non-Mormons who study the church agree that the intense focus on proselytizing has helped feed this astounding growth. "The missionary system is the engine that makes this church so robust," said Gary Shepherd, a former missionary who is no longer active in the church and is now a professor of sociology at Oakland University in Rochester Hills, Mich. There are 60,000 Mormon missionaries working in 160 countries, said Michael Leonard, a church spokesman. The Roman Catholic Church, by comparison, has 6,000 missionaries around the world, according to the United States Catholic Mission Association.
What separates Mormon missionaries from those of other evangelical faiths, say those who study the church, is the generous attention they pay to potential converts, known as investigators. Missionaries make repeated home visits to investigators and encourage them to join church gatherings even before they are baptized.
"This is a church where sweet-faced boys and girls make house calls, sit down and answer your questions eye to eye," said Richard Bushman, a professor of history at Columbia University and a lifelong Mormon. "Even before you're a member, they lavish a lot of time on you, offering you a wonderful sense of community. I don't know if that's matched by any other religion."
Mormonism does especially well in New York, a place rife with alienation, instability and fractured families, said Jan Shipps, a professor of religion at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. "People whose lives are in disarray, newly arrived immigrants and those looking for a sense of community and stability are especially drawn to the church," Ms. Shipps said.
Urban converts, especially blacks, were not always so eagerly courted: Until 20 years ago, the church priesthood was closed to blacks, who, according to Mormon doctrine, carried the mark of Cain. The policy was reversed in 1978, after the president said he had a revelation.
Among Mormon men, the two-year mission is a rite of passage, one that a third accept when they reach 19. Women, who must wait until they are 21 to serve, are not encouraged as strongly as men and make up only 17 percent of the missionary force. "It's really just a reflection of the church's attitude toward gender roles," said Mr. Shepherd, who with his brother Gordon wrote "Mormon Passage: A Missionary Chronicle" (University of Illinois Press, 1998). "Women are supposed to focus on marriage and having families. And just as important, they cannot hold the priesthood, which makes them unable to perform critical church functions like baptisms and confirmations."
Although church officials say there is no pressure to win converts, many missionaries say that those with a prodigious tally can expect a hero's welcome upon their return home and promotions in the church hierarchy. Mr. Shepherd said the average missionary converts five to seven people a year.
The church does not release figures on the number of missionaries who fail to complete their assignments. Mr. Rasband says that except for those who became ill, none of his charges have left early. Mr. Shepherd estimated a dropout rate of 5 percent worldwide based on his research. "Coming home early would leave you seriously stigmatized," he said. "It would probably result in you leaving the church."
 
Long Hours, No Pay, Little Drawer Space
Like missionaries around the world, Shon Denning and Russell Pratt start their day at 6:30 A.M. They have an hour to shower, dress and eat breakfast, followed by two hours studying church teachings. At 9:30 A.M., they start their core task: proselytizing on the Upper East Side and in East Harlem.
Their day ends 12 hours later when they return to the one-bedroom apartment they share with another team of missionaries. All four men sleep in bunk beds. Their only personal space consists of two dresser drawers each.
There is not much on the walls of the fifth-floor walk-up: portraits of Jesus Christ, bus and subway maps, a battered taxi license plate and a photo of President Hinckley. A tattered sofa, its armrests worn to the wooden frame, sits in the living room. One wall is lined with copies of the Book of Mormon and videocassettes with titles like "Family First" and "Together Forever," a reference to the Mormon belief that family relationships persist after death.
Missionaries receive no salary and are expected to pay all expenses other than the cost of their return flight home. They are allowed $200 a month spending money, $80 of which is used for transportation. "We eat a lot of ramen noodles, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and we walk a heck of a lot," said Mr. Denning, who has worn out four pairs of shoes since his arrival.
To save money, he and his roommates cut one another's hair and most days pack a lunch. At home, they eat out of plastic bowls. Like other missionaries in New York, they rarely dine out. A visit to a pizza parlor is a treat.
Missionaries operate in pairs, inseparable units known as "companionships." Even when Mr. Denning walks down the five flights of stairs to let a visitor into the East Harlem building where he lives, Mr. Pratt is invariably by his side. Mormon officials say that companionships are intended to insure safety, reduce the likelihood of slipping into temptation and act as a firewall against "false accusers," who might claim that a missionary has behaved inappropriately.
Companionships are shuffled over the course of the two-year mission; new arrivals are often paired with veterans, and those having difficulty are sometimes placed with those whose faith and devotion are deemed unshakable.
Missionary life is strictly defined by church rules and can be grueling. Like all Mormons in good standing, missionaries do not smoke or drink alcohol, coffee, tea or caffeinated beverages. Dating, masturbation and premarital sex are forbidden. Television, popular music, magazines and unapproved books are off limits.
Communication with family is restricted to a weekly letter and two phone calls a year, on Christmas and Mother's Day. Church officials say too much contact with family distracts missionaries from their work. "Ours is a very demanding religion," said Mr. Rasband, the mission president, who conducts regular interviews with missionaries to make sure they have not strayed. "I am constantly warning them against temptation, to look away when a half-naked woman passes them on the street, to avoid being pulled in by newspaper stands that display pornographic material. In a place like New York, the distractions are endless."
To hear them tell it, Shon Denning and Russell Pratt have so far resisted New York's bountiful lures. "For me it's easy," said Mr. Denning, one of eight children who grew up in a predominantly Mormon community in rural Idaho. "My love of the Lord is so strong, nothing can knock me off course."
Like many Rocky Mountain Mormons, Mr. Denning's ancestors migrated west on the Great Exodus of 1847, when thousands, fleeing persecution in Illinois, crossed the plains in wagon trains and settled in the Salt Lake Valley.
As a child, Mr. Denning said, he never planned to become a missionary, but one day during a religion class at Ricks College, a Mormon school near his home, he received a revelation, "a burning in my bosom." He dropped out of school, sold his car and went through a month of round-the-clock instruction at the church's Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah. His high school sweetheart, also a Mormon, was thrilled. "She said she would wait for me to come back," he said. "But unfortunately she married someone else last year."
Missionaries have no choice of where they are sent; church leaders say they make assignments largely on the basis of inspiration. Mr. Denning's parents were worried at first about his placement in New York. "We heard all the bad stories, but took comfort in knowing that the Lord would look after him," said his father, Michael, who owns a company that installs water pumps. "Frankly, we were just tickled with his decision to serve, to bring something good into people's lives."
When he returns to Idaho Falls on Wednesday, Mr. Denning is likely to be praised. During his two years in New York, he baptized 15 people, among them a Bolivian couple in Harlem, a family of Jehovah's Witnesses in the Bronx and a 27-year-old Upper East Side man who works as a production assistant on feature films.
With his blond hair and cherubic face, Mr. Denning stands out on the streets of East Harlem. Like most missionaries, he says local residents always treat him with respect.
"There are places I've felt safe as a missionary that I probably wouldn't return to as a tourist," he said. A beatific smile almost always adorns his face and, when preaching, he frequently offers heartfelt testimony to his faith. "I know the Book of Mormon is true," he says, his piercing blue eyes locked on those of his prospect. "I know that this is the true church."
 
Dreams of Returning To 'Electric' New York
Many Mormons spend their adolescence saving for a mission. Russell Pratt spent his youth training to become a professional baseball player. As soon as the sun came up, his mother, Anne, would start feeding the batting machine in the family's backyard for her six sons.
"The first thing the neighbors hear in the morning is the ping ping of the bat hitting balls," she said. But during Russell's junior year at the University of Utah, his baseball plans were scotched by a coach who told him he would never make it to the major leagues.
"When I realized my dreams weren't going to come true, the foundation of my life had been taken out from under me," Mr. Pratt recalled. Confused and dispirited, he turned to the church. Other family members were devout, Mr. Pratt said, but until then he had never read the Book of Mormon. "The church helped me realize there is more to life than baseball."
Although Mr. Pratt says that preaching the gospel has given his life meaning, he admits to feeling an occasional tinge of doubt. "When that happens, I pray and my testimony is renewed," he said.
Mr. Pratt seems to be far more attracted to the city than Mr. Denning, who says he will probably remain in Idaho to raise a family. Mr. Pratt wants to come back to New York after he completes his mission in September and returns to Utah to finish college. "This place is so electric," he said last week as he walked through midtown, offering opinions on modern architecture ("Some of these buildings are so faceless"), Latin cuisine ("They fry everything!") and pet owners ("How can they keep dogs in such tiny apartments?").
"I just love the diversity of people here," Mr. Pratt said. "You'd never get bored."
Like their fellow missionaries, he and Mr. Denning have had few opportunities to savor local culture. Socializing with non-Mormons is discouraged, and their strict schedule and budget leave little time or money for leisure activities. Their only luxury is a meal at the home of local church members, who are encouraged to feed cash-strapped missionaries whenever possible.
"It gets to the point that you don't even think about the things you're missing," Mr. Pratt said. "But when I come back, I'm going to jump all over this city."
There was little time to think about the future last Monday as the pair preached and proselytized their way from the forlorn projects along First Avenue to the staid brick fortresses of Park Avenue. Because doormen and intercoms keep them out of many buildings, their most fruitful contacts are people who have called the church's toll-free number requesting a free video cassette offered through television commercials. The advertisements, which often run late at night, feature uplifting vignettes about family values.
When Charlotte V. Vogt called the number last January, she assumed that the video would arrive in the mail. Instead, Mr. Denning and Mr. Pratt left several messages on her answering machine, which she ignored. A few days later, they showed up at her white-brick doorman building on East 57th Street. She told them she was too busy to talk, but they came back.
"I'm glad they did," Mrs. Vogt said. "I believe they saved my life."
She said a recent separation from her husband had left her reeling. "I was so traumatized, so without hope," she said, sitting on a plush floral couch as a Bach concerto filled her living room. But the half-dozen visits and daily phone calls from the missionaries, she said, helped ease her depression. "I've called other churches, but they just sent their literature," she said.
When the missionaries stopped by on Monday afternoon, Mrs. Vogt beamed as she described her baptism the previous week. "I was soaking wet and giddy with joy," she said, as she served the men orange juice in highball glasses monogrammed with her husband's initials.
Now that she has been confirmed, Mrs. Vogt will receive weekly visits from church members, who will teach her Mormon doctrine and history. Every Sunday, she attends services at the church's Lincoln Center chapel. Eventually, she hopes to receive a calling to become a home teacher.
"I feel like it's the beginning of a new life," she said. "I've finally found a community that really cares about me."
 
'There Is No Gray Area'
No one forced Aubyn Gwinn to become a missionary, but as a young Mormon growing up in Salt Lake City, Mr. Gwinn said, the alternative was grim. Among devout Mormons, he said, the pressure to serve a mission is intense, and those who don't can find themselves on the fringes of Mormon life.
"It would jeopardize your career in the church, put a wedge between you and your friends and make it difficult to get married," he said. "When you meet Mormon girls, the first thing they ask is, 'Where did you serve your mission?' If you didn't, they won't even date you."
By his own account, Mr. Gwinn was "a rock," a stalwart believer and a zealous missionary. During the two years he spent in Finland, he supervised other missionaries and helped make 10 conversions, a considerable achievement in a country known among Mormons as especially impervious to their preachings.
After returning home, Mr. Gwinn enrolled in the church-run Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He married, had two daughters and became a member of the church's unpaid priesthood. And he tithed, giving 10 percent of his income to the church.
But at 25, he started having doubts about the church. They intensified after he moved to New York City with his family to take a job at an advertising agency, and found himself among non-Mormons. His faith began to crumble, and he eventually fell away from the church. He and his wife eventually divorced; she, too, has since left the church.
In Mormonism, Mr. Gwinn said, "You either believe everything or nothing: there is no gray area."
His twin brother, Todd Gwinn, may have lacked Aubyn's youthful ardor, yet he felt compelled to follow his lead. He was assigned to Ontario, Canada, but halfway through his mission, he said, he lost the fire.
"I wanted to belong so badly that I convinced myself to believe," he said. "I knew that if I questioned the church, I would end up as an apostate." He said he became particularly disillusioned when he discovered that some missionaries were enticing potential converts by offering access to the church's generous welfare program. Several years later, he rejected Mormonism. He also divorced the Mormon woman he had married. She, too, has since left the church, he said.
Like other lapsed Mormons, the Gwinns say that church officials make it difficult to leave the fold. They say that bishops ask relatives to apply pressure to those who try to leave, and that missionaries try to track down so-called inactives. "They feel especially threatened by anyone who wants out," Todd said.
The brothers, now 38, say separation from the church has left them with a mix of bitterness and longing. Aubyn, a creative director for a cosmetics company, wonders how he might have better used the time he spent as a missionary. Still, he is bothered by the spiritual void that nags him from time to time. "It's that hunger for something bigger than yourself, that magical spiritual life, that belief in immortality," he said.
Todd, a librarian in the Bronx, says he, too, has some regrets, though he is relieved to be free of the church's constraints. "What I miss most is the loss of community," he said. "That's something I have yet to replace." ANDREW JACOBS
 
PRIMER
The Roots Of Mormonism
Mormonism was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith of Palmyra, N.Y., who claimed that when he was 14, he was visited by God and Jesus Christ who told him to form a new church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
At the heart of the religion is The Book of Mormon, a religious and secular history of the inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere from about 2200 B.C. to 421 A.D. Mormons believe that Mr. Smith translated the book from ancient from ancient gold tablets he is said to have found on a hillside in Palmyra. The book proclaims that after he was crucified, Christ appeared in North America and ministered to its inhabitants, believed to be descendents of immigrants from Jerusalem and the Tower of Babel.
Mormons hold that theirs is the only true Christian faith. Through proxy, they baptize the dead, whom they believe were denied an opportunity to join the church. The Book of Mormon states that God dwells on a planet, Kolob, with his many wives and countless spirit children, whom He sends to Earth as humans to be tested. Marriage and family relationships, they believe, persist for eternity. Polygamy, once an accepted tenet of Mormonism, was overturned in 1890. ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Classes Are Full At Catch-Up U.

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
ALL the brouhaha last week over the dropping of remedial classes at the City University of New York, one of the nation's largest systems, would make many people think that remediation was a multicultural course invented by CUNY professors.
They would be wrong. 
 In 1995, 78 percent of America's colleges offered such classes, up from 73 percent in 1988. Although they were most prevalent at public community colleges (96 percent of them offered these courses in 1995), they were common at four-year colleges, too, with 72 percent offering the courses.
Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of Education, found that almost half of all college students took at least one class to prepare them for college-level work. At CUNY last year, 46 percent of students entering four-year colleges failed one or more of the placement examinations in reading, writing and math. At the California State University System, about half the freshmen need such classes to acclimate them to the rigors of academia.
In the Ivy League, the official line is that there are no remedial courses or underprepared students, but these institutions typically provide help in different guises. Harvard and Yale, for instance, offer peer tutors and a writing center. At the University of Chicago, a handful of students are directed each year to a course called essential mathematics that begins with arithmetic, algebra and geometry -- comparable to the remedial math courses at CUNY.
So why are so many high-school graduates unprepared for college?
One explanation, educators say, is that there is a gap between what many secondary schools expect their students to know and what college professors require, and that there has not been enough coordination between them. Another is that many high schools offer preparatory courses but students fail to take them, either because they are not planning to go to college or because they think they can get by without them. In some cases, they get weak instruction; sometimes they do poorly.
"Students have been allowed to coast," said Joseph D. Creech, director for educational policies at the Southern Regional Education Board in Atlanta. "If students are going to have to be able to do certain things when they get to college, then we have to make these expectations clear in high school, and even in middle school."
 
Diploma as Passport
At one time many of these ill-prepared students simply did not go to college. But in a technology-driven, information-based economy, where a college diploma is a passport to a higher standard of living, more students are continuing their education.
But a growing number of university administrators and college officials do not see this trend as good news. To them, each remedial student represents a failure, and wasted resources -- a job that has to be done at least twice thus diverting colleges from their real mission of providing higher education.
Remediation is such a dirty word that some colleges will not even admit to offering it, although their catalogues list courses in algebra, grammar and other subjects many students routinely take in high school.
"There is a sense that it is despoiling the environment," said H. Patrick Swygert, president of Howard University in Washington. "Remediation -- the word -- is verboten on this campus because it carries with it all the stigma that its opponents have trotted out that students who need it are less than fully qualified.
"Some people do not qualify intellectually or have the inclination to do the hard intellectual work required in college," Mr. Swygert added. "The great tragedy is that by removing remedial classes, that is not who is being screened out. The numbers suggest that once students navigate the remedial classes, many go on to successful college careers."
Few colleges have approached moving remediation off campus with the fervor of the trustees at the CUNY, who despite widespread protests from faculty and students, voted last week to phase out remedial classes at their four-year colleges by 2001. Students failing placement exams will be directed to intensive summer or weekend classes, or to the two-year community colleges.
No one knows how many of these students would be able to complete these courses quickly, how many will opt for community colleges or how many will choose other four-year colleges or simply drop out in frustration.
But CUNY is not alone in trying to reduce its remediation.
Some universities, like the University of Maryland, are trying to foster closer coordination between secondary schools and colleges about what ground will be covered in certain courses.
The California State University, the largest public university in the country with 360,000 students, has set a goal of reducing the percentage of freshmen needing remediation to 10 percent by 2007 from more than 50 percent now. The trustees, who had hoped to move faster, scaled back in the face of criticisms that they would penalize immigrants and minority students who had attended poor high schools and fared poorly in placement exams.
Charles Reed, who became chancellor of California State University system in March, said he would like to follow a program similar to the one he introduced at the University of Florida in 1985, where it offers no remedial courses; students needing them must go to community colleges or other institutions. The students, however, can still register for university classes at the same time.
"There are always going to be some students who need remediation," Dr. Reed said. "But universities are not as well prepared to do remediation as the community colleges."
Another critical part of the plan, he said, is to give the college placement tests to high school students -- preferably by the 10th grade -- "as a wake-up call." That way students can see where they are weak and still have time to improve.
 
Playing Hooky
 Does it work in Florida? Partly.
Officials at the University of Florida say that only 10 percent of the students need remedial work -- well below the figure at CUNY and Cal State. The figure is lower in part because the university takes in many of its students after they have already completed some credits elsewhere.
But even under the Florida system, students do not always whiz through their remedial courses. Chuck Lindsey, director of general education at Florida Gulf Coast University, said that some students simply skip the hours they should spend learning basics and computer skills. "They just keep taking the class until they pass it," he said.
So Florida has taken one more step. The state recently passed a law requiring that students taking remedial courses repeatedly will be charged the full price of the course, not the subsidized price available to local students.
In the meantime, Dr. Reed said, the number of students needing remediation at Florida's community colleges continues to grow.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Boeing Is Still Plodding Despite Being No. 1

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
IT has one of the great global brand names, faces only one competitor, and demand for its product is setting records. So why is Boeing stock still taxiing?
Market domination may go in and out of favor in Washington and on Main Street, but it is always popular on Wall Street. The most attractive pitch any stock promoter can give a prospective investor is that a company dominates its business. 
Microsoft and Intel notwithstanding, market-dominant companies don't always reward their investors, as Boeing stockholders have learned.
Last year, when Boeing announced that it was buying McDonnell Douglas, its last domestic competitor in commercial aircraft, investors poured into Boeing stock. The merger left Boeing the dominant supplier of commercial planes with only Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium left to divide the spoils.
But almost from the day the merger was completed in August, Boeing has been beset by a series of setbacks that have forced it to take billions of dollars in charges against earnings. Last week brought yet more bad news: After months of playing down the impact of Asia's financial crisis on its business, Boeing revealed that weakening orders from Asian airlines would force it to cut production of the 747 jumbo jet, which by some accounts brings Boeing's airplane division half its operating profits.
"The airlines are making record profits," said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst with BT Alex. Brown in New York. "The parts suppliers are making record profits. What is wrong with this picture?"
Boeing stock, which reached a high of $60.50 last July, closed on Friday at $47.75, not far above its recent low of $43, in October.
The views of Wall Street analysts on Boeing are now polarized. After the company revealed the 747 cutbacks last week, two analysts downgraded their recommendations of the stock to a hold, while another raised his to a strong buy. In addition, Pierre Chao of Morgan Stanley reiterated his strong buy recommendation and set a price target of $100 a share over the next year.
Part of the attraction for the bullish faction is the belief that the stock cannot fall much lower than $45 a share before it becomes too attractive for many investors to pass up.
"I've been saying since January of '97 that we expected the stock to trade in the $45-to-$55 range," said Steven Lewins, an analyst at Gruntal, who raised Boeing to a strong buy on Thursday. "It got down to $45.25, so I pulled the trigger."
But a number of investors and analysts have cooled on the stock because they have lost faith in Boeing's management. Since the company's first production problems came to light in October, Boeing managers have dribbled out a stream of bad news practically monthly. Many on Wall Street are bracing for the company to announce yet another charge against earnings reflecting continued problems producing the new version of the 737.
"What investor is going to stake his reputation on this management?" asked one analyst who regularly talks to executives at the company, and insisted on anonymity.
BOEING executives have talked since the early 1990's about their determination to transform the way its airplanes are made, drastically cutting costs. But when demand for airplanes picked up in 1996, the company racked up a record number of new orders by offering its customers steep discounts. That helped win the market-share race against Airbus, but it forced the company to more than double production from 18 planes a month to 43 and hire 32,000 new employees, before it had finished transforming its production process.
By last September, Boeing's assembly lines were hamstrung by parts shortages and delays caused by inexperienced workers. The company was forced to halt production for a month on the 737 and 747 lines, and it announced a total of $2.6 billion in pretax charges. The company has since been plagued with more production problems and has put off full implementation of its cost-cutting plan until later this year.
"It's always been the same pattern," said Jack Modzelewski, an analyst with Paine Webber in New York. "Lucy pulls the ball from Charlie Brown every year. They promise to do better next time, but they never do."
Boeing executives now say that some 737 deliveries will be delayed through the end of the year but they offer little guidance about the company's future profits.
Mr. Modzelewski said the company would have a hard time increasing its earnings while it was saddled with a backlog of orders. According to his estimate, the back orders bear an average discount of 27 percent on each airplane. He predicted that the demand for new airplanes would decline 10 percent over the next year, leaving little scope for Boeing to make up the foregone profits.
"If you can accelerate earnings per share in that environment," he said, "that is like walking on water."
Still, the siren song of the market dominator is hard for some to resist. Mr. Chao is convinced that Boeing has a bright future. "You are talking about a company," he said, "that has only one main competitor in the world in a booming market."

HEADLINE: The Economics Of Intervention;
A Prominent but Impolitic Theorist Questions the Worship of Free Markets

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NO group in America seems more resistant to economic theory than politicians. For them, it is quixotic, and economists who stand on theory are like politicians who cling to principles that don't play well at the polls. So when prominent economists take big jobs in Washington and use them to push theory, the response from their bosses is often skepticism and resistance -- or outright rejection.
President Johnson ignored his chief economist, Arthur M. Okun, when he insisted, accurately, that inflation would accelerate if Johnson cut taxes while spending heavily on both the Vietnam War and social programs. Similarly, Ronald Reagan ignored Martin Feldstein's theorizing about the dangers of big tax cuts and a rising budget deficit. And the deficit saga played itself out over the next 15 years. 
 Now it is Joseph E. Stiglitz's turn. Though he is perhaps the most prominent economic theorist of his generation, Mr. Stiglitz was not paid much heed during his four years on the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the last two as chairman. But give him points for persistence. Rather than retreat to his professorship at Stanford University, Mr. Stiglitz, 55, shifted last year to a high-prestige job as chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank. And there, away from the levers of power he never managed to manipulate, the Asian crisis has given him an opening to quietly shape policy with theory.
Invoking theories that bear his stamp and are taught today in most college economics courses, Mr. Stiglitz is publicly criticizing the austerity measures -- high interest rates, bank closings and sharp cuts in public spending -- favored by the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund as solutions to Asia's economic woes.
Other economists who have sounded warnings about the I.M.F.'s prescriptions -- including Mr. Feldstein, back at Harvard -- are linking their criticism to Mr. Stiglitz's prestige. Republicans who oppose the White House's request to Congress for $18 billion in new I.M.F. funding are beginning to deploy Mr. Stiglitz's name and standing as a Democrat, if not his thinking, on behalf of their cause.
And Mr. Stiglitz is finding it invigorating to be listened to for a change.
"People underestimate the role that ideas play in politics, or should play," he said. "I sometimes use the analogy of children playing soccer: Everyone wants to be around the ball. The ball in Washington is politics." Yet smart athletes learn to play away from the ball, and Mr. Stiglitz has embraced that strategy. "I had to separate economic judgments from politics," he said.
Not just for Asia. From his new perch, Mr. Stiglitz is re-fighting other battles he lost as an adviser to President Clinton. Leaving his office on a recent morning, he drove to the private high school that two of his four children attend for a guest lecture to the economics class, which turned out to be three young men. The talk, in a sunny parlor setting, became a review of his White House record. As he ticked off issues -- the capital gains tax (it should be higher, he argued), auctioning the television spectrum (good economics), privatizing the enrichment of uranium (bad economics) -- his audience heard him out with more respect than he had often received at the White House, which vetoed him on these issues and so many others.
"Joe thinks that if he repeats the logic of his position often enough, he will bring people to that position," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, who preceded Mr. Stiglitz as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "The problem is that people are not always interested in the economic logic, or economic logic alone does not always carry the day," she said. "Joe does not want that to be the case."
Ms. Tyson, like most Presidential economic advisers, learned to read the political signals and then back off, or compromise, or enlist just the right political allies. Mr. Stiglitz never managed all this.
"When I was at the White House, in an environment dominated by lawyers and politicians, I often felt that I had arrived in another world," he said in a recent speech, and explained: "I had expected lower standards of evidence for assertions than would be accepted in a professional article, but I had not expected that the evidence offered would be, in so many instances, so irrelevant and that so many vacuous sentences -- sentences whose meaning and import simply baffled me -- would be uttered."
The eye of the beholder plays a role here. Democracy runs on political give and take, not on the translation of theory -- even accurate theory -- into policy, said James Carville, whose political skills as a campaign adviser played a big role in getting Mr. Clinton to the White House in the first place.
"I am beginning to think that resilience ain't a bad thing to have," Mr. Carville said, in a gracious nod to Mr. Stiglitz. "But when you look for and vote for candidates, you ought to vote for skilled politicians. Whenever anyone tries to get something through without using political skills, it ends up biting you."
Still, there is something edifying, in a "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" sort of way, about seeing someone get attention simply for the power of his ideas.
Mr. Stiglitz's views on Asia, for instance, contradict the policy of the World Bank, and that has raised speculation that his boss, James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's president, privately shares his chief economist's stance.
Mr. Wolfensohn denies this: "I do support the I.M.F. on what it has done. But you cannot and should not muzzle someone of the quality of Joe Stiglitz, although sometimes it causes me embarrassment."
 
Fixing the Marketplace
Mr. Stiglitz, good-natured, optimistic, given to explaining himself in speeches that drone on amiably for two hours, is a giant in his profession. Many economists view him as a shoo-in for a future Nobel prize -- perhaps with George Akerlof, a Berkeley economist who has done similar work. His fame is based on a theory that, stripped to simple terms, sounds like common sense to many noneconomists.
Where traditional economics holds that free, unregulated markets raise the well-being of society in general as individuals pursue their separate self-interest, Mr. Stiglitz says the real world does not work that way. Instead, he says, markets function imperfectly, often to people's detriment, because the information available to market participants is inadequate. So Government and other institutions have to intervene, adroitly, to make markets function properly.
What has won Mr. Stiglitz a following among economists, particularly younger ones, is that he has used the profession's most revered tools -- mathematics and computer models that simulate economic behavior -- to amend the traditional thinking.
"I took the logic that had led people to be convinced that markets were efficient," he said. "I changed one assumption -- that there was perfect information. I found a general way to model imperfect information. And when you plugged this in, you found markets to be almost always inefficient."
Consider insurance, the subject of a study in the 1970's that first made Mr. Stiglitz's reputation. Insurance companies cannot fully distinguish between high-risk and low-risk customers -- between the homeowner whose dwelling is likely to burn down and the one less likely to have a damaging fire. Charging the same high rate to both for the same substantial coverage tends to draw mostly the high-risk customers, while the low-risk households are more likely to go without insurance. And with so many high-risk customers, claims mount.
So the insurance companies "intervene." They ration coverage, giving no one as much as they would like -- an incentive to install fire safety devices and take other precautions. In addition, premiums are very high for the most complete coverage; low-risk customers, by raising their deductibles, can pay much less.
Or consider the employer-employee relationship, another area in which Mr. Stiglitz's research brought new insights. A pure market system assumes that the employer possesses an uncanny amount of information about each worker on the payroll: the employee's energy level, his skills, his pattern of absences, his dedication. If so, pay could be adjusted constantly to elicit the greatest output -- the greatest efficiency -- from each individual, and shirkers would earn less than hard workers.
But employers do not have all this information. So they take shortcuts, a form of intervention. They subsidize everyone's lunch in the company cafeteria, for example, to raise morale and, with it, average productivity. Or, to reduce absenteeism and turnover and encourage greater effort, they institute an "efficiency wage" that is higher than the marketplace requires to fill positions but prompts workers to bend to their tasks, knowing that they won't be able to find other jobs that pay as well. Mr. Stiglitz did not invent efficiency wage theory, but he certainly elaborated on it. He explained, for instance, why high unemployment can persist without wages falling.
Similar logic, Mr. Stiglitz argues, justifies Government intervention. His introductory textbook, "Economics" (W. W. Norton & Company, second edition, 1997), a best seller in China and Japan, although not at home, cites the Federal bailout of the Chrysler Corporation in 1980 as an example of policy that worked.
Free-market advocates argued that a Chrysler bankruptcy would have freed up factories, workers and materials for more efficient uses, however painful the transition. But Mr. Stiglitz notes that Chrysler flourished after the bailout, which took the form of loan guarantees that were never invoked. Not only were jobs preserved, he says, but the Government saved tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed pension payments that it would have had to make to Chrysler retirees if the company had failed.
Chrysler is the rule, not the exception: "I could always find, in my modeling, a particular intervention that made everyone better off," Mr. Stiglitz said. Free marketeers argue that market imperfections are rarely, if ever, sufficient to justify interference.
Imperfect information also means that interventions can have unintended consequences. And that is the theoretical grounding for Mr. Stiglitz's objections to prevailing policies in Asia.
The I.M.F. insists that a country in trouble should raise interest rates, on the assumption that higher rates will attract foreign investors and lenders. As their money comes in, the thinking goes, confidence is restored and the value of the local currency rises. With the help of the I.M.F.'s emergency loans, the country can move back toward normalcy, and interest rates can soon decline before doing much damage to the economy.
Not so, Mr. Stiglitz says: "Like a lot of economic lore, the evidence that higher rates provide the right incentive is less than overwhelming."
Absent adequate information, lenders and investors, he contends, cannot distinguish easily between safe and risky deals. And thus high interest rates are taken as an indication that those offering to pay them are likely to default. Instead of flowing in, money leaves, and exchange rates fail to recover -- the case in much of Asia today. Meanwhile, the I.M.F.'s other austerity measures -- closing insolvent banks, cutting back government spending, pressing for price increases -- multiply the damage.
"What is quite remarkable," Mr. Stiglitz said, "is that those who favor this approach have not come up with an intellectually coherent view."
That's not the right question in the I.M.F.'s eyes. "We agree that raising rates can have adverse consequences," a senior I.M.F. staffer said. "But in a crisis there are not easy alternatives. We have cases, like Brazil last year, where raising rates worked."
 
Lessons From the Family
Ask Mr. Stiglitz how his thinking evolved, and he mentions his parents and his upbringing in Gary, Ind., where his public-school classmates, the children of steelworkers, made him familiar with layoffs and mill closings and -- though he would not have so labeled it at the time -- imperfect markets.
"You are not isolated from what is going on in the way people who grow up in the suburbs are isolated and protected," he said.
His father, now 95, recently retired as an insurance agent; his mother, 84, became an elementary school teacher at 50, and retired at 67 from a ghetto school only because she was required to. Unwilling to stop working, she taught remedial reading and, finally, citizenship until eight months ago.
"They were liberal Democrats," Mr. Stiglitz said, "not revolutionary, but very dedicated."
High grades, particularly in math, won Mr. Stiglitz a scholarship to Amherst College, where in 1963, his junior year, he was student body president and joined in the march on Washington that culminated in Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His mentors included Paul Samuelson, who besides writing his famed textbook helped so much to imbue economics with the legitimacy of mathematics.
"We got this very mixed message at M.I.T.," Mr. Stiglitz recalled. "We were taught the perfect-market-competition model, and then we were told that only at the University of Chicago, a center of conservative economics, did they take the model seriously. We agreed with our professors that there was something wrong, but we were not given an alternative."
So he went to work on a fix, often collaborating with other economists on this odyssey. "If I had believed that markets worked, and you don't have to do anything, it would have made more sense for me to go into business and make a lot of money," he said.
Brilliant and original, Mr. Stiglitz flourished in his profession from the start. At 23, he became an assistant professor at Yale, where his contract included the proviso that he wear shoes, in and out of class, and show proof that he leased an apartment. (There were doubts; he had slept too many nights on an office sofa after hours of research.) He taught at Cambridge University and over the years shifted easily between tenured professorships at Yale, Princeton and Stanford, from which he is now on leave.
He has done well financially, without going into business. As a star professor, he earned $500 an hour busily consulting, in addition to a six-figure salary. At the World Bank, his pay tops the $130,000 that he earned in the Clinton Administration -- he won't say by how much. His books bring in six-figure royalties each year. His wife, Jane Hannaway, an expert in the sociology of educational institutions, earns six figures, too, running a study center at the Urban Institute in Washington.
"The constraints in our household are time, not money," she said.
Travel has long played a role in Mr. Stiglitz's research, and a world map covers most of one wall in the dining area of the family's Washington home. During dinner, he sometimes examines the map for the few places he has not yet visited.
He is just back from a trip to Bhutan, the tiny mountain kingdom between India and China where the Government's development strategy bans television and limits tourism -- the boon of many exotic lands -- as too great a blow to the native culture. The approach fascinates Mr. Stiglitz, who argues that trying to impose development strategies from the central councils of the industrial world too often backfires.
But the same restless travel that pleases the World Bank, with its lending programs in so many struggling countries, diluted Mr. Stiglitz's influence at the White House. "You have to be at the table explaining your view," said one Administration official who insisted on anonymity. "You cannot go away for two weeks and come back and be involved. Most meetings that take place you don't even know about when you come to work in the morning."
 
When Government Works
None of the issues that Mr. Stiglitz struggled with as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers represents, in his mind, a more harmful violation of good economic theory than the Administration's decision to endorse the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation. Fifteen months after leaving the White House, he is still fighting that battle, accepting every speaking invitation that offers an opportunity to make his case.
The corporation, an obscure Government-owned concern, processes uranium for nuclear bombs and various nonlethal uses. It also buys up Russia's enriched uranium, the goal being to prevent its sale to terrorists or America's enemies.
The argument for privatizing the corporation, of course, is that private owners, driven by the profit incentive, will operate the company more efficiently. But that runs head-on into another objective of the enrichment corporation: preserving national security. Mr. Stiglitz contends that this is a case in which the free market and its incentives fail to do the job as well as government.
The reason is that the company cannot make a profit on imported Russian uranium, which costs substantially more than enriching American uranium. So, responding to the profit incentive, managers of a privatized enrichment corporation would find excuses and subterfuges for not importing very much Russian uranium, while they push the sale of their own, homemade brand, Mr. Stiglitz says. To a startling degree, he notes, that has already happened, even without privatization.
Nonetheless, the Administration -- favoring privatization as a proper, free market goal -- concluded that Government surveillance would be enough to prevent the company from shirking its obligation to buy large quantities of Russian uranium.
The Treasury Department still has the power to cancel the pending privatization, and that keeps Mr. Stiglitz going.
"Everyone said, while I was still at the White House, that it was a done deal and why fall on your sword over a done deal," Mr. Stiglitz said. But he argues that by falling insistently on his sword, he has already managed to delay the privatization. And he has come to realize that, imperfect as it is, the power to delay in Washington is often an economist's most powerful tool.
"My view," he said, "is that it is not over until the fat lady sings."

Charts: "An Imperfect World"
Joseph E. Stiglitz put in mathematical terms the observation that markets fail to work perfectly because their participants have imperfect information -- the basis for his broader, influential view that free markets cannot, unaided, solve every problem. The chart above, from a 1976 journal article, introduced the concept as it related to the pricing of insurance policies. Insurers, he found, ration coverage to avoid being overwhelmed by claims from high-risk customers.
 
Today, Mr. Stiglitz is an active proponent of his theories on a number of policy fronts. Two prominent examples:
 
THE ASIAN CRISIS
The International Monetary Fund prescribe austerity measures -- high interest rates and lower public spending -- to attract investors and restore confidence in shaken Asian economies. Mr. Stiglitz says such policies make matters worse: Investors lack enough information in emerging economies to distinguish between safe and risky deals, and so take high rates as a sign of danger.
 
U.S. ENRICHMENT CORP.
The Administration wants to privatize this Government corporation, which enriches uranium for bombs and buys up the radioactive metal from such countries as Russia. The White House says a profit-seeking company with appropriate oversight will maintain national security. Mr. Stiglitz says the profit motive will cause the company to shirk from buying costly Russian uranium.

HEADLINE: Diana-ana And Other Obsessions

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
CAROL HERSH-WEISS collects, and then some. To enter her sprawling New York City apartment is to venture into the nooks and crannies of her decidedly idiosyncratic mind. Along one wall are 19 pairs of shoes, a small part of a collection of black shoes. Elsewhere are soda bottles bearing forgotten brand names like "Cheer Up," "Dream" and "Just Whistle." Hidden in a drawer are thousands of erasers, including one shaped like Ronald Reagan's head.
Antique quilts are everywhere, well over 100 the last time anybody counted. They have multiplied in value 10 times over in the last 15 years, with many worth more than $1,000. Mrs. Hersh-Weiss, a professional potter, has told her husband, Norman, a mathematician at Queens College, that quilts beat the stock market hands down. 
 "I can make more money on my quilts than he can on Microsoft and Intel," she said. "He's not going to double his money and I am."
Ms. Hersh-Weiss's optimism is shared by millions of other Americans who are taking advantage of the strong economy to collect stamps and coins as well as used beer cans in the hope that they will increase in value. One in three Americans collects something. Most of them don't care that collectibles, which is a term for items made solely for the enjoyment of the collector, have historically decreased in value than increased. They are more concerned about the proliferation of fakes.
Trade magazines estimate the collectibles market to be approaching $10 billion in annual sales, and stories of resale are legend. The Jetsons lunch box bought for $1 at a garage sale in 1980 fetching $200 today. The 1955 Murray fire truck that sold for $50 in 1993 worth $250. The unused Hawaiian missionary stamp selling for $575,000.
Today, much of the collectibles action is on the Internet, where millions participate in auctions held at hundreds of sites. It helps to be in the news. Frank Sinatra memorabilia is suddenly hot. All things connected with the millennium will be collected.
But white-hot publicity can be as fleeting as a sound bite: When Princess Diana died, autographed pictures that had been worth $1,500 immediately jumped to $50,000. The price has since drifted back to about $3,500.
"Given the amount of material related to the events surrounding Princess Diana's death and burial, it is safe to assume that supply will exceed demand for centuries, not decades, to come," wrote Harry L. Rinker in Antiques & Collecting Magazine. "Even if 90 percent ends up in the landfill, supply will exceed demand."
Nowhere is the supply-and-demand equation more in evidence than in the area of instant heirlooms. The Franklin Mint sells them by the hundreds of thousands, including its non-firing replica of Wyatt Earp's six-shooter and a 24-inch porcelain doll of Marilyn Monroe in a feathered headdress. The company is in the business of selling the glorious illusions that most resonate with the average person. It bought Jacqueline Onassis's faux pearls for $211,500 at auction and made replicas that became runaway best sellers at $195 each.
But true value hinges on scarcity -- a bitter truth learned by the 17th-century Dutch when speculators drove the price of tulips to astronomic levels, only to see it crash with an abundant tulip harvest.
Today collectors seem motivated more by love, often tinged with nostalgia, than by thoughts of making a killing. "People end up buying themselves a present in a way that means something," said Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center who has personally collected 25,000 comic books; baseballs autographed by Babe Ruth, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra, and Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers ray guns. Still, Dr. Manevitz worries that people, including some of his patients, become too obsessed. "You shouldn't define yourself through your things," he said, sounding almost convincing.
"I just lose myself in it," said Hank Seiden, an avid collector who runs an advertising agency in his spare time. From the time he bought bought an F.D.R. autograph for $5 as a teen-ager, he has always set a goal in his collecting. He now owns the signatures of all United States Presidents, and all members of Yankees teams in 1927, 1941, 1951 and 1961. "I'm not a nut," he volunteered.
Luck matters in collecting. On May 24, Yankee Stadium offered a free Beanie Baby to every child. Produced in limited quantities, other versions of the plush toys have fetched prices of nearly $3,000, but the financial windfall, finally, seems to be ebbing. Except perhaps for the free teddy bears given out by the Yanks: Each of these carries a certificate with the date of the game when David Wells pitched a perfect game. A cuddly, properly dated specimen already resides in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

Nuclear Fear and Narcissism Shake South Asia

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
India and Pakistan could not have asked for a clearer example of the futility of nuclear arms grandstanding than the one they have set themselves. Now that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has answered India's test blasts with his own, India needs to face a fundamental question. Why did Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee give up the advantages of nuclear ambiguity in favor of an action that has clearly worsened his country's security?
A decade ago, I talked at length with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi about the virtues of keeping India's nuclear capability in the shadows even though India's military and scientific establishment was pushing for a bolder approach. His thoughts then are relevant today. 
 Mr. Gandhi was in a reflective mood after an exhausting day of campaigning during which we briefly got lost in the jungles of South India. Over dinner that stretched past midnight at a Navy base on the Bay of Bengal, he acknowledged India's nuclear capability but was preoccupied by the possibility that Pakistan might declare its nuclear capability.
"If the Pakistanis get the bomb, I really don't know what we're going to do," he said with a sigh. He agreed that Pakistan also had an interest in maintaining an Israeli-style ambiguity about its possession of nuclear weapons, but added that domestic politics would likely drive Pakistan to proclaim its nuclear status. He was right about the motive but wrong about which Subcontinent country would go first.
Indians at first rejoiced after the country's tests this spring. Their hunger for self-respect and the respect of others was obvious as Mr. Vajpayee declared that India had taken "its rightful place in the international community." Now that Pakistan has answered, Indians may have second thoughts because their security is more precarious than ever. Since neither capital could survive a first strike, for example, might either be tempted to carry one out? An entrenched ethnic and religious rivalry along a disputed border could provide the initial spark. Short of nuclear threats, Pakistan has the ready ability to keep stirring trouble in India's Muslim-dominated border state of Kashmir.
But India surely bears most of the blame for its predicament. The world had presumed since an Indian test in 1974 that it had the bomb, and Pakistan was warily watching it develop short- and medium-range missiles to deliver it. But by so conspicuously showing off its nuclear might, India not only forced Pakistan's hand. It also threw both Pakistan and China on the defensive and, if anything, cemented an alliance between them that India had said was its main threat. The United States, which had made progress improving relations with India after essentially siding with Pakistan throughout the cold war, is now distrustful of India.
Mr. Gandhi was not wrong about Pakistan's nuclear potential. Around the time of our interview, an enterprising Pakistani journalist who was determined to force the issue managed to get A. Q. Khan, the top Pakistani nuclear scientist, to reveal his country's ability to make bombs. It stirred a furor in Washington and New Delhi, eventually forcing President Bush to impose sanctions on Islamabad. Today that journalist is the information minister.
India's nuclear provocation will lessen international sympathy on Kashmir. India's once hopeful demand to sit on the United Nations Security Council is probably dead. As for economic security, the debate in India's Parliament last week revealed growing anxiety over the losses in aid and overseas investment.
In return for little gain, India's actions have hurt its poorest citizens. The shots of nuclear adrenaline to the Indian and Pakistani body politic will be short lived, replaced by anxiety and deprivation. After feeling rankled by the West's attention and respect for China and tired of what it considers to be its own second-class status in world affairs, India has gotten the attention it wanted, but it may yet look back fondly on the days of neglect. One can only hope that for the same political reasons that drove them to act, India and Pakistan will learn the wisdom of restraint.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Chinese Plot Is Easy to See. Maybe Too Easy.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
IN politics, as in science, pundits are always on the lookout for a unified theory, preferably a single idea that binds together an otherwise disparate constellation of facts and events. For the seemingly endless stream of revelations that constitutes America's campaign finance scandal, no explanation is as seductively simple -- or sinister -- as the China plot.
It has all the elements of a remake of "The Manchurian Candidate": The mink-coat-wearing daughter of the top Chinese general. A frantic search for satellite technology and missile guidance systems. Intercepted communications that suggest a Beijing-directed scheme to suborn American politicians. And lurking behind the scenes, the People's Liberation Army, a onetime peasant force that some see as the American military's one potential peer in the coming century. 
 Look through the eyes of those who follow China most closely, however, and the best of those plot lines falls flat. "I was a skeptic from the beginning and I remain a skeptic," says James Mulvenon of the Rand Corporation in California, a specialist on the Chinese military and its commercial ventures."When you have a sense of how China works, it is hard to see these scandals as anything but an unfortunate series of coincidences, not a plot."
That view is shared by many American scholars and diplomats who focus on China. Many say they are wary of appearing to apologize for China's military, which has a staunch anti-American faction and a long history of activities that promote arms proliferation. None suggests that involvement in American politics by Chinese people with ties to government-run businesses is either legal or proper. And few would rule out the possibility that some element of the military has commercial ambitions that ties to President Clinton might help advance.
 
Received Wisdom
But they question some of the received wisdom in Congress and the media that underlie the plot theory: that China's military is a monolith; that the army has wealth and discipline to match its size, and that China's military, Foreign Ministry, defense industry, intelligence gatherers and Cabinet can be assumed to act with anti-American singlemindedness.
Chas Freeman, a longtime American diplomat and China watcher, argues that plot-seekers usually ignore the complexities of the Chinese system. "Unless and until there is something more concrete linking these different stories, I cannot accept that there is a plot," he said. "This scandal is about us, not about them."
Still, several of the main players in the drama are Chinese. One of the most prominent foreigners to have sought audiences with President Clinton during the last election was Liu Chaoying, an aerospace company executive and child of the Chinese army's most senior general, Liu Huaqing. Mrs. Liu was reported to have given money to the Democratic National Committee through a Taiwanese-American fund-raiser, Johnny Chung. The People's Liberation Army also has a vested interest in launching more foreign satellites and, of course, in acquiring American missile technology.
But the task of connecting those strands of information is complicated by the fact that China's military, though it remains opaque and wary of outsiders, does not follow the totalitarian model, at least when the model suggests unity and discipline of the first order. In fact, the army is closely watched these days for the high command's attempts to steel the ranks against an insidious foreign force: capitalism.
 
Make Money, Not War
In the early 1980's, a time of budget cutting, the late patriarch Deng Xiaoping pushed military units to support themselves by doing business, and by the end of last year the army could claim some 10,000 business enterprises within its domain, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, an industry journal. They make phones and cars, operate cruise ships and hotels, and own companies with listings on domestic and foreign stock exchanges. They also produce armaments, but some estimates put their arms-related manufacturing business at a small fraction of the total.
The military's vast commercial side sometimes supports national defense, but not always. Central military authorities have struggled to get officers to focus less on money making and more on military preparedness. And one expert on the Chinese military, Tai Ming Cheung in Hong Kong, says the bulk of money earned by military companies is invested in new businesses, or used to buy luxury goods for senior officers, or laundered overseas.
Even further removed from the army's direct control are defense contractors, including the China Aerospace Corporation, the parent of Mrs. Liu's company. It reports to the Government's Cabinet, not to the generals, and is considered a commercial enterprise, albeit with some military manufacturing duties. It has a subsidiary that has issued shares publicly, and that company is Mrs. Liu's direct employer, China Aerospace International. It has its headquarters and its stock listing in Hong Kong, making it subject to the former British colony's corporate disclosure rules. Its business line includes telecommunications, auto parts and real estate, but not military manufacturing.
Further complicating the picture is the fact that the companies rarely draw sharp lines between military and commercial businesses. China Aerospace, for example, controls Great Wall Industries, which manages China's Long March commercial rockets and solicits launch business from foreign satellite companies. Long March technology overlaps that of China's nuclear-tipped missiles. But China Aerospace and its subsidiary are also developing a separate and purely commercial television satellite business to serve Chinese homes.
Those degrees of separation make it even harder to piece together why Mrs. Chaoying might have forayed into American politics. Was she working on behalf of Great Wall Industries and the Long March rocket, or China Aerospace's satellite plan, or its auto parts, or none of the above? No one knows for sure, says Mr. Mulvenon of Rand. He also said it would not be unusual for such a person to seek contacts or publicity in America for an entirely separate reason, like a personal venture.
He considers highly unlikely one other scenario -- that she was working on behalf of her father, the now retired chief of the army, to acquire American military technology. Or that she was on a mission to persuade President Clinton to relax export controls on dual-use, civilian-military goods.
"One thing you can say with some certainty is that China is not run like Iraq, and Liu Huaqing is not Saddam, relying on his own children for sensitive missions," Mr. Mulvenon said. "China is much more institutionalized, not a capricious tin-pot dictatorship." He said the Ministry of State Security would jealously guard its right to manage an espionage mission, and the Foreign Ministry would be unlikely to charge an aerospace company executive with an important diplomatic duty, even if the executive had a high rank by birth.
None of that disproves a plot by the Chinese military, these experts say. But it raises the bar a notch for those who seek to show that one exists.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Leaving America;
Ireland, New Promised Land

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: YONKERS, N.Y.

 BODY:
BETWEEN retrieving thrown juice cups and cleaning up crushed cookies, the moms in the mother-toddler group at the Irish Community Center here talk about home. But unlike generations of homesick Irish women before them, many of them aren't just talking. They're going.
With the Irish economy thriving and now an agreement for peace in the long-bloody North -- resoundingly ratified in a referendum last weekend -- the motherland's pull on its exiles in America seems more powerful than ever. Many young Irish adults are breaking with earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United States for good: The Irish Government reports that over the last two years, 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America than went the other way. 

Reversal
That reversal breaks with previous decades of Irish immigration to the United States, one of the oldest, largest, most sustained and most culturally influential migration flows of American history -- reaching nearly a million in the 1850's after the Irish potato famine, but dwindling lately to just a few thousand a year.
For a few years now, the Irish have been celebrating the surprising return of their countrymen from England and Australia as well as America, a trend that the peace agreement seems sure to accelerate. Now the Irish in America, who once saw little choice but to come here, are confronted with a happy dilemma: choosing between this land of opportunity and a land more familiar to them that has been newly vested with promise.
To economists, Ireland is now "the Celtic tiger." Thanks largely to American and other foreign investments in high-tech manufacturing plants for computers, pharmaceuticals and other products, newly created jobs have brought unemployment in Ireland down to 9 percent from nearly 16 percent in 1993. Investors, in turn, are bullish largely because next year Ireland (unlike neighboring Britain) will adopt the European Union's unified currency, the euro. Participation in the euro imposes economic discipline on countries using it and is expected to reduce the cost of doing business within the European Union.
Jerry J. Sexton, a labor-market specialist for the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said most of those returning from the States are in their mid-20's to mid-30's, and usually have some education or skills.
Across the Atlantic, his assessment is affirmed in interviews with Irish immigrants. James Dalton, an Irishman who owns Dublin Construction Inc. in Woodside, Queens, said he typically employs 20 of his countrymen as carpenters or laborers -- and typically one leaves for home every week. After spending the day refitting a pub in mahogany, two of his 20-year-old carpenters -- both out of Ireland just two months -- ordered a round of Guinness and confided their dream: saving enough money to start a construction business back home.
In many of the Irish bars that dot New York, similar stories are being told, some that sound much like the fantastic tales that envious dreamers in the Old World once told about America. Seamus Gillespie, a 44-year-old asbestos remover who was sharing a pint and a cigarette with a co-worker and his fiancee at another bar in Woodside, leaned in to give the news about the Irish economy. "They're not building houses," he said. "They're building mansions!"
 
Whole Households
Historians of American immigration say revolving-door migrations like this one are nothing new, despite popular myths about America as the promised land. But they note that the Irish exodus is unusual in that it seems to involve whole households (as opposed to men without families), making the departure of the Irish more noticeable.
Dr. Kerby A. Miller, a history professor at the University of Missouri who specializes in Irish immigration, calls the turnabout simply astonishing for a people long motivated by starvation and political and religious repression to forsake their homeland. In the past, he said, "Irish immigrants longed to return, at least sentimentally, but they realized it was impractical or impossible."
Among the factors motivating the new Irish returnees, Irish immigration counselors say, are frustrations and delays in winning American citizenship, given the United States' current anti-immigrant political climate. Lately, though, the peace agreement for the British province of Northern Ireland provides another incentive for those already weighing a decision to return.
Arriving at the Irish Community Center in Yonkers to pick up his wife and young son, Andrew J. Convery, a taxi driver from the Bronx, said the prospect of peace was a big factor in their decision to return. A Catholic from Northern Ireland, he came here six years ago in search of the American dream, and met his future wife, Kerry, a Catholic from Dublin, when he picked her up as a fare. Now they are moving back so their 1-year-old, Ciaran, can be raised the way they were. But without the bombs. "Before, there wasn't much to go back to," Mr. Convery said.
The Irish exodus raises as yet unanswerable questions about the subtler cultural effects on two countries that have long drawn on each other's richness. Several neighborhoods in Queens and the Bronx look like Potemkin Irish villages: Newsstands sell papers from each Irish county, convenience stores carry ox-tail soup mix and butcher shops offer grouse. Lately in the United States, Irish culture, once shunned by the upper crust, has enjoyed a broad revival. "Angela's Ashes," Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of growing up poor in Limerick (interestingly enough, after his family returned from America), has been on The New York Times Best-Seller List for 89 weeks. And in recent years, "Lord of the Dance," the choreographed extravaganza created by Michael Flatley, an Irish-American, has made Irish folk-dancing almost hip.
The Irish cultural vibrancy here could be diluted by Ireland's new drawing power, says Dr. Timothy J. Meagher, the director of the Center for Irish Studies at Catholic University in Washington.
"If you lose the immigrant base, it threatens the culture," he said.
The flow of Irish from the United States can be expected to increase as the Irish Government and business groups rev up the welcome wagon. Ireland's Department of Social Welfare, which earlier published "Thinking of Going to London?" and "Thinking of Going to the United States?" last year switched gears and put out "Thinking of Returning to Ireland?" -- a guide to housing, pensions and workers' rights. A hopeful headline asked, "Home for Good?" A private group called Returned Emigrants was started last year and has grown to 180 members in three chapters; they gather to vent shared frustrations, including their experiences with the pokey Irish telephone service.
To other returnees, however, such flaws are quaint reflections of a more leisurely pace of life, which to them is one of Ireland's big draws. Pauline A. McGovern, who moved back to County Kerry in May with her husband, Brendan, and their son, said that within days of returning, her husband found work as a plumber. When they lived in Yonkers, he had to leave every workday at 6:45 A.M. to catch a train and then the subway for work in Manhattan. Now, he hops on his bike at 8:55 and rides 20 blocks to work -- and comes home at noon for dinner. Their 3-year-old son, Ryan, sleeps three hours later. "I think it's in the air," Mrs. McGovern said.

U.S. ECONOMY
Whoa, Big Fella!
Two economic indicators released early last week suggested that the economy was throttling back from the heated pace it reached earlier this year. Sales of previously owned homes fell in April, while consumer confidence edged lower this month. Existing-home sales in the United States declined 2.5 percent last month, to an annual rate of 4.77 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. And the Conference Board said its measure of consumer confidence declined to 135.2 in May, from 137.2 a month ago. A few days later, however, the Commerce Department reported that the economy in the first quarter was even stronger than initially reported. The gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up from the earlier estimate of 4.2 percent. Not to be outdone by upbeat assessments, President Clinton said he now expected the budget surplus for 1998 to hit $39 billion. 

SOUTH ASIA
Nuclear Tests' Fallout
The United States backed up its threat to make India pay for its recent nuclear tests by forcing a delay on $865 million in World Bank loans for an electric power grid and other projects. Without the loans, India will either have to scale back the grid or turn to higher-priced loans from private banks. Though the action was aimed at New Delhi, it was also seen as a warning to Pakistan not to set off its own nuclear devices. Pakistan was not impressed, detonating five devices soon after the loan cutoff. The United States announced that it would impose the same package of economic sanctions on Pakistan that it applied to India.
 
JAPAN
Glum and Glummer
Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded credit and financial strength ratings for five major Japanese banks, citing concern over Japan's weakening economy and the Asian financial crisis. In a grim assessment, the credit agency also put an additional four Japanese banks under review for possible downgrade. "Moody's believes that the combined scale of these problems may overwhelm many banks' internal resources and necessitate substantial official assistance," the agency said. The yen did not get much more respect than Japanese banks over the week; the dollar rose above 138 yen for the first time in almost seven years. To top things off, unemployment rose to 4.1 percent.
 
WORKERS
Just Saying No to Welfare
Some companies that hire welfare recipients say they have found that such workers stay on the job longer, with less turnover, than other employees. Many skeptics had argued that welfare workers lacked the skills and motivation to hold jobs. One expert pointed out, however, that welfare recipients receive job training, child care and transportation -- all unavailable to people "hired off the street. The employment picture for workers in general looks continues to look promising over the near term. In a survey of more than 15,600 businesses by Manpower the last two weeks of April, 32 percent said they intended to increase their work forces in the third quarter of this year, with just 5 percent cutting back and 59 percent maintaining present staffing levels. The United States unemployment rate is 4.3 percent, the lowest since it was 4.2 percent in 1970.
 
COMPUTERS
Intel Inside -- a Courtroom
The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to file a major antitrust action against the Intel Corporation, accusing the company of abusing its position as the dominant manufacturer of microprocessors for personal computers and bullying some computer manufacturers, according to Government lawyers. The suit will accuse Intel of selectively withholding key technical information about its chips from computer makers with which Intel is involved in patent and related product disputes. Without that data, the manufacturers are unable to design new products. Intel's processors and Microsoft's operating systems are the brains and nerves, respectively, that run 90 percent of personal computers. The Justice Department and 20 state Attorneys General filed antitrust actions against Microsoft on May 18. . . . The computer maker Gateway isn't waiting to see the outcome of the suits. After months of prodding, it got Microsoft to ease restrictions on customizing the screen that people see when they turn on their PC's. Gateway will let buyers pick the Netscape browser or the Microsoft browser.
 
VIAGRA
Hit Me Again, Doc
Pfizer Inc.'s Viagra, the pill to treat impotence, had more refills even as the total number of prescriptions declined in the week ended May 15, according to IMS Health, an industry consulting group. The drop in total prescriptions came before the Food and Drug Administration said that six people taking the pill had died. The F.D.A. said it could not confirm whether the deaths were linked to Viagra. After its introduction last month, Viagra has become one of the best-selling drugs in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions so far. Analysts expected demand to level off after men tried their first doses. Instead, the number of refills rose 46 percent, to 35,100, in the week ended May 15, while the total number of Viagra prescriptions fell to 297,666, or 1.9 percent, from 303,424 in the previous week, IMS Health said.
 
MALLS
Born to Shop
Growth in personal income accelerated in April and spending also increased. Shoppers are now spending an average of $67 a visit at malls, according to a survey of 38,000 shoppers by the International Council of Shopping Centers. That is about 10 percent more than a year ago. "The 'wealth effect' created by stock market gains, record low unemployment and the rise in real disposable income, which advanced 2.9 percent this past year, will continue to positively impact retail this year," said John Konarski, vice president of the trade group. Only one-third of shoppers said they visited malls just to browse, down from 41.5 percent a year before. The more affluent the shopper, the less likely he or she is to browse. The older the shopper, the more money is spent on each mall visit, the survey showed, peaking at $81.10 among shoppers aged 45 to 54. Teen-agers spend nearly $40 a visit, and the elderly spend just over $50 a visit.
 
PASSAGES
Philip L. Carret, 101
Philip L. Carret, a founder of one of the country's first mutual funds, the Pioneer Fund, died last week. He was a proponent of buying shares of companies with steadily growing earnings, strong balance sheets and managers who themselves owned a hefty stake in the company, and then holding those investments for many years.

HEADLINE: An Antitrust Antithesis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Capitalism Victorious (Thanks, Everyone)" (May 10), about the proposed merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, gave a brilliant historical prospective of the interaction between two favored big businesses. 
 What is more intriguing, considering such history, is how the United States Justice Department is perceiving its role in supposed antitrust matters. What seems to be emerging is a view that the welfare of the consumer is unimportant and that the regulation of merger activity is to be based on some unknown political criteria.
How is the consumer served by permitting banks, insurance companies and brokerages to merge? The prices of all of those services (except brokerage services) have risen as the industry consolidates and choice is reduced. How is the car-buying public served by having a German company, favored by its Government, buy an American company that taxpayers saved from ruin?
Conversely, how do computer users benefit when Microsoft, created by entrepreneurs, becomes so successful due to technical and marketing expertise, yet is attacked by our Justice Department because it serves consumers too well and makes computer use too affordable?
It appears that the Justice Department has things backwards and has forgotten the purpose of its antitrust mission -- to economically benefit the American people.

HEADLINE: With Hardly a Stir, Party Leaves Japan Coalition

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 30

 BODY:
Japan's four-year-old governing coalition fractured today when the Social Democratic Party formally announced it would quit and strike out on its own.
It is a measure of how far the Social Democrats have fallen in popularity that their departure will scarcely matter. The Liberal Democratic Party, which has dominated Japanese politics since the 1950's, will continue to govern Japan, with no need for new elections or a Cabinet reshuffle. 
 The collapse of the coalition had been expected and probably will not to cause any particular instability. The Liberal Democrats have a slight majority in the House of Representatives, the more important chamber of the Parliament, and therefore may not need the coalition to maintain power.
In addition, the Social Democratic leader, Takako Doi, said her party would support the Government of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a no-confidence motion that the opposition parties are planning. Miss Doi said her party could not vote to condemn Government policies that it had helped to formulate. "We can hardly say we are not responsible" for current problems, she said.
The coalition, formed in June 1994, had always been an improbable blend, a triumph of ambition over principle. It united the Liberal Democrats, who despite their name are more like what in the United States would be called conservative Republicans, with the Social Democrats, who were then known as the Socialist Party.
Ironically, nothing so undermined the Social Democrats as proximity to power. For decades they had formed the main opposition party in Japan, and there was occasional talk that they might even be elected to form a Government on their own.
In contrast, they are now withdrawing from power weakened and almost irrelevant, and it is unclear how much longer the party will even survive. The role of the mainstream liberal opposition has been taken over by another group, the Democratic Party.
In retrospect, the Social Democrats peaked at precisely the moment that seemed their finest hour: the ascension of Tomiichi Murayama as head of a Government coalition in 1994. It seemed an extraordinary triumph for the political left to place a socialist at the top of the world's second-largest economy, but the experience with Mr. Murayama profoundly soured the Japanese electorate on his party. The problem was not that Mr. Murayama was perceived as a hard-line leftist, but that voters saw him as little more than an opportunist.
The governing coalition also includes an even tinier party, the New Party Sakigake, which has also said it plans to withdraw from the coalition. Sakigake's departure would be even less noticed than that of the Social Democrats.

Allowing Games to Be Educational Tools

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Despising Nike is too easy these days, not that the sneaker bully doesn't deserve it. But the commercialization of adolescent sports, the corruption of higher education and the exploitation of low-paid workers is too huge a mission even for Phil Knight and his talented marketing executives. They needed help to swoosh the world, and they got it eagerly from Michael Jordan, from hundreds of pro athletes, Division I coaches and university presidents. They got it from high school coaches grateful for team uniforms and a little walking around money.
All this came up two weeks ago at the University of South Florida's unusual and stimulating conference on ethical issues in sport. But unlike the nostalgia buffs at most sports conferences, the attendees in Tampa seemed interested in progressive action. 
 One idea that created some heat came from Navita C. James, a member of the president of U.S.F.'s staff and a former director of the university's African studies department. She suggested that local ethicists could form something like a truth squad to approach pro teams with social, economic and political information that celebrity athletes, among others, would just as soon ignore. It would include conditions in the overseas factories that produce the sneakers they wear (and sometimes bear their names) as well as the minority hiring practices in the arenas in which they play and the hotels in which they stay. Not to mention in their own clubs' front offices.
A tall, handsome, enthusiastic woman, James made her suggestion with good humor. There were more than a hundred academics, journalists, coaches and athletes in the room, and they seemed divided between sharing her enthusiasm and rolling their eyes. Satch Sanders, the former Boston Celtics player who now works for the National Basketball Association, spoke for the establishment. He suggested rather coldly that it was a little naive to think that an athlete who had been kept in the tunnel of his games since the age of 12 would "suddenly become a social activist" just because someone had given him a leaflet.
Sanders, an old friend, is smart and sophisticated enough to know that not only is he absolutely right, but that James's provocative idea is also just the kind of naive scheme that could have an effect. The leaflet might not keep Jordan from continuing to give tacit endorsement to institutional racism, but the publicity it generated might give the next generation of athlete/model, or at least its agents, a pragmatic reason to make better choices. No one expects an athlete to become an activist, but becoming an informed citizen seems doable.
James's expression of enlightened naivete emboldened me to offer the audience an expression of my own. Many years ago, when Nike was running its annual summer high school basketball meat market in Princeton, N.J., I was in a group of teachers and journalists paid to attend a seminar there. That shrewd marketivellian, Sonny Vaccaro, was riding the swoosh then, and the little think tank was part of Nike's cosmetic academics; the company also made a great show of tutoring the players for their S.A.T.'s. (Now there's a Ph.D. thesis; a comparison of college graduation rates among Nike, Adidas and Reebok schools.) This was all between the summer camp games, of course, which, then as now, were set up as scouting-made-easy. (Even now, the college coaches sit in the stands taking notes in catalogues purchased at the box office that contain not only the players' statistics, but their home telephone numbers and the numbers of their coaches.)
At the end of our seminar, a Nike executive asked for suggestions. Naively, I asked, if Nike really cared about the communities it mined for young gladiators, why not also invite to camp, from the same high schools, male and female nonathletes with interests in journalism, medicine, law and business. Coached by teachers in those fields, the youngsters could write and broadcast stories about the players, learn to tape their ankles, keep their statistics, get a sense of box office and accounting procedures. There was a condescending Thanks, Bob, and we moved on.
Two weeks ago, when I brought it up again in Tampa, there was some eye-rolling, but the response from many coaches and teachers was instant and positive. They had been wrestling with ways not only to defuse what they saw as the negative aspects of sports -- the win-at-all-costs immorality, the driving commercialism, the exclusion of the non-elite -- but also to use games as educational tools. The bones of the idea were hardly on the table before they were fleshing it out, dressing it up, thinking of ways to identify the youngsters who needed to be offered possibilities that were real.
If Nike doesn't want to fund it, maybe Satch can get the N.B.A. involved. At the least, the league seems to need a worthy image boost, from stem to Stern. Satch and I didn't get a chance to talk about it because James came running up, offering to form a coalition. I told her it was all hers, just do it, you can.

HEADLINE: Iowans Seem All Too Calm About Race for Governor

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, May 29

 BODY:
Gerald Rayner, a grain and livestock farmer and registered Democrat from nearby Lone Tree, thinks he likes "the guy -- his name starts with a V" in this state's race for governor, but he is not sure he cares enough to make it to the polls on primary day.
Norman Ziskovsky, president of the Johnson County Cattlemen's Association here, knows he likes a Republican for the governor's job, but he registered as a Democrat because it is much more important to him to vote in this eastern Iowa county's majority party in local races. 
 And Jerry Morgan, a corn and soybean farmer who lives in Stumptown, has already voted for Democrats in an absentee ballot he filled out earlier this month, but he did not bother checking a box in the governor's race.
It is hard to tell, but Iowa is in the midst of what by most standards would be considered a season of political uncertainty and upheaval. Gov. Terry E. Branstad is leaving office at the end of this term, having served 16 years in the governor's mansion.
His departure leaves his fellow Republicans with a chance for some new blood. And it leaves Democrats with a desperate opportunity to take back an office they have not held for the last 30 years.
But just days before Tuesday's primary, in which both parties have contested races, the people of Iowa are not exactly enthused.
"The big yawn," is what Steffen Schmidt, a professor of political science at Iowa State University, calls it.
Even Governor Branstad, who says he will probably spend some time in the private sector, is concerned about the lack of interest.
"Our biggest challenge is to keep people from becoming complacent," Mr. Branstad, 51, said in an interview.
The prevailing view is that the strong economy, which has left Iowa with an unemployment rate of less than 3 percent and a budget surplus of more than $800 million, has dampened people's interest in government and politics, even in a state where the Presidential caucus has made people relatively politically aware.
"Times are very good," said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the political science department at Drake University in Des Moines. "People don't see politics as a solution to any problem. And you don't have any candidate who generates enough charisma and interest."
Campaigning at a burger-and-baked-beans dinner at the Johnson County Fair Grounds for residents who helped out after a recent tornado, even the most well-known candidate by far, Jim Ross Lightfoot, a Republican and former Congressman, found people who were not quite sure who he was. And he had to remind supporters like Dorothy Hobbs Kunkel, who sells feathers for hat bands and fishing lures in West Liberty, that there was a primary on Tuesday.
"You would think there would be some enthusiasm," Mr. Lightfoot said, "because we are going to change governors, no matter what happens."
It is not that there are no issues in Iowa. There is concern about young people leaving the state, about how to regulate the environmental effects of corporate "hog lots," about how to spend the budget surplus, and about education. Indeed, much more consuming than the election these days is a battle between Mr. Branstad and legislative leaders in his own party over an education financing bill. The Governor even canceled a trip to Russia, saying he would call the adjourning Legislature back into special session over the bill.
Politicians are hopeful the interest in the election will increase after the primary, when the national parties are certain to fight for such an important governorship and a stream of Presidential toe-dippers will traipse through the state.
Mr. Lightfoot, 59, a former farm radio reporter who served six terms in Congress and lost a close, bitter race for the Senate against the Democratic incumbent Tom Harkin in 1996, is the overwhelming favorite in the Republican primary, largely because he is so well-known. A lanky, white-haired man who flies a plane and speaks in folksy cadences, he is considered more conservative than Mr. Branstad, especially on fiscal issues.
His opponents are David Oman, 45, a former chief of staff to Mr. Branstad, and Paul Pate, 40, the Secretary of State, who both believe Mr. Lightfoot's proposed tax cuts are too steep.
The Democrats have a much closer race between Mark McCormick, 65, a former State Supreme Court Justice, and Tom Vilsack, 47, a State Senator. Mr. McCormick, who has headed several state commissions, is leading in popular polls, in part because of his Irish name, party leaders say. But Mr. Vilsack, a former Mayor of the southeastern town of Mount Pleasant, has the support of labor unions, a major factor in what is expected to be a low-turnout primary.
They differ slightly on approaches to crime, education and hog lots, but their serious, low-wattage personalities and their views are generally so similar that even ardent Democrats like Tom Carsner, who is running for Johnson County Supervisor in this university and farming town, said he keeps "vacillating between the two."
While Iowa has become more Republican in state and local races, Democrats are hoping for a backlash. "Thirty years is just too long for one party to run the governor's mansion," said the state Democratic Party chairman, Michael Peterson.
But political experts say it may be hard to fight the legacy of Mr. Branstad, seen as a steady, hard-working Governor, who, while not charismatic or a visionary, steered the state through the farm crisis of the 1980's and kept things running smoothly.
"To be honest with you," said Professor Schmidt, "we don't have any idea of what politics will be like A. B. You know, After Branstad."

On the right, five migrant farm workers slept on two mattresses. Straight ahead, two were on blankets on the floor. On the left, below a television, were three more. 
 There were eight migrant workers in Room 27A and seven in Room 7, six crammed in two double beds, one on the floor. Though most motorists would hardly glance at the drab motel, it had as many residents as a small town.
"When it comes to the rent, it's much more economical this way," said Reyna Fernandez, a 22-year-old strawberry picker from Mexico who had opened the door to a visitor to Room 39, which rented for $200 a week. "We really earn very little."
Three decades after Cesar Chavez made the shocking conditions of migrant workers a national cause, more farm workers than ever are living in squalor.
One reason is that Government efforts to build housing have not kept pace with the growing number of migrant workers. The Federal Commission on Agricultural Workers estimates there are 2.5 million farm workers, up from 1.8 million in 1960. About 800,000 of the current workers lack adequate shelter, according to the Housing Assistance Council, a Washington-based consulting group that studies rural housing.
In recent years, the agricultural work force has changed in ways that make it much harder for the Government to improve the workers' living conditions, whether by providing housing itself or pressuring growers to improve the housing they provide.
The most important is that the migrant work force, once composed mainly of United States citizens, is now largely made up of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, 40 percent of them here illegally. And a growing number of them leave their families behind, coming with the goal of sending home as much of their earnings as possible.
Eager to earn as much as 10 times what they can at home, these workers are willing to put up with living conditions and wages that few Americans would accept. The economic imperative driving them -- that they can lift their families out of poverty -- is so powerful that it has assured a plentiful supply of migrants even as real farm wages have fallen by more than 10 percent in the last 20 years.
"The root of the problem is there is an oversupply of farm workers," said Bruce Goldstein, executive director of the Farmworker Justice Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group.
Over the past decade, the Federal and state governments, working with growers, have built tens of thousands of housing units for migrants. But those units usually go to families, citizens and legal immigrants, rarely benefiting several large groups facing the worst circumstances: single men and women, illegal immigrants and workers who move from harvest to harvest.
And stricter Federal laws requiring growers to improve their migrant housing have largely backfired: rather than contend with the cost and hassle of complying, thousands of growers have stopped providing housing, since they are not required to do so.
Some of the worst conditions result when entrepreneurs fill the void by renting rundown housing at inflated prices. In response, migrants cram in as many people as they can to reduce how much each pays.
"We have to put up with this because we can't afford anything else," said Maria-Guadalupe Sanchez, a farm worker who lives with 13 other people in a three-bedroom house in Watsonville, Calif.
Watsonville and Salinas are on California's Central Coast, a bountiful agricultural region, but migrants earning $200 a week share little of the prosperity.
The Central Coast is not alone, however. The housing shortage is so severe that in harvest-time visits to farming communities up and down both coasts over the last year, workers were found packed 10 or 12 into trailers and sleeping in garages, tool sheds, caves, fields and parking lots.
"These people work very hard," said Moises Loza, executive director of the Housing Assistance Council. "The tragedy is that they're out there pursuing the American dream, and we don't treat these people, who do very valuable work, as if they merit the conveniences and decent shelter that most of us take for granted."
 
The Conditions
Different States, Same Misery
As the harvest moved from state to state, there was one common thread: miserable living conditions.
In Orange County, N.Y., an hour from Manhattan, raw sewage formed puddles outside migrant workers' trailers. In Mecca, Calif., more than 100 migrants slept in parking lots and along the road.
Along the Columbia River in Mattawa, Wash., dozens of Mexicans up for the cherry harvest slept in crude tents and lean-tos. In Belle Glade, Fla., hundreds of decrepit shacks have been demolished, only to be replaced by ramshackle rooming houses.
Immokalee, in the Everglades, boasts it is the East Coast's winter vegetable capital, but it might also be the trailer capital. It is crowded with mobile homes, many of them decades old, that absorb the population each winter when the tomato and pepper harvest swells the town to more than 20,000 people, from 8,000 in summer.
Outside, many trailers are painted a crisp white that masks the conditions inside. Because the trailers have few electrical outlets, wires crisscross bedroom ceilings so the workers can plug in fans and radios. To protect their food supplies from rats, migrants hang bags of flour and cornmeal, pinata-like, from strings nailed to the ceiling.
Ramiro Jeronimo, a 17-year-old tomato picker from Guatemala, could not hide his embarrassment. As he showed a visitor the trailer he shared with seven others, a rat jumped from behind a bag of flour on the refrigerator and scooted into a cupboard.
The bare wood around the kitchen sink was rotting. The living room had two beds, while the 10-by-10 end bedroom had three lined up inches apart. Clothes were slung over twine strung between the walls.
The trailer rented for $950 a month: as much as seaside apartments in nearby Naples and twice what year-round families in Immokalee pay for three-bedroom houses.
"It's difficult here, but it's hard to find anything better," Mr. Jeronimo said. "When you return from work, everyone wants to use the bathroom at the same time. And it's hard to sleep because some people want to hear music."
The trailers are rented out by entrepreneurs who take advantage of the seasonal crush of migrants. "They can afford to keep these trailers in terrible condition and charge abominable rents because these people have no choice," said Steven Hitov, a lawyer with Florida Rural Legal Services.
State officials say they do not have enough inspectors to find every trailer or house with illegally crowded or unsanitary conditions. And landlords often maintain that the migrants create the squalor and overcrowding behind their backs.
In the winter, Bernabe and Domingo Jacinto, brothers from Guatemala, and 10 cousins, nephews and uncles moved out of a cockroach-infested $800-a-month trailer to a $1,100-a-month, two-bedroom house. Now five slept in one bedroom, three in the other, three in the living room and one in the dining room. The shower reeked of mildew; the bathroom floor was so badly rotted that weeds were visible underneath.
The $100 a month each brother paid might seem cheap, even for such conditions, but they called it exorbitant because it equaled a peasant's monthly income in Guatemala.
"It's very expensive, but what can you do," Bernabe Jacinto said. "There are nicer houses, but they're far from the center of town. We don't have cars. All we have are our two feet."
Every morning at 5:30, Mr. Jacinto and hundreds of other migrants walked to a parking lot where trucks took them to the fields. He usually earned $5.15 an hour, or about $200 a week, and sent his wife and six children $250 a month. "It's difficult thinking it might be a year or more before I see my family," he said. "But it's good that we can earn some money here."
 
The Government Role
As Rules Multiply, Housing Dwindles
As early as Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency, government reports focused on the plight of farm workers. Ever since, insuring decent living conditions for migrants has been one of the most intractable problems facing government officials.
Masses of migrants enter the country and circulate undetected. Many are illegal immigrants who get hired through forged documents or growers turning a blind eye to their illegal status. Housing inspectors are stretched thin, and politicians and the public are hardly clamoring to spend money on housing for this largely invisible population.
Still, state officials and farmers boast that, often with Federal subsidies, they have built thousands of houses that have allowed farm workers to vacate the most rundown shacks.
Government inspectors have tried to shut down the worst housing. In Immokalee, the state has condemned all housing without electricity and closed encampments of makeshift tents.
"We used to have people who slept on canal banks, but in Florida now, all migrant farm workers are housed in some kind of structure," said Ken Widergren, one of Florida's chief inspectors of migrant housing. "There's a lot of wonderful housing that's been built and new housing is going up all the time.
"In some places, I'd still describe the conditions as deplorable."
Farm-worker advocates say far too little housing is being built. This year the Clinton Administration will spend $27.5 million on the main Federal Government program for farm-worker housing, which makes low-interest loans to developers. It is requesting $45 million for next year -- still far less than the $69 million spent in 1979.
Since 1983, 7,584 houses and apartment units have been built under the program, an average of 506 a year, and several hundred more are built yearly under other, smaller Federal programs.
Pressured by farm-worker advocates and embarrassed by exposes, in 1986 Congress enacted stricter rules for housing provided by growers. But instead of complying, many farmers stopped providing housing. In California, the number of labor camps provided by growers has plummeted to 1,000, from 5,000 in 1968.
"It got to the point where there are a lot of rules and regulations on housing and that created a tremendous cost," said Andrew Esposito, labor compliance coordinator at the United States Sugar Corporation, which closed a 150-unit camp in Florida in 1994. "It just wasn't economically feasible."
"Our job is to grow sugar and citrus," Mr. Esposito said. "We're letting the private sector take care of housing. Admittedly some of the housing isn't as good as it should be, but it's not for us to tell a local mobile home park how to take care of housing."
A recent legislative showdown in Washington State underlined how hard it is to ease the shortage. In 1997, the Legislature approved a bill allowing farmers to provide barracks without heating or hot water, but requiring central kitchens and bathrooms.
"Some of these orchards may only have a six-day harvest," said Mike Gempler, executive director of the Washington Growers League. "It's not economically sensible to build a full-scale apartment house that's sustainable for full-year living, just for a six-day harvest."
With the United Farm Workers union denouncing the bill, Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, vetoed it. But this year growers pushed the bill through again, and Governor Locke signed it after the Legislature added money for housing and tightened rules on plumbing and electricity.
The growers say the barracks are better than sleeping in the fields. But the president of the farm workers in Washington, Guadalupe Gamboa, said: "They're going back to 1940's and 50's shantytowns. We're talking about barracks with 60 people in a room and no heat, even though it freezes here in April."
 
The Invisible
Out of Sight, Out of Mind
On either side of the stream in Southern California stood primitive huts that seemed straight out of prehistoric times, except for their black plastic sheeting. Nearly camouflaged under the trees and vines, the huts were built from branches and two-by-fours covered with cardboard and the plastic sheeting that is used to cover fields to protect young plants from freezing. Essentially crude wooden frames wrapped with black plastic, they appeared equal parts Cro-Magnon and Cristo.
"I live here because it's close to work, and I don't have enough money for food, not to mention rent," said Juan Alarcon, an 18-year-old Mexican who shared a hut with his brother. They earned about $50 for a nine-hour day picking cucumbers and peppers.
The 50 or so hut dwellers lived around a hill from the vegetable fields they tended, 20 miles inland from Oceanside, Calif.
"Two sheets of plastic are good for keeping out the rain," Mr. Alarcon said. "But it's dangerous here. There are coyotes, mountain lions, and I killed a big rattlesnake."
The hut dwellers used the stream to wash themselves and their clothes. To get to work, many had to walk over a log crossing the stream. They live here several months each year, migrating north in the fall to other harvests and heading to Mexico each Christmas to visit their families.
"I don't like it here, but I have to live here," said Claudio Villa Cuevas, a 64-year-old Mexican "There is no other work."
The farm where they worked is far from any town where they could rent housing. But there were advantages to the location: it was hard for immigration agents to find them, hard for housing inspectors to find their huts, hard for neighbors to complain about illegal immigrants and eyesores nearby.
"In Southern California, where a lot of houses go for $250,000 to $500,000, people don't want to see farm workers, they don't want to see these little brown men in their vicinity," said Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance. "They want them around at 6 A.M. to bid down each other's wages, and then they want them to disappear at 6 P.M."
 
The Exception
Adequate Housing Rewards a Grower
To many farm workers, there is a simple solution to the problem: pay them more.
Growers respond that competition from foreign produce makes it hard to raise wages. Farm-worker advocates retort that growers can easily increase pay, because wages are a small fraction of retail prices.
Growers cite another sticking point: if they raised wages, many migrants would send the extra pay home and continue sleeping in garages or overcrowded trailers.
Advocates contend that if Government and growers build more housing, the increased supply would provide shelter for migrants who sleep in fields while lowering rents for those who pay exorbitant sums.
Some growers do provide decent housing, like the rows of tidy houses maintained by A. Duda, a Florida citrus giant. The company, unusual in its generosity, spends $1 million a year to house almost 1,000 workers, who often sleep two to a bedroom in four-bedroom, cinder-block apartments. Duda executives say the housing attracts good, dedicated workers back each year.
But many growers say building such apartments for $25,000 each would erase their profits. These growers say the free market should supply housing. But profitability is an obstacle there because migrants rent only a few months of the year and can afford only low rents.
An increasing, but still small, number of growers say they want to contribute to a fund to build farm-worker housing. And advocates say the Government needs to put up far more money. But there is little public clamor to build such housing.
Nonetheless, there are some highly promising programs, like one in Coachella, Calif., 20 miles east of Palm Springs.
In a development called Vista del Sol, 75 families who hope to settle down permanently spent nine months building 75 homes, with the cooperative spirit of a barn-raising. Usually eight families cooperated to build eight homes at once, pitching in on framing each other's walls and shingling each other's roofs, doing their construction each day after working in the fields.
The result: handsome houses appraised at $90,000, with $20,000 of that value coming from sweat equity.
"It's a lot of work, but it's worth it," said Juan Alvarez, a 39-year-old vegetable worker. "It's roomy, and a lot more comfortable than the trailer we lived in."
His mortgage payment is just $240 a month, about what he and his family paid to rent a cramped, rundown trailer.
Vista del Sol was made possible by a $70,000 low-interest Federal loan to each family and the patient planning of the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, a nonprofit group that has orchestrated the building of 500 self-help houses since 1989.
There is one snag: in the Coachella Valley alone, there is a waiting list of 2,000 families eager to build homes. That, housing experts estimate, is four times the number of self-help, farmworker homes built nationwide last year.
Nonprofit groups say they can oversee construction of 10,000 self-help homes per year -- if there was Federal money.
But Jill Long Thompson, Under Secretary of Agriculture for rural development, acknowledged that the will was not there for a concerted effort.
"It's very difficult because of the limited resources," she said. "We are barely making a dent in meeting the need."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE WASHINGTON VIEW;
Pakistan Test Leaves U.S. Out of Ideas and Angered

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
The United States reacted with anger and a sense of frustration to Pakistan's nuclear test today, as Administration officials said they had few ideas about how to stop the arms race in South Asia.
President Clinton was awakened at about 4:45 this morning and informed of the new test by his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, who in turn had been rousted by a call from the White House Situation Room. 
 Mr. Clinton condemned the new tests in a statement, saying, "Pakistan and India are contributing to a self-defeating cycle of escalation." He called on both to "renounce further nuclear and missile testing immediately and take decisive steps to reverse this dangerous arms race."
But United States officials, citing reports from the Central Intelligence Agency, said Pakistan today continued to prepare to test-fire its Ghauri missile, which is designed to be fitted with a nuclear warhead and has a range of up to 900 miles. They also said Pakistan appeared to be preparing to test a second, shorter-range missile, called the Tarmuk, which has a range of about 250 miles.
The C.I.A. said that Pakistan tested one bomb this morning, with an explosive force of between one and five kilotons, according to preliminary estimates. That is a relatively tiny bomb by cold-war standards, though it could kill hundreds of thousands of people if detonated in the heart of a big city.
Intelligence analysts believe a goal of the test was to devise a bomb small enough to fit on a missile. Pakistan is believed to be close to that difficult goal.
"My guess is that Pakistan is a screw-turn away from weaponizing their bomb, putting it on a missile or dropping it from an F-16," said Milton Bearden, a former senior C.I.A. official who was based in Pakistan in the 1980's.
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said, "This second test of nuclear devices can only further raise tensions in south Asia and undermine the global consensus on nonproliferation."
"We are very disappointed that Pakistan continues to ignore the calls to exercise restraint that were made by the international community after its first tests," Mr. Rubin said. "We again urge both Pakistan and India to cease and desist" from weapons tests and words of war.
Diplomats, policymakers and intelligence officials said today that they saw no end in sight for the arms race between India and Pakistan.
"Is this now the excuse for another whole new round of tests?" said Nicholas Platt, a former United States Ambassador to Pakistan and president of the Asia Society. "What do we do now? You have to do a lot of talking, pay a lot of attention. But there is no magic formula" to stop an arms race, he said.
"Once the Indians tested, the Pakistanis didn't have any choice," he said. "Now, of course, we're confronted with one more test and the question is whether they now feel they have reached a parity with the Indians or whether they are just escalating."
Administration officials said there was little the United States could do on its own to stop an arms race. "After a while there's nothing left on the shelf," said one Administration official. "The President has said, 'There's not a lot I can do.' "
Another, more senior Administration official said: "We're still worried about a missile test" by Pakistan and a likely Indian response. The best that could be hoped for in the short-run, he said, was that India and Pakistan would be as careful with their nuclear weapons and policies as Washington and Moscow were during the cold war -- which was, he acknowledged, little comfort.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Meeting Called on Tests
 LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) -- The foreign ministers of the world's major industrial powers will meet in London on June 12 to try to adopt a joint response to nuclear tests in India and Pakistan.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said today that he would be host to a meeting of the Group of Eight -- Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia.
Elsewhere, Japan condemned the new Pakistan test a day after freezing economic aid in response to the first tests.
Russia also condemned the test and called for a special session of the United Nations Security Council, which scheduled consultations this afternoon.
China, an ally that helped Pakistan with its nuclear program, expressed "deep regret" over the test today.

HEADLINE: Poor Conditions Follow Laborers as They Travel North

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: FLORIDA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Every July and August, an estimated 45,000 migrant workers arrive in New York State to harvest onions, apples, pumpkins and vegetables.
Eager to work as many months as possible, the migrants, most of them from Mexico, have followed the harvest north from Florida, most often through Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. 
 The lucky ones are offered well-kept trailers and houses that could serve as a model for migrants everywhere. The less fortunate end up in foul-smelling shacks with dingy walls, plywood floors and screens with large holes that invite in mosquitoes.
In last year's harvest in this onion-growing town 50 miles northwest of Manhattan, sewage formed a puddle outside one migrants' trailer and snaked around to the front. While the small bedrooms had new bunk beds, the bathroom sink handles did not work, the toilet tank had no cover and the doorknob was missing, replaced by a stub of cardboard that had to be pulled to open the door.
At another farm in Orange County, four barracks-like structures housed dozens of migrants. In one barracks, the workers were naturalized Americans, and the conditions were acceptable. In another, workers who said they were in the United States illegally predominated and the conditions were far worse.
There, four men slept in a bedroom. The refrigerator was ancient, the freezer compartment did not freeze and the kitchen shelves were listing. One of the two toilets in the group bathroom had been broken for months.
"The housing is better in Mexico," one man said. "But in Mexico there's no work, and at least you make a little money here."
New York farmers say there is plenty of good housing for the migrant workers who bring in their harvest each year. One farmer built a spacious house, with new carpets and a roomy kitchen, for a migrant family of three. In apple country south of Lake Ontario, there are some immaculate remodeled labor camps.
But substandard conditions are easy to find. "We have an archaic system for harvesting crops, and it all falls on the backs of migrant workers," said Herbert Engman, director of the Cornell University Migrant Program. "There's no other group of workers forced to sleep in cars or tents. It's a very strange phenomenon that we haven't brought agriculture into the 20th century in this regard."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Doubleday Takes Wheel And Revs Up the Mets

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Nelson Doubleday is still in a home-run trot, a baseball lawyer said a week after the Mets acquired Mike Piazza. "He hit one McGwire distance," the lawyer said of Doubleday, "and he's not going away."
The addition of Piazza, who was not traded last Friday for the first time in three Fridays, has supplied jet propulsion to the Mets' sluggish engine. The Mets have benefited immediately from their latest -- and most electrifying -- trade with the Florida Marlins, on the field, at the gate and in the newspapers and on the airwaves. 
 Doubleday, the team's co-owner, hasn't contributed even a base hit to the suddenly explosive offense, but he is credited with an assist in urging Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, to pursue Piazza. Doubleday, acting out of dissatisfaction with the fans' and the news media's view of the team, likes the immediate results of his effort and plans to play a more active role with Fred Wilpon, the other co-owner.
"Absolutely I'm getting more involved," Doubleday said, confirming the lawyer's report of the owner's plans. "I'm around. I am back. I'm going to be much more involved. I had a lot of family stuff I was doing. It took up a lot of my time and I'm now able to concentrate on baseball."
Wilpon, as president and chief executive officer, has basically been the owner in charge while Doubleday has been more of an absentee owner. Wilpon, 61 years old, said Doubleday, 64, is welcome to play any role he desires.
"He's my partner," Wilpon said. "He's been involved. He chooses to do what he wants to do. Both of us don't make the baseball decisions. He chooses to do as much or as little as he wants. He always has."
Although the two men have not always agreed on baseball matters, they both looked at the results of the first six weeks of the season and didn't like what they saw.
"It became evident," Wilpon said, "that the perception of the team wasn't one that was exciting the fans. It showed at the box office. It just wasn't exciting them. Whether it was right or wrong was academic. It was a fact."
Doubleday said he grew tired of seeing small Shea Stadium crowds. "We weren't going anywhere, weren't doing anything," he said. "I said my experience is in marketing; let's see what I can do. I felt very strongly that we can do it better than we've done it. I'm not insulting Fred or anything."
Doubleday credited Phillips with putting together a "great" pitching staff, but it was the dull, often unproductive offense that was keeping the fans away in droves, and that's where Piazza came in.
"I thought Mr. Piazza was a viable man for the New York Mets and a viable man for New York City and one hell of a star and we ought to take a shot at him," Doubleday said. Five days after the Marlins acquired the catcher from Los Angeles in an economically mammoth deal, Doubleday passed Phillips in a corridor at the Mets' offices. "I said: 'Where does this Piazza thing stand? You ought to look into it,' " Doubleday related. "I got the feeling from reading the papers that Miami was getting ready to move him very fast."
Piazza, a .334 career hitter who has averaged 33 home runs and 105 runs batted in for his five full major league seasons, presented a pretty offensive picture for the Mets, but he posed potential problems. For one thing, he can be a free agent at the end of the season and already had rejected a six-year, $84 million offer from the Dodgers. For another, he has been portrayed as a selfish player who cared more about his own statistics than team results. Brett Butler, in the first spring of his retirement, called Piazza "a moody, self-centered 90's player" and questioned the wisdom of spending $100 million for such a player. Other members of the Dodgers corroborated that view, their agents said.
Wilpon said the Mets did their "due diligence," satisfying themselves that Piazza would be a legitimately positive addition.
Piazza rejected any criticism of him as unfounded.
"I felt like I always played hard and to win," he said. "Unfortunately, people in life, no matter what you do, aren't going to like you. Maybe I was able to learn from it. I just feel you have to be yourself. At this level, people can smell it when you're being fake."
Addressing the leadership issue, Piazza said, "I think the guy that's covering your back is just as much being a leader as the guy charging the pack."
The money issue is another matter. Dan Lozano, the catcher's agent, said he never mentioned a specific dollar figure to the Dodgers but said he wanted a seven-year contract. Another agent said that before the Dodgers' sale to Fox became official, Lozano was telling people that a deal was essentially set at $120 million. However, no Dodgers official ever confirmed that deal. Instead the new owners offered $84 million, and Piazza rejected it.
"When you offer someone the best contract in the history of baseball, it should tempt him more than it did this guy," a veteran agent said.
Rather than have him become a free agent and gain nothing for him, the Dodgers decided to trade Piazza, and he wound up in New York by way of Florida. Now he's the Mets' money problem.
Is he likely to accept less from the Mets than he wanted from the Dodgers? Are the Mets likely to give him baseball's first nine-figure contract?
Wilpon said the Mets will definitely try to sign Piazza. Doubleday said it's a problem the club will address at the end of the season. Baseball people believe that Piazza will seek $100 million or more from the Mets, especially with an attendance growth that he generates. Asked about nine figures, Doubleday said: "I don't know. We'd have to take a look at it, see what he wants, see what we can do, see what he can offer us, see what the chemistry is for the team. I think it's possible. New York City can afford it. Freddie and I are not averse to it happening. We have to look at the chemistry of the team."
It is the chemistry, Doubleday said, that should prompt the Mets to move slowly in the pursuit of any other major trades. "I feel quite strongly that if it's not broken, don't fix it," Doubleday said.
It's too early to start tracking the wild-card chase, but it should be noted that less than a week after the Mets made the Piazza trade, they became the second-place team with the best record. Four months from now, that status would put the Mets into the playoffs.

Cadets Are Warned of New Threats

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WEST POINT, N.Y., May 30

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen today urged the 865 graduates of the United States Military Academy to rise to the challenges of a post-cold war world dogged by new tools of war and the longstanding threat of weapons of mass destruction.
"You are leaving a world defined by tradition, stability and order," Mr. Cohen said, to enter a world "of rising ethnic conflicts, of regional aggressors, of asymmetrical threats, of cyberterrorists who would send poison arrows at our databases, our financial markets or our banking or space-based communications systems." 
 Taking stock of the four years since the cadets entered the academy, Mr. Cohen said great strides had been made in drawing central and eastern European countries into NATO and in stabilizing Bosnia after its civil war. But he reminded the cadets assembled in crisp gray rows in Michie Stadium that military pitfalls still existed, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.
Mr. Cohen took note of the recent testing of nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India, saying the development was a powerful reminder that even in an age when most of the world's nations are at peace, the United States must remain vigilant in its efforts to control the spread of nuclear arms.
"When America ignores the problems of the world," he said, "the world brings its problems to the doorstep of America."
He also warned of the continuing threat from Iraq, reserving his harshest words for President Saddam Hussein, whose prolonged intransigence over permitting United Nations weapons inspections led to a showdown with the United States in February.
Mr. Cohen noted that United Nations inspectors will brief the Security Council on their latest findings this Wednesday, but added that it was not the responsibility of the United Nations to uncover chemical weapons hidden in Iraq; rather, it was Iraq's responsibility to provide evidence that it had disposed of the weapons.
Mr. Cohen urged the cadets to embrace their role as the military representatives of the world's sole superpower. He challenged them to live up to the class motto they had selected: "Duty will not wait."
 
Albany Law School
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., May 30 (AP) -- As he dedicated a professorship named after Gov. George E. Pataki, Henry A. Kissinger told law school graduates today that the United States must recognize its diminished economic presence and increasing responsibility in the world.
Mr. Kissinger, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Secretary of State, told graduates of Albany Law School that the United States must realize it will be drawn into many worldwide conflicts and concerns, including the nuclear race on the Indian subcontinent.
"Your generation has an opportunity and responsibility to operate on a global scale in a way America has never had to in the past," he told the 147th graduating class of the fourth oldest law school in the country.
Mr. Kissinger said one way to help lead the country through this troubling course is through the endowed chair named after Mr. Pataki, which he dedicated at the commencement.
The chair in international commercial law is financed with $500,000 from Morris Silverman, a retired New York City businessman from the Albany Law School class of 1936.
Mr. Pataki, addressing the 250 graduates, said, "I am especially thrilled that it will be used to enlighten young minds on the subject of international commercial law, a field that is rapidly emerging."

HEADLINE: Offering Commuters Fare Cuts and Free Parking

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
Riders on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad out of Bridgeport, Conn., will enjoy lower fares and free parking at the station if a Connecticut proposal to help rejuvenate downtown Bridgeport and reduce traffic on Interstate 95 is approved.
The fare reductions are expected to take effect near the end of August, reducing the cost of a monthly ticket from Bridgeport to Grand Central Terminal to $272 from $283, said Harry Harris, who is in charge of public transportation at the Connecticut Transportation Department. The reductions for daily and weekly tickets will vary depending on whether they are for peak or off-peak travel time, he said. 
 The Bridgeport City Council is to vote tomorrow on the second part of the state proposal -- an offer of $1 million from the State Department of Transportation to build a lot that would provide free parking for 750 cars. "I expect it will pass," said John M. Fabrizi, the president of Bridgeport's City Council. "It's a home run for Bridgeport. It will alleviate congestion on I-95 and boost our own economy. We want to attract more people to the city."
Mr. Harris said commuters must be persuaded to take the train from Bridgeport instead of Fairfield, a town four miles away where a monthly ticket costs $254. In 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, an average of 2,231 people took the train at Fairfield every day, compared with 537 in Bridgeport, Mr. Harris said.
The real savings to commuters in choosing Bridgeport would come from the free parking, Mr. Harris said. Parking now costs $60 a month in Bridgeport and $28 a month in Fairfield.
"There are 1,700 people on the waiting list to park in Fairfield," Mr. Harris said. "People drive down from the Trumbull-Ansonia area, and they go to Fairfield because there has been a perception of safety problems in Bridgeport. Now there will be an economic incentive to go to Bridgeport."
Mayor Joseph P. Ganim announced on Friday that the city would receive $34 million in Federal funds to build a terminal that would connect the region's railroad, ferry and bus lines. "What the city needed was a safe, clean, accommodating parking facility to draw people off the highway," he said. "It will be easy in, easy out."
If lower fares and free parking are not enough, maybe extra trains and the promise of empty seats will help, Mr. Harris said. Express trains originating at Bridgeport may be added in September, he said.
The commuter proposals are part of a larger effort to revive Bridgeport with attractions including a new minor league baseball park, which opened last week, and a planned waterfront redevelopment project.

HEADLINE: Classical Arts Lose Their Stages to Broadway

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
Orchestras, ballet companies and opera companies -- organizations that inspired construction of performing arts centers across America over the last 30 years -- are being displaced from their homes, sometimes for months at a time, by presentations with a different esthetic and a broader popularity: touring Broadway shows.
From Honolulu to Hartford, from Tampa to Tulsa, classical arts ensembles must now search for alternative spaces to perform as shows like "Phantom of the Opera," "Les Miserables," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Miss Saigon" sell out the classical groups' usual sites and earn record profits. The classical troupes say they often lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process. 
 The temporary exiles are all the more painful because many classical groups already suffer from dropping subscription levels and aging audiences. Moreover, in many cities, performance centers, though owned and run by the municipalities, were built primarily for these groups with donations from their major patrons.
In Louisville, for example, "Beauty and the Beast" will take over the main theater of the Kentucky Center for the Arts for two months next year, forcing one of the center's original "resident" groups, the Louisville Orchestra, to play at a renovated movie theater run by the local Broadway presenter.
In Honolulu, "Miss Saigon" will displace the Honolulu Symphony from the city-run Blaisdell Concert Hall for three months of its centennial season in the fall of 1999.
The Florida Orchestra could obtain only 5 of its desired 21 dates in the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center this season because of bookings by touring shows. The orchestra has experienced similar problems in other Florida cities; its executive director estimated that the problem had cost the orchestra between $300,000 and $500,000 this season.
Similar issues have arisen in nearly every city where there is one major arts complex and a sudden crush of interest in renting it, including Hartford, Des Moines, Columbus, Ohio, and Charlotte, N.C.
Behind the squeeze is the growing success of Broadway road shows. Once a second-string adjunct to the Great White Way, the touring show has surpassed New York productions in economic impact in the last five years. Industry statistics analyzed by the League of American Theaters and Producers show that touring companies now bring in twice the annual revenue of Broadway shows.
Some touring shows play for a week in each location, but the major shows sell out 2,500-seat halls for months at a time, earning, in some cases, more than $700,000 a week. Forty-six touring shows sold almost 18 million tickets last season, grossing nearly $800 million -- up from about $200 million a little over a decade ago.
The success has changed the balance of economic power in performing arts centers. The economic structures of the centers vary widely, but those built since the 1960's and modeled after Lincoln Center are generally either run by the local municipality or by a nonprofit agency established by the local government.
The Kentucky Center for the Arts, for example, which opened in 1983, was built with matching public and private money, mainly to provide a home for the local orchestra, ballet, theater and opera company. It has a budget of $7.2 million, out of which just 42 percent comes from earned income. That income is primarily made up of rentals and fees from its four theaters. They are available to "resident" artistic groups like the orchestra and the ballet. But they are also rented to outside concert presenters, conventions and for social functions.
But arts centers generally discount fees to local resident groups, which have never been profit makers. In recent years, those groups have been having an even harder time offering the center much income from percentages of ticket sales. Broadway shows, though, have become a gold mine.
"Broadway is the one slice that's making money," said Michael C. Hardy, the president of the Kentucky Center for the Arts. "It has become the tail that wags the dog."
The Broadway series at the Kentucky Center boasts about 10,000 subscribers compared with fewer than 2,000 for the Kentucky Opera and about 2,500 for the Louisville Symphony. While the opera and the symphony struggle to fill 70 percent of the hall, "The King and I" brought in $600,000 to $700,000 in six days.
Bradley Broecker, the president of the Broadway Series Management Group, the city's road show presenter, has even taken out a 10-year lease on the Palace, the vintage movie theater where he plans to regularly present Broadway shows and other entertainment, in some cases competing directly with the arts center.
In Louisville, the orchestra's executive director, Gregg Gustafson, like many other leaders of classical groups, challenged the changing emphasis of arts centers like the Kentucky Center for the Arts.
He points out that roughly a third of its $36 million cost was raised from corporate and private donors, many of whom were also patrons of the classical performing arts groups. "Their mission has drifted from what it once was," Mr. Gustafson said. "It was meant to provide a home for the orchestra. When we're kicked out of there for Broadway series, these questions come up."
When bumped from its traditional hall by a money-making Broadway hit, an art group must then find a less attractive site. It sometimes loses subscribers and may have to cancel concerts. Mr. Gustafson, for example, worries that the road show boom will undermine a long-planned effort to revive the orchestra. In the last decade, it has cut back its season and lost half of its subscription base.
But Douglas C. Evans, who runs Hartford's Bushnell theater, the largest nonprofit arts center in Connecticut, said that Broadway should not bear the total blame for the difficulties of classical arts groups. As many studies have shown, the classical traditions have become less compelling for younger audiences, who often have little exposure to them and no experience studying musical instruments.
According to a recent report commissioned by the Bushnell, the theater's 68-year-old World Symphony Series, which presents touring orchestras, once inspired such devotion that subscriptions were "passed from one generation to the next." In the last five years, attendance has dropped 37 percent and subscriptions have dropped 50 percent.
When "Phantom" came to Hartford in 1995, it played to 99 percent capacity audiences for more than six weeks. This season, "Showboat" grossed $1 million a week for four weeks. The Bushnell, which routinely sustained six-figure losses each year -- $760,000 in 1990 alone -- now breaks even and 92 percent of its performing arts income comes from Broadway presentations.
"Touring Broadway has been one of the engines to revive downtown Hartford," Mr. Evans said.
These changes have presented challenges for the classical arts, he said. In 1996, for instance, "Miss Saigon" displaced the Hartford Ballet's holiday presentations of "Nutcracker," a Christmas moneymaker for nearly every ballet company in the country.
The ballet rescheduled the production for Thanksgiving.
But the ballet, Mr. Evans said, ended up with a more successful run partly because it no longer competed with other attractions at the peak of the Christmas season. And in compensation for the move, the Bushnell gave the ballet a rental credit of $54,000.
Similarly, in Tulsa two years ago, some tempers were mollified when three performances of "Phantom" were sold as part of the subscription series of the local orchestra, ballet and opera, thus increasing their ticket sales.
The problem was more serious in Honolulu this spring as subscribers to the symphony protested plans to bump the orchestra from its hall for a three-month run of "Miss Saigon" beginning in September 1999.
Resolutions by the City Council and the Hawaii Legislature called for negotiations to avert a problem that, according to its executive director, Michael Tiknis, would have cost the orchestra about $500,000, a tenth of its annual budget. Under a compromise announced last week, the orchestra will be able to open its gala centennial season in September 1999, before the three-month run of "Miss Saigon" displaces it.
"It's the old story," said Ronald Andrew of Eagle Eye Entertainment of Toronto, which is presenting touring Broadway in Hawaii. "The business of art versus the art of business."
That is the story in Florida, as well. The Florida Orchestra does not have its own concert hall, but rents space in recently built performing arts centers in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater.
Since 1992, when "Phantom" played at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, touring Broadway shows have regularly sold out halls, drawing scalpers, inspiring demands for return engagements and causing more problems for the orchestra. In Tampa, the orchestra could book only 5 of 21 favored dates this season. In Clearwater, where the Ruth Eckerd Hall also started staging Broadway shows, the usual 7 pops concerts were reduced to 4.
In both cities, said the orchestra's executive director, Kathryn Holm, the halls were built with the participation and patronage of the orchestra's board, though not owned by the orchestra. In Clearwater, the concert hall was once billed as "Home of the Florida Orchestra."
But many leaders of arts centers argue that the Broadway boom indirectly helps other arts groups.
"Because Broadway does so well, the ramifications for performing arts centers are enormous," said Judith Lisi, the president of the Tampa arts center. "Broadway allows us to keep the rent for other classical concerts lower."
In Hartford, Mr. Evans is beginning a nationwide study of the impact of Broadway road shows on the performing arts. He agreed that there were benefits behind the conflict.
The added income, Mr. Evans suggests, allows the Bushnell to subsidize classical performing arts events with half-price rentals and helps support its half-million-dollar educational program. In Hartford, as in other cities, the new conflicts have led to attempts to negotiate future seasons with more care.
Mr. Hardy, the president of the Kentucky Center, hopes that the Center's 1,400-seat theater -- to open this fall -- may relieve some of the pressure Broadway's success has created. He has also established regular negotiations between the Broadway producer and the directors of the opera, orchestra and ballet.
As Ms. Holm, the executive director of the Florida Orchestra, points out, the crisis has also forced orchestras to "make lemonade." After being forced out of its traditional sites, the Florida Orchestra has tried informal concerts for families and schools and experimented with different repertories in a restored Tampa movie theater.
Mr. Tiknis, in Honolulu, sees a more ironic "positive byproduct" out of the struggle with Broadway: "Nothing, not even a concert in Carnegie Hall, could have made the city and its people feel closer to the orchestra."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ANXIETY: THE OVERVIEW;
PAKISTAN SETS OFF ATOM TEST AGAIN, BUT URGES 'PEACE'

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 30

 BODY:
Pakistan exploded another nuclear test device today, the Government announced, spurning worldwide criticism and calls for restraint after its nuclear tests two days ago.
Speaking after a round of tests that have catapulted the impoverished countries of India and Pakistan into declared nuclear powers and raised fears of war, a Pakistani official indicated that nuclear weapons could now be swiftly made ready for use. 
 "The devices tested conform to weapons configuration compatible with delivery systems," Shamshad Ahmad Khan, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference this evening.
"We have proved our credibility," he said, adding that today's test had concluded the series.
But he also said that Pakistan was ready to "talk peace" with India and that "it is not our purpose to enter into an arms race."
The Pakistani tests came two weeks after India exploded what it said were five nuclear devices.
A senior Indian official said today that India did not view nuclear testing as a competition with Pakistan requiring India to match each move by its archrival. The United States, which has imposed economic sanctions on both countries, condemned the latest Pakistani test. Articles, page 8.
Today's test came at 11:55 this morning in the same remote Baluchistan region of desert and mountains near the Iranian border where the previous tests by Pakistan were conducted on Thursday.
Initial reports said two devices, each with a force of 18 kilotons -- slightly bigger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima -- had been exploded in reinforced L-shaped tunnels, but Pakistani officials later said there had been only one.
Scientists outside India and Pakistan have questioned some of the two countries' assertions about their tests, and it was not immediately clear what size device Pakistan detonated today. The C.I.A. put the size at one to five kilotons, a relatively tiny bomb by cold-war standards.
Again and again in his remarks, Mr. Ahmad, the Foreign Ministry's senior civil servant, referred to India's development of nuclear weapons and the struggle between the countries over the disputed province of Kashmir, which he said was under the "patently illegal occupation of India." India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
Mr. Ahmad said Pakistan had developed its nuclear ability "only, only in self-defense and only to deter aggression."
"It is to restore the strategic balance," he said.
Mr. Ahmad reiterated his Government's assertion that it is willing to negotiate with India. But negotiations, he insisted, must lead to a "peaceful and just" solution to the problem of Kashmir.
Jammu and Kashmir is the only majority Muslim state in predominantly Hindu India and has been the scene of brutal violence between Muslim separatists and Indian security forces. Part of the Kashmir region is held by Pakistan, which has supported separatists in the Indian-held area.
Today's test was greeted here with jubilation. Crowds have been dancing in the streets of this desperately poor Muslim country since Thursday's announcement that Pakistan had conducted five underground nuclear tests in response to an equal number by India earlier this month.
Indeed, far from bowing to the pressure of international sanctions and at least four nations' recall of their ambassadors, officials here spoke openly of loading the newly developed nuclear warheads onto missiles.
"There is no problem" putting them on warheads, Foreign Minister Gomar Ayub Khan said on Friday.
Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the chief of Pakistan's nuclear development program and the country's newest hero, agreed. "If the Prime Minister asked, it would not be difficult to mount them," Dr. Qadeer Khan said. "We can really, really mount them, not in months, not in weeks, but in days."
Normally fractious parties across the splintered political spectrum are saluting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for standing up to India, and Friday Prayers throughout the country were devoted to giving thanks for the country's nuclear ability.
In the North-West Frontier Province, mountain tribesman let loose with the traditional celebratory volleys of gunfire from weapons of all descriptions.
Office holders, usually enriched here by their public service, vowed belt-tightening to share the economic suffering to come.
The elation reflected the long tensions between India and Pakistan. With a vastly larger population and a military twice the size of Pakistan's -- 1,145,000 to 587,000 -- India has been the dominant force on the subcontinent.
Much of the tension has centered on Kashmir. With independence, the princely states that had made up the British colony were to chose which new country they wanted to join. Most of the population of Kashmir was Muslim but its Maharaja was Hindu. When Pathan tribesmen challenged his rule, he appealed to India, which sent in forces.
With the victory of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in the Indian election this year, the tensions have sharpened, and both sides have been emphatic in linking the nuclear race and the Kashmir issue. After the nuclear tests by India, that country's Home Minister, Lal Krishna Advani, increased war jitters by speaking out strongly on Kashmir.
Both countries have been furtively developing their nuclear potential for years. But it is only in the last few weeks that India and Pakistan shouldered into the club of declared nuclear powers.
Dr. Qadeer Khan, Pakistan's nuclear director, gave new details of Pakistan's program in an interview today with a local newspaper, The News.
Describing the tests on Thursday, he said one was a big bomb that had a yield of about 30 to 35 kilotons, which was twice as big as the one dropped on Hiroshima. The other four were small tactical weapons of low yield. Mounted on small missiles, they can be used in the battlefield against concentrations of troops.
"None of these explosions were thermonuclear," a hydrogen bomb, he said. "We are doing research and can do a fusion blast, if asked. But it depends on the circumstances, political situation and the decision of the Government."
This morning's Pakistani newspapers were euphoric over the nuclear tests, carrying article after article about parades and celebrations here, and the discomfiture of the Hindu nationalists and the reigning Bharatiya Janata Party.
"Long Live Nuclear Pakistan," declared the headline on the front page of The Pakistan Observer. "Five nuclear blasts have instantly transformed an extremely demoralized nation into a self-respecting, proud nation of 140 million people, having full faith in their destiny," a front-page article said.
"Indian explosions and belligerent statements made by the B.J.P. leaders were a constant source of constant anguish for patriotic Pakistanis and a befitting response was inescapable to restore the badly shaken confidence of the masses.
"India's self-perceived towering stature, on the basis of which it hurled threats on Pakistan, has been razed to the ground in the mountains of Chagai," the area of the test site.

HEADLINE: Trump Buying The Landmark G.M. Building

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
In a deal reminiscent of the high-flying 1980's, Donald Trump and an Indianapolis insurance company have purchased the General Motors Building in midtown Manhattan for $800 million.
"It's a terrific asset," Mr. Trump said last evening, confirming the deal. "It's probably the greatest real estate asset in the world." 
 It is now one of the most expensive. The property attracted numerous bidders, but sources said that some of them began to drop out when prices soared to $750 million. Mr. Trump and his partner, the Indianapolis-based insurance company Conseco, paid a $40 million down payment upon signing the contract Friday afternoon.
"It is already a premier building but it can be greatly enhanced," Mr. Trump said.
Known as one of Manhattan's trophy properties, the General Motors Building sits in a prime midtown Manhattan location across Fifth Avenue from Central Park. Once the sale is completed, the General Motors Building will join Mr. Trump's other midtown properties, including Trump Tower at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West.
The 50-story General Motors Building bestrides an entire city block, stretching between Fifth and Madison Avenues and between 58th and 59th Streets. With 1.9 million square feet of office space, it accommodates such prestigious tenants as General Motors, Estee Lauder and Revlon, Mr. Trump said.
For the past decade, the building had been owned by Corporate Property Investors, a New York-based real estate investment trust that also owns dozens of shopping malls across the country. In February, Corporate Property reached an agreement to sell its malls to the Indianapolis-based Simon DeBartolo Group, one of the country's largest owners of shopping malls. But the deal required that the General Motors Building be sold separately from the malls.
"It was sold in contemplation of the merger we hope to close in the beginning of August," said Richard Posen, a lawyer with Willkie, Farr, Gallagher, who represents Simon DeBartolo.
John Mechanic, a real estate lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, expressed surprise that Mr. Trump ended up as the high bidder. The building is 98 percent leased, and Mr. Mechanic said it is the sort of stable revenue producer favored by large real estate investment trusts.
"It's a little surprising that an entrepreneur ended up in a bidding contest like that as the high bidder," Mr. Mechanic said. "I guess ego would probably have something to do with it."
A lawyer close to the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity said many bidders hovered at about $750 million and a few went higher.
Mr. Trump's lawyer, Leonard Boxer, agreed that pride played a role in Mr. Trump's pursuit of the property but he also cited economics. Mr. Boxer said Mr. Trump entered the bidding only about a week ago. On Thursday, parties on all side negotiated late into the night, hammering out the deal that was signed the next day. Mr. Trump said he and Conseco are equal partners in the deal.
Mr. Trump said he planned to revamp the building's existing retail space, in particular the subterranean plaza currently leased by Houlihan's restaurant. The toy store, F.A.O. Schwarz, also leases property facing Fifth Avenue.
Mr. Trump acknowledged that the purchase marked a departure from his usual practice of purchasing and developing vacant buildings.
"This is different, but there is still a great deal that can be done with the building," he said.
Mr. Trump said several of the corporate leases should come due in the next four or five years, and he predicted that he would increase their rents substantially. "Some of these leases are going to be doubled or quadrupled," Mr. Trump predicted.
Asked if Mr. Trump paid too much, the developer's executive vice president in charge of acquisitions, Abe Wallach, said no. Mr. Wallach said other development possibilities include converting part of the building to residential condominiums or to a hotel.
A 3,000-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in another of his properties, the nearby Trump Tower, is listed for sale for $3.49 million.
David Simon, the chief executive officer for Simon DeBartolo, could not be reached for comment. The company is expected to hold a press conference tomorrow to announce the deal.
Built in 1968 by the acclaimed architects Edward Durell Stone and Emery Roth, the General Motors Building had a controversial birth. To construct the white, marble-plated skyscraper, the architects had to raze the graceful old Savoy Plaza Hotel.

HEADLINE: Hardship Claim Is Doubted In Bid for SoHo Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article about housing in SoHo "Non-Artists' Housing Seen as Blot on Local Canvas" (May 10) ignored the real issues. 
 The Board of Standards and Appeals granted several variances based on the developer's highly suspect claim of economic hardship. It relied on property comparisons outside of SoHo and a parking capacity at 19-35 West Houston Street of 35, even though, as the accompanying photo reveals, about 57 cars are routinely parked.
What's more, the buildings are out of scale and out of character with the Cast Iron Historic District. In approving them, the Landmarks Preservation Commission sold out the idea of landmarking.

Pass the Popcorn (And the Khakis)

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
NAME-BRAND apparel and independent films. There's not much connection there, really, except you might wear one while watching the other. Still, consider this: Major clothing manufacturers have decided that, in their quest to remain hip with youth, they want to associate with those low-budget films that everyone talks about and almost no one sees.
On Wednesday, Perry Ellis International presented its first Breakout Award to the two stars of the movie "Slam," a winner at the Cannes and Sundance film festivals. Next weekend, Dockers Khakis will sponsor the first Classically Independent Film Festival in San Francisco. And the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation has signed a deal to promote the stars of Dimension's "Faculty" -- Josh Hartnett, Salma Hayek and Elijah Wood; it expects the movie, about werewolves in high school, to be as successful as the studio's two "Scream" movies. 
 The list doesn't stop there. Polo Ralph Lauren sponsored the New York premiere of "Shooting Fish" recently, and Perry Ellis has co-sponsored the openings of "No Looking Back," "Office Killer" and "The Opposite of Sex" -- edgy indie films all.
So, what gives with this meeting of casual-Friday fashion and low-budget celluloid?
Max Garelick, the president of Perry Ellis International, said, "I'm interested in what's new and different, instead of what the mainstream is talking about." His company believes that its customers are the kind of hip people who could spot Saul Williams or Sonja Sohn, the young stars of "Slam," in a crowd. Inevitably, Perry Ellis is drawn to the -- how to say this? -- independent-ness of the independents.
Which can backfire. At the party at the Perry Ellis offices in Manhattan, Mr. Williams pondered the significance of a group of clothing industry executives paying homage to a film like "Slam," a drama about prison, the inner city and poetry. It's like "an old dying country on its deathbed, discovering its long lost soul," he said.
Who knows, maybe that's the kind of individuality that clothing companies are looking for. "Our customer is not part of that red-white-and-blue, Tommy-Ralph-Nautica herd," Mr. Garelick said. "They're self-assured and individualistic. They're drawn to Perry Ellis, and we see them drawn to movies that are not part of the herd."
Self-assured as the company may be, when it came time to select the winners of the Breakout Award, it wisely relied on the Independent Feature Project in Manhattan and a panel of independent-film experts.
Why get behind "Slam" rather than, say, "Die Hard 4"? Susan Malinowski, a senior vice president of marketing for Perry Ellis, said: "Independent film is consistent with a company that is trendsetting, a little hipper, a little younger, a little more sophisticated than companies that go the Hollywood route. We don't see ourselves getting involved in 'Air Force One.' "
Take that, Armani -- which supplied Glenn Close's wardrobe in "Air Force One."
Next for Perry Ellis International is the sponsorship of the glossy June 10 premiere of "The Farm: Angola U.S.A.," a documentary about the United States' largest maximum security prison, in Angola, La.
Is the support for independent film charity, or is it synergy? "It's synergy," said Amy Rosenthal, the senior marketing specialist at Dockers. Dockers Khakis (not to be confused with those swinging Gap Khakis) is the clothing label most heavily involved with independent film.
Besides sponsoring the Classically Independent festival, it ran the Fuel film tour last year (promoted in ads with people like Jon Favreau wearing Dockers) and has run advertisements starring "independent thinkers" like Asia Argento (who will appear in "B. Monkey"), Stacy Edwards (who appeared in "In the Company of Men") and Summer Phoenix ("S.L.C. Punk").
"I'm trying to blend the independent world into the brand," Ms. Rosenthal said. She argues that Dockers is a better fit with the spirit of independent film than her competitors. "If you look at Calvin Klein, it's sex," she said. "And Tommy is Americana. Dockers is about being who you are. It's about personal vision, and that's what independent film, especially for budget reasons, is about. They're hip with personal style. We don't want trendy, trendy."
Ms. Rosenthal sees some danger in getting corporations involved with low-budget and no-budget films. "Any time a big company gets involved in the arts, there's the sense of deep pockets," she said. "But the company doesn't belong in the creative process. We don't want to just slap a logo on. We're not trying to outfit casts and create big promotions."
That "outfit casts" comment is a slight directed at Tommy Hilfiger, which not only dressed the entire cast of "The Faculty," to be released at Christmastime, but also cast one bit player, Kidada Jones, Quincy Jones and Peggy Lipton's daughter. "I got her into the movie -- Tommy did," said Andy Hilfiger, the director of public relations for the company.
The expected audience for that movie is the "exact age demographic as our jeans customer," he said, adding, "It's a great marriage."
The company is also paying for a joint advertising campaign for the film that will top $10 million. "We already had the media in place," Mr. Hilfiger said. "We'd bought all the gatefolds for the fall books: Teen People, Spin, Vibe, YM. Those are perfect consumers for Dimension. It makes it a little hipper if the movie is not too commercial."
Some independent filmmakers find the prospect of a big company like Hilfiger dressing the cast and promoting a small movie to be troubling. Neda Pourang, the costume designer for "Macbeth in Manhattan," shooting in New York this summer, said that Hilfiger's outfitting the cast of "The Faculty" was "just terrible."
"If that became common with independents, I would have to retire from this business and be a window dresser at Macy's," she said.
Nor does she think it's a good idea if everyone in the cast wears clothes from the same company. "In a film, if you walk into a room and everyone's wearing Hugo Boss, that would be a nightmare," she said. "It would be like, 'Everyone's my dad.' "
Still, Perry Ellis has provided some clothing for "Macbeth in Manhattan," and Ms. Pourang admits she is grateful for the help. But she said: "I don't sell my soul to a designer. I think they realize that. It's my job to stop them." She paused for a moment.
"I have to remind myself that Perry Ellis dresses Alex Trebek," she said.
Robert Hanson, the vice president of marketing for Dockers Brand U.S.A., said that market research shows that consumers will switch to brands that share their values. "We feel pretty strongly that if you can demonstrate that a brand cares about issues and life styles, that's effective," Mr. Hanson said.
Dockers, owned by Levi Strauss & Company, is apparently not scared by the raw subject matter of many indies. "Levi Strauss has taken a stand on many controversial issues," Mr. Hanson said. "AIDS, H.I.V., youth empowerment, social justice, community-based economic development. A lot of the story lines in independent film are about those things, and this company has demonstrated an effort to air those issues."
Memo to Dockers, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger et al: There's another art form that takes risks and attracts hip, not "trendy, trendy," independent people. Poetry. It could use some new sponsors, and most poets could also use some new clothes.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Sunday Styles this week about clothing designers' inroads into independent films misstated the name of a new Perry Ellis award in the field. It is the Breakthrough award, not the Breakout award. The article also misstated the subject of "The Faculty," a movie in production with costumes by Tommy Hilfiger. It is about aliens, not werewolves.

HEADLINE: The Real Asian Miracle;
The World's Biggest Going-Out-of-Business Sale

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about start-up companies in Silicon Valley

 BODY:
 It has been less than 10 years since a Japanese company nobody had ever heard of bought Rockefeller Center, but it might as well be 10 centuries. The fear and loathing of the Asian corporate enterprise seems a thing of the distant past. The financial crash that began in Thailand last July 2 and that is still playing itself out across Asia was the final great clarifying event: in a stroke it explained away a great deal of mystery. American businessmen who had wondered how, say, Thailand kept growing by 8 percent a year, or how South Korea supported five large automobile companies, found themselves gazing into the guts of the busted machine.. . .Oh,so that's how it worked!
The second of July was the day that the central bank of Thailand gave up trying to support its currency, and the baht collapsed. While currency traders in midtown Manhattan danced little jigs of joy, the Thai central bank disclosed what it had lost in its futile attempt to bolster the baht. In just a few months it had spent $60 billion, $23 billion of it borrowed, which in Thailand is a lot of money. Only in retrospect could anyone understand why they had done such a thing: they were propping up not just a currency but an economy. 
 Over the previous few years, half of corporate Thailand had taken to gambling on its currency. Seeing that the interest rate on baht was higher than the interest rate on dollars, Thai companies borrowed as many dollars as they could, exchanged them for baht, raked in the interest differential, and prayed that the baht would not collapse. In the end, their prayers went unanswered. By the end of last summer just about every large company in Thailand was bankrupt. It was as if someone had waved a wand over an economic miracle and turned it into a savings and loan.
But that was only the beginning. A vicious circle emerged: when investors saw that corporate Thailand was bankrupt, they sold their Thai shares, and the stock market crashed. When the stock market crashed, more money fled Thailand and the baht fell further. The Thai people responded by tossing out one Government -- the oddly named New Aspiration Party -- and tossing in another, the reassuringly named Democrats. But that wasn't going to stop anyone with any sense from getting out of town. In the past seven months three different men have taken on the job as Thailand's finance minister and tried to sort out the unbelievable mess. But no one can, and no one will, at least not anytime soon.
Pretty much the same thing that happened in Thailand happened in South Korea. In Indonesia, the economic crisis brought on a political one, with protests and looting and hundreds of deaths and the resignation of President Suharto. The reason for the East Asian economic collapse was surprisingly simple: large Asian companies were failing to make money doing what they were supposed to be doing. They were selling hundreds of billions of dollars of consumer goods abroad without making a dime in profits. It wasn't business, it was a habit, and they gambled to support it. In other words, by capitalist standards, the Asian miracle was a bust. And its collapse was in one way more dramatic than the collapse of Communism -- no sane person believed that Communism worked.
Half a billion Asians got the news about their corporate culture more or less overnight. The psychological crash played itself out in stages. The first was denial. The Thais blamed Americans upset with Thai policy toward Cambodia; the Koreans blamed Westerners who feared they could not compete with Koreans; the Malaysian Prime Minister blamed the Jews. Across Asia, politicians became like those B-movie victims of torture who take a bit too long to figure out that it's better not to insult their captors. Every time one of them opened his mouth to complain, Westerners shorted his markets, and the markets crashed. The verbal abuse of foreigners didn't last long, though. After all, it's difficult to blame foreigners for your economic troubles when you had designed your economy to exclude them.
Once it became clear that denial didn't work, the hatred turned inward. The values and beliefs that created the economic miracle suddenly seemed actually pernicious. That earnest self-denial! Those bad suits! They didn't work! None of it worked. For one thing, the whole of industrial Asia had been built on a faith in elites. Elites rather than markets had determined who got capital, and therefore who was allowed to succeed in business. The elites suddenly were on the run. The economies no longer needed elites; they needed dollars. Entire societies assumed a position no one had seen in a generation, the colonial cringe.
South Korea offered maybe the clearest view of this startling phenomenon. The day the International Monetary Fund dictated the terms of its $57 billion loan to Korea, Dec. 3, 1997, was immediately named National Humiliation Day. Since then, all that is Korean has wilted, and all that is Western has risen. Now anyone who has dollars, or knows where to find them, is cast in the role of colonial administrator. The International Monetary Fund, with its own blowfish-throated bureacracy, turned up and chipped in its $57 billion. Free-market American financiers, once ignored, are calling the shots. Goldman, Sachs was hired to persuade the world to buy $3 billion worth of Korean Government bonds. Morgan Stanley was retained to sell off state-owned Korean banks. A hedge fund from New Jersey, called Appaloosa, was permitted to gobble up big stakes in a local tire manufacturer, a bank and a cell-phone company. People no one had ever heard of back in the States turned up with a fistful of dollars in downtown Seoul...and were welcomed!
 
An Asia Fund Is Not Necessarily a Joke
In early april two men with dollars to invest in Asia agreed to let me tag along on one of their business trips. Paul Matthews and Mark Headley of a San Francisco-based group of mutual funds, Matthews International Capital Management, are among the Western investors now trolling Asia for bargains and striking deals with the locals that before the financial collapse would have been inconceivable or just plain illegal. Since they opened for business in 1991, Matthews and Headley, who run four Asia-based mutual funds, have made these trips every few months. But from the moment Asia first cracked, the trips took on a different tone. We found ourselves in these meetings with corporate finance directors, says Matthews. They'd just look across the table and tell us point-blank: 'That's it. It's all over. I just bankrupted my company. What do I do now?'
At the time Matthews and Headley had their own problems. Every dollar they had invested in Thailand and Korea last June was by December worth 50 cents. Their many investments in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines fared nearly as poorly.
Matthews, who is English, and Headley, who is American, had always thought of themselves as stable, humble, long-term investors, the marrying kind. After the crash they found themselves running some of the worst-performing mutual funds in America. They faced ruin. At the end of 1997, Matthews and Headley were on the fast track to becoming a punch line.
But then something happened. On Jan. 1, a Wall Street Journal reporter called and asked Headley how he was dealing with his new role, total loser. "I bought a pool table and installed it in my office," Headley said, which was true. "When the markets tank, I shoot pool."
The Journal reported some of his panache in the lead of a short piece about pathetic Asian money managers. The piece caught the attention of Sir John Templeton, the famous mutual-fund investor. A week later Sir John called and placed $10 million in the Matthews Korea Fund, mainly, it seems, because it was the simplest way to invest in Korea. Matthews and Headley were running one of the only solvent, open-ended Korean mutual funds in America. A few articles about Templeton's money, and their solvency was confirmed. By early April, Matthews and Headley controlled more than $110 million in Korea and another $70 million in Indonesia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.
On a continent rapidly becoming the world's largest going-out-of-business sale, Matthews and Headley had dollars to spend.
 
 Seoul on Ice
Until we landed in Seoul, I hadn't thought it possible that Tokyo could look charming in comparison to anything. It is the hottest April morning in the recorded history of Korean weather, and the air hangs thick with a godforsaken yellow dust that sweeps down upon South Korea from northern China. Otherwise, the most unsettling thing is how normally life motors along. You half expect to see riots and mass starvation, but there is nothing of the kind.
It is the first time that Matthews and Headley have visited Korea together since the crash, and both are struck by the tranquillity of street life. This is the quietest Asian city on a Monday morning I have ever seen, Matthews says, gazing into the yellow haze.
Financial collapses are dissatisfyingly abstract. They leave no trace of their destruction, outside of a few sale signs and a skyline of unfinished construction. At this point in the Korean collapse, at least, all important disruptions have been internal. The suicide rate is up more than 30 percent since the crash, with a noticeable shift in its composition, from teen-agers to middle-aged businessmen. Yesterday a man named Lee Myung-Chul, an executive of the Hansol paper company, was dragged in by the Korean police for questioning about his balance sheets. During the session, according to news reports, he tried to kill himself by banging his head against the table. When that failed he stabbed a pair of scissors into his neck. A financial collapse is a tsunami of the soul.
There's money in tragedy, however. On the drive to our first meeting, Headley explains that there are two kinds of Korean companies worth buying. A relative handful of thriving midsize firms operate along lines more or less familiar to American entrepreneurs, and they're a good bet to emerge from the rubble. The other desirable category of companies, the gargantuan conglomerates called chaebol, will be permitted to survive only because the banks that lent them dollars can't afford for them to fail. Run-of-the-mill large Korean companies -- like large companies throughout Asia -- are now widely, suddenly, viewed as the worst-run on the planet, to be avoided at any cost. The American consulting firm McKinsey & Company just released a study showing that with the same amount of capital and labor, Korean companies produced only half as much stuff as American firms.
 
 Quotations From Chairman Kim
The Daewoo Corporation's build-ing is less like a modern office headquarters than a prison. The corporation is part of a group that includes Daewoo Motors, Daewoo Shipbuilding, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Daewoo Electronics, Daewoo Construction, Daewoo Capital and a lot else
besides. The Daewoo Group's annual revenues are pushing $100 billion, which represents about 10 percent of the Korean economy. This part of the portfolio, says Headley, as we find our way into a decrepit elevator, is a proxy for Korea Inc. It's neat to find the small company with the great technology that no one has ever heard of. But when foreigners rediscov-er Korea it'll be the chaebols that take off.
Lord knows how. Rows of exhausted Korean men hunch over their desks trying to look busy. Gray walls and decrepit linoleum floors are poorly lighted by exposed florescent lights. Half of the bulbs have been removed from each of the ceiling fixtures to save on the electric bill. Stepping off the elevator we are met by a weary young man with serrated forelocks and a nervous handshake. He leads us past an incongruous grandfather clock and several large photographs of Kim Woo Choong, the founder and chairman of Daewoo Group.
Chairman Kim, as he is known, created Daewoo in the early 1960's. He's the only man still running a chaebol of his own creation; all the others are run by heirs of the founders. At the zenith of the South Korean economic miracle, Chairman Kim became fashionable with American plutocrats, who, from a safe distance, admired his fanaticism. "The American company is not what it used to be," he wrote in his autohagiography, "Every Street Is Paved With Gold," which is decorated with encomia from John S. Reed, Henry Kissinger and the Forbes family. "In the old days," Kim wrote, "Americans worked hard to challenge new frontiers. But as their economy got mature, they became more interested in nice houses, jogging and having a good time than in doing business. How can you compete without dedication?"
Chairman Kim is now in an awkward predicament, similar to that of an old Soviet party hack after the fall of the Berlin wall. He is one of a handful of people most culpable for the ideas on which modern Korea was constructed. Yet his response has been to call for more of the same; more sacrifice from the average Korean worker, for example. Back in January, Chairman Kim and the head of another chaebol, the Samsung Group, requested that their employees gather any gold they might have in their homes and exchange it for the South Korean currency, the won. Kim wanted the Government to collect the gold, exchange it for dollars and alleviate the debts of Daewoo, Samsung and the rest. Old habits die hard; immediately the wishes of Chairman Kim became a national mandate. Forty thousand Koreans delivered up nearly two tons of gold treasures. In two days the fire sale of Korean family heirlooms drove down the price of gold on world markets to its lowest price in 15 years.
We leave the last of Chairman Kim's smil-ing portraits behind and come to rest in a grim little room with a table and chairs where the only sign of life is an etiolated plant. There we wait.
After a bit, a trim, officious Korean man in a neat suit, who declined to be identified and whom I'll call K., comes and takes a seat at the head of the table. Paul Matthews, who just turned 42, has been coming to this sort of meeting for 20 years, but in 20 years he has learned nothing by asking direct questions. Matthews came to Hong Kong shortly after his graduation from Cambridge University, in the great British colonial tradition, and has spent the better part of his career blending in. For the whole of his career it would have been thought rude for a foreign investor to challenge a Korean honcho; in any case it would have yielded only ill will. But now Matthews goes, in a pleasant way, on the attack.
matthews: It must be a tremendous burden for you to meet your next year's interest payment.
k.: Yes and no.
matthews: What percentage of your debt is in construction loans?
k.: (a bit nervously) I haven't got the details.
A dysfunctional relationship to capital is at the heart of the Asian crisis: companies were able to borrow money without many questions being asked. After the markets successfully destroyed the South Korean won last fall, the Daewoo Group was revealed to have debts five times its market value. Korean companies were able to pull this off because: a) the mystique of the Asian miracle seduced lenders; b) they eventually became so big that no one imagined them failing, and c) they kept their financial problems to themselves.
The most distinctive trait of the big Asian company is that it was never required to provide information to outsiders. An investment in Korea, for that matter most anyplace in Asia, could never be based on a piece of hard analysis. Often there were no books to inspect, and even if there were you probably wouldn't be allowed to inspect them, and even if you were, you could be sure that what you were permitted to see was far less important than what you were not. In this morning's paper one of the chaebol chiefs is quoted protesting the I.M.F.'s demands that Korea open its books: We, chaebol, cannot restructure ourselves in an open way because corporate deals need to be done in secret.
Not anymore. Now -- now! today! -- for the first time in these Western investors' experience, they might just figure out exactly how this mysterious Asian corporation is put together. If Matthews can determine that Daewoo is serious about dismantling itself, for instance, he can make a lot of money buying the parts that it intends to sell. Korea is like the brilliant athlete who has troubles off the field and is looking for a team to take a chance on him, the Latrell Sprewell of the Global Economy. By Matthews's reckoning, the Korean stock market, now worth $70 billion, could be worth between $200 and $700 billion if Korean companies were decently managed.
matthews: General Motors has said it might take a 50 percent stake in Daewoo Motors, but you have made no comment on that. Is it true?
k.: (producing a cigarette and lighting up) The current negotiation is 50 percent, that is true.
matthews: Will G.M. get control of the company?
k.: No, thank you for that!
Bad news. The only hope for Korea, Matthews thinks, is for half of it to be owned by foreigners.
matthews: What is the possibility of any of the Daewoo businesses changing its name? Could Daewoo Motors become General Motors Korea?
k.: The Daewoo name is our brand. It does not make sense to change it.
Matthews shakes his head and K. mumbles something, then excuses himself to take a phone call. In his absence, Matthews suggests to Headley that K. does not fully appreciate what has hit him. And he's wrong about the brand name, says Matthews. "Daewoo Capital would be much more valuable if it was called Merrill Lynch."
After a few minutes K. returns to the inquisition a changed man. He sits squarely in his chair, as if he's been strapped in. But this time he carries with him a spanking new booklet containing all sorts of information about Daewoo. For some reason he is now willing to answer Matthews's questions:
matthews: (leafing through the booklet) Are you still expanding into eastern Europe?
k.: Not really. We're not looking for new projects.
Good news. Matthews stops; he realizes that something important has changed. He raises the booklet in the air.
matthews: I don't think anyone has ever given me this information before.
k.: We never had to prepare it before now. Five years ago we did not need it.
matthews: One year ago you did not need it.
k. grunts.
Matthews now locates a chart that purports to clarify relations between the many different pieces of the Daewoo empire: the car company, the shipbuilding company, the bank, the brokerage house, the electronics company, the construction company and so on. It looks like a Greenwich Village street map.
"Does anyone understand this?" Matthews asks. K. chuckles nervously and sucks dead another filterless cigarette.
matthews: Is there any chance that you'll give board seats to foreigners?
k.: (long pause) Board of directors of a Korean corporation, in a real sense, has not existed before now.
matthews: (again holding up the magic booklet) I'm curious what is not in here. If I wanted a chart for the whole Daewoo Group's finances could I make it from this?
k.: (lighting yet another cigarette) That should be quite interesting to have. But it should be quite difficult to produce.
matthews: Does it exist anywhere?
k.: Chairman Kim's head.
Later, outside on the street, Matthews turns and says, "I don't know what is more interesting: the prospect of this regime changing, or how terrifying it is that we have been investing under it."
 
 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern At Sea In LG Chemical
Our visits to large Korean companies blend together. All have the obligatory grandfather clock, the homely oil painting and the depressing slogan painted on the even more depressing gray wall advertising the company's vision for the coming century: Vision 2000, Vision 21 or, in one especially weird case, Vision 2005. All have the young men with bad haircuts whose job it is to be insulted by foreign investors. These men exhibit precisely the qualities encouraged by the stereotypical American 1950's corporation: loyalty, conformity, self-sacrifice. These qualities, once globally admired, are now globally suspect. Eight months ago the young organization men seemed necessary to the economic miracle. Now they seem as doomed as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
This afternoon we visit another mammoth company, called LG Chemical. LG Chemical is part of the LG Group, and the LG Group, like the Daewoo Group, makes just about any product you can imagine. But while Chairman Kim projects machismo, LG projects desperation. In fact, Desperate Survival is the title of the investment brochure handed to us. Matthews and Headley page through it with feigned interest, until Matthews looks up and asks, "How many products exactly does LG Chemical make right now?"
The Koreans confer. Guildenstern leaves the room for a moment and returns with a thick green binder. They study it. Three hundred thousand, says Rosencrantz, finally.
"How many of those 300,000 products are you planning to eliminate?" Matthews asks.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern vanish into a long conversation in Korean. I can't help but notice that when the locals disappear into their language, Matthews and Headley retaliate with a rude discussion about the company in English. Headley points out to Matthews that the company has hired firm McKinsey & Company to make sense of its senseless business. A recent audit by Coopers & Lybrand revealed the fantastic web of bad debts used to create the LG Group in the first place. In effect, each putatively distinct LG company said to the bankers of every other LG company: if they fail, we'll pay the bills. "This is what the whole society did in place of credit analysis," Headley says.
When the two Koreans emerge from their discussion, they say they do not understand Matthews's complaint.
"Someone at McKinsey should be shot, Headley says.
 
Hearing From President Kim (And That Other Kim)
We set off to an investment conference to meet President Kim Dae Jung. President Kim has declared war on the Korean social structure and is using foreign financiers as his howitzer. His Government has passed laws that shift the balance of power away from Koreans who use capital and toward foreigners who have it. When Korean companies borrow money they must now say so publicly. Korean corporate accounts must be audited. The heads of the chaebol will no longer be allowed to quietly shuttle profits and debts around their various companies. Foreigners, previously limited to a 26 percent stake in Korean companies, will this June be permitted to buy companies whole. Ditto land. The big question in Matthews's and Headley's minds is: how much further will the President go?
We sit quietly in the ballroom of the Seoul Hilton with perhaps 75 other Westerners and as many Koreans as President Kim is ushered to the stage by large bodyguards. He hobbles in slowly, and you have to remind yourself that not that long ago he was a dissident on a boat in the Japan Sea, being fitted by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency with concrete shoes. (A last-minute call from the State Department saved his life.) He comes to rest behind a lead bulletproof desk, then lets fly against the old economic structure in a way that was unthinkable just a few months ago. In a single caustic sentence he sums up the Korean economic miracle: A model for growth based on authoritarian politics. He then says that he will greet with open arms foreigners who wish to stage hostile raids on Korean corporations.
But on the heels of the South Korean President comes the other Kim -- Chairman Kim of the Daewoo Group. He jitters up to the podium and eyes the audience as a mongoose eyes a snake. His remarks, delivered in Korean, are the opposite of the President's. I plan to expand into this crisis, he says. It is a great opportunity for Korea. It is the moment in the story after the curtain had been pulled back on the Wizard of Oz, but before the Wizard notices what has happened. He's still yanking his levers and blustering through his microphone while his audience looks on. Matthews shakes his head: the man who has flushed billions of dollars down the drain building a monument to corporate inefficiency proposes to extricate himself from his problems by flushing down a few billion more. He makes a mental note to dump his shares in Daewoo Shipbuilding.
"That was thrilling," says Headley afterward.
"I think he's actually gone mad," says Matthews.
 
 Meet Professor Jang, Capitalist Rebel
Sometimes the bravest thing a person can do is to behave badly. On a brief visit to a Korean bank we discovered that the bankers had been rattled by a university professor who declared personal bankruptcy. Though bankruptcy laws exist in South Korea, they have been overridden by the shame of unpaid debts. Just as Korean companies long agreed to sign for each other's loans, Korean families liquidate their possessions to settle the debts of a single member. The professor is, so far as anyone at the bank can recall, the first Korean officially to pull the plug on his creditors. It is widely viewed not as an economic act, but as a political one.
Tonight we head to a Japanese restaurant to dine with another Korean professor, who has taken to raising a stink at shareholder meetings. His name is Hasung Jang and he is a professor of finance at Korea University. He arrives fashionably late, his face so thin that it appears carved, his forelock stained with a distinguishing swoosh of gray, as if someone had been sloppy with a paintbrush.
We have the distinction of running the only open-ended Korean mutual fund in the United States, Matthews says, moments after everyone has taken his uncomfortable seat on the floor. So our interests are allied. Allied but distinct. The professor wants to make Korea a fairer society for the average Korean. Matthews and Headley want to make a fortune. All three men wear suits. But from start to finish their conversation has the deliciously illicit feel of a conspiracy against established authority.
It turns out that Professor Jang, like Michael Milken, came to radicalism via the Wharton School. In 1990, after teaching finance for three years to young Americans who wanted to become investment bankers, he returned to Korea. After I studied in the States, he says, I saw that there was no other way. I accept free markets. There is only one way to organize an economy, and it will dominate the world.
Jang wrote endless papers in Korean arguing for market efficiency, which had exactly zero influence. "As you know," he says, "the market is not really working here. So no matter what I wrote, they didn't care." And so: "I decided to jump into the market. Since I didn't have money I should carry some other weapon. I thought: how can I confront the guy who needs to be changed? And the natural answer was: become a shareholder."
In 1996, well before the current crisis, Jang formed his shareholder rights' committee. The thing muddled along for a bit until Jang seized on the idea of bringing lawsuits against companies on behalf of shareholders. He sued Korea First Bank, run by a friend of his father's, and has gotten nowhere. He later sued SK Telecom, a wing of the giant SK Group, and succeeded through a court order in getting three outside directors appointed to the board. In America there is a brisk business in such activity; in Asia there is nothing of the sort.
"In Korea the corporation is the vehicle for the execution of political power," he says. "And that power is not questioned." Jang came from a prominent Korean family and had gone to the best Korean schools and was friendly with many important Korean businessmen. Now, suddenly, he was the unwelcome outsider. Newspapers refused to accept his advertisements; friends declined to return his phone calls. The free-market revolt was too new for people to put a label on it, so if they spoke of it at all they grabbed for the old labels. The newspapers referred to Jang as "a leftist."
The turning point for Jang came last fall, after the crash. In December he went after Samsung Electronics. He used the voting rights of shares owned by the American mutual fund Scudder, Stevens & Clark to force a meeting with Samsung's president. The two men reached a gentleman's agreement that Jang would be allowed to voice his criticisms at the annual shareholders' meeting. Then all hell broke loose. To prevent unwelcome questioning, the big Korean companies, like the big Japanese companies, often marshal their employees to fill all seats. Outsiders can then be denied entry for lack of space. The President of Samsung Electronics had assured Jang this would not happen, but it did. On the day of the shareholders' meeting, which was scheduled to begin at 10:30 in the morning, Jang turned up four hours early and found the auditorium jammed with Samsung employees. The house remained full until 10:30 A.M., he says, and everyone in it was sleeping.
When Jang finally elbowed his way into the meeting, he accused the Samsung chairman of cutting various sweet deals for himself and his family, at shareholders' expense. The initial reaction of everyone in the room was shock. "The employees came up and said: 'How come you are calling my chairman's name like you are calling a dog? Why don't you show him respect.' And I said, 'Why should I call him in a respectful way even though I don't respect him?"' The meeting ran for 13 hours and 30 minutes, which, Jang has been told, is a world record for a corporate board meeting. By the end of it, Jang and his group of radicals were on their way to court, where they intended to prove, among other things, that the minutes of Samsung's corporate board meetings are forged.
The point of all of this is to open the company's books, and to force it to run its business to maximize its profits rather than the power of its chairman. If Jang succeeds, he will set in motion a process worth a fortune to investors in the Korean stock market.
Have you ever thought of suing Samsung Electronics in America? asks Matthews, a bit too calmly. "They have issued securities in America. You could bring a class-action suit for 50 years of mismanagement." Actually, Jang has.
 
On to Thailand!
Bangkok's Sukhotai Hotel is where the American investment bankers stay. Although it is meant to capture the spirit of ancient Thai culture, it resembles the small, fashionable hotels that have been popping up in New York and Los Angeles since the early 1990's. As slender young Thai men in black jackets glide silently along the hardwood floors, plumpish white men in white shirts make themselves overheard: I met with the guy from Merrill. Goldman was here not long ago. That sort of thing.
What's really odd is that the victims of crisis are happier than their would-be conquerors. They look happier, at least. But perhaps that is just the irrepressible Thai character on display. According to the local financial people who serve as our guides, Thais have a professional obligation to seem happy.
You'd see these pictures in the newspaper after a riot, says one brokerage analyst, recalling the weeks after the baht collapsed, and all of the Thais who rioted had these huge grins on their faces. Strangely, there have been none of the bitter recriminations seen in South Korea. No one has gone directly to jail; no one is hated with conviction. The murder rate has soared, however, with a particular rise in domestic violence. When a Korean loses his job he kills himself. When a Thai loses his job he kills his wife.
Matthews has gone home and left Headley in charge of putting their dollars to work. Before he went into the investment business in 1989, Headley was a nationally ranked fencer, and narrowly missed competing for the United States in the Olympics. Fencing is one of those activities, like numismatics or Greek poetry or, for that matter, investing in Asia, that strikes you as odd for Americans to take up. But at this point, Headley's Thai strategy has a straightforward American flavor to it.
There are two kinds of Thai companies, he says. Ones that will survive and ones that won't. The trick is to own the survivors. His theory is that when money comes flowing back to the region, as surely it must, it will flow first to Thailand and Korea, since Thailand and Korea are furthest along in resolving their problems. The market -- meaning Western money managers -- is thinking that Thailand is in the pits for the next three years. All it takes is for the market to think it's in the pits for only the next two years and the result will be explosive.
In Headley's mind, Thailand has the same talent for chaos as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. There is not in Thailand, as there is in Korea, an elaborate corporate machine designed to chew up investment capital. There are merely a lot of dubious (though happy) Thai characters looking to steal your money. On a visit last September, in the middle of the meltdown, Headley and Matthews checked up on a company that made small diesel engines used by rice farmers. They had just made a tiny investment and were thinking about increasing their stake. They expected to be greeted by the very picture of anxiety. Instead, a couple of young Thais in mirrored sunglasses giggled through the meeting. "When they're wearing sunglasses indoors and they think that the crash is a joke, it's a bad sign," says Headley.
The small company, called Thai Engine Manufacturing, is a few miles from the heart of Bangkok. A year ago the drive would have taken us perhaps an hour. But the traffic has vanished -- it seems as if half the country has sold its cars -- and we arrive early, after maybe 10 minutes. The men with the mirrored sunglasses are gone. In their place are a pair of respectable-looking characters, eager to help.
They show us a video of their new television advertisement, in which a Thai superhero, Engine Man, uses a diesel engine to pull a barn down on top of a Thai villain's head, before lopping it off. They then walk Headley through a meticulous set of financial statements. The crash has been very good for Thai rice farmers, they say, who are now exporting at lower prices.
Headley asks if any foreign investors have been through. The happy Thai man laughs and says the magic word: "Soros."
The New York fund manager George Soros is one of the few investors pouring money into the region. He paid $15 million for a share in a Thai steel mill, for instance. If Soros took an interest in Thai Engine he could double the share price overnight. "The man from Soros made a list of 10 top Thai companies for investment," says the man. "And we are No. 1." "Did he ask for a seat on the board?" asks Headley. "He did!"says the man, surprised that Headley had guessed. "And we say we would give it to them. It's good to have a Westerner on the board."
"The company could double in three months," says Headley, as we leave. "When you step back and look at what Thailand should be doing -- as opposed to what it got into because it had all this money thrown at it -- rice makes sense." A few hours later, he checks in with the market. Thai Engine is up 20 percent.
 
Get Them!
A year ago we would have been on our way to Malaysia or Indonesia, but the crash has caused the Matthews Fund to flee Islam. On Headley's last visit to Malaysia the police raided his brokers' offices and confiscated tapes recording private conversations about money. The headline in the newspaper the next day was: get them. them referred to foreign financiers. Headley gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal in which he accused Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Big Brother tactics, then dashed for the flight home. A few days later, safely back in San Francisco, he received a call from the Journal reporter telling him that his quotes were picked up by the Malaysian press, controlled by the Malaysian Government. Be careful before you come back here again, the reporter said. Some people are upset.
After that, Headley sold most of what he owned in Malaysia, and also in Indonesia. Indonesia had made Malaysia seem calm -- though there the preference for scapegoats ran to students and Chinese shopkeepers. Last fall I went to China and said, 'There is no problem here.' Then I came to Thailand and said, 'Well, it's bad but they'll dig their way out of it.' Then I went to Indonesia and said, 'Jesus Christ, it's a social catastrophe in the making.' "
And so we are flying to Manila.
 
The Imelda Marcos Fund
Tonight Imelda Marcos, who is running -- unsuccessfully, as it would turn out -- for President, put a fine point on the problem of investing here. During a televised debate with other presidential candidates she looked meaningfully into the camera and said: We don't need the I.M.F. We can have my I.M.F. Half the country was on the edge of its seats. What was she talking about? "The Imelda Marcos Fund," says Imelda.
"Those people," says Headley, referring to the Marcoses, "raped these poor people," motioning to the peasants on the squalid streets. Thanks in large part to the Marcoses' misgovernment the wave of dollars that crashed down upon the rest of Asia missed the Philippines. The nation somehow got itself classified as a Latin American country during the Asian boom, and as an Asian country during the current Latin American boom. They never had an economic miracle, says Headley, so there's no economic miracle to lose.
Headley visits a couple of banks, a distressed credit-card company and a large family-owned conglomerate. Compared with Thailand and Korea, however, the country is boring. The family conglomerate is actually profitable. It is run by a couple of guys hired by the family from the Harvard Business School.
 
How Investors Become Activists
Each night Headley receives a fax from the San Francisco office that tells him how many dollars have entered or exited the Matthews Fund. Tonight the portfolio is up 2 percent and investors have dumped in another $230,000. Attached to the fax is an unexpected letter, addressed to the chairman of Samsung Fire and Marine, and signed by six American investors. Dear Mr. Lee, it begins, We the undersigned represent 454,609 common shares of Samsung Fire and Marine. It goes on to insist that: a) the company appoint outside directors to represent them; and b) that the company under no circumstance siphon off funds to the ailing Samsung Motors company. The signatories together wield billions of dollars in capital.
Paul Matthews has also signed the letter. It is the first political act in his investment career.
A couple of weeks ago I paid a call on Headley and Matthews in their San Francisco offices. The Indonesian army was at that moment on the streets of Jakarta. Asia had resumed its collapse. This is it, says Headley. In the worst case it takes 24 months and requires bloodshed." To them, the Indonesian revolt, like the Asian collapse, appears promising in the long run but costly in the short run. It just adds to the pall of gloom hanging over Asia, says Matthews. And contributes to the idea that no sane person could put his money there. The putatively global economy was meant to guard against wild imbalances, but the imbalances in the world today are large and emphatic. One industrial region is in the midst of its greatest stock-market boom in history, with companies run by teen-agers trading at 200 times earnings. Another great industrialized region is in the midst of the greatest stock-market collapse in its history, with companies that have $20 billion in sales trading at two times earnings.
The Asian markets are now plummeting again. The Matthews group, with investments throughout Asia, is now down nearly 10 percent. The Matthews fund that invests exclusively in Korea has fallen 13 percent. Since their return, Headley and Matthews have bought a chunk of Thai Engine and a piece of the Philippine conglomerate. They have sold a Singapore bank with business in Indonesia and are thinking about selling anything having to do with Chairman Kim.
There was a time when these were mere investment decisions. No longer. They are cultural signals that encourage one type of behavior and discourage another. Echoed 1,000 times, as these investment decisions most certainly will be by other capitalists, they may transform societies. The crash was thus an intellectual event as much as an economic one. It put an end to the belief that Asian economies could be run along different lines than others. Markets force the convergence of all things, of prices and of values. Before July 2, 1997, the Asian economies masked that. They suggested the possibility of another way of doing things. No longer.
Interestingly, Matthews already has had a response to his joint letter of protest to Samsung Fire and Marine. The company has acceded to one of his demands and appointed an outside director. More than anything, what impressed Matthews is that the boss of a Korean company bothered to respond in the first place. A year ago, he says, I don't think we would have heard a word.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 28, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 31 about the financial crisis in Asia misstated an amount of Korean bonds offered for sale worldwide in April. The amount was $4 billion, not $3 billion. The article also omitted the name of the company that managed the offering with Goldman, Sachs. It was Salomon Smith Barney.
