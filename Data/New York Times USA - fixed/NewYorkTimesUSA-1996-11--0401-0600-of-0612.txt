HEADLINE: Cutting Federal Deficit to Zero Is a Good Idea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your opposition to a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution is well founded (editorial, Nov. 14), but your declaration that "there is no compelling reason" to shrink the deficit to zero -- that is, to balance the budget -- misses an important point and appears to rest on a dubious premise. 
 The case for spending no more than the sum of incoming revenues (except in a recession) is clear: by ending annual deficits, the Government would stop adding to its outstanding debt and to the interest it must pay each year. With the debt stabilized, or even reduced gradually, a larger share of future revenues would be available for more useful spending.
You worry that eliminating the deficit will lead to the cutting of "expensive items first," the "public investments on which the future health of the economy depends," while nickel-and-dime appropriations to please scattered special interests -- "pork," in the vernacular -- will survive. The line-item veto just signed into law is supposed to enable the President to winnow out the pork. Its effectiveness will depend on the President.
As for your assumption that Congress would eliminate those public investments that contribute most to economic vitality, I know of no basis for it. The debate of 1995-96 shows that both parties believe that what most needs paring is spending for entitlements, especially benefits that go to those above the poverty line, whether for health care or old-age income. Of course, there are differences of degree and detail, but this is where the biggest savings are needed and will occur, if the President and the Congressional leadership decide to forge a compromise.
Medicare and Social Security are not "investments" that are determinative of the country's economic health.

HEADLINE: U.S. Publications Focusing on Africa Fade

BYLINE: By GREGORY JORDAN 

 BODY:
Crises in Africa, like the current troubles in Zaire and Rwanda, are one of the few guaranteed ways the continent draws media attention, as representatives of relief agencies, governments and sometimes international military forces descend and try to cope with the situation.
For in-depth coverage, people interested in African developments have mostly been dependent on smaller, African-focused publications that routinely analyzed more positive issues like the growing trade between the United States and the Southern African Development Community, the rise of Uganda's economy or the rehabilitation of Mali's democracy. 
 Today, however, the three definitive American sources for African news and analysis in print -- Africa Report, Africa News Service and Africa Notes -- are defunct, or about to be. While Africa News Service has been reincarnated on the Internet's World Wide Web and detailed coverage of Africa continues in publications like Foreign Affairs, the specialty press in this area has all but disappeared.
In contrast, other former cold war hot spots like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe are spawning numerous American magazines and newsletters focused on their churning economies and shifting politics.
African-focused publications have always existed on the financial fringe. When it closed in 1995, Africa Report, the most financially solvent of the three that focused on Africa, had an annual budget of $240,000. Circulation, once as high as 15,000, had dropped to 5,700 by 1995. The $30 subscriptions did not bring in enough to make the venture worthwhile for the African-American Institute, which put out the magazine.
Africa Notes, a publication of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, has a circulation of about 1,000 -- including corporate executives, diplomats and scholars. The December issue will be its final publication.
Africa specialists like Helen Kitchen, who was the first editor of Africa Report in 1960 and founded Africa Notes in 1982, are baffled that the growing cultural and economic links between the United States and African countries are not supporting an African-focused cottage industry within the American news media.
"I have always believed in Africa as a cup that is half full and not half empty, and I have always believed that there is a wide American audience that wants detailed information on African events," Ms. Kitchen said. "There is massive potential in Africa, economic and otherwise. And there has been growing reportage in Britain and France in recent months. But American coverage just keeps dwindling."
The simple explanation for their demise is that these publications -- which, along with their sponsors, have failed to develop strict financial management skills -- simply lack a readership substantial enough to sustain them.
Still, Africa Notes and its kin serve a relatively small but highly influential cadre of policy makers, investors and corporations, nongovernment organizations and African immigrants -- all of whom are alarmed by the gap left by the publications' demise.
The last editor of Africa Report, Margaret Novicki, emphasized that the magazine was never out to make a profit. "We had a financial backer," she said, referring to the African-American Institute. "When that backer ran into financial problems, so did we."
Ms. Novicki also said: "There is definitely an audience out there of both influential people and your average reader who just wants to learn more about Africa. The problem is that advertisers don't see specialized magazines as a good market for their advertising dollars."
Steve McDonald, the executive vice president of the African-American Institute in New York, recognized the breadth of the powerful and committed readers that Africa Report served.
But Mr. McDonald pointed to the success of British and French magazines that are focused solely on African economics, trade and investment.
"They're specifically targeted and they are doing quite well," he said. "We had economic reporting from time to time, but we were all basically focused on general analysis. That's where we fell afoul in being able to draw a larger readership."
The inability of African-focused publications to sustain themselves without outside help suggests to many that the notion of a broad American readership is illusory.
But Michael Clough, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, which publishes Foreign Affairs, argued that it is an absence of cooperation, not of readers, that is killing the publications.
"The problem with these magazines is the problem with African-oriented institutions in general -- the different groups are unable to come together and say, 'We need one magazine and let's rally behind it instead of everyone trying to do their own thing,' " Mr. Clough said. "Africa Report in its early years served that role because at that point the Africanist community wasn't as fragmented as it is today."
Dave Miller was a reader of all three publications in his role as associate director at the Corporate Council on Africa, a group that advises 105 American companies engaged in trade and investment with African countries. He believes there is an audience eager for African news and analysis.
"The United States has a combined two-way trade with African countries that is greater than our trade with all of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union combined," Mr. Miller said. "Sure, the trade is resource heavy. But we have no magazines, trade or otherwise, that track this stuff for investors. That's just absurd. Someone will need to fill the void."
And Mike Kiernan, communications director for Interaction, an umbrella group of 150 American nongovernmental organizations, said that such regionally focused news providers were "very essential" to his community.
"The long-term solutions to crises like Zaire are being written and reported in these smaller publications," Mr. Kiernan said. "Without them, that dialogue disappears."
Trying to surmount disunity and indifference, Reed Kramer and Tami Hultman, a husband-wife team in Durham, N.C., who founded Africa News Service 33 years ago and closed the print version in 1993, have resurrected their publication on line (http://www.africanews.org).
As a regionally specific news provider, Africa News Service subcontracts to native African news organizations and reporters. The results of their efforts, Mr. Kramer said, are far more positive than anything Africa News Service experienced during its 30 years of print circulation: underwriters like Essence Magazine and Centura Money Managers advertise on the site, and hits to the home page, although at best a very rough indicator of readership, exceed 100,000 a week.
"From what we can tell from our statistics and research, one-fifth to one-fourth of our users are from the business world, another 25 percent are from overseas," Mr. Kramer said.
"This is more than just a web site," he added. "It's an electronic network. Africa News Service was not set up as a publisher but as a provider. We weren't as specialized as some people wanted us to be, but on line they can focus as they wish."

HEADLINE: Essay;
With an All-New Cast

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
O.K., so I won by eight points, and all those polls showing an 18-point spread right up through the final weekend were wrong. It's a lucky thing the Republicans never knew they were in single-digit range, and the media were misled by those polls into thinking it was no real horse race.
Now let's make a Cabinet. Has to be congenial, to be easy to confirm, good on television, loyal to me when the crunch comes. 
 Colin Powell would be right down the alley for Secretary of State, which I offered him once before, and he's now a Republican to boot. But Al Gore worries that making Powell the foreign policy superstar would build up a rival for the 2000 campaign. Same with Sam Nunn; can't set him up for a primary run.
George Mitchell? He was last week's sure thing, and I owe him for falling on his sword in the health-care fiasco. But Mitchell is the one authentic liberal who has a chance of getting Senate confirmation if I nominate him to the Supreme Court. Maybe save that card.
Richard Holbrooke, the Bosnia headknocker? Tony Lake would go through the White House basement roof, and even if I moved Tony from national security adviser to C.I.A., the two bureaucratic enemies would be leaking at each other.
My favorite, of course, is Strobe Talbott, and it would be nice to move the Deputy to the top job. Probably could have done that if Jesse Helms had not been re-elected, but Strobe knows he would never get past Senate Foreign Relations now. That's why he's writing articles for Time magazine already. I'll enjoy his book a lot more than Dick Morris's, which could be trouble.
I suppose I could go with Madeleine Albright, though she has that hawkish streak. Really need to pay off the single women. (Married women split evenly, and I got over two out of three of the unmarrieds.) Madeleine would be good if Janet Reno gets my heave-ho hint and heads back to Florida so Hillary can move Jamie Gorelick up to Attorney General. We can trust Jamie to stop asking the courts for special prosecutors -- why did I ever sign that law in the first place? I'll veto any extension when it lapses, but that may be too late. Save Al a lot of trouble, though.
I could put Jamie across the river at C.I.A. First woman Director of Central Intelligence would take a little of the heat off our spooks. Poor John Deutch thought he'd ease the tension with the blacks on that drug-dealing nonsense by holding a town meeting, but they just didn't feel his pain.
I promised Secretary of Defense to Deutch if he'd fix up the C.I.A. for me, and now that bill has come due. But the trouble with John is that he's the smartest guy in the room and is driven to make sure everybody knows it. Bill Perry thinks I would need a Tom Pickering or some other diplomatic type to be Deutch's Deputy, to smooth ruffled feathers at the Joint Chiefs and to reassure the Secretary of State.
Appoint Bill Cohen at the Pentagon as my Republican? If I do, he'd be the only published poet and novelist in that job. But Cohen went up against Nixon during Watergate; I need loyalists. (Reminds me -- got to find a Cabinet slot for Harold Ickes, Labor or Interior, before he kills me with the libs. He knows too much to let be sore.) And no wonder Mickey Kantor bailed out of Commerce -- that'll be the hot seat for investigation into what Bruce Lindsey did for John Huang.
Maybe Tommy Thompson, G.O.P. Governor of Wisconsin, to run welfare. Loved the way he stabbed Dole in the back. Or Jack Kemp, who's big on empowerment -- Al doesn't worry about him. But they tell me Jack rolls his eyes a lot at Cabinet meetings and argues with Treasury.
Can't replace Bob Rubin at Treasury. He's got to keep Alan Greenspan at the Fed to keep me out of a recession for at least another couple of years, past the '98 elections. Then Bob can run for Governor of New York while Charlie Schumer runs against Al D'Amato, and I'll bring Laura Tyson back from California to run Treasury. I all but caved on the Republicans' balanced budget amendment -- what would it cost me? -- until Rubin jerked me back. He's the only one I'll let make me look foolish in public.
What I'd really like in my new Cabinet is a fresh face with universal appeal. Maybe a single Asian-American Republican moderate woman.

HEADLINE: Japan Aims to Regain Semiconductor Leadership

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Japan's Government and semiconductor manufacturers are starting a series of consortiums and cooperative research programs on a scale not seen since the project two decades ago that catapulted this nation into the front ranks of the world's computer chip producers.
The companies and the Government will spend between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years to develop advanced technology and to improve the competitiveness of the Japanese industry, which has been hurt as South Korean companies have encroached on their markets and the American industry has revived. 
 The new programs "are a conscious attempt to wrest technological leadership in manufacturing away from foreigners," said Kenneth Flamm, a Brookings Institution economist and author of a recent book about international semiconductor competition. He estimates spending on the new programs will reach about $190 million a year.
Some experts say the effort could signal a renaissance in Government-industry collaboration in Japan.
While Japan has long been known for that approach to industrial development, the practice had faded somewhat in the high technology industry, as Japan's electronics companies became big enough to do research by themselves and had caught up to Western competitors.
But now Japan once again sees itself playing catch-up in areas like software and telecommunications at a time when corporate research budgets are crimped by an economic slump. So the Government has stepped in, increasing its spending on research and development.
"There is a more widespread feeling among Japanese industry that the Government has to do something," said John P. Stern, senior vice president of the Asian Technology Information Program, a nonprofit technology monitoring organization based in Tokyo that published a report by Dr. Flamm on the new Japanese chip programs.
Another factor clearing the way for a revival of such projects is that trade tensions have diminished as the share of Japan's semiconductor market held by American and other foreign manufacturers has tripled in the last decade to about 30 percent. Last summer, a semiconductor trade agreement between the United States and Japan expired and was replaced by a far weaker accord.
A few years ago, when trade tensions were higher, "We were not so confident of acceptance by our U.S. counterparts," said Hajime Sasaki, the executive vice president in charge of semiconductors for the NEC Corporation.
American companies are not complaining now about Japan's "industrial targeting" as they did in the past. However, there is still some concern about a renewed competitive threat from Japan.
William J. Spencer, the president of Sematech, an American semiconductor industry consortium, said the Japanese companies rejected a call to participate in a project involving American, European, Korean and Taiwanese companies and opted to start their own, in an apparent effort to gain a competitive edge. "Every major semiconductor company in the world except the Japanese is in our program," he said.
Japanese executives contend that the United States has little ground for complaint since it undertook a joint industry-Government effort in the form of Sematech, the consortium based in Austin, Tex. that started in 1987 and had a budget that was bigger than the Japanese programs combined. Until last month, when its Federal financing ended, Sematech spent about $200 million a year, half from the Defense Department and half from its member companies.
Indeed, Japanese officials said they were prompted to start their programs in part by the success of Sematech in revitalizing American chip manufacturing, just as Sematech had been partly a response to the VLSI Project, an earlier Japanese program in the 1970's. VLSI stands for very large-scale integration, a reference to putting thousands of microelectronic circuit elements on a chip.
Japanese officials point out that collaborations are increasingly common in the semiconductor industry, because the cost of advancing the technology has become too high for any single company to shoulder by itself. They also note that some of the Japanese projects have foreign participants, while Sematech was restricted to American companies.
"Industrial policy may come back, but it's not the same as the targeting policy 20 years ago," said Toru Nakayama, deputy director of the industrial electronics division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI.
The VLSI Project, in which the ministry backed cooperative research by Japan's major electronics companies, was arguably the most successful of Japan's industrial development projects. By the middle 1980's, Japanese companies had virtually taken over the world market for dynamic random-access memory chips, the main type of computer memory chip, forcing all but a couple of American companies to drop out.
But now South Korean companies are challenging Japan's leadership in D-RAM's. Meanwhile, the Japanese companies have not been able to make much of an inroad into advanced chips, like microprocessors, that are the province of American companies. And, owing in part to Sematech, the American manufacturers of chip-making machinery have improved in competitiveness.
The Japanese collaborations started in 1994 when Japan's 10 largest semiconductor manufacturers formed the Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan, a research center that planned the programs that are starting now. One new effort is the Association of Super-Advanced Electronics Technologies, or ASET. This consists of 10 separate research programs aimed at developing technology to make future generations of computer chips, as well as disk drives and liquid crystal screens.
The five-year project, which began in March, is being financed by MITI, with total spending perhaps reaching $300 million over five years. It received 10 billion yen, or nearly $100 million, in last year's budget but only 1.3 billion yen, or $13 million, this year. Three American companies -- Texas Instruments, I.B.M. and Merck -- are participating in some of the research projects.
Another new consortium is Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies Inc., or Selete, which is budgeted at $350 million over five years and is financed completely by the 10 member companies.
It aims at evaluating equipment for manufacturing semiconductor chips using silicon wafers 300 millimeters, or 12 inches, in diameter. Selete is now nearing completion of a $50 million clean room, a manufacturing site, at a Hitachi laboratory in Yokohama.
Right now chips are generally made on 8-inch wafers. Using 12-inch wafers would allow more chips to be made on each wafer, lowering manufacturing costs per chip. The shift to the new technology, expected by the year 2000, will represent a big chance for companies to gain or lose market share.
Sematech set up a similar cooperative program, in which 12 companies from the United States, Korea, Europe and Taiwan are participating. But the budget for this effort is only $26 million over 18 months.
Another new Japanese project, the Super Silicon Crystal Research Institute, aims to develop 400-millimeter, or 16-inch, wafers, which will not come into use for 10 years or more. The project is budgeted at 13.4 billion yen, or about $130 million, over five years, with half being paid by the Government and half by its member companies, which are seven Japanese makes of silicon wafers.
The Japanese industry has also begun a small program to finance semiconductor research at universities, similar to one started many years ago by the Semiconductor Industry Association in the United States.
The semiconductor research institute is also considering starting a program to develop software for chip design, an area in which Japanese industry is dependent on small American companies.
Japan's Government-industry collaborations are not always effective. The Fifth Generation Computer program, which aimed to develop machines with artificial intelligence, is widely viewed as a colossal failure.
A recent book about the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's programs by Scott Callon, chief strategist for BT Asia Securities in Tokyo, describes how the ministry often had to twist the arms of the companies to get them to participate.
Companies rarely donate their best researchers to such consortiums and do not cooperate as well as it appears, Mr. Callon writes in "Divided Sun: MITI and the Breakdown of Japanese High-Tech Industrial Policy, 1975-1993" (Stanford University Press, 1995).
Japanese executives acknowledge that such problems do occur. But they say that the current programs were begun by industry itself.
"This time they are very cooperative," said Hiroyoshi Komiya, a former chief semiconductor engineer at Mitsubishi Electric Company who now is the executive vice president of Selete. "The industrial situation is completely different from in the past. We need so much money to develop new technology."

HEADLINE: As the Shoreham Well Runs Dry, a School District Struggles With the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: WADING RIVER, L.I., Nov. 12

 BODY:
It seemed too good to be true. For two decades, the small but growing school district here reaped a tax bonanza from a large property, enabling educators to finance their dream programs.
At times, that single property paid 90 percent of the Shoreham-Wading River School District's annual budgets. And what budgets they were. 
 Kindergartners got individual violin lessons. Budding biologists sailed the Hudson River. Each child had a personal adviser. A dish antenna delivered educational television via satellite. Spanish classes traveled to Madrid. Tennis courts were lighted for night players. Star teachers were recruited from other states. Class size shrank to as few as 15 pupils. Students produced shows in their own television studio. The library boasted 60,000 books, Colonial-era newspapers and 25 computer terminals. A demonstration farm had goats, pigs and a garden.
The results have been extraordinary. The schools have had virtually no dropouts, crime, vandalism or graffiti, and 93 percent of the graduates go to college. Despite an enrollment of only 2,166, the district racks up countless trophies and awards in competitions ranging from art to math to English to sports. It has National Merit Scholarship semifinalists every year and had a first-place Westinghouse science scholar.
"We've had hundreds of visitors come to see the programs," said a former school board president, Albert G. Prodell. Parents were thrilled, and families moved here for the schools. Homeowners profited from low taxes, and houses fetched premium prices compared with those in neighboring districts.
But there was a big catch.
The property that made it all possible was the Long Island Lighting Company's nuclear power plant at Shoreham, a troubled project that has been a political and economic quagmire for Long Island.
Now a State Supreme Court decision has transformed the school district's golden goose into an albatross. On Nov. 7, Justice Thomas Stark ruled that Lilco had been overassessed for taxes on the power plant, which was abandoned because of environmental opposition before it ever went into operation.
That ruling threatens to bankrupt the schools. Lilco contends it is owed $1.15 billion in refunds and interest from local governments. That includes a staggering $472 million from the school district, or an average of $85,000 for each of its households.
"Paying back $400 million is impossible," said the school board's president, Patricia A. Fearon. Desperate to avoid the bill, the district is appealing the ruling.
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, has been talking to Gov. George E. Pataki to find a way to ease the refunds, which Lilco is demanding from Brookhaven town and the county as well. The officials hope to solve the problem as part of a broader state plan to take over Lilco because of its high electric rates -- partly caused by Shoreham's construction debt and high property taxes. But the chances of such a complex deal are uncertain.
"People are starting to ask about it, and I tell them I don't know what's going to happen," said Kenneth P. Kaufman, a real estate broker. "Shoreham-Wading River schools have always been top-notch, but the proverbial free ride is over." Residents face a double whammy of rising taxes and dampened home values, he said.
The power plant started creating problems for the district in 1992, when the state's Long Island Power Authority took over the plant and began reducing its payments to the schools.
The school budget, which peaked at $38.8 million that year, is now down to $30.1 million, even though enrollment and costs have grown. Power plant payments still account for $17.6 million, but that subsidy is shrinking by about $3 million a year. Spending per pupil has dropped to $13,900 from $19,000. Taxes, though still a bargain, have risen.
The number of teachers has fallen to 190 from 230, and 100 other jobs have been cut. Average class size has grown to 24. Teachers who once advised 8 or 9 students are now assigned 12 or 13.
"A lot of the individualized program has been lost," said Cornelius J. Mahoney, the president of the teachers union. "The district has changed dramatically, and the staff is doing their best to maintain quality education."
Astronomy, horticulture and home economics courses have been dropped, and business, science and photography classes have been trimmed. The farm was given up.
On Tuesday, high school students dismantling stage sets for their "Inherit the Wind" production were saving not only the lumber but also the screws. Some lamented that in the good old days, they received minimum wage for work they now do for nothing.
But there is little sympathy from other Long Islanders, who bear some of the nation's highest local taxes. They have envied the Shoreham-Wading River district's good fortune and reviled it for extravagance.
"I know there is resentment," Mr. Prodell said.
Lou Lewis, a lawyer for the district, said, "People seem to think we have swimming pools, carpeted hallways and golf courses, and that's all untrue."
The district is mostly middle class, mostly white, and the homes range from a trailer park to expensive homes on the bluff overlooking Long Island Sound. District officials say that a number of teachers from other districts moved here so their children could take advantage of the school programs.
Unapologetic, school officials say they were trapped by circumstances. "This was a situation not of our making," said Mrs. Fearon, who added that the district did not build the power plant or set the assessment; Lilco and Brookhaven did. "What were we supposed to do, say we don't want the money?"
Providing conventional education would have saved money, resulting in even lower residential taxes and higher home prices. But Mr. Prodell said he was proud that the board opted for first-class schools, "giving our kids a chance to succeed."
When a 1992 court ruling on the power plant signaled tax refund problems, should the district have started building reserves? School officials say that state law sharply limits the annual amount of such contingency funds.
In addition to challenging the latest ruling, school officials are fighting in court to overturn a special law, passed in the 1980's, that made the district liable for tax refunds. In Suffolk's other districts, the towns pay for refunds.
"I just felt it would be extremely unfair, after all the largess Shoreham-Wading River received, that a payback would come out of the people of 21 other school districts in Brookhaven," said George J. Hochbrueckner, who sponsored the law as an Assemblyman. "We thought this would come home to roost, which it did. I don't fault the district for what they did. They did what they thought was right at the time, and they probably didn't have a choice."
The school district won one ruling against the law but lost on appeal and is seeking a decision from a higher court.
Whatever the outcome of all the legal and political maneuvering, school officials say that student successes justify the district's investments.
Just last year, Daniel Durand was on the "Today" show with his winning entry in a national Duracel science contest. Five of the fall sports teams were league champions, and Masami Stampf was chosen by the National Orchestra, a student ensemble.
"Last season, there were two network television programs, one with Karen Sillas -- class of '81 -- playing the lead, and another series starring D. B. Sweeney -- class of '79," said their old high school drama teacher, Jeffrey L. Bennett. "Not bad for a small school."
Although many public schools have extracurricular theater programs, Shoreham-Wading River is among the few to offer courses in drama. Mr. Bennett said he knows of only two others in the state.
"Many consider it a frill and a luxury, but it has a noble tradition here," he said. But whether that tradition will continue is unclear. Mr. Bennett is retiring this year. He said he did not know if he would be replaced.

HEADLINE: OPPOSITION LOOMS FOR WELFARE BILL OFFERED BY PATAKI

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Now that Gov. George E. Pataki has released his long-awaited plan to reconstruct the state's $4 billion welfare system, the debate has shifted to the Legislature, where many Democrats are already vowing to block major portions of his initiative.
The 300-page bill the Governor unveiled last week called for cutting benefits to families by 45 percent over four years and ending them entirely after five, and replacing cash grants to able-bodied childless adults with vouchers for food, clothing and shelter. If enacted, the plan would represent the most thorough revision of state welfare policies in six decades and significantly change the lives of 1.4 million recipients. 
 But interviews with a broad sampling of Assembly Democrats in recent days show that many of them strongly question, if not outright reject, several important provisions in the Pataki plan, particularly those that would cut benefits for families.
Since the Democrats control the Assembly by a comfortable 95-54 margin, they have virtual veto power over most of the Governor's welfare agenda -- a muscle they flexed in 1995 and again earlier this year in rejecting similar welfare proposals.
Still, the Democrats are far from united in their opposition to the Governor's plan, and some conservatives are likely to cross party lines to endorse parts of it. Many of those conservative Democrats agree with the Governor that the new Federal welfare law requires the state to revamp its policies to push more people off the welfare rolls.
As a result, the Democrats are bracing for a heated battle first among themselves and then with the Governor over welfare revisions when they take the issue up, probably in January. Emboldened by their party's strong showing in this month's elections, liberals and some moderates say they plan to mount a strenuous campaign against Mr. Pataki's plan so as to wrest control of the debate from the Republicans.
"I think it's important that the Assembly's approach be clearly articulated and that the Governor's rhetoric not go unchallenged," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat. "It's important that opponents be out early saying that this not the way to get welfare recipients off welfare. It is simply reckless and punitive cutting."
Democrats are not the only ones raising concerns about the Governor's ideas. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has echoed Democrats' worries about the benefit cut for families, though he praised many other parts of Mr. Pataki's plan.
In New Jersey, the debate over Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's welfare plan is expected to be much less contentious, partly because Democrats helped write her plan and partly because both houses of the Legislature are controlled by Governor Whitman's fellow Republicans. Connecticut is not expected to have a major battle over welfare because the Legislature enacted a comprehensive plan last year.
In a signal of just how hard fought next year's welfare debate in New York is likely to be, some liberals, who represent one of the largest voting blocs in the Assembly, plan to oppose setting a five-year limit on cash benefits to families. The new Federal welfare law prohibits states from using Federal funds to pay benefits to families that have been on welfare longer than 60 months, meaning that should the state decide to extend that limit, it might have to pick up all of the tab for people in the program longer than that. The Federal law does not restrict how states use their own money.
Many Democrats say they would support a plan that would extend cash benefits beyond five years if it could be shown that there were not enough entry-level jobs for welfare recipients, based on a formula using unemployment and job-creation rates. Such a plan would almost certainly cost the state extra money.
"The Governor's plan is predicated on the notion that if you don't work, you shouldn't get welfare benefits, even if you are a single parent with small children," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat. "Are we in a position to guarantee that everybody can get a job? The answer is no."
The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who will play a pivotal role in the welfare negotiations, has already endorsed the idea of extending time limits for people who cannot find jobs. Mr. Silver has been traveling in China and was unavailable for comment on Mr. Pataki's new plan. But his aides said he was uncomfortable with several parts of the Governor's bill, particularly benefit cuts for families.
Conservative Democrats, however, said they would object to any plan that required using large amounts of state money to extend the five-year limit. "That's not realistic," said Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano of Staten Island. "The state doesn't have the money to do that."
Welfare advocates also think they have found a loophole in the Federal law that would allow the state to circumvent the five-year limit. Contending that the Federal time limit applies only to parents, not their children, the advocates argue that the state could use its own funds to pay parents' benefits beyond five years and Federal money to assist children.
Asked about the legality of this proposal, Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said, "I don't know, to be honest."
But independent welfare experts said they doubted the maneuver would work, saying the clear intention of the Federal law is to establish a five-year limit on entire families. And any such proposal would face stiff opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate and Mr. Pataki, who believes time limits are the best way to end welfare dependency.
When he released his bill last week, Mr. Pataki said his plan would provide a humane and effective way to prod entrenched welfare recipients to find jobs. The plan would cut benefits to families by 10 percent after 18 months, with the benefits shrinking gradually to 45 percent after 4 years and ending completely after 5. But Mr. Pataki would also allow parents to keep their welfare benefits even if they earn as much as $1,080 a month from work; now, benefits are reduced for those who earn more than $667 a month.
While Mayor Giuliani has generally endorsed the thrust of the Governor's proposals, yesterday he reiterated his concerns about the long-term effect of the plan.
"I have concerns about the third, fourth and fifth years," he said. "The cuts are very, very steep."
The Governor's bill would abolish the state's Home Relief program, which provides cash grants to about 230,000 mainly able-bodied childless adults, and replace it with a system that provides vouchers for food, shelter and clothing.
Mr. Pataki's plan would also impose a host of restrictions and rules on recipients. Parents would lose a portion of their benefits if their children, up to age 19, were absent without excuse from school three times in an academic quarter. Teen-age recipients would be required to attend high school and live with their parents. All recipients would have to undergo drug testing.
Felons who violated parole or probation would lose cash benefits. And the plan would end the state's policy of increasing cash benefits to families who have additional children while on welfare.
The cuts come after the state has already tried to curtail welfare spending; yesterday, the Governor said the state had reduced welfare rolls by 25,000 by taking fingerprint images from recipients to reduce fraud.
In a survey of nearly a dozen Democratic Assembly members from different parts of the state, almost all said they would oppose benefit cuts. Most said they disliked punishing families with truant children, saying the policy would allow unruly teenagers to hurt their siblings. And most said they would oppose a cap on family benefits.
But opinions were more divided on other aspects of the Governor's plan. Several Democrats said that the proposal to test welfare recipients for drugs should be strongly considered, though they stopped short of endorsing it. And several said they liked the idea of using vouchers instead of cash to assist certain welfare recipients, provided there was enough money available to meet those needs.
In a year when Democrats picked up a seat in the Assembly, most Democrats said they felt on stronger ground than ever in opposing major elements of the Governor's plan. Still, Democrats from the suburbs and upstate said they believed that voters wanted changes made to welfare, though nothing as sweeping as Mr. Pataki has proposed.
"I'm not sure I won't end up supporting some of what he's putting forward," said Assemblyman Steven Englebright, a Suffolk County Democrat. "Thematically, these ideas lean in the right direction. The devil is in the details."

HEADLINE: Quality of Life Is Up for Many Blacks, Data Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
Four years ago, officials here in Marion County decided to make an all-out effort to curb the stubbornly high level of births among unmarried women, a problem that affected a cross-section of the county, but was particularly acute for blacks.
The health department, public and private social service agencies, the schools, even the local prosecutor's office, all joined in to help. Last year the effort seemed to pay off: 358 fewer babies were born to unmarried black women than in 1992, a drop of more than 12 percent, within a 4 percent overall decrease in Marion County. 
The county's success in confronting what was a seemingly intractable problem among its black population is a small victory but not an isolated one. Without much fanfare, a remarkable and little understood change is occurring among the nation's 33.5 million African-Americans. After a decade of rising drug use, growing violence, disintegrating families and declining measures of health among some segments of the black population, things are starting to turn around in many ways.
While there is much debate on whether the gains are temporary, and although wide gulfs in opportunity, incomes and education still exist between blacks and whites, signs of improvement abound:
*The black teen-age birth rate fell by 9 percent in 1995 and has dropped by 17 percent since 1991. Last year, the percentage of black babies born out of wedlock fell to 69.5 percent, from 70.4 percent, the first such drop since 1969.
*For the first time since the Census Bureau began keeping track in 1959, the poverty rate fell below 30 percent of all blacks in 1995. Median income for black households rose by 3.6 percent, far faster than the 2.2 percent increase for white households. (Census data show that many of the strongest gains in earnings are at the bottom, rather than at the top, of the black income scale.)
*Blacks are the only group whose inflation-adjusted median income exceeds what it was in 1989. That year, households headed by black married couples earned 79 percent as much as their white counterparts. By 1995, the gap was 87 percent.
*The rate at which black people were victims of murder dropped an estimated 17 percent last year, and the average life expectancy for black men rose to 65.4 years, the highest since 1984, when crack cocaine and accessibility of weapons like assault rifles began to engulf many black communities.
*The proportion of young black adults, age 25 to 29, who have completed high school has reached that of young white adults.
*Verbal scores on national standardized tests have risen faster for black students than for white students, but African-Americans still score much lower than whites.
"I think that this is a short period of really very substantial and significant gains," said Milton Morris, vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington group that tracks trends among African-Americans. "In the heat of the political debates and atmosphere of the last year or so, very few people have been paying serious attention. And yet when you do, you see that by virtually every measure of well-being, African-Americans have been on a significant uptrend during the 90's."
There remain large gaps between African-Americans and whites in educational attainment, infant mortality, income and poverty rates. And sociologists, economists, demographers and civil rights advocates caution that the improvements should not mask problems with crime, welfare dependency, discrimination and unemployment that still confront the black population in this country.
"I don't know that I can agree with how robust those indicators are in terms of significant gains," said Evelyn Moore, the executive director of the National Black Child Development Institute, a nonprofit advocacy organization in Washington. "I think there are still very serious challenges facing our children."
Some scholars also worry that the recent gains may be reversed if the economy falters or, in the short term, by the new welfare law.
"I think there's reason to be concerned about the impact of the welfare bill on a number of these trends, on the poverty rate, on the employment rate," said William Julius Wilson, a professor of social policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "When the welfare mothers reach their time limit, they will flood a pool that is already filled with a lot of jobless workers."
Still, in public hospital waiting rooms, in medical clinics and in the offices of social welfare programs around the country, workers point to glimmers of improvement even with poverty and hopelessness.
Jarvis Emerson, the director of the school-based program for the Watts Health Foundation, a nonprofit group in the South-Central section of Los Angeles, said he was beginning to notice gains in the struggle to reduce the soaring rates of out-of-wedlock births in the neighborhood.
"I do think it is a slight decrease or leveling off of births to teen-agers," he said. "With all the programs out there all putting out the same message, there is more of a heightened awareness among the young people of becoming pregnant."
Diane Sawyer, who works in the G.E.D. program at Jefferson State Junior College in Birmingham, said more black students were taking the test each year. Lisa Crumley, a supervisor with the Department of Human Resources in Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham, said fewer black people had applied to her office to receive welfare benefits in recent months. "I don't know if that means the quality of life has improved or what," Ms. Crumley said.
In Camden, N.J., there was a 21.2 percent drop in the number of births to mothers on welfare there from 1992 to 1994, according to Gary Young, a researcher at Cooper Hospital-University Medical Center in Camden, and Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at Rutgers University.
Scholars who study America's black population give much of the credit for the improvements to the country's overall economic prosperity, though they acknowledge that better economic times cannot explain the whole story. A number of economists and sociologists note that in 1995 the black unemployment rate tumbled under 10 percent for the first time in 20 years, though it has since inched up above that level.
But while a brighter labor market helps account for black gains in income and the drop in poverty rates for African-Americans, many experts cannot fully explain improvements in the out-of-wedlock birth rate or the teen-age pregnancy rate.
Some researchers in New Jersey credit the drop in the out-of-wedlock birth rate among the state's welfare families -- about 46 percent of whom are black -- to its 1992 law denying increased cash benefits to women who have more children. Other states, like Delaware and Indiana, which did not institute policies like New Jersey's until recently, have also reported such decreases.
"Something is going on," said Kristin Moore, the executive director of Child Trends, a Washington-based research group. "Whether it's cultural factors, or a thousand programs finally seeing some success, we don't know."
A growing sense of material well-being is even changing the makeup of the military. The Pentagon recently found that the number of blacks joining the armed forces has fallen by about half since 1990, a steeper decline than for any other group. Defense Department and civilian analysts are unsure of the reason, but one theory is a growing confidence among blacks in their ability to succeed in the labor market.
Some economists argue that the closing of the gap between blacks and whites is partly explained by surveys that often count most Americans of Hispanic heritage as whites. Recent increases in the number of Hispanic immigrants, many of them low income, thus hold down overall white performance.
Some economists also say the nearly 800,000 black adults in Federal and state prisons and local jails are not counted when looking at things like unemployment or high school completion rates. So the measures of black improvements seem higher than they actually are.
"Those people are gone from all these employment and earnings statistics," said Richard Freeman, a professor of economics at Harvard. "Those are huge numbers."
But there is disagreement over how much these two phenomena affect the overall picture, and some sociologists say whatever distortions that occur only show up when comparing achievement among blacks to that of whites, not when looking at black improvements by themselves.
"Some figures would be different if they were counted, but I don't think the overall trends would be affected," Professor Wilson said of the numbers of black men in prison.
Across the country, from Jersey City to Cleveland to Los Angeles, the signs of improvement are also beginning to be felt among the people.
"In my area, I see things getting better all the time," said Felicia Wearing, 25, who lives with her daughter in the Bergen Lafayette section of Jersey City. "It used to be like hell, groups always on the corner, cussing and fighting, ripping and raiding, shooting each other. It's calmed down a whole hell of a lot."
Chuck Wheeler, 39, a former drummer who bought an aging laundry in a black section of Cleveland, also senses a change. "People are not doing the same things they were doing before," Mr. Wheeler said. "People are waking up. They're realizing what they need to do is get their families and themselves together."
But not everyone is convinced that things are improving. "To tell you the truth, I really think things are going back," said Harold Truxon, a black community activist from Ellendale, Del. "I really see more problems than I ever have."
In his own way, Richard Edwards of Indianapolis is symbolic of the changes. A little more than a year ago he was selling and using drugs. He never spent any time in prison, but he had been arrested on narcotics charges and had been given probation. A high school dropout, he also spent very little time with the son he had fathered out of wedlock.
Today, at 26, he is living with his girlfriend and spending time with his son. Mr. Edwards said he had no intention of having more children until he was married and financially able to provide for them. He is studying for a G.E.D. and is working as a maintenance mechanic at a hospital.
"I've been here 10 and a half months," he said, smiling and clutching a practice test for his G.E.D. "I've never held a job that long."
In October 1992, health officials in Marion County, Ind., surveyed all women who gave birth there. Among the findings of the survey was that more than 90 percent of the unwed mothers said they had not intended to get pregnant. So officials saw an opportunity to make a dent in the illegitimacy rate with better education and family planning.
Now, all major hospitals in the county offer family-planning programs, as do clinics and classes run by the county health department and private agencies like Girls Inc. and Planned Parenthood.
Recently, a local middle school and a high school have begun giving boys and girls life-like computerized dolls that are programmed to cry at random. So they can learn that parenthood brings responsibilities that do not end, the students must cart around the dolls even on weekends or arrange for a baby-sitter.
But even as officials take note of progress, people like Virginia A. Caine, the director of the Marion County Health Department, worry about complacency.
"People's perception," Ms. Caine said, "is that we've solved the problems and we don't have to put as many resources into it. Let's focus our attention on something else. People have no idea the amount of effort it requires to get people to receive services and to change their lives."

HEADLINE: Profit Squeeze for Publishers Makes Tenure More Elusive

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Michael Parkhurst knew that his doctoral dissertation on the German sociologist and philosopher Theodor Adorno would not compete for sales with Oprah and Dennis Rodman.
Still, he was stunned that when the Cornell University Press said it was not interested in publishing his book, it cited its lack of marketability. 
 "I was not particularly surprised or hurt that they did not think my work would be a best seller," said Mr. Parkhurst, who is teaching at two universities in Oregon while trying to finish his dissertation. "But I was astonished that they explicitly cited sales as a criterion for considering manuscripts' worth."
Like Mr. Parkhurst, hundreds of young scholars around the country are facing this latest obstacle in a glutted academic job market.
To get tenure in the humanities and social sciences, it is all but mandatory at some universities, especially the most prestigious ones, to get an academic book published, usually by one of the 100 university presses that are members of the Association of American University Presses. But, as financially strained libraries are slashing budgets for books, university presses are cutting back on publishing specialized monographs, like doctoral dissertations.
A result is a collision between the financial logic of the book market and the ground rules of academia. Some say the conflict is a serious threat to the future of new scholarship at America's universities.
"University presses are increasingly having to make their decisions by reference to the market," said Sanford Thatcher, director of the Pennsylvania State Press, "so that presses will publish fewer books that have expected low sales. The whole problem, though, is that university presses were set up to publish precisely these kinds of books, and the tenure process depends on our decisions. Right now the whole system is breaking down."
Even a glance at academic publications makes it clear that the system has not entirely broken down. University presses publish about 8,000 books a year, some 15 percent of the 50,000 books published in the United States. And recent titles like "Essays on the Ethnography of the Aleuts" from the University of Alaska Press or "The Etablissements de Saint Louis: Thirteenth Century Law Texts from Tours, Orleans and Paris" by the University of Pennsylvania Press make it clear that you do not need best-seller potential to get published by university presses.
But financial pressures are making economically marginal books increasingly hard to justify. University library budgets have been under pressure for years. At the same time, scholarly journals have been drastically increasing in price. Since journals in various disciplines, particularly the sciences, are often considered essential purchases, budgets are being eaten up by the cost of journals at the expense of books.
"In 1975 a library might spend 70 percent of its annual budget on books and 30 percent on journals," said Walter Lippincott, director of the Princeton University Press. "Now those percentages are reversed."
When Mr. Lippincott worked at Cambridge University Press a few years back, he said, the assumption was that the institutional market for scholarly books was about 800 books. Others put the figure at 1,000. Now, he said, the expected market is 300 books, and it is difficult to justify publishing books with such a small sales potential. The Association of Research Libraries, which mostly represents university libraries, said its 119 members bought 23 percent fewer books in 1995 than in 1986.
Presses are finding ways to adjust. Many are focusing on books of regional interest or seeking books with general or academic appeal that stretches across different disciplines, thus broadening the market. And hot fields, like gay and lesbian studies, are prospering at academic presses, particularly those that have focused on such books, like the University of Chicago Press.
Also, some of the more aggressive university presses are hoping that as general-interest publishers focus more on blockbuster books, university presses will inherit many of the smaller, mainstream titles.
"Many big publishers don't want to publish books that don't have a chance of sales of 100,000 or more," said Stanley Fish, executive director of the Duke University Press. "The authors are becoming more willing to turn to university presses."
But none of that is likely to help scholars in specialized fields publishing works of academic importance but narrow appeal. Scholars say that may not matter at all to the general public, but it matters enormously to scholars dependent on getting their work disseminated and seeing the works of others in their field.
In a recent column in the weekly Chronicle of Higher Education, James Shapiro, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, warned that a result would be that trendy subjects would be explored while important but less sexy ones would not.
He cited two scholars, one studying Milton, the other cultural studies. Inevitably, the second would be more likely to be published and granted tenure, he said.
"The odds are that fewer Miltonists will get tenure; before long, there won't be enough around to train the next generation," he wrote. "It can hardly be a good thing" when the knowledge that is valued "is determined by market forces rather than by intellectual exchange."
There is much talk of solutions. One possibility is the rise of electronic publishing to the point that manuscripts could just be distributed and reviewed over the Internet rather than published in book form. But while electronic publishing is growing, few think the Internet is likely to replace books. Many academics say it is more likely that tenure procedures will have to change.
"There has not been anybody in my department to get tenure without a book in the last 25 years," said Gerald Snare, chairman of the English department at Tulane University. "Considering the number of extraordinarily bright young people who are having trouble even getting a reading, I would think in the next couple of years departments are going to have to rethink the tenure requirements."
Professor Shapiro of Columbia suggested that the tenure process be revised so that unpublished manuscripts could be judged on their intellectual merit rather than only being judged as finished books.
For now, though, young scholars like Mr. Parkhurst are having to play by the old rules. He is revising his manuscript on the political implications of the work of Adorno, a member of the Frankfurt School of scholars, of whom Herbert Marcuse is the best known.
"It's not like the mating habits of the Eastern woodfly, but it's still pretty esoteric," he said. "It doesn't have a high profile even in academia. But people who do esoteric nonmarket-oriented research don't do it to make money or be famous. They do it because they really want to do it. So I think people like me will continue to do what we do. It's just going to be harder and harder for us to find venues to share our work."

HEADLINE: Hard-Liners Are Regarded as Likely To Succeed Croatia's Ailing President

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The passing of President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who lies seriously ill with cancer in a Washington hospital, would probably strengthen hard-line nationalists who are openly hostile to the American-brokered Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia and who care little for democracy, say Western diplomats here.
The United States has often been frustrated with Mr. Tudjman's imperial style, his iron control of news reporting, political debate and the economy, and his refusal to allow the return of more than 200,000 ethnic Serbs driven from Croatia during the war. But at the same time, the 74-year-old former Communist general has battled back extreme factions in his governing party, the Croatian Democratic Union. 
 While he has not been an enthusiastic supporter of the federation in Bosnia, set up by the Americans in 1994 to end fighting between the ethnic Croats and the Muslims, he has insured its survival. And since the establishment of his Croatian nationalist state five years ago, he has astutely done just enough to keep his American and European allies behind him -- such as permitting a handful of small opposition newspapers to publish and backing the Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia.
But the President's party includes a powerful group of staunch nationalists who disapprove of the President's flexibility. Many of them live in Croatia in exile from the area in Bosnia held by ethnic Croats. That faction, which has amassed great wealth in the last few years by seizing control of state businesses following Croatia's independence in 1991, is dismissive of parliamentary democracy. Many members have close links with emigre groups in various countries like Canada and Australia whose members left Croatia after World War II because of the involvement they, or their ancestors, had in the Nazi-allied fascist state.
The loss of the President could not come at a worse time. His party is increasingly divided, facing mounting corruption scandals and struggling to halt a steady decline in its popularity. Only Mr. Tudjman, widely viewed as the father of the Croatian state, has been able to keep himself largely above the fray, although members of his family have profited handsomely from lucrative business deals.
"Without Tudjman, the ruling party could have a hard time holding on to power in free and fair elections," a European diplomat said. "But we worry about the lack of commitment by many of the people around the President to democratic procedures."
Even under Mr. Tudjman's patronage, the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia barely functions. The ethnic Croats in Bosnia, who carry Croatian passports and vote in Croatian elections, have refused to dismantle their self-styled government of "Herzeg-Bosnia" and to form common institutions with the Muslims. Diplomats here say that without the President's restraining hand, the hard-liners could well call for the annexation of Croat-held Bosnia, which is contiguous with the Croatian border. That would seriously destabilize Bosnia and openly repudiate the Dayton agreement.
The faction clustered around the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, who comes from the Croat-held part of Bosnia known as Herzegovina, has steadily pushed the party to the right. Mr. Susak, widely regarded as the second-most-powerful figure in Croatia, has also been ill, however. He was operated on in the United States this year for lung cancer, and reports of his continued illness persist despite official statements that he is in good health.
But even if he were out of the picture, that faction still dominates the party, controlling the police, internal security and the military. Mr. Susak works closely with several hard-line members of Parliament, including Ivan Milas, Vice Vukojevic -- who also originates from Herzegovina -- and Vladimir Seks.
The moderate Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, who has often helped curb the excesses of the hard-line wing, will probably be the big loser if the President is unable to stay in office, although the Foreign Minister has the respect of Croatia's most important allies, including the United States.
"Granic is the last, best hope for Croatia," said a Western diplomat. "But it is doubtful that he will be able to prevail over the hard-liners, who do not want to see the vast economic and political gains they made during the war diminished."
The country's fractious opposition coalition is unlikely to galvanize enough support to challenge the hard-liners in the governing party, in the scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections next year. The coalition is locked out of the Government-controlled news media, and its members are often harassed and lack financial backing. The coalition is also plagued by bitter divisions.
The opposition coalition began a monthlong boycott of Parliament meetings last Wednesday because of the governing party's refusal to honor the spirit of the municipal elections last year in Zagreb, the capital. Opposition candidates won control of the City Council, which is supposed to appoint the Mayor. The Council has nominated a series of candidates for Mayor, but the President has vetoed each one, citing a murky national security clause in the Constitution.
The Speaker of Parliament is designated by the Constitution to take over Mr. Tudjman's responsibilities if the Supreme Court decides that the President is unable to carry out his duties. Croatia has no Vice President. The Constitution calls for new elections 60 days after the President leaves office.
"Tudjman got away with this refusal to honor the results of democratic elections because of his personal stature," a Western diplomat said. "But no one else in the ruling party has that kind of authority. If the same tactics continue under a less popular politician, it could trigger a political upheaval."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Tudjman Said to Improve
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (Reuters) -- President Tudjman, under treatment in a Washington hospital, was feeling well and was working, a diplomat from Croatia's Embassy said today.
"He feels well," the diplomat said in a brief telephone interview. "He's performing his duties."
American officials said late last week that Mr. Tudjman was seriously ill and was being treated in Walter Reed Hospital for stomach cancer.
Croatian officials, apparently anxious to discourage speculation about the President's health, have avoided any mention of cancer and described his illness as a "digestion problem."

THE RAIN ON MACY'S PARADE
How Greed, Ambition and Folly Ruined America's Greatest Store
By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg
Illustrated. 274 pages. Times Business/Random House. $27.50.
Depressingly familiar is the story that Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg tells in his new book, "The Rain on Macy's Parade: How Greed, Ambition and Folly Ruined America's Greatest Store." Not only are the character flaws referred to in his subtitle commonplace, but his story of decline and fall is also all too symbolic of the corporate takeover era through which the American economy recently passed. 
 As Mr. Trachtenberg tells it, the descent of R. H. Macy & Company into bankruptcy in January 1992 is very nearly archetypal. Six years earlier, the chairman, Edward S. Finkelstein, recognizing the value of Macy's assets and wanting to protect his company from a hostile takeover by outside raiders, had engineered an ambitious leveraged buyout, placing himself at the head of a team of inside investors who hoped to be made rich by the maneuver. But in doing so, Mr. Trachtenberg says, Mr. Finkelstein projected too rosy a picture of the economic future and took on too heavy a burden of debt.
Poor management and bad luck increased Macy's vulnerability, Mr. Trachtenberg argues. When the economy turned sour, particularly through a series of Christmas seasons, Macy's was finally forced to seek bankruptcy protection. Because Mr. Finkelstein and his team could not come up with a viable reorganization plan, he was forced to resign, his management team lost its entire investment, and Macy's was eventually taken over by Federated Department Stores.
Mr. Trachtenberg, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, tells this story somewhat unevenly. He is spirited on Macy's rise to prominence, noting how the store was the first to sell Polaroid cameras and the games Monopoly and Scrabble, and how the Herald Square Macy's once auctioned live sheep and cows on the fifth floor.
He catches close up some of the more significant moments in his story, like the post-buyout victory party Mr. Finkelstein arranged for himself at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he pronounced for the gathering his own version of Henry V's St. Crispin's Day speech: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers." Or the shareholders' meeting on June 19, 1996, at which, despite the articulate objections of certain dissidents, Mr. Finkelstein's buyout proposal was overwhelmingly approved.
And Mr. Trachtenberg is adept at weaving into his narrative the parallel stories of other department-store empires, particularly Federated, which, by dealing more wisely with many of the same challenges that Macy's faced, was ultimately able to outmaneuver its rival.
Unfortunately, in certain other respects, Mr. Trachtenberg's narrative is weaker. True, we are all economists now, as commentators on the recent election have pointed out in explaining voters' resistance to Bob Dole's tax-cut proposal. But we are not all so sophisticated that we can follow, without a little coaching, Mr. Trachtenberg's sometimes rapid-fire references to "senior subordinated debentures," "nonrecourse senior real estate debt," "clean-down requirements," "debtor-in-possession financing" and "the cash flow ratio coverage covenant relative to debt."
More bothersome, the author fails to show precisely how Mr. Finkelstein's supposed personal failings worked to undermine Macy's struggle to survive. Various associates are quoted as accusing the chairman of nepotism, of an intolerance of contradiction, of surrounding himself with yes men, of rewarding himself too lavishly and of losing touch with the rank and file.
But no real connection is made between these shortcomings and Mr. Finkelstein's failure, for instance, to coordinate the operations of Macy's with its sister store Bamberger's, or his inability to understand that the success of the upscale stores in his organization, like Bullocks in Los Angeles, and the I. Magnin specialty store chain, depended on limiting inventory, so that wealthy shoppers would have the sense that they were getting something exclusive.
To judge from Mr. Trachtenberg's account, Mr. Finkelstein's fatal failing was that he counted too strongly on good economic times to repay Macy's huge debt, which is hardly an unusual flaw in a highly speculative business. So to end up calling Mr. Finkelstein "a King Lear-like figure -- angry, abandoned, bewildered" seems cliched and melodramatic, particularly when the reader hasn't gotten to know him well enough even to compare him to as elementary a character as the giant in "Jack and the Beanstalk." It is insulting, really, to both Mr. Finkelstein and Lear.
The discontinuity between character and action in Mr. Trachtenberg's narrative is summed up by his curious citation of a comment by Robert Miller, a lawyer who represented Macy's bondholders in dealings with Mr. Finkelstein after he resigned.
"Do you know the movie 'The Producers'?" said Mr. Miller. "At the end, when they are singing 'Springtime for Hitler,' Zero Mostel says, 'I hired the wrong director, the wrong actor, the wrong story. Where did I go right?' It was like that for Ed. Ed did everything right. So today he believes that the mistakes and faults weren't his. It was the weather, it was the recession, but never me."
These remarks are incoherent, and so is Mr. Trachtenberg's point in quoting them. To anyone who recalls "The Producers," the point of Zero Mostel's funny comment "Where did I go right?" is that he has a hit on his hands despite having done everything in his power to produce a failure. This is exactly the opposite of what Mr. Finkelstein tried to do by taking Macy's private. Presumably he tried to do everything right, and went wrong. Unless, of course, a hidden side of this story exists that Mr. Trachtenberg, in this ultimately superficial account, has neglected to reveal.

HEADLINE: An Odd Rift Develops Between an Author and Borders, a Chain Promoting His Book

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Ever since he filmed the docu-comedy "Roger and Me" at the nadir of the 1980's recession, Michael Moore has gained fame and money playing the guileless Everyman who skewers corporate America. Little did he suspect that an Everyman corporation might someday skewer back.
But to hear him tell it, that is precisely what Borders Group Inc., the bookseller whose megastores are among the sales elephants of the literary jungle, is doing. 
 In a column appearing today in The Nation magazine, Mr. Moore contends that Borders executives have banned him from promoting his popular book "Downsize This!" in any of their 152 stores. He says Borders security guards have intimidated him and that long-planned readings and autograph sessions have been canceled.
Why? Mr. Moore's explanation is that last month, while in a Borders in Philadelphia to promote his book, he said it is a good idea for bookstore employees to join unions. It happens that two unions have begun trying to organize the 8,000 workers of the chain; last month the Lincoln Park, Ill., store voted to join the United Food and Commercial Workers.
"I just don't think they're thinking very clearly now because they're so afraid," Mr. Moore said. "I was really looking forward to going out on a book tour. I'm not going out on a union organizing tour."
For their part, Borders officials suggest that Mr. Moore suffers from a persecution complex. They say the union movement extends to barely four of the company's sites, and has already failed in Philadelphia. "Downsize This!" got generous billing in a promotional magazine that Borders gives to customers, and Borders officials say it defies logic for a bookstore to muzzle an author who is padding their bottom line.
And they profess to be mystified as to why Mr. Moore would start a public attack on a company contributing so heavily to his success. "We welcome him and are pleased to have him sign copies," said Jody Kohn, a spokeswoman for Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich. "We are doing what we can do to help sell his book. He's gone to several places and done exactly what you're telling me, which is to kind of bad-mouth us."
In short, Ms. Kohn said, Mr. Moore's account of Borders's behavior is flat-out incorrect. Mr. Moore says her version "flies in the face of everything I know to be true."
It is an odd rift. Mr. Moore, who is from Michigan, fondly remembers shopping at the original Ann Arbor Borders when the company was a single store owned by "two hippies" who let customers browse as long as they wanted.
The chain and Mr. Moore got off to a rousing start this year, when Mr. Moore regaled an Ann Arbor audience with a speech speckled with praise for Borders. He spoke about the union drive when asked. "I answered that I think everyone should like to join a union and that I support them," he said. "But I also said that I had to say I think Borders is probably the best bookstore in America."
Things went downhill from there. The two sides disagree little over facts, but are light years apart on questions of motivation.
No one disputes, for example, that the situation was dicey when Mr. Moore arrived to speak and sign books in Philadelphia. The International Workers of the World was trying to unionize the store; there were accusations, denied by Borders, that a worker was dismissed for supporting the union's efforts.
Mr. Moore, a committed union supporter, refused to cross a picket line outside the door. But with the apparent blessing of officials of Borders, Mr. Moore invited the pickets inside and let the dismissed worker speak.
But The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted an unidentified union official saying Mr. Moore urged his audience to buy their books elsewhere, an account Borders officials agree with.
"He said, 'Hey, there's a Rizzoli's down the street; you can shop there,' " Ms. Kohn said, referring to a competing store.
Mr. Moore denies it: "I don't want people to boycott Borders. Maybe someone said 'I don't want to buy your book at Borders' and I said, 'Maybe you can buy it somewhere else.' "
His next appearance at a Borders shop in the World Trade Center in New York also did not go smoothly.
Mr. Moore's version is that two officials of Borders canceled his speech an hour before the event, telling him they did not want to repeat Philadelphia's commotion. He said, "They told me I could sign the books but I was not to open my mouth," adding that when he took the dais he was flanked by two security guards he viewed as enforcers.
Ms. Kohn said the speech was scrapped because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police told the store to winnow the "enormous" crowds at lunchtime author sessions. The executives were there on other business, and many stores have guards, she said.
Two weeks later, after a signing party in a Des Moines high school gym (Borders provided the books), Mr. Moore said worried store employees hailed him in a parking lot, saying Borders ordered them to stay away. The Food and Commercial Workers are organizing at the Des Moines outlet; an election is scheduled for Dec. 10.
Ms. Kohn says that account is fiction and that Borders workers were given time off to attend the signing.
For Mr. Moore, the last straw was the cancellation of a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., book signing early this month. "They said they'd received a directive from corporate headquarters that Michael Moore would not be allowed to speak at any Borders nationwide," he said.
"That's not true," Ms. Kohn said. Rather, she said, Mr. Moore's appearance was never confirmed; the store decided on its own to bypass the event.
Ms. Kohn says she is "perplexed" by Mr. Moore's animosity. He says he is willing to take Borders at its word and resume appearances.
 In the meantime, he says, he is donating the royalties from 1,000 copies of his book to the union drive.

HEADLINE: New Bird Found in Brazil Forest Owes Survival to Cocoa

BYLINE: By LES LINE

 BODY:
OVER the last decade, some 20 new bird species have been found in the remote tropical forests of South America. None of them, however, have astonished scientists quite like an acrobatic treetop species with bubble gum-pink bill and legs that has been found nesting along one of Brazil's busiest highways, and owes its survival to the human craving for chocolate.
The warbler-size bird, called the pink-legged graveteiro ("twig gatherer" in Portuguese), lives in towering forest trees that shade cocoa plantations in the coastal state of Bahia. But cocoa production, once a major part of the Brazilian economy, has suffered a catastrophic blow from an accidentally introduced fungus disease. "The shade trees are being cut and sold as landowners turn to raising cattle or growing bananas," said Bret Whitney, a research associate at Louisiana State University and one of the ornithologists who discovered and documented the species. 
 "This remarkable new bird and its secrets could disappear in the coming decade," Mr. Whitney warned.
The discovery of the pink-legged graveteiro (Acrobatornis fonsecai), whose genus is also new to science, was announced in the current issue of The Wilson Bulletin, an ornithological journal, by Mr. Whitney and his Brazilian colleagues. The bird's Portuguese name is "acrobata," referring to its habit of foraging for winged termites and other small insects while swinging upside-down from the foliage of 140-foot-tall trees, or creeping along the underside of canopy branches heavily laden with bromeliads, lianas, orchids and mosses. The startlingly colored legs of the otherwise black and gray adults are unusually stout for a bird its size, Mr. Whitney said.
The pink-legged graveteiro belongs to the ovenbird family, a group of New World tropical birds with more than 230 species and found in virtually every kind of habitat, from cloud forests to deserts. The family gets its name from domed nest structures of hardened clay or mud that are built by several species and look like miniatures of the baking ovens common in rural Latin America. Several ovenbird species, including the graveteiro, construct huge arboreal nests of tightly interlaced sticks that the birds enter through long tunnels leading to one or more rooms.
Mr. Whitney said that after the Bahia species was found by two Brazilian friends in November 1994, he counted a number of its nests "along highway BR-101, which runs through the middle of its range and is as crowded with traffic as a freeway in the United States." He said the bird had been overlooked "because it stays way up in the canopy and its nest was confused with that of another species." Mr. Whitney said a total of 131 nests of the graveteiro were found at 53 different sites. But there was no estimate of the bird's total population.
For years, Louisiana State researchers have scoured the South American rain forests for previously unknown birdlife with considerable success. But the pink-legged graveteiro was found in a densely populated agricultural region, and Dr. Van Remsen of the university's Museum of Natural Science called it "the most exciting new species of bird discovered in decades." Dr. Gary Graves of the Smithsonian Institution said, "That it apparently occurs only or principally over cocoa plantations makes it all the more unexpected."
The excitement was tempered, however, by the knowledge that the bird's unusual habitat is rapidly disappearing. The cocoa planations of Bahia preserve a remnant of Brazil's once vast Atlantic forest, a coastal lowland ecosystem that was rich in endemic species but has largely been obliterated by logging, agriculture and living space for the majority of the country's human population. One of the world's rarest mammals, the golden-headed lion tamarin, is also found in the canopy over cocoa trees.
Cocoa was introduced into southern Bahia from the Amazon in 1746, and in the 1970's it was Brazil's second most important export after coffee, with more than 1.25 million acres planted in the crop. But the international price for cocoa crashed in the late 1980's, about the time a destructive fungus called witch's broom began to spread through the plantations. "Control of the fungus was expensive and ultimately not effective and cocoa production plummeted," Mr. Whitney said. "Plantation owners, often with reluctance, have little choice but to cut their valuable old trees and sell the timber for immediate cash."
Mr. Whitney said there was no officially protected forest and almost no intact native forest in the range of the pink-legged graveteiro. Cocoa, he explained, is cultivated by removal of the forest understory and thinning of the canopy to about 10 trees per acre. "This system has preserved, to a considerable extent, the humid microclimate upon which many forms of life depend," he said. "The canopies are almost continuous over large tracts and hold magnificent adult trees of a wide variety of species."
The ornithologist said that because of the failing cocoa industry, conservationists had an opportunity to buy two large blocks of land "to preserve a representative sample of the biodiversity in this part of the Atlantic forest," adding, "The cocoa could be removed and seedlings of native tree species planted to replace mature trees that are nearing the end of their life spans."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Yen but Falls Vs. Mark on Aide's Remarks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday but ended mostly lower, weakening after a top Bundesbank official surprised the market by saying he did not think the dollar could gain against the mark.
The remarks by Ernst Welteke, president of the regional central bank based in Frankfurt, contradicted a chorus of recent statements by other officials of the German central bank, including its president, Hans Tietmeyer, expressing support for a higher dollar. 
 "That was a shocker when it came out," said Elliott Dix, assistant vice president for foreign exchange at the Signet Banking Corporation in Richmond. "The Germans were the only ones giving a solid front, then Welteke comes out and blindsides us like that."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5015 marks from 1.5103 marks on Friday. The dollar rose to 111.48 yen from its seven-week low of 110.88 on Friday.
The British pound continued to trade at four-year highs against the dollar, up to $1.6662 from $1.6635.
Asked at a conference in Frankfurt whether the Bundesbank is now content with the dollar's level against the mark, Mr. Welteke said, "German exporters would like to see it go higher, but I don't see any reason why it should."
Although Mr. Welteke later backtracked and said the Bundesbank would like to see a stable and slightly higher dollar, his initial remarks still suggested a divergence of opinion in the German central bank over the dollar's value against the mark. The dollar fell sharply against the mark and other European currencies and never recovered.
"This was perceived to be a surprise," said Jim Powers, vice president of foreign exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landes Bank in New York. "All the others are supportive of a strong dollar."
Mr. Tietmeyer and other Bundesbank aides came out forcefully in support of a stronger dollar last week after it fell below 1.5000 marks. A weaker dollar hurts German exporters, who are helping lead Germany out of a prolonged period of economic weakness.

HEADLINE: Serbia Opposition Claims Municipal Vote Victory

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Serbia's opposition parties claimed victory today in municipal elections and called on President Slobodan Milosevic's governing Socialists to concede defeat, warning them not to tamper with the vote.
The four-party opposition coalition, called Zajedno, won control over 32 municipalities, including the capital, Belgrade, and several former Communist bastions, according to unofficial results from the vote, held on Sunday. 
 Mr. Milosevic's party suffered the biggest blow in Belgrade, where the Zajedno coalition won 12 of 16 municipalities, or 70 seats in the 110-seat city council, the opposition said.
The results would give non-Communists their first chance to form Belgrade's local government in more than 50 years.
The Socialists seemed surprised and unprepared for the returns, refusing immediate comment. They claimed to have won in some smaller municipalities, but the tone of their statements today was uncharacteristically humble.
The municipal councils have little real power, but the returns meant a symbolic loss to the President and could tarnish his image. They could also put a dent in the power of the leftist bloc made up of Mr. Milosevic's Socialists and the neo-Communist party headed by Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
In a statement, the opposition warned the leftists against trying to annul vote results. "We will defend our election victory at any price, and we warn Slobodan Milosevic and his wife not to play with the people's will," they said.
About 10,000 opposition supporters crowded downtown Belgrade, where they threw firecrackers and blew car horns through early morning to celebrate.
"I call upon the European Union and the United States to bring Milosevic to his senses and make him admit that democracy has won," a Zajedno leader, Vuk Draskovic, told the cheering crowd.
In addition to Belgrade, the opposition also claimed victory in the industrial cities of Kragujevac and Nis. All three cities were once Milosevic strongholds, but workers are angry over Serbia's dismal economy, still largely in state hands.
Half the work force is unemployed, and those with jobs are often idle and have to wait months for wages.
Zoran Djindjic, the opposition candidate for mayor of Belgrade, said there had been many irregularities during the balloting, including fistfights in Nis and another town, Smederevska Palanka, and that opposition monitors were barred from several polling stations. The Government authorities had no comment.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Milosevic and his wife easily triumphed in elections for the Parliament that represents Serbia and its only partner in Yugoslavia, tiny Montenegro.
That victory could secure Mr. Milosevic's election by the legislature as Yugoslav President next year, when his second term as President of Serbia expires. He is constitutionally barred from a third term.

HEADLINE: A Generic Fighter Plane

 BODY:
Tight budgets, advanced technologies and the end of the cold war are at last bringing some sanity to the way the Pentagon buys new weapons systems. Lockheed Martin and Boeing have been selected as the surviving bidders in a competition to build a reasonably priced fighter plane that can be modified for use by each of the military services. The plan puts an old and honorable idea into practice. The logical notion of a generic fighter plane has been around for decades, but was always trumped by service rivalries and members of Congress eager to keep the aircraft plants running back home.
Military reformers have long known that use of a common aircraft by the Air Force, Navy and Marines could save billions. But reaching that goal will still require uncharacteristically rigorous management by the Pentagon and measured military spending by Congress. 
 Changes in the world order and the nation's budget priorities at home make this a timely step. Over the next two decades, the United States will need new combat aircraft to maintain its military power as China and other countries develop new planes of their own. But the urgency and scale of production need not match cold-war expectations. The cost of acquiring new planes must be held down to allow Federal spending on domestic programs.
The Pentagon seems determined to contain costs this time by setting a price of $35 million per plane and sticking with one design that can be adjusted for the varying combat demands of the Air Force, Navy and Marines.
Last weekend the Pentagon trimmed the field of potential manufacturers to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, dropping McDonnell Douglas from the competition. Even if Pentagon orders for the new plane are kept to a reasonable and financially sound level -- far below the 3,000 aircraft now estimated -- American and foreign contracts are likely to total several hundred billion dollars over the next 25 years.
Despite the expense, this approach is a striking departure from the old system of designing gold-plated weapons systems in Washington and insisting on costly Pentagon technical specifications in manufacturing. This time the Defense Department wants cost-conscious companies to produce a utilitarian design and come up with an economical manufacturing plan.
To survive in the much-tightened defense market, recently merged companies like Lockheed Martin have driven down production costs by negotiating labor concessions and turning over parts production to outside companies. Computer simulation has streamlined the design phase.
The new combat aircraft, known for now as the Joint Strike Fighter, must satisfy the Air Force's need for a nimble fighter that will replace its fleet of some 1,400 F-16's. The Navy is looking for a durable, stealthy attack plane that can be launched from aircraft carriers, and the Marines would like a warplane like the Harrier jet that can operate on short runways and land vertically.
Getting all those attributes from a single aircraft design will not be easy. Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas produced plausible proposals based on relatively conventional aircraft technology, while Boeing offered a futuristic plane that resembles a flying wing. By eliminating McDonnell Douglas, the Pentagon seems to be betting on Lockheed Martin, while waiting to see if Boeing can produce a technological breakthrough.
None of this will work if Pentagon turf battles resume, abetted by Congressional trade-offs designed to shovel money into as many districts as possible. The Pentagon plan could also be undone if Lockheed Martin or Boeing find orders falling so far below expectations that they cannot take advantage of mass-production savings to keep the price down. But for now the Pentagon seems to be trying to change its wasteful ways. With aircraft production not expected to begin until 2008, there will be time to reconsider the plan if the costs start to escalate.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Is VW's New Plant Lean, Or Just Mean?

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: RESENDE, Brazil

 BODY:
At first glance, the work force at Volkswagen's truck and bus factory here seems like any other, clad in unremarkable gray uniforms. But look at the pockets, and you will see the key to what Volkswagen executives call the factory of the future. The names stitched there are Rockwell, Cummins, Remon and MWM. What are conspicuously scarce are Volkswagen workers.
In this new factory some 100 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, Volkswagen employs a mere 200 of the 1,000 workers, those responsible only for overall quality control, marketing, and research and design. The assembly work -- from counting spark plugs to bolting down engines -- is left to suppliers. 
 This is the "dream factory" that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has long promised would revolutionize auto manufacturing Mr. Lopez, Volkswagen's charismatic, controversial head of purchasing, quit General Motors in 1993 because that auto maker, he said, would never build it. General Motors, for its part, accused Mr. Lopez of stealing its plans for "Plant X," and building it here.
Whatever its origins, the plant, inaugurated this month, transforms Volkswagen from a manufacturer into a contractor, overseeing the work of other companies. Some eight major subcontractors have their own shops along the assembly line, where their workers assemble components, including parts from 400 suppliers, before dropping them onto chassis.
Volkswagen is betting that the system will reduce the number of defective parts, improve efficiency and cut costs. If it does, it could become a manufacturing model for the developing world, where almost all growth in the auto industry is expected to take place, According to Mr. Lopez, it could apply to other types of manufacturing as well.
But industry analysts ask whether Volkswagen's factory for the future is lean, or merely mean: whether it achieves true gains in productivity, or furthers a trend toward squeezing subcontractors and employees. Volkswagen's subcontractors shoulder more direct costs and risks, and the assembly-line workers are paid roughly a third as much as auto workers in Sao Paulo.
While Volkswagen calls this new way of putting together trucks and buses a "modular consortium," it can look like a Russian doll of auto making. The subcontractors include Brazilian companies like Delga Automotiva Industria e Comercio Ltda.; local subsidiaries of transnational corporations, like Rockwell International and Cummins Engine of America and Motorenwerk of Mannheim Eisenmann of Germany, as well as consortiums like Remon created for the venture.
This blurring of distinctions between suppliers and auto maker, as between electrical components and mechanical ones, is also a sign of change in auto manufacturing, said Sean McAlinden, manager of economic studies at the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. "Who's the customer and who's the supplier?" he said. "In the future, those boundaries may not make sense."
While truck makers and Japanese auto makers have long relied heavily on pre-assembled components, "We haven't heard of a completely supplier-run plant before," Mr. McAlinden said.
With South America's largest economy and population, and with more than 90 percent of its goods transported by truck, Brazil is an important testing ground for Volkswagen.
"How things work in a country like Brazil matter very much indeed," Mr. McAlinden said. "It doesn't even matter if the product isn't meant for outside Brazil. The most important prototype plants today are prototype plants for the third world."
For the moment, the factory is producing only one truck a day, because of delays in installing some equipment, such as an electronic overhead monorail. The cab factory and the paint shop are not finished, and so for now, every truck produced here is white. Suppliers are using the time to train workers, who were hired without experience.
Instead of a traditional assembly line, on which a single piece of metal grows part by part into a truck or bus as it moves from worker to worker, Resende runs subassembly lines parallel to the main line. The process begins with a chassis delivered to a loading dock; as the chassis moves along the main line, each supplier simultaneously assembles its components.
At the first stop for a chassis, workers from Iochpe-Maxion mount the gas tank, transmission lines and steering box.
At it moves down the line, Rockwell-Braseixos workers mount the axles and brakes. At the next stop, workers from Remon put on wheels and adjust tire pressure.
MWM/Cummins prepares and installs the engine and transmission. The cabs -- supplied by the Ford Motor Company now, but eventually to be produced by Delga -- are outfitted by VDO do Brasil, a unit of Adolf Schindling A.G. of Germany. Painting will be done by Eisenmann.
When the plant reaches capacity next year, its two shifts are expected to produce 100 trucks a day, using only 800 assembly workers, compared with 2,500 in traditionally designed plants in Brazil. And Volkswagen is betting that with suppliers on hand to inspect each component before it becomes part of a vehicle, quality will be high. Volkswagen pays suppliers only when trucks are completed and pass inspection. If a component is not up to quality, the supplier is not paid.
That, some analysts said, could solve a major drawback of developing countries: quality control.
In Japan, for example, Toyota does not need such a system, said James P. Womack, an efficiency expert and co-author of "Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation," because only 5 parts in a million are defective; in much of the developing world, defective parts can run 15,000 to 20,000 per million.
The plant also saves on wages, which the suppliers have all set at $374 a month, which Volkswagen says is in line with factory work in the Resende area. And, any down time on the assembly line -- say, because parts are missing -- is charged to the workers, who must make it up without overtime.
The plant's manager, Luiz Antonio Pinteado de Luca, said salaries usually accounted for about half the cost of producing trucks in Brazil. Nevertheless, he said he expected the biggest savings to come from logistics, even though one part of the strategy, just-in-time delivery, could be vulnerable to hitches like poor roads or strikes at supplier bases in Sao Paulo.
But industry analysts wonder how much of Volkswagen's lowered production costs depend upon simply paying workers and suppliers less.
"It's not clear how much is a fundamental efficiency game, and how much of it is a way to get people to work for less money," Mr. Womack said. Mr. Lopez's calls for a third industrial revolution, familiar to industry insiders, never mentioned lowering salaries, he said.
"Merely cutting wages does not constitute a revolution," Mr. Womack said. "It constitutes a counter-revolution, in some ways."
Volkswagen calls its suppliers in Resende "partners," and it required them to put up $50 million of the factory's $300 million cost. Despite their capital investment, they are not, like true partners, sharing profits.
Given the reputation Mr. Lopez has developed for muscling suppliers to lower prices, those at Resende said they designed their contracts with Volkswagen very carefully, building into prices, for example, allowances for Volkswagen's withholding payment until trucks are completed.
"Basically, we recognize that Mr. Lopez is a tough negotiator and tough with suppliers," said Sergio Carvalho, director of sales and service at Rockwell do Brasil. "But we foresee the chance to grow our market share with Volkswagen."
Ricardo Chuahy, director of operations at Cummins do Brasil, concurred. "The concept is very aggressive," he said. "If it works, other manufacturers will copy Volkswagen."
Similarly, Volkswagen maintains that the lower wages at Resende merely reflect the labor market. But while the plant's work force is expected to unionize eventually, local union leaders admit they are perplexed by its web of employers.
Much of the plant's success will depend on Volkswagen's ability to break into the domestic truck market dominated by Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz, said Jose Roberto Ferro, an economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation and local coordinator of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's International Motor Vehicle Program.
Volkswagen is counting on the Resende plant to be an important source of exports to Europe and South America, but it does not have a corresponding international distribution network, he said.
"It's a nice solution, and the primary reason it sounds so neat is because labor is so cheap, and it gives Volkswagen a massive two-by-four to wield against its unions in Sao Paulo," Mr. Womack said.
If so, the message was not lost: last week, workers at General Motors and Volkswagen plants in Sao Paulo accepted management's first offer on a new contract.

 Like Tom Sawyer and his fence-painting project, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua designed Volkswagen's new truck plant in Resende, Brazil, around work done for Volkswagen's benefit by others. Major suppliers are assigned space in the plant and their own workers add components to trucks rolling down the assembly line. Volkswagen's employees, a minority in the plant, supervise the work and inspect finished trucks; only when they pass are the suppliers paid.

HEADLINE: 1.12 Loss Halts Dow's 10-Session Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average fell just shy of its ninth straight record yesterday as an afternoon rebound faltered in lackluster trading.
The Dow fell 1.12 points, to 6,346.91, also ending a string of 10 straight winning sessions that had produced a gain of about 325 points, or 5.4 percent. 
 Broader measures also finished lower as investors, expecting few market surprises from this week's light schedule of economic events, secured some profits on a stunning post-election rally.
"How long can you celebrate the election? You need some positive events to drive the market," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., noting that no big earnings or economic news is expected in the next few days. "The market's going to be in a pretty tight range this week."
The market's early afternoon turnaround could be traced to another good day for I.B.M., which surged for the second straight session on positive comments by securities analysts. I.B.M. spent the morning lower amid some profit taking after Friday's 8 1/8-point advance, but then jumped higher after an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company raised his 12-month target price for the company's stock to 170 a share, from 145.
I.B.M. rose as high as 150, then settled to close at 146 3/4, up 1 3/4 on the day, giving the stock a two-day gain of 7.4 percent.
I.B.M.'s fortunes were not good enough to keep the rally going yesterday afternoon, and stocks fizzled in the absence of any broader news.
"The volume is contracting; you need to show superior firepower to keep it going," Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, said.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 388.5 million shares, down sharply from Friday's 529.1 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.60 point, to 737.02, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.12, to 389.90. The S.& P. 500 had closed at record highs in seven of the last 10 sessions, while the Big Board composite had set new marks in 8 of the last 10 trading days.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.23, to 1,254.57, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.23, to 584.18.
The Dow's other big gainer was Boeing, which rose 1 1/2, to 93 1/4, after Saturday's announcement that the Pentagon had narrowed the competition for a joint strike fighter contract to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, cutting out McDonnell Douglas. McDonnell shares slid 4 1/4, to 52 1/2, in active trading, with several brokerage firms downgrading the stock. Lockheed rose 1 7/8, to 95 5/8.
The Dow's biggest loser was Texaco, which fell 2 3/4, to 98 3/8, as investors reacted to a settlement late on Friday in a racial discrimination suit against the company.
The Big Board's most active issue was Deutsche Telekom, which rose to 21 1/2 from an offering price of nearly $19 as the German state phone monopoly raised about $13.3 billion in an initial public offering.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Separate Trade Pact by Canada and Chile

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Bypassing a deadlock in Washington over whether to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement to include Chile, Canada today signed its own accord to open trade with Chile.
Although Chile, one of South America's fastest-growing economies, is not a major Canadian trading partner, commerce between the two countries has been growing in recent years and now exceeds $500 million (United States) a year. Canadian mining companies already have made big investments there, and businesses in both countries have formed more than 50 joint ventures. 
 Today's agreement removes tarriffs on three-quarters of all imports and exports between the two countries, with the remaining duties scheduled to be eliminated over the next five years.
But Canada's most important goal in pursuing a trade agreement was to pave the way for the eventual entry of Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement, where it could help offset some of the dominance of the United States.
"We will keep pushing the U.S.," Prime Minister Jean Chretien told reporters after he signed the agreement in Ottawa with President Eduardo Frei of Chile. Mr. Chretien said he firmly supported "extending Nafta very rapidly" to include Chile.
A United States trade official, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified, said the Canadian agremeent appeared to be "a good interim step" that would help speed the process of Chile's admission to the North American trade bloc once negotiations with the United States resumed, perhaps early next year.
After the North American trade pact went into effect in January 1994, the three original members -- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- looked forward to expanding it to bring in other Western Hemisphere nations. In December that year, the leaders of the three nations announced their intention to begin the process of extending membership to Chile.
But that initiative got off track within weeks, after Mexico was forced to devalue the peso, setting off a financial and economic crisis that required a multibillion-dollar rescue effort led by the United States.
Mexico's problems soured many members of the United States Congress against free trade. The fast-track negotiating authority the Clinton Administration wanted before opening discussions with Chile became entangled in political disputes in Washington.
Fast-track authority allows for a trade agreement to be voted on without being subject to unlimited amendments. Without it, the Administration might have risked reopening the existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.
Chile has been eager to join the exclusive trading club. But the nation's leaders did not want to proceed unless the American legislative measure had the fast-track provision.
That was when Canada stepped forward to pursue its own negotiations. Trade with Chile has more than doubled since 1988, with Canada sending grain, minerals, machinery and paper products to Chile, and buying fruit, nuts, wine and fish.
Negotiations between the two nations snagged several times and nearly broke off over Chile's strict capital requirements. In the end, Canada accepted the Chilean demands.
All foreign investors in Chile are required to deposit almost a third of the capital they bring into the country with the Chilean central bank. The money remains on deposit for a year. Chile thus hopes to avoid developing an overreliance on speculative capital, or leveraged deals, of the type that damaged Mexico's economy before devaluation.
The United States trade official said that unless Chile changed its stance, the capital requirement would probably stand in the way of Chile's entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Treasury Prices Post Slight Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday, as a lack of economic data and the prospect of auctions later this week discouraged active buying.
"This could be a difficult week: The market's looking for reasons to move, and I don't really think it's going to get any," said George Adell, a trader at Starboard Capital Markets Inc., a Philadelphia-based firm. "There's going to be no direct news to drive the market." 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32 yesterday, to 100 12/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 6.46 percent. The price of the two-year note also fell, driving its yield up to 5.67 percent, from 5.65 percent on Friday.
The Treasury, meanwhile, sold $14.1 billion in three-month bills and $14.1 billion in six-month bills at its regular weekly auction yesterday. The three-month bill was sold at an average discount rate of 5.03 percent, up slightly from 5.02 percent last week, while the six-month bill was sold at an average rate of 5.07 percent, the same as last week.
Weighing on bond prices yesterday was expectation that Wall Street firms would push yields higher to drum up demand for the $30.75 billion of notes the Treasury is selling this week.
"You have two auctions this week, so the market has backed up a little bit," said Terry Rose, who helps manage $2 billion of bonds at Advisers Capital Management Inc. The Treasury sells $18.25 billion of two-year notes today, and it will offer $12.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow.
The market will also have more data to digest this week. Today, the Commerce Department reports on October housing starts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia releases a monthly survey of manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region on Thursday.
In the corporate bond market, Tri Polyta, an Indonesian maker of resins and plastics, sold $185 million of seven-year Yankee notes, or debt sold by foreign entities in the United States. The notes were priced to yield 11.5 percent, 5.5 percentage points more than the comparable Treasury note.
Other companies are lining up to borrow while Treasury yields are low. Slim spreads, or differences in yield between corporates and Treasuries, have also made borrowing inexpensive.
"Rates are very favorable, spreads are very favorable," said Steve Bohlin, who manages $1.7 billion at the Thornburgh Management Company in Santa Fe, N.M. "The rumor is that there's a fair amount of supply ready to roll before year end."
Last week, companies including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and the Export-Import Bank of South Korea sold more than $4 billion of new bonds.
At least a dozen corporations are scheduled to sell at least $3 billion in bonds this week, with junk-rated corporations making up the bulk of the borrowers.
Some of the bigger expected sales include junk bond offerings by Allied Waste North America Inc., the Lamar Advertising Company and WCI Steel Inc.
Bonds are considered below investment grade, or junk, if they carry ratings below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Municipal bonds were little changed as investors looked for more attractive returns on the $3.8 billion in new bonds to be sold later in the week. About $225 million in new bonds were priced today.
Two San Francisco revenue bond sales lead this week's offerings.
Following are the results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: Losses May Signal End of Gambling's Lucky Run

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: CONWAY, Ark., Nov. 14

 BODY:
The congregation's opinion of gambling fitted as snugly with the Rev. David Hatfield's view as his low-slung brick church did with the neat houses across the road. The members of the Woodland Heights Baptist Church did not need much persuading that casinos were bad.
Gambling interests had flooded Arkansas television screens with one of the industry's biggest advertising campaigns. More than in two previous gambling votes in the state, this threat seemed urgent to Mr. Hatfield and to his congregation: nearly one-fifth of whom signed up to vote for the first time. The story was repeated across Arkansas and on Nov. 5., with help from many new voters, a casino proposal was crushed. 
 "I think people felt more of a threat this time," Mr. Hatfield said. "They saw an all-out barrage by gambling forces."
What happened in Arkansas on Election Day mirrored the larger picture across the country. In six other states, wagering proposals were rejected by voters. Only Michigan voted to allow casinos in hard-pressed Detroit. Elsewhere, voters appeared to combine new suspicions of the industry's economic optimism with old moral qualms while vigorous grass-roots campaigns like the one here worked hard to muster the anti-gambling vote.
This rejection appears to be part of a slight shift in the fortunes of the highly profitable gambling industry, still not universally accepted despite vigorous efforts to improve its image. Critics and boosters alike agree that the great period of gambling expansion appears to be over.
The National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, a lobbying and advocacy group based in Washington, reports victories for anti-gambling efforts in over two dozen states in the last two years, in legislatures and in referendums. Industry proponents deride some of these as no more than isolated defeats for them.
But even advocates of gambling suggest that it may have reached a point of saturation, now that every state but Hawaii and Utah permits some sort of wagering. Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of American Gaming Association, said a better economy has lessened the demand for casinos and the like.
Critics of gambling cite a different reason for the apparent roll-back. They say long-standing public suspicion of the industry has deepened in the last few years, and politicians are becoming aware of this.
A 1995 survey by Gtech, the world's largest supplier of lottery equipment, found that sentiment for legalized gambling had declined by 10 percent since 1994 and concluded that support for the industry may be waning. Moreover, the anti-gambling coalition found that gambling initiatives had been defeated in the last two years in the legislatures of such states as Alabama, Hawaii, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas.
"All the polls show that the longer you have it, the more you have of it, the less popular it becomes," said Robert Goodman, a professor at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., and the author of "The Luck Business" (Free Press, 1995).
Gambling's major defeat this year, in Ohio, was spearheaded by Gov. George V. Voinovich, who led a campaign against a proposal for eight riverboat casinos. Mr. Voinovich spoke out strongly and often against gambling's social costs, enlisting the aid of churches, businessmen and educators. The gambling initiative was defeated by 36 percentage points.
In Washington State, a successful drive to defeat slot machines on Indian lands was led in part by State Senator Dwight Pelz, Democrat of Seattle.
"I think most people have a distasteful image of slot machines as one-armed bandits for dazed idiots," Mr. Pelz said. "Folks are starting to realize it is not the magic bullet of economic development."
In Louisiana, voters cut back on gambling in the state, throwing video poker out of 33 of the state's 64 parishes in the wake of a legislative bribery scandal. But a heavy advertising campaign by the gambling industry helped secure a yes vote for the state's river casinos and the land casino in New Orleans. In Colorado, Iowa and Nebraska, voters rejected limited expansions of gambling while approving them in Arizona and West Virginia.
In a surprise result, voters in Michigan approved casinos for Detroit by three percentage points. Opponents had been so certain of defeating the casino proposal that they hardly bothered to mount a campaign, said Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics. Mayor Dennis Archer had backed the proposal, as did the city's voters, irritated by a successful new casino across the Detroit River in Ontario.
In Arkansas, casino gambling has twice before been rejected by voters, in 1964 and 1984. But this year, with casinos in neighboring Mississippi and Louisiana drawing patrons from Arkansas, the state's voters faced growing pressure to approve a constitutional amendment that included a referendum for three casinos in Hot Springs, a lottery and bingo.
Gambling's backers here, principally Charles Cella, who owns the Hot Springs horse track and who would have gained one casino, outspent the opponents almost 6 to 1. Most of the opposition money, came not from citizens' groups but from Mississippi casinos, fearful of competition. In all, the proponents spent nearly $4 for every person in Arkansas, or about $10 million.
Still, the gambling proposals never led in polls, though in mid-October supporters drew almost even with opponents, worrying the Christian grass-roots campaign that had been organizing for over a year.
"I had some doubts about keeping our lead," said Larry Page, director of the Christian Civic Action Committee in Little Rock. "They were running their ads unopposed. It was saturation advertising."
But Mr. Page, whose group represents conservative evangelical churches, had anti-gambling coordinators in virtually every Arkansas county. Pastors copied the anti-gambling literature sent by Mr. Page, distributed it to congregants and used the pulpit to speak about the evils of gambling. His group also led a statewide drive for new voters, and a "substantial increase" was registered by the Secretary of State's Office, officials said.
On Sundays, the message in churches up and down the state rang out for months before Election Day, seeking to counter the industry's extensive advertising campaign.
"For me it was critical," said Stewart Bell, pastor of First Baptist Church in Searcy. "If there was ever a time I needed to take a stand, it was now."
The proposals were rejected 61 percent to 39 percent.
Mr. Hatfield of the Woodland Heights church summed up voters' sentiment this way: "I do wish the gambling forces would get the message: take your efforts somewhere else. We don't want it here."

HEADLINE: Typical Relief Check This Year Was Worth Half That of 1970

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Cash welfare benefits in the typical state have lost half their purchasing power in the last quarter-century, a Congressional committee reported today.
The report, by the House Ways and Means Committee, shows that the states as a whole have not increased the benefits nearly enough to keep up with inflation. 
 The data appear in the committee's 1996 Green Book, a compendium of facts and figures on welfare, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal programs.
They reflect payments during the period 1970-96, when, under the old Federal welfare law, states had wide discretion in setting the level of welfare benefits. Under the new law, enacted this summer, the states will have even greater authority, running their own welfare and work programs and setting benefits at any level they want.
The report shows that in January of this year, the maximum cash assistance payment for a family of three within the 48 contiguous states ranged from $120 a month in Mississippi to $703 in Suffolk County, N.Y.
In the median state, the maximum welfare payment for a three-person family was $389, up from $184 in 1970. But the purchasing power of this cash assistance, as reflected by adjustment for inflation, had declined by 51 percent since 1970, the Green Book says.
The decline was 43 percent in Connecticut, 59 percent in Illinois, 47 percent in Massachusetts and Michigan, 65 percent in New Jersey, 48 percent in New York City, 60 percent in Pennsylvania and 68 percent in Texas.
The report also makes these points:
*Legal immigrants who become citizens are less likely than native-born Americans to receive welfare, food stamps and Medicaid.
*Elderly people typically get back much more in Medicare benefits than they contribute in payroll taxes and premiums during their lifetimes. A man who retired in 1995, after working 30 years at the average wage, contributed $30,691 to Medicare but will typically get back benefits worth $80,442 after adjustment for inflation.
*Seventeen percent of the Federal budget is spent on "income-tested benefits" that provide medical assistance, welfare, food, housing and educational assistance to people of low or moderate income.
*Although Congress established the child-support enforcement program to help offset the costs of welfare, the Federal Government has lost money on it every year since 1979. Most states make a profit on it, though, spending less than they receive in payments from parents and from the Federal Government.
The study confirms that many people may lose assistance as a result of the new welfare law, which sets a five-year lifetime limit on payments to any family: although roughly half the families on welfare leave the rolls within one year, most of them return, the report says.
"In fact," it says, "of the 4.4 million families now on welfare, about 65 percent, or 2.9 million, will eventually be on welfare for eight years or more. Research also shows that despite the short welfare spells of some families, the average length of stay on welfare, counting repeat spells, for families enrolled at any given moment is 13 years."
The report also documents the growth of Medicare spending. After adjustment for inflation, Medicare spending per beneficiary grew by an average of 4.8 percent a year from 1990 to 1995. This included growth of just 2.5 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, in spending on hospitals and doctors. But it also included inflation-adjusted growth of 19.9 percent a year in spending on skilled nursing homes, and 28 percent a year on home health care and hospices.

HEADLINE: Shift in Zoning On Megastores Is Challenged

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed sweeping zoning changes that would allow huge warehouse-style stores to move into New York City's manufacturing areas, he called the changes a key component of his plans to revive the city's economy by adding jobs, raising new tax revenue and keeping consumers from spending money in the suburbs.
But yesterday, the proposal came before the City Council for its biggest test as Council members voiced community concerns that the zoning changes would prevent neighborhoods from having a say on where the stores should go and asserted that such "big box" stores would destroy the singular character of New York's many vibrant commercial strips. 
 In fact, the opposition has grown so strong in recent months that many Council members believe the Mayor's plan will have to be severely curtailed before it is finally approved. At the very least, in the first of two days of public hearings, they made clear that the proposal was headed for a tough fight when the Council votes on it in mid-December.
For hours yesterday, the debate revolved around whether the Council would lose some of its hard-won authority over land-use policy in the city and whether allowing the age of megastores to come into New York would ruin the city's tradition of neighborhood shopping. But also at issue was the question of whether the city should encourage megastores to locate in the five boroughs with a measure that allows no public input on where the stores will be situated, so long as they are in a manufacturing zone.
"There are several layers to this issue, starting with the future of manufacturing in this city, going to the viability of small businesses and to the role of consumers and residents," said Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Councilman who is one of the most outspoken critics of the Mayor's proposal.
"Then it boils down to a question of power," he continued. "And I'm not embarrassed to say that because that is the Council's role and that's what people in the community expect from us, to make sure that we, and consequently they, are not excluded from the process."
Mr. DiBrienza and many of his colleagues were expressing the concerns of neighborhood groups, particularly those that have fought to keep large stores like Pathmark or Home Depot out of their communities. They fear that the zoning changes would end their ability to challenge or stop a megastore from being built in their communities.
But Mr. Giuliani, in keeping with his general philosophy that business is overregulated in New York City, has said he believes that the public review process that requires community board and City Council approval is often tedious and has discouraged new development in the city.
After two and a half hours of intense questioning yesterday by Council members, Joseph B. Rose, the City Planning Commission chairman and the Giuliani administration's representative, said, "I understand now that we have a big job ahead of us."
The Planning Commission, which the Mayor largely controls, has approved the measure in an unusually close vote. Twenty-one community boards and the five borough boards had all recommended "no" votes.
Mr. Rose acknowledged that there was much opposition to the proposal, but he insisted that residents' concerns about being shut out were unfounded and said the changes provided a more uniform policy that actually protected neighborhoods across the city.
"This is an extremely narrowly drawn, well-planned and carefully considered proposal, and it has been misrepresented," he said. "Our retail economy is dying on the vine, but there are professional store stoppers who have made a cottage industry of stopping retail development in New York City, and the city simply can't afford it anymore."
Current zoning regulations, which were adopted in 1974 in an unsuccessful attempt to keep industries and lure new ones into manufacturing areas, prohibit large stores like 24-hour supermarkets and discount retailers from opening in industrial zones. But sprawling hardware stores like Home Depot and toy stores like Toys "R" Us are permitted, because they did not exist when the law was written and therefore were not explicitly prohibited.
The Mayor's proposal would repeal the restrictions and allow as many as 57 new superstores of any kind to open throughout the city on wide streets in areas zoned for light or medium manufacturing. The stores could be as large as 200,000 square feet, a little more than the size of four football fields, and they would be "as of right," which means that no public hearing process would be required and neighborhood views on where the stores go would not be solicited.
Throughout the daylong hearing, City Council members heard from small business owners who fear the superstores would destroy them and from borough presidents who voiced concerns about the loss of community input.
But some community leaders contended that minority areas desperately needed larger supermarkets that provided lower prices and better variety. And for a short time, about 100 construction workers filled the balcony of the Council chamber while 100 of their colleagues waited on the steps of City Hall, but they all left before their union representatives testified about how the construction industry would benefit from the development of new superstores.
Walter L. McCaffrey, chairman of the Council's Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises, which organized the hearing, pointed to Chicago as a big city that has found a way to accommodate large stores without harming smaller retail or manufacturing businesses.
Donna M. Ducharme, a consultant and a deputy commissioner of Chicago's Planning and Development Department until last month, said Chicago had created "planned manufacturing districts" where viable industrial businesses are protected from other development, but buffer zones have been created around those areas where superstores are allowed.
"We agree with the assumption that there is an excess of manufacturing," Mr. McCaffrey said. "But the as-of-right approach prevents the community not just from being heard but from being felt, and the administration to date has not addressed that problem."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "OVERVIEW: Plan for Superstores"
A proposal to change zoning rules, which was approved by the New York City Planning Commission in October, came before City Council yesterday for the first of two day of public hearings. The proposal would allow as many as 57 new superstores to locate the city's manufacturing zones without going through the current arduous approval process.
 
EXISTING RULES
 
Current zoning restricts supermarkets, clothing and department stores larger than 10,000 square feet from opening in industrial areas. The stores that are exempt from the existing restriction include harware stores like Home Depot, toy stores like Toys R Us, and drugstores like Walgreen's.
 
Stores larger that 10,000 square feet can apply for zoning variances through community boards, the Planning Commission and the City Council. But that process can take up to three years.
 
PROPOSED RULES
 
The change would allow any kind of superstore as large as 200,000 square feet to open on wide streets in areas zoned for light or medium manufacturing, without a lengthy review process that includes community and City Council approval.
 
The changes would allow as many as 57 new superstores: 21 in Queens, 17 in Brooklyn, 8 in the Bronx, 6 in Staten Island and 5 in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THE American wine drinker's love affair with chardonnay continues to be as passionate as ever. Red wines have gained in popularity in recent years, with merlot and zinfandel now sharing the spotlight with cabernet sauvignon. Among white varieties, however, chardonnay has no serious competition.
California, the country's principal source of wine grapes, had 73,000 acres of chardonnay vines last year, according to Wines and Vines, a trade publication, compared with 11,000 acres of sauvignon blanc, the second most popular white variety. There were 44,000 acres of zinfandel vines in the state, 38,000 acres of cabernet sauvignon and 25,000 acres of merlot. 
 Chardonnay has become equally important on the world scene. So important, in fact, that many European wine makers are abandoning or modifying their traditional commitment to place names, like Macon and the Languedoc, and emphasizing that the wine in the bottle is made from the chardonnay grape.
With white wine so popular, one might expect to find an overwhelming supply of really fine white wines in the marketplace. There are plenty of them, but an appalling number of poor ones, too. Featuring the grape varietal name so prominently leads many consumers to believe that one wine, in this case chardonnay, is much the same as any other. Not so.
A cheap chardonnay from the south of France has almost nothing in common with a great white Burgundy, which also happens to be made from chardonnay. For that matter, it has little in common with an inexpensive chardonnay from California. Or one from Australia. Or from South Africa or Italy.
Indeed, the undue emphasis on the name chardonnay has led to plantings of the grape in relatively unsuitable places like the Pfalz region of Germany and in various parts of Italy. Chardonnays from Eastern Europe, which show up on these shores from time to time, are mostly worthless.
Adding to the confusion is the number of wineries in the United States pumping out chardonnay: some 700 in California, and a hundred or so each in Oregon and Washington. Include New York, New Mexico, Virginia and a dozen other states, and it adds up to quite a bit of chardonnay.
What's more, chardonnay seems to defy the basic laws of economics. Even though there is so much of it available, prices have risen rapidly in the last two or three years. That might be acceptable if quality improved at the same pace. It hasn't. In many instances, it's difficult, if not impossible, to tell a $30 California chardonnay from a $12 one. Often, wines selling for less than $10 are much better buys than wines selling for two or three times as much.
There has been -- and continues to be -- a serious shortage of good grapes, both red and white, in California. Phylloxera and other diseases have ravaged some of the best vineyards in the last six or seven years, and new plantings are not yet productive. At the same time, there has been a surge of interest in fine wines.
I must confess to what for want of a better phrase I'll call a longstanding disappointment with many West Coast chardonnays. I find them too heavy, too fruity and far too oaky. The oak flavor is supposed to be a subtle component in a good wine, the result of its having aged in an oak barrel. In many California wines, oak is the dominant flavor. This is particularly true with many inexpensive chardonnays that have not been allowed to age and have almost certainly been forced through oak chips or subjected to some other artificial process.
To dissociate themselves from the spirits industry, American wine makers vigorously promote their product as a beverage to drink with food. In fact, many chardonnays are difficult to match with food, particularly the lighter foods that traditionally are paired with white wine. Oaky chardonnay overwhelms most of these dishes.
It is not surprising that chardonnay is a popular sipping wine; often it's better as an aperitif than as a table wine. Nor is it surprising that, in comparisons, California chardonnays are frequently preferred to a Burgundy or Macon wine from France in the same price range. The French wine seems sharper and thinner, but will probably do better with fish or chicken than an American chardonnay.
Given these cavils, here are six chardonnays in the $10 to $12 range that will grace any holiday table:
EDNA VALLEY CHARDONNAY 1994 From California's south central coast, this wine has long been an example of moderation; the oak has never masked the attractive flavors of the chardonnay grape.
ESTANCIA CHARDONNAY This is a separate venture by the people who run Franciscan Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Estancia chardonnay comes from extensive vineyards in Monterey County.
LOUIS JADOT MACON VILLAGES 1995 Macon is a vast area between Burgundy and Beaujolais that is devoted almost entirely to white wine, all of it made from chardonnay grapes. Jadot is a Burgundy shipper with impeccable credentials when it comes to making attractive white wine.
GEORGES DUBOEUF BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1995 White Beaujolais comes from the northernmost vineyards of Beaujolais, next door to the Macon region. Only an expert could tell the difference between the two.
GALLO SONOMA CHARDONNAY 1994 Gallo, based in Modesto, Calif., out in the hot San Joaquin Valley, owns hundreds of acres of the best vineyard land in Sonoma County. Its Sonoma wines, including this chardonnay, are extremely well made.
KENDALL-JACKSON VINTNERS RESERVE CHARDONNAY One of America's favorites. A touch of added sweetness seems to be the not-so-secret ingredient that has made this the catnip of California chardonnays.
 
TASTINGS
Vichon Winery Zyrah 1993, Napa Valley. About $12.
 
From the folks who brought you Chevrier, later Chevrignon, comes this latest flight of fancy, a combination of the names zinfandel and syrah, but actually a sort of varietal catchall. Those two grapes are there, but so are bits of grenache, mourvedre, cinsault, merlot and cabernet sauvignon. The name is pronounced ZEER-ah. Soon after Vichon Winery went into business in 1980, it made a big hit with Chevrier, a blend of sauvignon blanc and semillon. But not big enough. In 1985, when Vichon was nearing insolvency, the Robert Mondavi Winery, next door, took it over. First, Chevrier became Chevrignon; then some excellent cabernets appeared, and now there is Zyrah. The fad for Rhone-style wines seems to have abated in California, but this full-bodied one is definitely worth trying. After all, there can be 13 different grapes in Chateauneuf-du-Pape. This one's got only seven.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Isn't Missing Data on Digital TV

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 16 editorial "Go Slow on Digital TV" did a good job of summarizing the issues before the Federal Communications Commission as it considers finalizing its tentative decision to adopt a new standard for digital television broadcasts. However, the statement that the F.C.C. "does not have the facts at hand to resolve the issues of innovation, cost and market access" is inaccurate, and your conclusion that the commission should go slow and appoint "an independent panel of experts to resolve key technical issues" is misguided. 
 The issues you highlight are not new. They were thoroughly investigated and debated during an eight-year process in which world-leading technology was developed and tested under the direction of the F.C.C. Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service, which was appointed by the commission to arrive at a recommended standard. With the assistance of the Advanced Television Systems Committee, of which I am chairman, the advisory committee achieved a broad consensus and recommended a standard to the commission without objection in November 1995.
During the last year the commission itself has developed an extensive record that demonstrates that the proposed standard far exceeds its requirements and is the most interoperable, computer-friendly television system on the planet.
Yet, almost a year after the advisory committee delivered this breakthrough around a stunning technological achievement, the F.C.C. has still not acted. The sad paradox is that while unfounded concerns over computer interoperability have been permitted to delay adoption of a standard, a far less computer-interoperable standard -- begun in Europe three years after the technology was invented here in the United States -- is sweeping the world, and has even been adopted for two American direct-broadcast satellite services, stealing the economic benefits that should be accruing to American workers and the American economy.
Three of the four F.C.C. members understand this and are working to bring the matter to a final vote at the December meeting. The commission has all the relevant facts at hand, and it's high time that it follow through on its oft-repeated commitment to adopt a standard. Further delays would be unconscionable.

HEADLINE: Some Routine Lab Tests May Be Unnecessary

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
THE little plastic specimen cup and the blood vials with the brightly colored caps have long been essential elements of that time-honored ritual, the medical checkup. But judging from recent research, the cups and vials, and the tests they represent, may be about as useful as the unclosable gowns that complete the examining-room experience.
A team of doctors from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has reported that four common sets of laboratory tests -- urinalysis, complete blood count, thyroid studies and the chemistry panel that measures various blood components -- were of little value in routine checkups of apparently healthy people. 
 "The chance of those tests actually finding something is very small," said Dr. Marc Silverstein, who directed the study, which was published recently in The American Journal of Medicine. Dr. Silverstein, who recently left the Mayo Clinic to become director of the Center for Health Care Research at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, emphasized that his findings applied only to people having routine physicals, not those with illnesses that would lead doctors to order specific diagnostic tests.
An estimated $30 million worth of these routine tests are done each year, said Dr. Michael Bissell, a clinical pathologist who is chairman of the research advisory committee of the Clinical Laboratory Management Association.
Dr. Silverstein and his colleagues studied 531 patients, with an average age of 63, who visited the Mayo Clinic for checkups. The researchers looked at the "therapeutic yield" of the 1,508 laboratory tests ordered for those patients, that is, the percentage of the tests that revealed something that led to a change in treatment for the patients. Generally, the yield was low: 2.8 percent for the chemistry panel, and less than 1 percent each for thyroid, urinalysis and complete blood count.
Given those findings, Dr. Silverstein said, and today's pressures to economize, patients and their doctors might want at least to consider skipping some of the tests. He himself orders fewer tests than he did in the past. "I take more time to inform patients about what's recommended," he said.
Dr. Silverstein's findings came as no great surprise in medical circles. Before his study was published, similar recommendations about reducing tests during checkups had already been made by professional groups, including the American College of Physicians and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a unit formed by the Public Health Service.
Even so, Dr. Silverstein said, he did not expect his paper, or the professional groups' guidelines, to bring about quick changes in medical practice. "Patients expect lab tests," he said. And even when the tests do not show anything, patients may regard that as reassurance rather than money wasted.
Many doctors are in the habit of ordering tests partly to be thorough and partly to protect themselves from malpractice suits. "Physicians are very concerned about liability," Dr. Silverstein said. Although skipping the tests that he studied is unlikely to provoke a lawsuit, doctors may fear that if they are sued for something else, failure to test might be used as extra ammunition. "The general concern," Dr. Silverstein said, "is that since tests like these appear noninvasive and low cost, the courts will find they should or could have been done. But I think that since the expert panels have made their recommendations, physicians may need to worry less. They might have some defense."
Still, even at a progressive institution like the Mayo Clinic, where the department of medicine asked Dr. Silverstein to study laboratory tests, his findings have not changed the way things are done, and are not expected to in the future, a spokesman for the clinic said.
"It's the practice style at Mayo to order a lot of tests," Dr. Silverstein said. It is a point of pride there that the clinic has a longstanding and worldwide reputation as the place patients go when doctors at other hospitals cannot figure out what is wrong with them. "Patients expect tests and come here for this sort of thing," Dr. Silverstein said.
The tests themselves are harmless to patients, he said. "But the harm is that we're spending money that should be spent for other reasons," he said, citing more effective screening tests like those for breast, cervical and colon cancer, as well as the one laboratory test that his study did find useful: the lipid profile that can detect high blood cholesterol.
Dr. Silverstein's study did not include the commonly used test for prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., another common test that the task force has recommended against using routinely because of a high incidence of falsely positive results for prostate cancer.
The four tests that his study questioned cost about $165, not a great expense. "But in the aggregate they're substantial," Dr. Silverstein said.
Dr. Harold Sox, chairman of the department of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, and chairman of the Preventive Services Task Force that also recommended against some screening tests, said, "The medical literature is full of examples in which doctors haven't changed their test-ordering behavior very much despite the findings of an important study or the release of guidelines from a reputable expert panel."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Stronger Except Against Surging Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Widespread weakness in the German mark left the dollar mostly stronger in foreign exchange trading yesterday, but the dollar fell against the surging British pound.
Although there was no news to spur additional appetite for the pound, traders said its momentum over the last several days pushed it past important technical levels that incited more buying. 
 "For sterling, the news only gets better there every day," said Rob Sabia, a vice president of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "Right now, it's attracting the most interest."
Britain is the only major industrialized country where interest rates are clearly going up, which makes assets denominated in pounds worth more.
Traders also increasingly view the pound as an alternative to the uncertainties created by Europe's planned single currency in 1999. Britain is not expected to participate in that plan initially.
"People are looking at sterling as the better buy, compared to marks, the Swiss franc and the dollar," said Charles Cheesman, an assistant vice president at the New York branch of Bank Austria.
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.5053 marks from 1.5015 marks on Monday. The dollar fell to 111.40 yen from 111.48 yen. The pound rose to $1.6739 from $1.6662, the highest since October 1992.
The mark weakened partly as a result of the pound's strength, as well as the diminished effect of conflicting comments Monday from Ernst Welteke, a senior Bundesbank official. Mr. Welteke first said he saw no reason why the dollar should gain against the mark but later retracted that comment. Other senior officials of Germany's central bank have been saying they want to see a stronger dollar, which will aid German exporters by making mark-priced goods more competitive abroad.
Traders said the mark also weakened after President Jacques Chirac of France, during a visit to Japan, expressed confidence in Europe's single-currency plan and France's ability to meet its strict criteria.
Such news has tended to hurt the mark, which will be replaced as the dominant currency in Europe by the single currency, known as the Euro, once the plan takes effect.

HEADLINE: Debt and More Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I hope Russell Baker will allow me an addendum to his ruminations on our economically stratified society (column, Nov. 16). On the other side of the rainbow from the "rich, very rich and very, very rich," sand the in debt, the very in debt and the very-very-how-did-I-get-here in debt. 
 As someone who will accumulate approximately $400,000 worth of debt in my pursuit of higher education, I'd hate to be lumped with any poor slob who happens to have "maxed out" her credit cards to the tune of a paltry $5,000.
Instead, I have proudly joined the growing number of 20-somethings who will emerge, blinking, into the light with the equivalent of a house in Scarsdale tied to our bent backs. Happy holiday spending.

A Sony expansion adds to San Diego's reputation as a center of technological manufacturing.

BYLINE: By Kevin Brass 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
SONY ELECTRONICS INC. is adding a warehouse and distribution center the size of six football fields to its already substantial manufacturing complex in San Diego.
The 394,000-square-foot building will be part of the 95-acre Sony Technology Center in the community of Rancho Bernardo, in the northern inland section of San Diego, about 20 miles north of downtown. 
 In 25 years the San Diego operation has grown into Sony's largest industrial center in the United States, with more than one million square feet of industrial space and 2,500 employees. It is the home of Sony's United States operations for manufacturing televisions, computer display systems, wireless phones and optical storage products, including CD-ROM's.
In addition to the new warehouse and distribution center, construction began earlier this year on a 210,000-square-foot, three-story structure in Rancho Bernardo to house an engineering operation. Sony is also expanding plants in the Tijuana, Mexico, area, south of San Diego, that manufacture televisions and computer monitors.
"The San Diego area has the large labor pool for both manufacturing and engineering talent that we need," said Richard Clancy, vice president of corporate communications for Sony Electronics.
The proximity to Tijuana and the shipping port of Long Beach, Calif., were also factors in Sony's decision to expand in San Diego, Mr. Clancy said.
Other Asian consumer electronics giants -- Sanyo, Casio, Uniden, Matsushita and Samsung -- have large manufacturing and research centers in both San Diego and Tijuana. More than 11 million television sets are produced in the San Diego-Tijuana area each year.
The county also has the fourth- largest concentration of biotechnology companies in the country, according to a 1995 study by the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.
San Diego is "probably 20 years behind Silicon Valley but we're moving fast," said Barbara Bry, director of programs for Connect, a privately financed support agency formed by the University of California at San Diego and the local high-technology industries. The high-technology region known as Silicon Valley is south of San Francisco.
In addition to the Rancho Bernardo area, large high-technology industrial developments have grown in Otay Mesa; Sorrento Mesa, along the coast north of downtown San Diego, and in the city of Carlsbad, north of San Diego.
One attraction of the San Diego region is a legacy of the miscalculations of the last decade: the region was overbuilt, and prices for industrial space plummeted in the first part of the 1990's, according to real estate experts. "Many of the properties have been a bargain compared with other metropolitan areas," said Gary London, a real estate consultant.
As recently as 1994, the vacancy rate in industrial space was more than 10 percent, Mr. London said. Now it is closer to 6 percent. Consequently, land and lease prices are rising again.
High-technology industrial space is the "healthiest sector in the San Diego economy," Mr. London said.
In recent years the City of San Diego has had a program to help streamline the permit and fee process for large companies. Water and sewer hookup fees have been cut by 50 percent, according to Steven Weathers, vice president of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, a private nonprofit organization.
"That is having a huge impact," said Tim Hoag, vice president of John Burnham & Company-Oncor International, a real estate company.
One of the fastest-growing San Diego companies is Qualcomm Inc., which has developed a digital wireless phone technology. Qualcomm occupies more than two million square feet of space in San Diego.
In 1994, Sony joined with Qualcomm to form Qualcomm Personal Electronics, which designs and manufactures digital cellular phones. The phones using Qualcomm's technology are built in Sony's expanding San Diego complex.
Sony moved into San Diego in 1972, when it built the first television assembly plant established by a Japanese company in the United States.
For the new warehouse and distribution center, Sony is leasing the property from Mitsui Real Estate Sales and Tenant First Real Estate Services of San Diego. They are building the structure to Sony's specifications.
Mitsui and Tenant First used a similar arrangement earlier this year to build a 110,000-square-foot office and warehouse for the Matsushita Television Company in the Otay Mesa area, near the Mexican border. The building will house the North American and South American headquarters for Matsushita, which were previously in Chicago.
With large vacant industrial sites scarce, more companies are doing these "build to suit" industrial projects in San Diego, Mr. Hoag said.

HEADLINE: Opting for an Early Warning When E. Coli Is Suspected

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
IT was the day before Halloween and officials at the Seattle-King County Health Department had to make a decision quickly. Should they go public with their finding that there was a strong link between a recent outbreak of illnesses due to E. coli bacteria found in Odwalla apple juice, or wait for further proof? More than 700 illnesses and four deaths were reported three years earlier in the Northwest during an E. coli outbreak traced to hamburgers sold at a fast-food chain.
The evidence in this latest incident, though fairly strong, was not conclusive: 6 of the 10 people who had become ill said they drank an Odwalla product. Carl Osaki, the director of environmental health with the Seattle-King County agency, decided to make the announcement. 
 "We could have been wrong," Mr. Osaki said in a telephone interview last week. "We could have ruined a business, but the probability of our being wrong was about 10 percent."
There was another consideraton, Mr. Osaki added. "It was the day before Halloween," he said, "a time when a lot of apple juice and apple cider are consumed."
Odwalla Inc., a juice processor in Half Moon Bay, Calif., was notified of the impending announcement. The company voluntarily recalled all of its products made with unpasteurized apple juice as well as a few non-apple products that were processed on the same assembly lines as those that contained apple juice.
Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and other F.D.A. officials held a marathon telephone conference call with health officials from Seattle-King County, the State of Washington and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which lasted until 3:30 A.M. As many as 40 people were on the line at various times, discussing further action by the Food and Drug Administration, including nationwide notification of the recall.
The conferees unanimously agreed that Washington State had made the right decision despite the lack of one important piece of evidence, one that is traditionally required before any recall is instituted: the results of microbial testing that would have confirmed that the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria causing the outbreak had come from Odwalla's apple juice.
"One of the major decision points is whether you act on the basis of epidemiology only or do you wait for the microbial testing," Dr. Kessler said. Because Seattle-King County has an effective reporting system for E. coli in place, all of the health officials thought it was prudent to notify the public.
Washington State and Minnesota have the most sophisticated response systems to outbreaks associated with E. coli, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Seattle has a major children's hospital that carefully follows potential public health problems. In addition, scientists now have the ability to match the genetic fingerprints of the bacteria found in patients who contract an illness so they can identify the source. And Seattle-King County has adopted a set of non-leading questions to help elicit information about the possible sources of an illness. In the Odwalla case, for example, patients were not asked directly if they drank the company's apple juice: they provided the information unsolicited.
"Seattle gets an enormous amount of credit for having strong surveillance of E. coli in place," Dr. Kessler said.
The particular strain of E. coli in question can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome, the leading cause of kidney failure in children, which can lead to death in the most extreme cases. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and vomiting. Elderly people and children under 12 (especially those under 5) are particularly vulnerable.
The bacteria are usually found in the manure of animals like cows. Apples may become contaminated when they fall from trees or when someone with the bacteria comes in contact with the food. The pathogens can be eliminated by washing uncut apples thoroughly and boiling or pasteurizing apple juice.
No one has yet determined how the bacteria got into the apple juice, but subsequent inspections of the Odwalla plant by the Food and Drug Administration have not found any E. coli at the plant. But the agency did uncover some inadequacies in the plant's sanitation systems, though no conclusions were made about a relationship to the E. coli outbreak.
Odwalla products are sold in seven Western states and in British Columbia. A total of 64 cases have been reported since the first was confirmed on Oct. 10. There has been one death in Colorado.
"And now we are seeing secondary cases," Mr. Osaki said, describing people who have been infected by those who became sick from the apple juice.
"It could have been a much larger problem," he added. When the microbial testing was completed last weekend, E. coli was found in one of the recalled bottles of juice.
Today, scientists are trying to decide if pasteurizing apple juice products would eliminiate E. coli contamination and should therefore be required. At a news conference on Monday, Odwalla announced that it had stopped production of all fresh apple juice products until it had set up a better safety monitoring system. It recommended that other producers do the same.
"This is the kind of issue we have to confront increasingly because we are eating more and more uncooked produce and because of an increasing global economy," Dr. Kessler said. "There is also a difference of opinion about whether E. coli 0157:H7 is an emerging bacterium or whether the reporting system is better."
There have been at least three outbreaks since the 1993 Jack-in-the-Box episode, the most recent a serious incident in Japan this year.
"At the very least we need to have an early warning system in place," Dr. Kessler said.
 
Before You Sip Or Slice or Bite
PRECAUTIONS can be taken to lessen the chances of becoming ill from products contaminated with E. coli 0157:H7. Here are some of them:
* Always wash hands before handling food.
* Do not eat whole apples if the skin has been punctured. Scrub apples before eating them.
* Look for pasteurized apple juice (apple juice in refrigerated cases may be unpasteurized). If you are unsure, write to the manufacturer for information.
* Unpasteurized apple juice purchased in a store or at a roadside stand should be boiled for 30 seconds before drinking.
* Hamburgers should be cooked to an internal temperature of 155 degrees.
There is also much less chance of being infected by solid pieces of beef like steak, because the interior is sterile and the exterior is always cooked long enough to kill bacteria.

HEADLINE: The Fattening Of America

BYLINE: By DONNA ST. GEORGE 

 BODY:
THE next time you hear about a friend's low-fat diet, the next time you see a kitchen stocked with low-fat cookbooks and fat-free snacks, consider this: Three of the fastest-growing foods in America are hamburgers, french fries and chicken nuggets.
Several years after low-fat eating became a full-fledged national obsession, there are signs that many Americans may have had their fill of fatlessness. 
 For the fourth year in a row, America is not eating more better-for-you foods, even as new low-fat items show up daily on supermarket shelves, according to a survey published this week by the NPD Group in Rosemont, Ill., a marketing research company that has tracked eating habits for 16 years.
At the same time, America is big on restaurant junk food, feasting on almost eight million more orders of french fries, nearly six million more hamburgers and five million more servings of chicken nuggets in a two-week period this year than last, the survey found.
"You can tell me all you want about how you're concerned about health and you're eating healthy foods, but then who's eating all of these hamburgers?" said Harry Balzer, a vice president of the NPD Group.
In their 11th annual report, "Eating Patterns in America," Mr. Balzer and his researchers did their best to find out what Americans actually eat, rather than what they say they eat.
They did this by relying on meal-by-meal dairies, kept by 2,000 households and mailed in daily, to avoid regretful revisions. It turns out that, when it comes to talking about how they eat, Americans are prone to fib or forget. Diaries are not foolproof either, the researchers admit, but they come closer to depicting real life. "You wouldn't trust what they tell you, not when it comes to food," Mr. Balzer said. "They begin to make value judgments about what society would prefer, not how they behave."
Part of the reason eaters are secretive is they "want their fries, and they want to cut their fat, too," said Dr. Warren Belasco, a professor of American studies and a food historian at University of Maryland's Baltimore County campus. "I just see Americans with very contradictory tendencies," he added. "We feel guilty. We worry about it. But we still go on eating what we eat."
Instead of giving up chocolate-chip cookies for nutritious fruit and grains, for example, many people opt for popular low-fat brands like Snackwell -- and imagine that they are health-conscious.
And often one or two low-fat cookies are not enough. "What they don't tell you is that they eat the whole box instead of three or four cookies," Mr. Balzer said.
The new survey found that 86 percent of Americans consume at least one low-fat or no-fat food every two weeks. Over all, 31 percent of the American diet is better-for-you foods. But for four years, that percentage has not budged. "It's hit a plateau," Mr. Balzer said. "There still is a health trend, but it's not going to be low fat anymore."
In supermarket aisles there are also signs of a low-fat lag, based on a sampling of sales figures from Information Resources, a Chicago company that tracks supermarket sales. For example, sales of Snackwell cookies and crackers soared from 1992 to 1995, then dropped 20 percent from 1995 to 1996. Over all, sales are flat for low-fat frozen dinners and Healthy Choice frozen desserts, according to Information Resources.
Snackwell officials said that, with a greatly expanding product line, the company's annual sales have jumped $200 million in spite of the plunge in cookie and cracker sales.
At the same time takeout restaurants are doing a booming business, surpassing table-service restaurants for the first time. In a decade, takeout food has jumped from a 35 percent share of the nation's restaurant business to more than 50 percent.
More and more, people are wolfing down fast food in their cars, in a kind of pit-stop dining, food as fuel. That may help to explain the top five fastest-growing restaurant foods and beverages: soft drinks, tap water, french fries, hamburgers and chicken nuggets.
"You want a dangerous health trend?" Mr. Balzer said. "The one that will kill you is driving down the road eating and talking on your phone, trying to avoid hitting the construction workers."
That people are confessing to such french-fried habits may suggest less embarrassment, more of a collective shrug, about unhealthy eating. "It may be a backlash against nutritional correctness, like the backlash against political correctness," said Dr. Belasco, the food historian.
The survey comes in a year when McDonald's gave up on its low-fat hamburger, the McLean Deluxe; when obesity rates are rising and when a newly popular book, "Eat Fat" by Richard Klein (Pantheon, $24), talks up the virtues of fat.
But other trends may give more comfort to nutritionists. While takeout food is on the rise, for instance, American families eat dinner together five nights a week, the NPD survey found.
To Bonnie Liebman, the director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, where healthful eating is a daily crusade, most of the survey results are a bit disappointing. Referring to hamburgers, fries and chicken nuggets, she said, "If you had to make a list of the worst foods to eat, they are way up there."
But Ms. Liebman contends that the low-fat movement has had a lasting effect. "Some people have cut down on fat," she said. "It's a big country."
Other experts question whether fat is really on the way out of the American mind. Dr. Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University, said that the most health-conscious Americans tend to be highly educated, well-to-do city dwellers. "Everybody I know is still concerned about fat," she said.
Mr. Balzer argued that age, not economic status, was the greatest determining factor in healthy eating: older people watch their diets more than younger people.
He also maintained that old habits were hard to break and that better-for-you food allowed many Americans to avoid the painful task of giving up old favorites. These are the days, after all, of lower-fat Twinkies, pork sausage and chocolate cake. Never mind all the empty calories. "Manufacturers have given us the perfect way to keep eating what we like and feel healthy," he said.
Mr. Balzer understands the penchant for self-deception. A pushover for oatmeal-raisin cookies himself, he tells people: "I'm big into grains." As he explained it: "There's flour in there. Flour's a grain."

HEADLINE: The Pope's Visit to Cuba

 BODY:
Like Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to the Vatican in 1989, Fidel Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II yesterday was infused with political as well as religious meaning. The Polish Pope, who helped accelerate the collapse of European Communism, agreed to visit Cuba, a largely Roman Catholic island that is one of the last redoubts of Marxist rule. The Catholic-educated Mr. Castro, in power nearly 37 years, had never before met with a pope.
The Pontiff and the Cuban dictator are experienced and determined fighters for opposing causes. Yet each now sees possible gains from a papal visit, despite obvious risks for both men. If all goes well, the biggest winners could be the Cuban people. 
 The Pope would like to extend his career-long crusade for human rights and democracy to yet another Communist land. He is insisting on the same ground rules in Cuba he has negotiated for all of his travels, including the freedom to go anywhere and meet with whomever he chooses. Institutionally, he would like to open up more space for an officially constrained Roman Catholic Church and its unofficially persecuted believers.
When Fidel Castro seized power, he shut down hundreds of Catholic schools and expelled hundreds of priests. Today Catholicism can be freely practiced in Cuba, but its public role is largely confined to church premises. The Pope will probably seek greater church access to the news media and an end to unofficial discrimination against practicing Catholics in public and professional life.
In Communist Cuba as in Communist Poland, the church represents the only major social institution not controlled by the Government. Looking to the future, the Pope will try to give the church a wider role in whatever political transition takes place after Mr. Castro leaves the scene.
For Mr. Castro, a papal visit can give broader legitimacy to his regime. He may especially hope to take advantage of the Vatican's opposition to all forms of economic sanctions to maximize Washington's isolation over the reckless Helms-Burton law, which provides for the punishment not only of Americans but of foreigners who do business with Cuba.
The Pope's plans to preach the gospel of freedom on Cuban soil ought to point the way to a wiser American policy, one that recognizes the reality of Mr. Castro's present power but seeks to influence the future by directly engaging the Cuban people, rather than trying to coerce an unwilling world into shunning them.

Treasury Prices Show An Advance

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices advanced yesterday for the first time in three sessions after a surprise slump in home building buoyed expectations for a slowing economy and restrained inflation.
"Housing was the one thing in the economy that wasn't slowing," said David Hoffman, who manages $300 million of bonds at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del. Bond investors "have one more piece of evidence that there's very little in the way of inflation pressure," he said. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32, to 100 25/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.43 percent, from 6.46 percent on Monday. The price of the two-year note also rose, driving its yield down to 5.65 percent from 5.67 percent.
Bond prices started to rally after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 5.1 percent in October, the slowest rate in a year. The market had been expecting an increase for the month, following a decrease of 6.1 percent in September. In addition, building permits fell 2.7 percent in October.
The data pointed to continued moderate growth for the economy and a steady interest policy from the Federal Reserve as a result.
Such expectations were confirmed by private reports yesterday that showed a slump in retail sales as the crucial holiday shopping season approaches. LJR Redbook Research said sales fell 2 percent in the week ended Saturday. Sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent in the week, according to the Mitsubishi Bank-Schroder Wertheim index.
The rally in bonds, however, did little to spur demand at the Treasury's sale of $18.255 billion of two-year notes. In a sign of less than stellar demand, the bid-to-cover was 2.11, less than the 2.39 average at the previous 10 sales. The bid-to-cover ratio is the number of bids compared with the total amount of securities sold. The new two-year notes also sold at a yield of 5.662 percent, more than the 5.657 percent that traders expected before the sale.
Investors are already "somewhat tapped out" after buying enough securities to drive yields to the lowest since early March, said Mark Sauvigne, a trader at Chase Securities. "When you asked a lot of people it seemed like not a lot had interest."
What's more, some traders may need to sell securities to make way for the $12.5 billion of five-year notes the Treasury is selling today, he said.
Some bond managers are betting the rally will fizzle. "We're not in a recession, and I think we're going to have to start to see a recession to justify some of these yields," said John Burgess, who helps manage $70 billion of bonds at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management in New York.
In the corporate bond market yesterday, the First Security Corporation, the Arizona Public Service Company and CIT Group Holdings Inc. sold a total of $350 million of debt amid continued strong demand for bonds which pay more than Treasuries.
First Security, a bank holding company based in Salt Lake City, sold $150 million of 10-year notes yielding 6.9 percent, or 75 basis points more than the comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In other trading, Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, raised $500 million in a sale of three-year global bonds which were sold to investors around the world.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of two-year notes yesterday:

HEADLINE: U.S. Readies $100 Million Erie Canal Plan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
The Federal Government is on the verge of announcing a $100 million revitalization of the waterfronts along the Erie Canal and its connecting waterways, a plan aimed at increasing tourism in a region that has been hurt by a sharp loss of jobs.
The plan has several features that are similar to one announced 16 months ago by the New York State Thruway Authority, which operates the 524-mile system of canals. 
 But that plan stalled in a dispute between Gov. George E. Pataki and the authority's chairman at that time, Peter Tufo, who refused to surrender his job despite being a Democrat in a Republican administration.
Now the idea of rebuilding the waterfront along the canal system has been revived by Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The new plan was to have been announced today at a news conference where Mr. Cuomo was to appear in Syracuse and Albany with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. But the announcement was postponed because some financing and other issues had not been resolved.
The effort to mount a new canal plan has been the subject of intense and often contradictory political speculation. Mr. Cuomo has been mentioned in political circles as a possible candidate for Mr. D'Amato's seat. He has also been mentioned as a candidate for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a job that would require confirmation by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which Mr. D'Amato heads.
Thus there was a tangle of theories, many of them conflicting, about what Mr. Cuomo's motives might be in pushing ahead with the canal revitalization plan.
Mr. Cuomo declined to discuss details of the new plan yesterday. But he said that loans and grants totaling "in the range of $100 million" would be made available to scores of cities and towns bordering the canal to create shops, canal landings, parks, housing and improved streetscapes.
The aim would be to transform the historic but commercially moribund canal into a magnet for American and foreign travelers and for economic development benefiting the canal's municipalities. Cities and towns like Buffalo, Rochester and Fulton have been losing manufacturing jobs for years, and a revitalized canal would provide a way to animate their economies, he said.
"Where is their economic future?" he said in a rhetorical manner reminiscent of his father. "Bingo. What you come up with is the barge canal as an asset unique to New York. What can you do with the barge canal? You use it to generate economic development projects as well as regional approaches that would use the entire breadth of the canal, creating jobs, revenues, a tax base."
Mr. D'Amato, who is familiar with the canal from his days as a student at Syracuse University, predicted that each Government dollar would invite $4 of private investment, giving the canal project the potential to yield more than $400 million in investment. He called the HUD plan a "fait accompli."
A 10-page draft outlining the HUD plan, called "The Canal Corridor Initiative," that has been distributed to local officials said that as much as $120 million would be made available. Of that amount, $60 million would be in grants to small cities and towns and the rest in loans to large cities like Syracuse. The localities could compete for the money by filing development proposals.
The mule-drawn barges of the Erie Canal opened the Midwest to commerce from the Northeast and the Atlantic 170 years ago. The canal survived competition from the railroads, but the building of superhighways and the St. Lawrence Seaway rendered it obsolete.
In July 1995, Mr. Tufo, as head of the Thruway Authority, disclosed plans to spend $146 million over 15 years to spruce up the waterfronts of seven cities and towns on the canal. The money would have come from government and private financing as well as Thruway tolls.
The chief aim of his plan was to capitalize on the canal as a recreational asset for boating, biking and hiking, as well as for tourism.
But his announcement annoyed Governor Pataki and his aides. They were already seething that Mr. Tufo did not promptly surrender his post as Thruway chairman. They saw his Erie plan as an additional sortie to garner publicity in his long-range ambitions to take over the Governor's job. They also thought it was imprudent to be discussing spending state money on what Mr. Tufo called a "recreationway" at a time when the state was facing huge deficits.
When Mr. Tufo departed in January, a reconstituted authority soft-pedaled the Erie Canal plan, and in July a new five-year canal plan was announced that Mr. Tufo criticized for restricting Thruway funds to a bare-bones minimum.
The effort to revive the canal survived because the bordering towns and cities want some comprehensive plan that would draw travelers and boaters to take pleasure trips on the canal, which winds through the pleasant scenery of western New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley and up to the Adirondacks. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has long had a fascination with the history of the canal, and Mr. D'Amato were brought in, and a new plan was worked out to use HUD money.

Belle Signs the Richest Deal: 5 Years, $55 Million

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
The Chicago White Sox made Albert Belle the highest-paid player in baseball yesterday, signing the free-agent slugger to a five-year contract worth a guaranteed $55 million that made the City of Big Shoulders look more than ever like the City of Big Bucks.
The confluence of Belle's impressive numbers and the revenues enjoyed by a large-market club allowed Belle to shoot past the likes of Ken Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds and his new teammate, Frank Thomas, becoming the first baseball player to surpass $10 million a year. 
 That staggering amount could grow because the contract not only has an option for a sixth year with a guaranteed $5 million buyout, but also has a promise that Belle will be among the top three salaried players for the life of the deal. But, as Thomas, a two-time most valuable player, said: "Albert has set himself apart from the rest of the players the past couple of years. He should be the highest-paid player in the game."
The White Sox owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, now has the highest-paid players in two team sports. Reinsdorf, also the owner of the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls, is paying Michael Jordan $30.14 million this season.
Reinsdorf flexed economic muscles that few baseball teams can, despite his call for fiscal restraint on salaries and his successful challenge of a proposed agreement with the players' union that would have placed a luxury tax on the teams with the highest payrolls.
"We're not being fiscally irresponsible because we can afford it," said Reinsdorf, whose actions drew immediate criticism yesterday from John Hart, the general manager of the Cleveland Indians. "But it does bother me that there are only a few teams that can afford to do this. That means the game is not healthy. I want the people in Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Milwaukee and all the other small towns to have a chance to compete. I want competitive balance."
Reinsdorf cited a need to win back fans, having seen home attendance fall from 2.9 million in 1991 to 1.6 million last year, when the White Sox were in contention with the Indians.
Belle, who has hit 98 home runs and driven in 274 runs over the last two years for the Indians, said he wasn't looking only at the money.
"It wasn't about the most money," the 30-year-old Belle said at a news conference at Comiskey Park yesterday. "I'm sure I could have shopped around and got more money. But you have to look at the personnel and the organization. I was very excited about being a part of the lineup. I hope I make the organization better."
Arn Tellem, the agent for the outfielder who has been at the center of several controversial incidents, looked to intangibles, not the least of which was the accommodating embrace Chicago is noted for giving the famous and sometimes infamous.
"The money is a factor, but if he left Cleveland, of the teams that expressed interest, this is where he wanted to be; this was the best place for him to make a fresh start," said Tellem, who negotiated a deal in which Belle will earn $1.5 million more than Griffey next season and nearly $3 million more than what Bonds and Thomas will make in 1997.
First, Chicago could offer what other suitors -- including Cleveland and the Florida Marlins -- could not: Thomas, who is Belle's good friend and a player of equal offensive wallop. Tellem said Belle "often thought that they could do what Jordan and Pippen have done for the Bulls for Chicago and have that same impact."
Then there was the comfort of staying in the American League, but also the comfort of the city itself.
"Chicago is a city with big shoulders and it has embraced a lot of star athletes, specifically Dennis Rodman," Tellem said of the Bulls' forward known for his tattoos, hair colors and cross-dressing.
"Dennis came from the Bulls' most hated enemy -- the Pistons -- and the city has had a love affair with Rodman," Tellem said. "For Albert, that was something that definitely went through his mind, hoping that if he did well and performed that the fans would embrace him here."
Belle, like Rodman, has had his image troubles, including run-ins with fans and the news media, and he has been heavily fined and suspended. After he hit a photographer with a baseball last season, he was ordered by the American League to undergo counseling.
Reinsdorf, who made the Rodman lovefest in Chicago possible, has enjoyed a close relationship over the years with Tellem.
"And I think when Jerry met Albert, the two of them felt very comfortable with each other," Tellem said. "And Jerry stressed to Albert that he's had a lot of experience dealing with stars, not just in baseball, but in basketball, and that he would go to the end of the world to help protect him."
As Reinsdorf said, "The people of Chicago have shown in the case of the fellow with the pink hair that if you are playing for us, and you are playing your heart out, we're going to embrace you."
Thus the coming-out of baseball's most reclusive superstar, who sounded like a man ready for a new beginning as he met the news media just three days after Cleveland took its last offer from the table and just four days after the bidding for free agents began.
Thomas, Chicago's All-Star first baseman, was also at the news conference. He expressed excitement over the possibilities as he, Belle and Robin Ventura brace to become arguably the game's most powerful 3-4-5 hitters in the lineup.
The Indians got back in the pennant-winning business for the first time since the 1950's thanks in good part to Belle, whom they drafted in 1987. Belle became the Indians' career home run hitter (242), and last season he led the league with 148 runs batted in, the second-highest total in Indians history and the most by an American Leaguer since Ted Williams and Vern Stephens had 159 in 1949.
Belle batted .311 last season and his power numbers brought him a third-place spot in the voting for m.v.p., his second straight near miss. Yet on Saturday, the Indians withdrew a five-year contract offer of about $40 million, essentially severing the relationship with the player who helped them win a pennant in 1995 and the A.L. Central last season.
"I don't consider that I'm abandoning Cleveland," said Belle, a career .295 hitter with 751 r.b.i. in eight seasons. "I'm very happy that the fans of Cleveland stuck by me during some tough times. But things didn't work out."

HEADLINE: Zoning Battle Is Early Issue For Campaign

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Stepping up the political battle over superstores, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is running radio commercials to promote his plan to allow the stores in some areas. And yesterday, he harshly attacked Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a probable mayoral candidate, who is running ads against the plan.
The Mayor accused Ms. Messinger of cheating on campaign finance rules by spending taxpayer money on her ads, which he suggested were intended to promote her mayoral effort. Mr. Giuliani's commercials will be paid for with about $70,000 raised by a private group organized by the Mayor, which calls itself the Committee for Consumer Choice. 
 Ms. Messinger demanded yesterday that the Mayor disclose where the committee was getting its money and suggested that he "needs a Valium." Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, would not provide names of contributors yesterday, but said most of the money would probably come from retailers and developers.
Neither Mr. Giuliani nor Ms. Messinger has formally announced plans to run for mayor next year, but their intentions have become increasingly clear in recent weeks. In Ms. Messinger's commercial, which she is paying for with money from the Borough President's budget, she attacks Mr. Giuliani as much as his proposal.
The Mayor's commercial, which started running on Monday night, represents the first time Mr. Giuliani has used paid advertisements to try to sell one of his initiatives to the public. The ads indicate how seriously Mr. Giuliani has taken the possibility that the City Council could sharply scale back or even defeat his plan.
Yesterday, the City Council held its second day of hearings on the Mayor's plan, which Council members have said is headed for a fierce battle when the Council votes on it next month. The zoning changes would allow as many as 57 new superstores on wide streets throughout the city in areas zoned for light or medium manufacturing.
Council members said yesterday that the paid ad campaigns sponsored by the Mayor and Ms. Messinger would have no impact on their decision-making process.
"I don't think either of these ads have anything to do with megastores because they have everything to do with the 1997 mayoral campaign," said Walter L. McCaffrey, the chairman of the Council's Subcommittee on Franchising and Zoning.
The Mayor's commercial praises the plan as a way to bring "larger, modern supermarkets and discount stores" into "poor and minority neighborhoods." It criticizes "politicians and special interests" who are trying to keep the stores out of the city.
"This is an important public policy issue," Ms. Messinger said yesterday, "and I welcome the Mayor to the airwaves. He wants the public to hear his side, like I want the public to hear my side. Fine."
Her commercial tries to exploit growing concern that the Mayor's zoning proposal would cut citizens out of the process because superstores would be allowed in certain industrial areas "as of right," or without community review on where the stores would go. "Apparently, Rudy Giuliani doesn't care what you think," Ms. Messinger says in the commercial.
The Mayor condemned Ms. Messinger's commercial yesterday as a tactic typical of "old-fashioned politicians" and said she was improperly using public money to pay for a political ad.
"Before she's even started running, she's cheating," the Mayor asserted, adding, "She shouldn't be allowed to get away with it."
The Mayor said Ms. Messinger's radio ads were the latest in a history of abusing the city's campaign finance law, accusing her specifically of cheating in her 1989 and 1993 campaigns for borough president. But when asked to substantiate the allegations, the Mayor's aides were unable to document any particular improprieties.
Administration officials, though, cited a complaint filed by the Giuliani campaign in 1993 -- one of many filed by various candidates against each other -- that Ms. Messinger had improperly contributed to the campaign of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The complaint was withdrawn by the Giuliani campaign after the election, and no determination was ever made by the Campaign Finance Board that Ms. Messinger had acted improperly.
The agency found her to be in "substantial compliance" with the campaign finance law in 1993, the same determination made about the Giuliani campaign.
Also yesterday, Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican representing the East Side, filed a complaint about Ms. Messinger's radio ads with the city's Conflicts of Interest Board. The complaint accuses Ms. Messinger of using $7,400 in public money for personal political purposes by denigrating the Mayor and furthering her own candidacy for mayor.
Ms. Messinger defended her financing of the ads, saying that using money from her Borough President's budget was appropriate because planning issues are part of her responsibilities.
Giuliani administration officials have also said Ms. Messinger's commercial, and contentions by other opponents of the proposal, have been dishonest and irresponsible.
"After a while," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, "we get tired of all the kind of lying that's going on about this, so we're putting on an ad that lays out the absolute truth about this proposal."
The Mayor's commercial suggests that his plan would increase competition in the city and would specifically bring more shopping choices to the city's poor.
"It's us who put up with the stale produce, sour milk and clothing we can't afford, while wealthy areas have better prices and all kinds of shopping choices," the announcer says on the ad. "Don't let the special interests stop us from getting lower prices and better quality."

HEADLINE: Careers Are Among the Casualties Of C.I.A.'s Latest Security Breach

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The careers of the bright new graduates of the Central Intelligence Agency's school for spies are blighted: the F.B.I. fears that the class lists and curriculum are sitting in a Russian safe.
The identities of American businessmen in Moscow who volunteer intelligence secrets to the C.I.A. have probably been exposed. The agency's operations in Moscow, Tokyo, Manila and Malaysia have been compromised. And the reputation of the nation's clandestine service has taken another crushing blow. 
 That, for starters, is the damage believed to have been done by Harold J. Nicholson, the C.I.A. officer arrested on Saturday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged with selling secrets to Moscow, intelligence and law-enforcement officials said today.
Though it will take months to complete a definitive damage assessment, "we have a pretty good idea of what he had access to and what he could have had access to," a senior law-enforcement official said. The officials assigned to figure out exactly which secrets Mr. Nicholson sold to Moscow must assume the worst. And the worst is very, very bad.
Officials suspect that Mr. Nicholson sold his Russian contacts the names of every student who prepared for undercover assignments overseas at the C.I.A.'s training school in 1994, 1995 and the first half of 1996.
The school, Camp Peary, is a secret 9,275-acre base near Williamsburg, Va., known informally as "The Farm." It provides a yearlong graduate seminar in espionage.
Mr. Nicholson taught a 16-week course in tricks of the trade like stealing mail, using disguises, evading pursuers and handling agents. He is suspected of telling the Russians everything about Camp Peary's core curriculum.
Mr. Nicholson read the biographies and the future assignments for every officer trained at Camp Peary during his two-year tenure there, the F.B.I. says in an affidavit that was unsealed on Monday. The C.I.A. has to assume that since Mr. Nicholson knew every student, the Russians do, too, intelligence and law-enforcement officials said.
That knowledge damages the immediate prospects of many of the agency's newest spies. Normally, they would be working undercover as State Department diplomats overseas. Now they cannot -- particularly not in Russia -- without fearing that Mr. Nicholson, their trusted instructor, has blown their covers.
"It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the C.I.A. to place some of these newly trained officers into certain sensitive assignments for the rest of their careers," the affidavit says.
They will be in danger of exposure in any country where the Russian foreign intelligence service has a presence. For years to come, many will be forced to work at desk jobs, either at headquarters or in obscure and out-of-the-way foreign capitals, processing information instead of gathering it. That will not improve morale at the clandestine service.
"There's a very real cost involved in this case, and that may be the highest cost of all," said Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence from November 1991 to January 1993. "It will be very difficult to have them targeted against Russia. It clearly puts some limitations on assignments. Time will have to pass before they are assigned overseas. There will be a much greater cost in creating cover for them. Their careers will be delayed" -- if not destroyed.
Some of the betrayed young officers may be retrained to assume "non-official cover" -- that is, to pose as businessmen or in some other guise overseas. It costs millions of dollars for the agency to train and support such a deep-cover officer, and the assignment is far more dangerous, since it lacks the diplomatic immunity provided by posing as a State Department official.
The affidavit also said Mr. Nicholson, in addition to blowing the cover of one of his own star pupils who was headed for an undercover assignment in Moscow, sold the Russians the name of the agency's new Moscow station chief and information about the new chief's staff of clandestine officers.
Equally galling to the C.I.A. is that Mr. Nicholson is charged with selling secret files on American citizens who live or work in Russia. These Americans, mostly businessmen, have volunteered information to the C.I.A. on the structure of Russian banking, the state of the Russian economy and the workings of Russian military and industrial companies, among other subjects.
Those who have cooperated with the C.I.A. may pay dearly for trusting that their roles would stay secret.
"They are clearly at risk," a former senior intelligence official said. "They have to worry whether they are going to be subject to increased surveillance by the Russians."
Mr. Gates agreed, adding that American businessmen in Moscow may now be reluctant to open a relationship with the C.I.A. "Others willing to help may now decline to do so for fear their business will be damaged," he said.
Mr. Nicholson is also suspected of revealing details of intelligence operations in Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania, all countries he served in as a spy from 1982 to 1994. A former intelligence official said, "He very well may have disclosed specific collection operations that C.I.A. might have had targeted against the Russians or against local governments that the Russians might be interested in."
And diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow have been damaged. The United States lodged official protests over the case, one delivered face to face by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who summoned the Russian Ambassador, Yuli M. Vorontsov, to the State Department on Monday. The United States is contemplating expelling a Russian spy working under diplomatic cover in Washington, Government officials said, just as it did when similar spy cases arose during the cold war.
[At a news conference in Australia on Wednesday, President Clinton said that he was concerned about the breach but that the arrest was "the direct result of the tightening of the system." He said the United States had discussed the matter with the Russians. "We will do what we think we have to do in intelligence," he said, but he declined to elaborate.]
The C.I.A. has taken pains to point out that the charges against Mr. Nicholson were dwarfed by the case against Aldrich H. Ames, the career C.I.A. officer who pleaded guilty to espionage in April 1994. Most important, no one died. Mr. Ames's treachery led to the execution of every important Soviet and East European military and intelligence officer secretly working for the C.I.A. -- at least 10 of them -- and the destruction of most of the espionage operations aimed at Moscow at the height of the cold war.
But Mr. Gates, the former Director, said the two cases had had a similar effect on the C.I.A. -- and a perversely healthy one.
"They've cleared away a lot of mythology within the agency," Mr. Gates said today. "There was a view that people in the agency didn't turn and work for the other side. C.I.A. people didn't steal. They didn't cheat.
"What we've found is that C.I.A. is like any other big institution. It's made up of human beings, some of whom are weak. They do embezzle. They do work for the other side. They do cheat and steal. The biggest effect of these cases has been to eliminate a good deal of the cultural mythology inside the agency and a certain measure of arrogance that went along with it -- that the agency was different and better than anybody else."

The Arab Burden

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
I asked President Hosni Mubarak the other day what qualities he would like to see in the next U.S. Secretary of State. The Egyptian leader remarked that Warren Christopher was the ideal Secretary for the past four years. His low-key, lawyerly style was well suited for a period in which Israelis and Palestinians were driving the peace process by themselves and the U.S. role was to ease them over the bumps. But with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu having replaced Shimon Peres, and with the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations soon to reach the knotty final-status issues, the U.S. may again need a Secretary of State with more of the Jim Baker, in-your-face style of diplomacy, Mr. Mubarak gently suggested. "With no Rabin, no Peres, the President will have to select a Secretary of State who works differently," he said.
Mr. Mubarak is half right. The next Secretary will certainly need to have a Bakeresque taste for knuckle-breaking, strategic leaking and other diplomatic contact sports. It was one thing for the U.S. to promote the peace process when there was an Israeli leadership -- Mr. Peres and Yitzhak Rabin -- who were ready to drive the agenda, take all the heat and make the tough choices. It is another thing for the U.S. to promote the peace process with an Israeli Government preoccupied with looking for ways to move forward without political costs and without making the really tough choices vis-a-vis the Palestinians. But the U.S. isn't the only party that will need a new style. So too will Egypt and the Arabs. 
 Here's why: The only way the peace process is going to proceed is if Mr. Netanyahu can be persuaded to break off the far-right religious-nationalist wing of his coalition and build a constituency for peace based on Labor doves, who are 50 percent of Israel's population, and Likud security hawks -- those who voted for Mr. Netanyahu because they want a deal with the Palestinians but just a better one than they thought Labor would negotiate -- who are 25 percent of the population. Together, they are 75 percent of Israel.
But Egypt has to help. Sure, it's easy now for Arab leaders to generate support at home by pummeling Mr. Netanyahu. Because of the high-handed way he tends to deal with Arabs, he really agitates them, right down to the man on the street. He's now a popular target. Egypt's very able Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, is the most popular diplomat in the Arab world today, precisely because of the way he has been bashing Mr. Netanyahu -- without ever saying a good word for the rest of Israel, or encouraging the peace coalition that still exists there. This has got to stop. It's cheap. It's counterproductive and it's throwing out the bathwater with the Bibi.
The only way U.S. diplomats can effectively pressure Mr. Netanyahu is if they have the visible support of the moderate Arabs, who make clear that they are ready to help nurture the Israeli constituency for peace -- that 75 percent -- that still exists beneath the surface of the Israeli elections. But if that Israeli peace constituency detects that the mood in the Arab world is reverting to anti-Israel, and not just anti-those in Israel against the peace process, if it detects that Mr. Netanyahu will get bashed if he does the right thing or the wrong thing, that peace coalition will never get galvanized and drive the process forward.
At least a few Egyptian intellectuals, who have long been hostile to the peace process, recognize this. Al Ahram's editor, Ibrahim Nafie, wrote the other day: "Is it possible for us to continue to deal with Israeli society as a monolithic entity, one which has a unified stand toward peace, given the schisms that exist in the Israeli body politic?" If the answer is no, he said, then the question for the Arab world is "how should we act to further the cause of peace within Israeli society and marginalize those opposed to its implementation?"
In other words, the loss of Messrs. Peres and Rabin not only makes it incumbent on the U.S. to take more responsibility for the peace process, it makes it incumbent on the Arabs, and particularly Egypt, to take more responsibility as well -- to persuade the Israeli man in the street that despite the current impasse there is still an Arab peace partner out there, ready to deliver real security and economic benefits to an Israel still willing to take risks for peace.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Global Pact on Computers May Be Nearing

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials expect two major meetings in the next month to set the stage for a global agreement abolishing tariffs on computer and software products.
Such an Information Technology Agreement, or I.T.A., would liberalize some $500 billion worth of computer and software exports annually -- roughly equivalent to world trade in agriculture -- among the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and many other Asian and Latin American countries. 
 "We are working quite diligently on this," said Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative. "And while I'm cautious by nature, I think most countries realize the benefits of an I.T.A."
The first of the meetings is scheduled to begin later this week in the Philippines, when the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathers to take up the issue. APEC is committed to achieving complete free trade in the region. Then, on Dec. 9 in Singapore, the APEC countries will press the more than 100 members of the World Trade Organization at their first meeting of trade representatives to also adopt this free trade agreement.
The impact of such an agreement could spread beyond the relatively narrow scope of information technology. To complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks in 1993 that created the World Trade Organization, negotiators left unresolved a liberalization of world trade in service industries: maritime shipping, financial services and telecommunications.
Since then, attempts to resolve the issues have failed, and accord on information technology will be seen by some as breaking a three-year logjam on multilateral trade agreements. At the same time, a failure could be seen as a stunning blow to global trade talks.
"An I.T.A. is the minimum needed to show trade liberalization is still alive," Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics in Washington said.
One problem in jump-starting the information technology talks is that there are several competing visions as to what course the W.T.O. should take next. Several trade strategists want a commitment to merge the world's proliferating number of small, regional free trade areas into one worldwide free trade region. Others -- including Europe's chief trade negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, and Renato Rugiero, head of the World Trade Organization -- have suggested that the W.T.O. session should begin a new round of trade freeing negotiations.
But the United States and many other governments seem unenthusiastic. "This is not the time for grand new initiatives, which would only encourage countries to hold back concessions they are being asked to make now for the final package deal that could be years away," said Jeffrey Lang, deputy trade representative. More likely, Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Lang said, is that the trade representatives will begin exploratory talks on a number of smaller issues at Singapore rather than take up any grand schemes.
These smaller issues include such things as whether restrictions on foreign investment hamper trade and the commercial impact of differing labor market standards, environmental and antitrust regulations and government procurement policies.
"A Mercedes-Benz without gas" is how Sylvia Ostry, a former Canadian trade negotiator who now teaches at Toronto University, described this distinctly subdued World Trade Organization agenda. She said that with the cold war over, Western democracies no longer felt the need to consolidate their political links by encouraging freer trade.
"There seems to be little commitment to implementing the built-in agenda of the Uruguay Round or completing the service sector negotiations, let alone setting new targets for further liberalization," Mrs. Ostry said.
But those hopeful about the coming meetings in the Philippines and Singapore also see advantages in a series of small steps. "Free trade in information technology could make it easier for the Asians to accept freer trade in telecommunications," Mr. Lang said.
In fact, trade negotiators are already working to create some momentum toward renewing the talks on telecommunications. Earlier this month, the United States and the European Union submitted new, more liberal telecommunications proposals to the World Trade Organization, with Europe proposing to quicken the pace of its liberalization and the Clinton Administration agreeing for the first time to let foreign companies land underwater cables on United States shores.
If an agreement on information technology does emerge from the coming meetings, it will be for three main reasons.
First, the four so-called Quadrilateral Powers -- the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan -- have already agreed to one in principle at their April 1996 summit meeting in Kobe, Japan, provided they get enough support from Asian countries.
Freeing trade in information products is attractive to many APEC countries. But China is always reluctant to open its market to outside goods and might try to link acceptance of an agreement on information technology to its own admission into the W.T.O. -- something the United States is not yet willing to accept. Indonesia may also have reservations, since it is not a big electronics exporter.
Second, an accord is also favored by the European electronics industry, which wants to reduce the cost of imported semiconductors. But while Asian exporters want to include consumer electronics like television monitors and videocassette recorders, European producers fear the increased competition and want the agreement to dismantle administrative barriers to trade as well as to abolish tariffs.
And third, an agreement on information technology would allow the European Union to join a recently renegotiated semiconductor agreement between the United States and Japan. That agreement has opened up the Japanese market to United States producers and enabled them to grab close to a 30 percent share. The United States has refused to let the union join in the agreement until it agrees to complete free trade in information technology products.

HEADLINE: October Starts Of Housing Fell by 5.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
For months, analysts puzzled over the housing construction market's seeming disregard of last winter's sharp rise in interest rates that pushed mortgage costs higher and cut down on buyers. No more. Figures issued today showed that builders in October broke ground on the fewest new houses in a year, as activity tumbled for the second consecutive month.
The drop of 5.1 percent in housing starts came as much of a surprise to analysts as the earlier strength had been. With most analysts having predicted a rebound from a 6.1 percent decrease in September, the October figures raised questions about whether economic growth might be faltering. Mortgage rates have fallen again, however, and some analysts see housing construction recovering. 
 Nevertheless, the October figures were eye-catching. Joseph Liro, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, a securities firm in New York, said he and his associates were "taken aback by the extent" of housing's two-month skid. He predicted that this important sector would be a drag on growth over the balance of the year.
October's drop in housing starts, moreover, was accompanied by a decline of 2.7 percent in permits issued for construction, an indicator widely -- but not universally -- regarded as a business forecaster. This was the third consecutive month of lower permits, and the pace was the lowest since July 1995.
Whether the economy continues to grow at a slackened pace or possibly tips into recession, today's results were further vindication of the Federal Reserve's decision against tightening monetary policy this autumn in the belief that the economy was cooling enough on its own.
"This makes the Fed look prescient in having not raised rates," said Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers, a trade group whose members are major mortgage lenders.
But while housing-market psychology has "shifted so dramatically," according to David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, he and others contend that construction is likely to stabilize now that interest rates have reversed course. Conventional mortgages are now available at about 7 5/8 percent and adjustables at 5 1/2 percent, he said.
Moreover, the supply of unsold homes is relatively lean, apparently reflecting caution in the industry that sooner or later the early-year jump in rates would have an impact.
"Builders have reasonable control over their inventories this time," Mr. Taylor said.
At the same time, the association's housing-market index fell to 51 in November from 55 in October, the group reported on Monday, well down from May's peak of 63. All three survey components declined -- current sales of single-family homes, their projected sales over the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers.
October's 5.1 percent drop in housing starts, which followed September's 6.1 percent slump, included all areas of the country except the West and multiple-dwelling buildings as well as single-family homes, the report showed.
In the Northeast, where activity has long been slowest, the decline was 9.3 percent while the Midwest and South were down 9.2 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. The West posted a 6.5 percent gain but this recovered less than half the ground lost in September.
Over all, starts ran at a seasonally adjusted pace of 1,336,000, or 10.9 percent below the August peak.
Single-family homes eased 4.6 percent last month while dwellings in buildings with at least five units, a more volatile sector, dropped 12.5 percent.
As for permits, the report found a 2.7 percent October decline, with all regions other than the Northeast, which registered no change, down by roughly similar amounts.
The annual rate was 1,361,000, with permits for the more economically important single-family component down 3 percent last month.
Elliott Platt, a senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said he was tempted to predict that housing starts would rebound in November on a presumption of renewed strength in the South and Midwest. But he counseled resisting this notion because of exceptionally bad weather that may be causing a big drop in the Midwest.
The October pace nonetheless stood 6.2 percent above that of 12 months earlier, reflecting the surprisingly buoyant first half of the year.
Today's report also included a lagged tally for mobile homes, shipments of which ran at an annual rate of 373,000 in September, 1 percent higher than in August.

The Inspass system for hassle-free entry into the United States is being expanded.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AFTER three years of apparent fraud-free use at Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark International Airport and Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto, the Inspass system will soon be in place at eight more airports. Its purpose is to provide frequent travelers hassle-free entry into the United States.
Those eligible for the program are citizens of the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the 25 other nations that participate in the visa-waiver pilot program, provided they travel to the United States on business at least three times a year. Also eligible are "low risk" visitors like diplomats, airline crews and representatives of international organizations. 
 To enroll in Inspass, which is run by the the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, travelers must visit an I.N.S. office and be approved by an agency inspector. After receiving an Inspass card, the traveler arriving at a participating airport can bypass immigration lines by inserting the card into what resembles an automated bank teller machine. But unlike users of the bank machine, Inspass card holders must also insert their hand in a "reader" that compares it with the image captured at the time of their enrollment.
The airports scheduled to have Inspass in place by mid-1997 are Miami, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Honolulu, Houston, San Francisco, Chicago and Montreal. The system at the Canadian airports is to provide pre-clearance for entry into the United States.
 
Guarding Your Laptop
With laptop computers a prime target of thieves at airports and hotels, Port Inc., a Norwalk, Conn., company that manufactures accessories for portable computers, has come up with a motion sensor alarm system. The 6.2-ounce system, Defcon 1, employs a cut-resistant steel cable that passes through the handle of the carrying case or into a laptop's security lock slot. Because the motion sensor operates on time-delay, the alarm gives three warning chirps if the computer is moved, shaken or tilted. If not disarmed, an ear-spliting alarm will alert the owner -- and presumably everyone else within earshot. The price of the alarm is $49.95.
 
Call for Help
Mastercard International is offering card holders who travel abroad an easy way to report lost or stolen cards, find the nearest A.T.M. machines or get emergency card replacement or cash advances: a toll-free telephone call in any language from anywhere in the world (or through a collect call where toll-free service is not available). The numbers can be obtained by asking local directory assistance in each country for the toll-free Mastercard Global Service number, or through hotel concierges and Thomas Cook travel and currency-exchange locations in major cities.
 
Route Planning
Three weeks ago the Promus Hotel Corporation began offering travelers free customized auto route planning via three World Wide Web sites on the Internet. By Monday those Web sites had mapped out about 100,000 trips for browsers.
The Web sites, available to anyone with access to the Internet, are for each of three Promus brands -- Hampton Inn and Hampton Inn and Suites, whose site is www.hampton-inn.com (Hampton Inn and Hampton Inn & Suites); Embassy Suites, whose Web site is www.embassy-suites.com, and Homewood Suites, at www.homewood-suites.com.
 
Promoting the Slopes
The ski industry contributes $3.2 billion a year to Colorado's economy, but skiing has been pretty much a no-growth industry nationwide for about a decade.
To "fill the pipeline," as one concerned ski executive put it, the Colorado state government and Colorado Ski Country USA, a marketing organization, have teamed up to give every fifth grader in the state a season pass entitling them to ski and snowboard for free at 23 resorts statewide.

HEADLINE: Utility Seeks Partner to Aid Power Needs

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
A big Georgia utility said yesterday that it was turning to an outside power-marketing company to supply half its electricity needs in an effort to cut its costs by tens of millions of dollars over more than a decade.
The deal between the Georgia utility, the Oglethorpe Power Corporation, and the power marketer, the LG & E Energy Corporation, is indicative of how utilities are likely to seek partners with more expertise to help them take advantage of an increasing competitive market for electricity. 
 The arrangement also demonstrates the growing ability of power marketers, who trade in electricity as a commodity, to take on long-term contracts to deliver power over a decade and longer.
Under their agreement, an LG & E subsidiary, LG & E Power Marketing, will provide Oglethorpe with half its electricity for 15 years. The contract estimates the current value of that electricity at $4.5 billion to $5 billion.
LG & E will take over the management of Oglethorpe's plants, which can produce about 3,200 megawatts of power, or enough to serve a medium-sized city.
It will buy electricity from outside sources if that proves cheaper than producing it. It will also sell power from the plants if it proves to be more lucrative.
"We decided we would use the advantage they have developed to see if we can save money," said Clarence Mitchell, the vice president of generation for Oglethorpe.
The companies said they believed that it was the largest long-term power marketing agreement so far.
Oglethorpe is also negotiating with two other big power marketers, Enron Power Marketing Inc. and Duke/ Louis Dreyfus, to manage the rest of its electricity needs, which total about 5,000 megawatts.
Although Oglethorpe provides wholesale electricity to 39 electric cooperatives serving 2.6 million households in Georgia, it does not have the experience that LG & E has in buying electricity. LG & E Energy, the parent company of the Louisville Gas and Electric Company in Kentucky, has been one of the most aggressive utilities to market power outside its home base.
Oglethorpe was set up by the cooperatives in 1974 to provide power after rising fuel prices, high inflation and tight supplies pushed up electricity prices.
Mr. Mitchell said that although Oglethorpe itself had experience in power marketing, it could not match the sophistication and the big volumes handled by the large marketers like LG & E that buy and sell power daily from many sources.
He said that under the contract Oglethorpe had locked in a certain price that LG & E had to meet. If LG & E was able to buy electricity at lower prices, then it could keep the difference.
The agreement, which will take effect Jan. 1, still must be approved by the Rural Utilities Service, a Federal agency that oversees the nation's electric cooperatives.
The trading of electricity has been growing rapidly and is expected to surge when states begin to open up their utilities to outside competition. An order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last spring has also made the delivery of power over the nation's grid more equitable, since utilities must now treat outsiders using their grids on an equal footing as themselves.
What is unusual about Oglethorpe, which is the nation's largest power supply cooperative, is that it made its decision on its own to have outsiders manage its power.
"This is the precursor of many deals that will happen," Mike McInnis, the president of LG & E Power Marketing, said.
"Managements will focus on those risks where they have the greatest strengths," he said. "Oglethorpe wants to manage the risk on the customer side in distribution and allow us to manage the risk on the generation side."
Shares of LG & E Energy gained 50 cents yesterday, closing at $24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Cooperatives were set up, beginning in the 1930's, to bring power to rural farm areas where private utilities were reluctant to build power plants and transmission systems.

HEADLINE: A Mayor Slides Off His Pedestal

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
There are those who will now assert that they knew all along that Willie L. Brown Jr. would slip, that it was only a matter of time and hubris before he would stop being "the wildly popular Mayor of San Francisco" and become just the Mayor.
It had been the prevailing local view that beneath his Cheshire cat smiles and his $3,000 Brioni suits, Mr. Brown possessed a non-stick political skin. He had gotten away with describing his Board of Supervisors as "mistresses that you have to service." He had compared California's Attorney General to the Nazis and got barely a rebuttal. Several ballot measures he supported in the Nov. 5 elections were roundly defeated, and nobody said a word. 
 But then Mr. Brown made the mistake of turning his switchblade tongue on something truly sacred, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.
Last week, after a tough loss in overtime to the hated Dallas Cowboys, Mr. Brown called the 49ers' beleaguered back-up quarterback, Elvis Grbac, "an embarrassment to humankind" and vowed that Grbac would never play in any new stadium that the Brown administration helped build for the team. He later claimed not to have known about Grbac's post-game confession that he may have been distracted by the precarious health of his 9-month-old son, who had undergone spinal surgery for a birth defect. But the Mayor's explanation seemed to mean nothing in the fury that ensued.
As Mr. Brown flew off in a private jet for a five-day trip to Paris, angry callers besieged the telephones of local newspapers, radio stations and City Hall. Fax machines ran out of paper. Sports bars were in an uproar. In one radio station's overnight telephone poll, 84 percent of the 1,548 people who called in said they believed Mr. Brown's effectiveness as chief executive had been undermined.
At the 49ers' game on Sunday, the most-photographed banner read, "Keep Elvis Trade Willie." And after the local heroes prevailed over the Baltimore Ravens, 38-20, with Grbac (pronounced gerbach) completing an exclamatory 26 of 31 passes, The San Francisco Examiner announced the victory with the headline: "Elvis wins, humankind rejoices."
Mr. Brown, who reveled in his reputation as the Deion Sanders of city government -- brashness and talent in equal measure -- has responded in an uncharacteristic way: he apologized. After some intercontinental penance through the press, which he also blamed for failing to inform him about the condition of Grbac's child, he called to the 49ers' practice field on Friday and delivered his regrets to the quarterback directly.
"It was a dumb thing to have uttered," Mr. Brown said again today, at his first news conference since flying back from France (He was now pronouncing it "Fronce."). "I'm sorry it was said. I'm sorry it was done. Mr. Grbac accepted my apology."
But if the Mayor sounded about as close as he could to sheepish, some analysts of the city's politics suggested that he might well have overestimated the taste of San Franciscans for what many of them see as an imperious style of governing.
"He's talking like he's the dictator of San Francisco, like we should be bowing down to the king!" Bob Santilli, 34, an operations manager at a stock brokerage, objected last week over a drink at Harrington's Bar and Grill in the city's Financial District. "He's got the Board of Supervisors in his pocket, so he think's he's the god of San Francisco."
Mr. Brown insisted today that whatever arrogance might have been seen in his remarks, his style would not change. And in a recent interview, he predicted that complaints about his perceived authoritarianism would probably be a staple of local politics during his tenure.
"You're going to hear that," he said. "Because this city has never been run properly. Nobody's been willing to make a decision. Incumbent enjoyers of the current, chaotic process will be critics, and that includes the press."
The writer of a new biography of Mr. Brown, James Richardson, noted that in his three decades in the California State Assembly, mildly outrageous, off-the-cuff statements by Mr. Brown came and went without ever getting the kind of attention they have drawn since he became Mayor. It was taken for granted in Sacramento, Mr. Richardson said, "that there was a difference between Willietalk and Williedo."
It is, of course, a measure of Mr. Brown's success in San Francisco that his outburst about Grbac has occasioned what is by most accounts the most serious "crisis" of his first year in City Hall.
The larger challenges of governing the city, with its growing service economy and its decaying, underfinanced infrastructure, have been steadily apparent. Federal officials were brought in to take over the city's decrepit housing authority in March.
A ballot proposition intended to give the mayor greater control over the hiring and firing of 500 mid-level municipal employees was roundly defeated despite a $700,000 campaign on its behalf.
Mayoral aides have battled for months for changes in the city's inefficient, underfinanced public transportation system. Health and social-services officials have pledged to oppose Federal and state cuts in aid to welfare recipients and immigrants, but they have not yet explained clearly how they will foot the bill themselves.
Still, it is also widely felt that whatever his real accomplishments, Mr. Brown's energy and ebullience have helped to crystallize a significant lifting of the city's mood.
"He's taking no end of grief for this, but it's not going to have any fundamental effect on his political future," said Dan Schnur, a former aide to California's Governor, Pete Wilson, and a political analyst for KGO Radio in San Francisco.
"For a combination of reasons -- a rejuvenated economy and Willie Brown among them -- this city is feeling better about itself than it has in a long time."
It was also clear that many San Franciscans were enjoying the crisis. Even the Mayor's old friend, the San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, was repeating the latest Willie joke to make the rounds.
"Why does Mayor Brown buy Italian shoes?" Mr. Caen asked in his column.
"Because they taste better."

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects Move to Block CSX-Conrail Merger Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Norfolk Southern Corporation failed to thwart a giant railroad merger between its rival, the CSX Corporation, and Conrail yesterday, when a Federal judge in Philadelphia refused to grant a preliminary injunction blocking the $8.5 billion deal.
The battle for Conrail and for supremacy of the rail freight industry east of the Mississippi is far from over, however. 
 Norfolk Southern, which has offered $10 billion for Conrail, immediately appealed the decision by Federal District Judge Donald VanArtsdalen in Philadelphia. More important, CSX must still persuade Conrail shareholders next month to allow the railroad to acquire more than 20 percent of Conrail through its friendly, though less lucrative, offer.
"The next battleground is going to be the proxy fight leading up to the shareholder meeting in December," said Barry Benzing, a lawyer at Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, whose firm is representing four arbitragers hoping that Conrail goes to the highest bidder. "It looks as if CSX will have a headstart now, but Norfolk clearly has the superior economic offer."
With yesterday's ruling in hand, CSX is now expected to counter Norfolk Southern's advertising blitz with its own campaign promoting its offer. The CSX offer would give shareholders $110 cash a share for 40 percent of Conrail shares and, if the deal is approved, a stock swap worth $84.22 a share for the remaining 60 percent of the shares. Norfolk Southern is offering $110 a share for all Conrail stock.
People close to the negotiations say that CSX will sweeten the offer for the remaining 60 percent of Conrail in early December to get the votes it needs.
Barring a successful appeal by Norfolk Southern, CSX is expected to complete its tender at 12:01 A.M. tomorrow for 19.9 percent of Conrail, giving shareholders about $2 billion in cash for a merger that may not take place until 1998, if at all.
Norfolk Southern had sought to block the friendly combination, contending in Federal court that Conrail's directors had abrogated their fiduciary responsibilities by agreeing to "unprecedented" merger terms that barred them from considering another richer offer for 270 days and prevented them from lifting the company's poison pill rights plan for any bidder other than CSX.
Moreover, Norfolk said that CSX's coercive, two-tiered, cash-and-stock offer was an attempt to stampede shareholders into accepting CSX's lower offer.
Testifying on Monday, John C. Coffee Jr., professor of corporate law at Columbia University, said he had not seen a "disparity this great" between the front and back ends of a takeover bid in over a decade.
"The Conrail directors are not in a position to live up to their own fiduciary duties, even if they wanted to," Professor Coffee, who testified for Norfolk Southern, said. "I don't think you can sell or trade your duty."
But Bradley Jones, a Conrail director, testified today that the company reviewed all its options before seeking out CSX in a strategic merger of equals.
Judge VanArtsdalen sided with Conrail in rejecting all of Norfolk Southern's arguments.
"It is hard for me to conceive of any shareholder being misled by Conrail or CSX," the judge said.
The judge's ruling came after the stock market closed. Earlier on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Conrail rose 37.5 cents, to $96.375, while CSX shares rose 87.5 cents, to $45.375. Norfolk Southern shares edged up 12.5 cents, to $89.
After CSX acquires 19.9 percent of Conrail, it must convince the majority of Conrail's shareholders at a special meeting in mid-December to allow CSX to acquire the rest of the stock without having to offer $110 cash for all shares. The bulk of Conrail's outstanding shares are now in the hands of pension fund managers and arbitragers who have favored Norfolk Southern's richer offer and vowed to stop the merger with CSX.
No matter which company wins the war for control of Conrail it is unlikely that a merger will take place for at least two years.
In testimony before the House Transportation Committee yesterday, David Konschnik, director of the Surface Transportation Board, said the board was proposing a 10-month review process, with the final vote on the deal coming sometime late in 1997. The hearings before the board, which regulates railroads, are expected to provoke extensive and sometimes angry testimony from shippers and state and local officials because the merger could result in a single railroad dominating traffic in anywhere from 38 to 64 cities in the East, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Baltimore.
"With more and more mergers, shippers have become captive to one railroad, and typically, shippers captive to one railroad have not enjoyed the improvements in service and price as shippers who have more options," said Jim Hall, who oversees the transport of plastic and detergent products for the Condea Vista Company in Houston. "I'm a free-market guy, but monopolies aren't good."
In Maryland, where the Port of Baltimore is served by Conrail and CSX, Gov. Parris Glendening pulled together a task force last month of shippers, port officials and government agencies to assess the potential effects on the state's economy.
Both Norfolk and CSX have long coveted Conrail and its monopoly over freight rail traffic in the Northeast, particularly at the Port of New York, perhaps the richest consumer market in the nation. But it was John W. Snow, the chairman of CSX, who positioned himself as Conrail's white knight. He advised the railroad on a reorganization plan in the 1980's and then in 1987 Mr. Snow aided Conrail in fending off Norfolk Southern's takeover bid for Conrail shortly before the Government sold the company to the public.
A year ago, Mr. Snow and David R. Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern, did spend several months exploring a joint bid for Conrail and a subsequent division of the assets but nothing came of it. Conrail ultimately opted to pursue a combination with CSX this fall. The company's love affair with CSX may be motivated by a sense that Conrail franchise and its aggressive managers would be embraced at the larger and somewhat creakier CSX, according to transportation analysts. Norfolk, by contrast, is regarded as the best run railroad in the industry and may not need another set of managers when and if it swallows Conrail.
"With CSX, Conrail believes that their management team has a chance to run the combined railroad in the future," Kevin Keefe, editor of Trains magazine, said. "Their future probably isn't as good with Norfolk Southern. Norfolk is the class of the industry when it comes to making money and running a railroad."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Strengthens vs. Dollar; Yen Weakens in Late Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against most currencies yesterday, hurt by an unexpectedly large increase in the United States trade deficit and new evidence of vitality in Germany's economy that helped strengthen the mark.
But the dollar recouped against the yen, which weakened broadly in late trading in New York on a report by the Kyodo News Service that the Japanese Ministry of Finance was closing the Hanwa Bank, a regional bank, because of insolvency. 
 "That bank has a huge amount of bad loans and is a reflection of Japanese banking weakness," said Kazuhiko Sekiguchi, vice president of foreign exchange at the Toyo Trust and Banking Company in New York. After the Kyodo report, he said, "Everybody sold the yen against the dollar and the mark."
Hanwa would be the first Japanese bank to shut down as a result of a glut of unpaid debt from the speculative 1980's and was seen as another reason why Japan's record-low interest rates are not likely to rise anytime soon. Higher rates would help the yen but aggravate the Japanese banking crisis.
"It brings forward the problem that these banks are still saddled with very poor loans," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "It's fess-up time in Japan. The fact of the matter is there are good fundamental reasons for the yen to be weak, and that mainly is the overhang of this debt."
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 111.55 yen, up from 111.40 yen on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.4968 marks, down from 1.5053 Tuesday and below the psychologically important 1.5000 level for the first time since Nov. 11. The pound was quoted at $1.6770, up from $1.6739, extending the British currency's string of four-year highs against the dollar.
The main catalyst for the dollar's weakness was the Commerce Department report that the trade deficit rose to $11.3 billion in September, the worst showing after a record $11.6 billion shortfall in July.
Forecasters had expected a slight decrease, reflecting their view that the slowing United States economy had diminished demand for imports. A rising deficit weakens the dollar by increasing the supply of dollars held abroad, which ultimately dilutes demand for the currency.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Be thrifty and invest well, and then wait for the huge tax bill.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
GOOD news for the affluent and thrifty: the 1996 law raising the minimum wage also suspends the 15 percent tax on "excess distributions" from retirement savings. Trouble is, the suspension of the tax lasts just three years. And what very few Americans understand, a new study argues, is that Washington has long been chipping away at retirement tax breaks, creating huge potential tax liabilities for millions of baby boomers and their heirs.
While the plight of those who have ridden the great bull market of the 1990's may not evoke much sympathy, a study by John Shoven of Stanford and David Wise of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, just published by the Center for Economic Policy Research at Stanford, suggests that it does illustrate the law of unintended consequences. "I don't think Congress meant to punish those who saved long and successfully with 90 percent taxes," Mr. Shoven allowed. 
 According to the conventional wisdom, "qualified" retirement savings -- defined benefit corporate pension plans, 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts, Keogh's -- are the last great tax shelter for the middle class. Taxes on the money set aside from current income, along with taxes on the earnings of the money set aside, are deferred until the nest egg is spent in retirement.
But there are catches. To deter the rich from exploiting retirement accounts, Congress put an extra 15 percent tax on annual distributions exceeding $150,000. This is the tax that was suspended from 1997 through 1999; thereafter "excess distributions" will be indexed to inflation before they are taxed.
A companion "excessive accumulation" tax (which was not suspended or indexed), adds a 15 percentage point surcharge to Federal estate taxes on retirement assets in excess of the amount actuarially needed to finance a $155,000 annual pension. For the estate of a 65-year-old, an accumulation greater than $1.2 million is considered excessive; for an 80-year-old, the figure is about $800,000.
Because the excess distribution tax is not deductible from state or local income taxes, those liable to pay it end up in a 56 percent Federal bracket. In a high-tax state like California they pay 61 cents of the last dollar spent. With a substantial estate (one in excess of $3 million), the combination of Federal estate taxes and the excess accumulation tax put the heirs in a 62 percent bracket.
But wait: personal income taxes must also be paid on tax-sheltered retirement accumulations within estates. And that puts the $3 million estate in the 92 percent bracket, or even more if state taxes are exceptionally stiff. For the heirs of a $10 million estate in New York who are themselves in the top tax bracket, Mr. Shoven and Mr. Wise calculate that government gets 99.73 cents out of the last dollar.
What does all this have to do with just plain folks who eat early-bird dinners and make good use of their A.A.R.P. discounts? More than you might expect, the economists explain, provided that investments in stocks do as well in the future as they have in the past.
Take the case of a professional who begins a career today at age 25 with a $50,000 salary, averages just a 2 percent annual real raise for the next four decades, saves 10 percent of her income in qualified retirement plans and enjoys an 8 percent real rate of return. She will accumulate $1.8 million by age 65 and $2.7 million by age 70 -- more than enough to set off the excess accumulation tax, should she die before spending the principal.
Or consider a baby boomer who started work in 1971 at $15,000, enjoyed salary increases of 2.5 percent annually after inflation through 1995, and then settled down to 1 percent raises until retirement. If he saved 10 percent of his income and earned 8 percent on the assets annually through 1995, he would have accumulated $675,000 by age 50. Another 15 years of persistent 10 percent savings that compounded at an 8 percent return would get him up to $2.4 million.
One very practical implication, Mr. Shoven argues, is that tax shelters can easily become tax traps for middle-income Americans who are thrifty and invest well. But the broader issue here is whether it ever makes sense to tax assets at rates exceeding 90 percent.
After all, high savings rates are good for the economy as a whole, both because they reduce the proportion of retirees who need public subsidies and because capital accumulation raises the productivity of those still working. It is one thing to deny lucrative tax breaks to the tiny fraction of the population that is drowning in wealth. It is quite another to undermine the savings incentives of the upper middle class.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Heir Seems in Charge, but a Grim Winter Looms

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 15

 BODY:
As wintry cold spreads across the Korean Peninsula, North Korea is desperately short of oil and food and lacks a president. But it at least appears to have someone in charge.
Kim Jong Il, 54, has still not taken over the titles of head of state and head of the ruling party since his father, Kim Il Sung, died more than two years ago. But even though the posts remain vacant, diplomats and other analysts increasingly say the son appears to be running the country and consolidating his authority. 
 Moreover, some say that for all North Korea's problems and despite speculation that it is near collapse, it could stagger on indefinitely.
"Our view is that Kim Jong Il is in firm control over his country," said Lieut. Gen. Park Yong Ok, the South Korean Assistant Defense Minister. "We think North Korea is capable of maintaining its system for the time being. We don't expect North Korea to collapse right now."
Still, there is little doubt that North Korea's 24 million people face a desperate winter. Severe flooding in 1995 was compounded by torrential rainstorms this summer. The latest flooding left 147,000 people homeless and killed 32,000 head of livestock, the International Red Cross says.
Even North Korean soldiers, who have been protected from the worst of the food shortages, are not getting enough to eat. Chang Chol Bong, a North Korean sergeant who defected this year, stood 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed just 92 pounds.
"They simply don't grow enough to feed their people," said James T. Laney, the American Ambassador to South Korea. "We think that probably by February, they should have real shortages of grain."
"We don't have many reports of real starvation," he said. "We have a lot of reports of malnutrition."
North Korea is responding to its difficulties in a variety of ways. It now tolerates private markets in many areas, allows foreign aid workers access even to poor areas and has been surprisingly frank about its food shortages.
There are also growing accounts that North Korea is turning to counterfeiting and drug trafficking to raise money. Some intelligence experts say they believe that North Korea is turning out fake $100 "supernotes" in a factory in its capital, Pyongyang, and a recent defector from North Korea asserted this month that the North was operating opium farms in more than 10 places across the country.
The defector, a former pharmaceutical official, said the opium was sold abroad for hard currency.
The economic difficulties might also explain why North Korea is reluctant to exchange liaison offices with the United States, a step toward normalizing relations. The United States is willing to open an office in Pyongyang on a reciprocal basis, but North Korea has balked, and some officials say they believe that the problem is a lack of money to open a mission in Washington.
Many experts expect Kim Jong Il to assume the top Government and party posts next summer, around the third anniversary of his father's death. Mr. Kim, who always used to be called the "Dear Leader," is now referred to by the North Korean news organizations as the "Great Leader," although the expression in Korean is different from the term for "Great Leader" that was always used to describe his father.
In a measure of the kind of adulation that Kim Jong Il receives, the North Korean Government declared this year that in addition to his other accomplishments, he is "a great maker of witty remarks." The announcement said those jokes "have equipped the people with the most scientific and revolutionary world outlook."

Political Gambling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: CAREFREE, Ariz.

 BODY:
The gamblers won a ballot initiative in Arizona, where voters called on the Governor to sign a casino deal with Indian tribes -- though he gutsily says he won't. And in Detroit, citizens fearful of losing business to a casino in Ontario voted to build a defensive one of their very own. That's two scores for the crapshooters.
But elsewhere across the country, the moral blight of organized, big-league casino and riverboat gambling -- and the public disgrace of state-sponsored gambling -- took a licking from people who have grown tired of being taken for suckers. 
 Despite more than $4 million spent by casino operators, gambling industry PAC's and unionized croupiers, the voters in 23 elections and referendums decisively defeated proposals to make the get-rich-quick philosophy -- with transfixed players tugging ever-hopefully at the one-armed bandits -- their local way of life.
Why? One reason is that experience has shown the promise of state-sponsored lotteries -- that the proceeds would be used for more or better education -- is a fraud. Money is fungible; when the state or city raises money "painlessly," from public or private gambling, some of that money is ostentatiously set aside for schools -- but legislators soon treat that as a replacement for funds previously voted for education.
Another reason for the gambling defeats is bipartisan shame. Liberals are ashamed of raising money regressively, preying on those who can least afford to lose. Conservatives are ashamed of allowing government actively to encourage an ancient vice and exploit a human weakness. Up to now, the nation's anti-gambling majority has been afflicted with "pluralistic ignorance" -- not realizing it is a majority.
That's ending because rampant casino-ism in Las Vegas and Atlantic City is competing with the tax-avoiding palaces of glitz operated by real and phony Indian tribes, and their market appears to be reaching the saturation point. Even the largest supplier of lottery equipment noted a 10 percent drop in sales and admitted to Adam Nossiter of The New York Times that "public support of legalized gaming may be waning."
The public is not as apathetic as cracked up to be at the spectacle of government promotion of moral degeneration. We're not talking here about a friendly evening of dollar-ante poker or a charity bingo game or office pool; we're dealing with a $40-billion-a-year predatory industry that deserves no official boost. Gambling's new ability to turn a home computer into a slot machine should get no government encouragement.
Thanks to Tom Grey and his National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, and to Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, a national commission was set up this summer to study gambling's impact. The casino lobby, unable to weaken it, is now out to rig the nine-member commission with gambling enthusiasts.
Trent Lott resisted, picking a family-values type and an objective radiologist, but Newt Gingrich let down morality's side. Eager to help a Nevada freshman under union financial assault get re-elected, the Speaker named the C.E.O. of the MGM Grand casino company in Las Vegas, along with an unbiased academic.
Democrats may do worse. President Clinton is on the verge of appointing a Nevada gambling bureaucrat and a pro-casino Native American; his third pick may give the illusion of balance. Tom Grey suspects that Senator Tom Daschle leans toward a South Dakota gambling commissioner and the House's Dick Gephardt is pledged to a union official representing casino employees, but both say they have not decided.
That would stack the commission in gambling's favor, guaranteeing a Pablum report and undermining the whole point of the exercise.
It's hard to believe the President is ready to go along with this. Such tilting of the table is in direct conflict with his family-values pitch; equally important, he no longer needs the soft money from casino interests for future campaigns. It would cost him nothing to do what is right.
Clinton's commission choices will determine whether we get the truth about gambling's impact on economies and its victim-customers -- or get the sort of sleight-of-hand at which some gamblers are so adept.
No dead-of-night appointments. We'll all be watching.

The Cloakrooms of Russia, the Dens of Dragons

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Winter has slowly begun to muscle its way back to its natural place at the center of Russian life. Furs are starting to emerge from storage. So are hats and boots. It is the season when mud gives way to snow and people tape their windows shut against the cold.
It is also the season of the awesomely powerful, routinely unpleasant women who rule the cloakrooms of the nation. There are very few figures of serious authority left in Russia -- people nobody would dare to challenge. The guardians of cloakrooms -- there is one in nearly every public building in the country -- are definitely among them. 
 At dry cleaners in America, who hasn't lost a ticket and still come away with the goods? But in Russia, rules -- however rare, bizarre and contradictory they may be -- are still rules.
"I lost my coat check once at the Bolshoi," said Galina Abalkina, 37, an economist who works for the Moscow City prosecutor. "I didn't even bother to ask for it. I just went home in the cold, shivering. My mother finally had to get the coat for me."
This is a country where etiquette is not particularly prized. But even here there are limits, and wearing coats indoors exceeds them.
You cannot enter a building unless you turn your coat in at the door. Drafts in offices here are as common as the snows (and the object of another national obsession) but do not try to keep your coat on in any business, hotel, restaurant or other large building. It won't happen.
To many of the pension-age women who work in cloakrooms, the fact that people would actually leave their coats on indoors is the clearest sign that the nation has seriously lost its way.
"I see this type of person from other countries on TV shows," said Yuliya Aleksandrovna, who did not give her last name because, at 65, she does not want anyone she once worked with to know that she checks coats at the Institute of Russian Language for a living.
"They walk into a room and a man starts smoking and sitting on a couch in his coat," she said. "They don't even take off their boots. And the women -- they put their feet right up on a chair without taking off their shoes. It's terrible. For me, it's an atomic bomb."
Most of those employed at cloakrooms make less than $100 a month. There is a union, a Coat Check Society, and its members make more, sometimes twice as much. The women receive modest tips as well. And befitting its nature as one of the last true Soviet institutions, the guild also supplies those members with complete medical benefits, trips to spas and other benefits. What it cannot supply its members, however, is their salaries.
"Half our clients have failed to pay their salaries this year," said Vladimir N. Zlobin, head of the society.
Outside his office in central Moscow there is a list of items a coat-check person is not required to accept. No flammable objects, poison, waste, sharp instruments or explosives. Nothing overtly agricultural or obviously spoiled. Anything else goes.
"We do a serve a very important social function, and the list of our customers is a list of noble and great Russian institutions," Mr. Zlobin said. "The Tretyakov Gallery, the Lenin Library. They want the services but they can't afford to pay us."
For that reason, most institutions are going it alone these days. But none except movie houses dare dispense with the custom altogether. That is probably because the coat-check system -- however inflexible it became in the Soviet experience -- has a noble heritage.
"Garderobe," as the cloakroom is known here, is a French word that appeared in Russian dictionaries for the first time only in 1780. The system began as a way to honor the elegance of fashion in a country where the elements always make elegance a struggle.
"In prerevolutionary times, people dressed for the theater in the most magnificent manner," said Irina Saveleva, professor of arts at the Russian Science Institute of Textile and Light Industry. She teaches the history of clothing and folk clothes.
"People came in furs and diamonds and the most sumptuous clothing," she said. "There couldn't even be talk of entering with outer clothes on. It didn't match the luxurious interior of the theater, or the action that was going on stage. It was a celebration."
"We undress everywhere," Professor Saveleva continued. "Even at restaurants. We don't take our clothes off only in those places that are 'to go' " -- a place like McDonald's, for example.
At the Rossiya Hotel, which was closed by an epidemic of rats two years ago but is now back in business, the coat-check team is among the most aggressive around.
"Don't give me one," Aleksandra I. Boyevna, 61, said when asked what she does with coats that lack loops sewn into the back. "I don't accept them."
That is routine. Anyone offering a coat without a loop can expect to become engulfed in a torrent of abuse. Anybody trying to wear a coat inside can, too.
"This country is falling apart," she said, practically spitting and warily examining a foreigner's coat for any sign of hooklessness. "But in one profession we can have standards. You don't wear a coat inside. That is policy that survived the czars and it survived the Communists. It's rude. It's wrong. And we won't allow it."

HEADLINE: Romania's Communist Legacy: 'Abortion Culture'

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Dorina Ciuplan, a 40-year-old mother of three teen-agers, recalled with a mixture of terror and emotion the nine self-induced abortions she endured during Communist rule under Nicolae Ceausescu.
"I sometimes think I'm lucky to be alive," said Mrs. Ciuplan, her eyes watering as she described forcing miscarriages at home and then going to a hospital, where doctors and nurses tormented her with abusive words and rough treatment as they finished terminating the pregnancies rather than let her die. 
 For more than two decades, contraception and abortions were strictly forbidden by Mr. Ceausescu in an attempt to build his country into a colossus through population growth. His government was overthrown in 1989, and one of its legacies was orphanages filled with unwanted and neglected children.
Another legacy of those horrific years, for Romania's women, is abortion. Some 10,000 women are believed to have died from complications of illegal abortions, and many more were permanently maimed.
Abortions were legalized as soon as Mr. Ceausescu was toppled, and contraception is theoretically available through the state health system.
But overwhelmingly, Romania remains what Western doctors call an "abortion culture," with an abortion rate that remains the highest in Europe. It also has by far the highest rate of pregnancy-related mortality, the strongest indication that Romania continues to lag far behind the rest of Europe and Russia in providing reproductive health services for women.
According to the United Nations Population Fund, Romania had 3.2 abortions for every live birth in 1990. By last year, the rate was 2.2 abortions per live birth. In 1995, the equivalent rate was 2.0 in Russia, 0.67 in the Czech Republic and Hungary and 0.2 in Germany.
The reasons why Romanian women turn to abortion center on the reluctance of the Government to promote family-planning despite healthy doses of Western aid to help the country establish such services, Western and Romanian doctors say. Iulian Mincu, who was Minister of Health until recently and who had been a personal physician to Mr. Ceausescu, publicly stated his opposition to family planning. After a public outcry over poor conditions in the health system, Dr. Mincu was dismissed this summer by Mr. Ceausescu's successor, Ion Iliescu, in an attempt to clean up the Government's image before parliamentary and presidential elections that Mr. Iliescu lost anyway.
The President-elect, Emil Constantinescu, made it clear during his campaign that he would make improved health services a priority, and family planning advocates said they were optimistic that the new Government would be more supportive of their efforts.
Without guidance from the Government, many Romanian doctors have been more enthusiastic about the more lucrative work of performing abortions than about recommending birth control, said Daniela Draghica, one of the administrators of 12 pilot family-planning clinics in Romania opened in 1995 and financed by the United States Agency for International Development.
The state pays for abortions, but as with almost all public health services women say they feel obliged to give the doctor a sizable extra payment, thus making abortions more financially rewarding.
A 28-year-old woman who would give only a first name, Adina, was at the gynecological clinic at Giulesti Hospital in Bucharest. She said she had had six abortions. An abortion costs 3,000 lei, a little less than $1, at public hospitals, where the vast majority of Romanians get their health care. But she said she had paid an additional $7 as a "gift" to the doctor.
On top of this, many doctors, repeating myths from the Ceausescu years, tell women exaggerated stories that oral contraceptives are deleterious to their health, Mrs. Draghica said.
"Women had these myths about contraception," Mrs. Draghica said. "The doctors had told them that pills were bad because they made women fat and gave them heart disease. It's a battle to get their confidence."
Some women are beginning to look for other alternatives. Maria Staicu, 41, who lives in the city of Sibiu and has two children, said the pain and debasement she endured in 1991 when she had a legal abortion left her determined not to go through it again.
"They did 20 women in a few minutes: 'Ready, go; ready, go,' " she said, describing the atmosphere in the state hospital. In the last five years of the Ceausescu regime, she had managed to buy Hungarian-made oral contraceptives on the black market, she said. After her abortion in 1991, she was fitted with an I.U.D.. "I would prefer anything else than an abortion," she said.
Romania remains the only country in Eastern Europe not to manufacture any kind of contraceptive. Thus supplies, including condoms, must be imported and are too expensive for many women, who say they have trouble even getting food on the table in the chaotic Romanian economy. Birth control pills imported from Hungary, the Netherlands or Germany cost as much for a month's supply -- or in many cases up to two or three times as much -- as an abortion, even though Western aid helps subsidize some of the cost.
The Western aid stems from publicity in 1990 about the plight of the unwanted Romanian children. Foreign assistance was sent to help care for the children, and for a longer-term solution, funds were offered to create family- planning services, including a $14 million World Bank loan and a $5 million grant from the United States Agency for International Development.
In the last year, a little progress has been made, but not enough given the resources that have been made available, those who work in the program say.
According to a report by Adriana Baban, a psychologist who counsels at one of the Romanian family-planning clinics funded by the A.I.D., and Dr. Henry P. David, director of the Transnational Family Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, Romania had at least 445 deaths attributable to illegal abortion in 1989. By 1992, the number had been reduced to 120 and last year to 59.
But despite these reductions of deaths from self-induced abortions, the pregnancy-related mortality rate remains startlingly high. The World Health Organization reported that in 1990, for every 100,000 live births in Romania, 84 women died in childbirth. By contrast, the rate in Poland was 19. Last year, the number in Romania was 48. In the United States last year, the rate was 8, according to the Population Reference Bureau.

HEADLINE: All Aid Is Political

BYLINE: By Chester A. Crocker; Chester A. Crocker, a professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University, was Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Nothing better illustrates the lessons and risks of humanitarian intervention than the fast-changing situation in Central Africa. It reminds us that intervention (just like nonintervention) is an inherently political action with inescapable political consequences.
The United States should have learned this in Bosnia, Somalia and northern Iraq. Labeling an intervention humanitarian may temporarily allay the qualms of public opinion, but it does not dilute the political effects on a region. By the same token, if we decide not to step into a crisis, our determination not to get involved does not free us of political and ethical responsibility for our inaction. 
 Look at Africa. Our post-Somalia paralysis prevented us in 1994 from calling for Western intervention in Rwanda to halt the killing of a half million Tutsi by the Hutu majority. This butchery could have been prevented by the prompt deployment of an international force with a mandate to isolate and disarm the extremist Hutu militia and to detain their leaders for a war crimes tribunal.
When the tide turned and a Tutsi rebel movement (now Rwanda's Government) drove nearly a million Hutu refugees into Zaire, we rushed in to set up refugee camps. But our belated humanitarian spasm did nothing to help the refugees free themselves from the grip of the Hutu militia leaders; nor did we act to turn these warlords over to a war crimes tribunal. The refugee camps soon disrupted Zaire, inflaming Hutu-Tutsi tensions within the country, aggravating relations between Zaire and Rwanda and providing a base for the Hutu militia to raid Rwanda.
Thus, two years later, the Clinton Administration was facing allied and public pressure to "do something" about the impending disaster in Zaire. Despite the obviously political nature of the problem, the United States and Canada were determined to confine any action to a "humanitarian" response, even asking for the agreement of local players before we intervened. Pentagon planners, fearing any proximity to ethnic strife, made it clear that the mission was not to police, disarm, detain or arrest anyone.
To the Administration's vast relief, the refugee crisis largely resolved itself last weekend. No American ground troops will be sent to Zaire, although military airlifts and logistical support will be needed. How did it all change so quickly? Because the Rwandan Government and Zairean rebels took matters into their own hands, fearing that the United States might make the problem worse by sustaining and nourishing the camps.
Zairean rebels (mostly local Tutsi acting in coordination with the Rwandan Government) liberated perhaps 600,000 Hutu refugees near Goma from their militia warlords; the same thing is likely to happen at camps farther south. Hutu civilians rushed to return to Rwanda, while Hutu remnants of the former Rwandan Army and the militia and their followers are moving deeper into Zaire.
So what are the real lessons here? Most important, if America is not prepared to use its muscle to address underlying political problems, it should think twice about creating and sustaining humanitarian safe havens and corridors. When humanitarian action becomes unavoidable, it is equally vital that we link it to a broader political strategy.
In Central Africa, that strategy should have been to clamp down on the Hutu extremists who organized the hatred through radio campaigns and unleashed the carnage in the first place. It is not too late to provide help in this regard; we should share our intelligence reports with some area governments and provide legal expertise and financial aid to further the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
Also, greater care should be taken in describing problems in Central Africa and elsewhere as "ethnic conflicts." If it were that simple, would hundreds of thousands of Hutu be streaming back to their villages in Tutsi-controlled Rwanda?
Civil wars are too volatile and costly to handle reactively. Before violence erupts again, we should more actively push Central African nations toward political solutions. In moving on from the Mobutu era and solving its many problems -- revitalizing the economy, instituting democracy, restoring collapsing institutions -- Zaire needs help from the United States and its allies. And it needs help now, before the next "humanitarian" crisis forces our hand.

Note Auction Success Sends Bonds Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose in late trading yesterday, following a note auction that was better than expected and by a rebound in the dollar.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32 , to 1014/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.41 percent, from 6.43 percent on Tuesday. 
 Bond prices rose after the Treasury successfully sold $12.5 billion in new five-year notes, following the sale of $18.25 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday. The five-year notes sold at a discount of 5.95 percent, down from 6.325 percent at the last auction in October and the lowest rate since Feb. 28.
"The auction did go well," said William Gross, managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif. He added that bids from Wall Street firms could have handled three times the securities that were sold, indicating strong market interest.
After the auction news was out, the dollar began retracing early losses against the yen on a report by Kyodo News Service that Japan's Ministry of Finance was closing Hanwa Bank, a regional bank, because of insolvency.
The report sent Japanese and American investors fleeing to the relative safety of the dollar and dollar-denominated securities, said Paul Kasriel, chief domestic economist at Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
"It just reinforces the view that the Japanese economy still has a lot of problems and that interest rates are not going to be rising there any time soon, which helps the dollar," Mr. Kasriel said.
Bond prices started the day lower after the Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit climbed to $11.3 billion in September, the worst showing since an all-time high of $11.6 billion in July, as oil imports rose. Analysts had expected a slight narrowing, believing a downturn in the economy would dampen demand in the United States for foreign products.
The long bond was down a quarter-point at midday, but rallied when the auction results were made public around 2 P.M. and then again as the dollar advanced.
Further scrutiny of the trade deficit data calmed some fears in the bond market as well, as analysts noted slower growth in the gross national product than had previously been suspected, Mr. Kasriel of Northern Trust said.
"The trade numbers really weren't as bad in fundamental terms as they looked," he said.
"We did buy more oil, and we paid a higher price for it. But we didn't ship as many aircraft, and now we know that Boeing's orders are very strong both domestically and foreign," so aircraft exports going forward are going to be strong.
Prices of short-term Treasury securities ended unchanged, while intermediate maturities rose between one-eighth point and one-quarter point, reported Dow Jones Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.40 point, to 1,262.66.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 117 3/4, up from 11719/32 on Tuesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.72 percent, down from 5.73 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes yesterday:

High Price . . . 99.680

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
With the Mud Flying, Race for Mayor Begins

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
And suddenly, in a furor of radio ads and accusations, the 1997 mayoral campaign has begun on a distinctly rancorous note, very possibly foreshadowing the tone for the year to come.
With a swiftness and bitterness that have surprised many local politicians, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his most prominent opponent for re-election, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, have already prepared thinly disguised attack advertisements on the radio and are charging each other with improprieties. The ads are ostensibly about the Mayor's proposal to allow superstores in parts of New York City, but their propulsion systems are clearly political. 
 Ms. Messinger's ad touts her as a "mom who raised three kids" and says the Mayor "may not care what you want for your neighborhood." The Mayor's ad blasts the "politicians and special interests" who are deliberately keeping prices high by prohibiting superstores.
He accused Ms. Messinger of abusing the campaign finance law by spending public money on her ads, and -- though he was unable to substantiate the contention -- said she had "cheated" in her financing of two previous races. Ms. Messinger, saying the Mayor needed to take a Valium and some "truth serum," criticized him for not revealing who is paying for his ads.
Similar skirmishes have also occurred in recent weeks between Mr. Giuliani and various potential opponents over such matters as the sale of public hospitals, the size of the education budget, and the battle with Time Warner Cable, making it clear that virtually any contentious issue is fuel for the political crucible.
Four years ago, when Mr. Giuliani was preparing his second run against David N. Dinkins, the acrimony was nowhere near this level. There was some early jousting over Mr. Dinkins's response to the Crown Heights disturbances, but there was no explicit name-calling, and the ads were months away. Rarely, in fact, do mayoral campaigns accelerate quite as rapidly as this one has in the fortnight since the Presidential election.
The Mayor's supporters blame Ms. Messinger, who they say started it all by running such a harsh radio ad and using money from her own public budget to pay for it. Having maintained a strong stand against the unfettered development of superstores for more than a year, Ms. Messinger does seem to have left herself vulnerable to such criticism by not using any of the $1.3 million in campaign money she has raised to pay for the $7,400 ad.
"Her commercials use taxpayer money under the guise of spelling out her view," said Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader and one of the Mayor's close political advisers. "She's the one who attacks Giuliani by name and refers to herself as a mom who raised three kids. Why should the taxpayers have to pay for her attacks on the person of the Mayor?" Another of Mr. Giuliani's allies, Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, has filed a formal complaint about the ads with the city Conflicts of Interest Board.
To some degree, the direction of the campaign so far reflects the nature of running against a strong incumbent best known for reducing crime and working to restore a perception of order to the city, still the most important issues for many voters. Opponents are forced to seize upon the remaining issues -- education, hospitals, superstores, among others -- and hammer hard at those areas where the Mayor may be vulnerable.
But Mr. Giuliani's political style has also clearly contributed to the current decibel level. For weeks he has been attacking his most likely opponents as "old-fashioned politicians" or "machine politicians" who have personally caused the problems he has had to fix. Having made it apparent over the last three years that he considers a personal attack a legitimate response to those who oppose him, he has built up an atmosphere at City Hall in which every policy debate -- whether over the budget, union contracts, education, or crime -- quickly escalates into a confrontation.
"I believe what is happening now comes as a result of the perception, which is factual, that Giuliani will readily engage in gutter politics," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a former supporter of Mr. Giuliani and now a confirmed opponent. "These other candidates, therefore, have decided that to protect themselves, they have got to begin early and sling as much mud as he does. It's bad for the city, because it brings everyone down to the lowest common swamp denominator."
Ms. Messinger said she thought the Mayor had set a negative tone earlier this month when he denigrated each of his potential opponents by name. But the decision to run the advertisements, she said, was made because the superstore zoning issue is before the City Council, and was unrelated to Mr. Giuliani's remarks. She used public money for the ads because she considers fighting the zoning proposal part of her job, she said.
In response to questions first raised by Ms. Messinger, the Giuliani administration yesterday released the names of four people who are helping to raise money for the Mayor's ad campaign on superstores: Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Investment Fund, a nonprofit group that promotes economic development; Edward J. Molloy, president of the Building Trades Council; Joseph Fedele, co-owner of the Fairway supermarket in Harlem, and Joe Wiscovitch, owner of an advertising agency that specializes in marketing products to the Hispanic community.
Mr. Wiscovitch, the designated spokesman for the group, which is calling itself the Committee for Consumer Choice, said the names of contributors were not yet available because fund raising was still going on. He said the group hoped to raise at least $100,000 for its ad campaign, which will begin criticizing "special interests" next week.
And there are still 348 days until the election.

HEADLINE: Treasury Report Will Oppose Federal Taxes on Internet Sales

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department, struggling to devise a tax policy that keeps up with the rapid growth of electronic commerce, will publish a draft report today that outlines the Administration's opposition to new Federal taxes on the Internet but underscores its determination that the global computer network not become a haven for tax evaders.
"We absolutely reject the idea that the Internet is some sort of golden goose whose feathers should be taxed," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said. "The key message of the report is, no Internet taxes." 
 The report, which will be posted for public comment on the Treasury Department's World Wide Web site (www.ustreas.gov), will make no formal policy recommendations. Treasury officials said the report would advocate an "overarching goal of neutrality," at least on the Federal level, when it comes to the Internet.
"Neutrality means we shouldn't treat a transaction any differently because it occurs over the Internet, as compared to one that does not occur over the Internet," one senior Treasury official, who insisted that he not be identified, said. "We can take existing tax principles and evolve them."
Although the 50-page report is intended to disclose the Clinton Administration's general thinking on key issues affecting global electronic commerce and taxation, it will not specifically address the issues of state and local taxation on electronic transactions and on-line services.
A number of states, including New York, are considering the possibility of new sales and use taxes on the Internet and on-line information services, which have attracted tens of millions of consumers and hundreds of thousands of businesses in recent years.
The report outlines the challenges faced by tax officials in a world where buyers and sellers can be anonymous, where transactions take place in cyberspace and where both money and products exist as flurries of electronic bits.
"The issue is really whether they can effectively maintain an income tax, as electronic commerce grows and people start using digital cash, especially if it can be used anonymously," said Andrew Whinston, a professor of computer science and economics at the University of Texas in Austin.
"There is also the issue of illegal transactions," Dr. Whinston said. "For example, drug transactions that are now conducted with a suitcase of $100 bills can potentially escape detection on the Internet. This in turn gets into the issue of key escrow encryption policy, and whether the Government has the right to decrypt certain messages to see whether they are concealing violations of the law."
According to industry analysts, the value of computer-based electronic commerce in the United States is expected to expand to more than $70 billion a year by the end of the decade, from slightly more than $500 million this year.
Besides the Federal Government, many of the country's more than 30,000 state and local taxing authorities have taken an interest in that flow of money. Computer and on-line industry executives, as well as many Internet users, have been alarmed by the recent proposals and suggestions, mainly on the state level, to impose new taxes, beyond standard sales taxes, on Internet use and transactions.
But the Internet poses legal and technical issues for tax officials. For example, where does a transaction take place: at the user's personal computer; at the Internet service provider's computer, which may be in another state, or at the seller's computer, which may be in a different country?
And, how can tax officials monitor transactions when technologies like digital cash make it possible to buy and sell anonymously?
The report is likely to calm some Internet companies fearful of new or redundant taxes, at least on the Federal level, but other analysts said it missed a chance to simplify the tax code, especially as the Internet becomes a major force in international commerce.
"Why evolve a mess?" said Bill Bluestein, director of new media research at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "Why not take the opportunity to simplify it?"
Mr. Bluestein said attempts to add new taxes on the Internet "take away the ability to use the Internet as a more efficient delivery channel, which would ultimately benefit consumers by lowering costs."
Ellen K. Fishbein, assistant general counsel for America Online Inc., said the Interactive Services Association, a trade group whose members include most of the country's largest on-line service providers, was preparing its own position paper on Internet taxation, expected to be released within a month.
"Our goals are uniformity for definitions and rates between the states," Ms. Fishbein said, "but we view it as a stepping stone on how to deal with taxation globally. Whatever concepts we come up with need to be applied everywhere."
The Government report was prepared by Treasury Department experts with support from the White House, the office of the Vice President and the National Economic Council.
"We view this as the beginning of the process of getting comments," the senior Treasury Department official said. "We can see that the developments on the Internet are dramatic, and they are accelerating. This is our attempt to stay ahead of the curve."

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT WORSENS, AND GAP WITH CHINA GROWS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
As President Clinton prepares to press top Chinese officials to open their market more fully to American goods, the Government reported today that the trade deficit with China rose in September to another record. It was part of one of the widest overall monthly trade gaps posted by the United States in years.
The Commerce Department said the nation's overall trade deficit for September unexpectedly surged to $11.3 billion, $1 billion higher than a month earlier and the second-highest gap, after July's $11.6 billion, since the Government adopted its current measurement system in 1992. Economists had predicted a decline of $1 billion or more. 
 For the second consecutive month and the third time this year, the deficit with China was the largest with any nation, further evidence of how China is supplanting Japan as the primary source of trade tension for the United States.
Mr. Clinton is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin of China in the Philippines on Sunday at a gathering of Asian leaders, and Mr. Clinton is expected to insist that China break a long pattern of intransigence and lower its trade barriers if it wants to join the global trade body, the World Trade Organization. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met today with China's leaders in part to prepare the ground for Mr. Clinton's meeting. [Page A10.]
With the two nations also at odds over issues including human rights and nuclear arms, Mr. Clinton spoke in upbeat terms today about the opportunity to "sustain an engagement" with China and improve relations across a broad front.
"The United States and China will continue to have our differences, especially in the area of human rights, and we will continue to discuss them candidly," Mr. Clinton said in Australia, where he was visiting before attending the meeting of Asian leaders.
"But by working together where possible and dealing with our differences openly and respectfully when necessary, we can deepen our dialogue and add to Asia's stability."
The trade deficit with China was $4.73 billion in September, up just fractionally from its August level but nearly $1 billion higher than the September deficit with Japan, which was down marginally from a month earlier.
While the cumulative deficit with Japan for the first nine months of the years remained larger than the deficit with China, the trade gap with Japan was down 27 percent for the period while it grew 14 percent with China.
Today's figures led critics of the Administration's trade policies to complain that Mr. Clinton's team has been long on rhetoric but short on results when it comes to prying open foreign markets and reducing the deficit. The overall trade deficit has grown in each year of his Presidency and is on track to exceed last year's total of $105 billion.
"The fact is there has been a leadership void in U.S. trade policy during the last year," said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on trade.
The rise in the overall deficit was driven in part by surging oil prices, which pushed up the value of imports, and by a strong dollar and weak economic growth among a number of major trading partners, which held down demand for American goods and services abroad.
Despite the sharp slowdown in the American economy in recent months, higher oil prices kept imports steady at $80.1 billion in September. More recently, oil prices have fallen somewhat, raising the prospect of a decline in that element of the trade deficit.
Exports, which had been one of the primary sources of strength in the American economy, declined by $1 billion in September to $68.8 billion. The total was depressed somewhat by a decline in exports of aircraft and parts, which fluctuate sharply because commercial airliners are individually so expensive and are usually ordered in bunches.
On the other side of the ledger, exports of automobiles and parts reached a record high of $5.9 billion.
The unexpected rise in the trade gap for September led some analysts to project that economic growth estimates for both the third and fourth quarters would have to be scaled back. The Government's original estimate of third-quarter growth, 2.2 percent, already down sharply from the 4.7 percent growth rate in the spring, may now be revised downward to around 1.5 percent.
"This was truly a pathetic performance that raises some questions about the extent of growth going forward," said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Philadelphia.
"Yes, the entire increase in the goods deficit can be traced to higher petroleum imports, and as the price declines, the nominal trade deficit will decline as well," Mr. Naroff said. "But the situation with China has become critical."
Senator Grassley called the coming meetings between the American and Chinese leaders "yet another opportunity to establish the terms of the relationship the U.S. will have with China."
"While the latest trade deficit numbers show that it's important to have China in the W.T.O.," he said, "the Administration must insist that China enter under terms that are fair to the American people."
Although the growth in exports has slowed this year, Mickey Kantor, the Secretary of Commerce, said the overall level of exports would again set a record, reflecting the improved competitiveness of American industry and market-opening agreements with Japan and other nations.
Mr. Kantor said the September trade figures would "really have no effect" on negotiations with China. Those talks have proved almost unremittingly frustrating to the United States over the last few years despite China's professed commitment to agreements like one seeking to control Chinese piracy of videos, software and other intellectual property.
"We have continued concerns over market access in China within the industrial and agricultural sectors," said Mr. Kantor, who was the Administration's chief trade negotiator before he was named Commerce Secretary earlier this year. "We've been heartened to some degree by China's willingness to implement the second intellectual property agreement, but we've not made appreciable progress with regard to their accession to the W.T.O."
China's Finance Minister, Liu Zhongli, said in Washington on Tuesday that the trade gap between the nations was an "old issue" that was exacerbated by differing systems of measuring trade flows.
Mr. Liu also said the United States could help its trade position by relaxing export controls on many types of technologies that would find ready buyers in China.
The deficit with China has risen for six consecutive months, even as the two nations have wrangled with little apparent progress over how fast China should be subject to the free trade obligations that would come with membership in the World Trade Organization and its right to protect state-owned enterprises and certain sectors of the economy from international competition.
The increase in the last several months has been caused partly by seasonal imports of Chinese-made toys and Christmas ornaments, analysts said.
But it also reflects sweeping changes in the structure of Asian economies generally, with Japanese and South Korean companies, among others, seeking low-wage manufacturing sites in China.
"It looks fairly clear that a fair bit of production that used to take place in other Asian nations has now moved to China," Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, said after meeting with Mr. Liu on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Retailers Left Out of Computer-Stock Boom

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The holiday season is when the consumer is king of the personal computer industry. So the recent fall in the stock prices of computer retailers like CompUSA, Circuit City Stores and Best Buy has some investors and analysts scratching their heads.
How is it, they wonder, that the retailers can be doing so badly when stocks of the companies making the products they are trying to sell -- like I.B.M. and Compaq Computer -- are doing so well? 
 "What that tells you is that the computers are selling somewhere else, or we are all going to be in for a rude awakening after the first of the year," said Louis Mazzucchelli, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company in New York.
October saw the worst comparisons in sales from stores open at least a year in the history of the PC industry, David Childe, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, said it would stop selling computers at 629 stores, or 25 percent of the chain, because of their poor sales.
CompUSA shares plunged 9 percent on Tuesday after Montgomery Securities lowered its rating on the stock to a "hold" from a "buy." The stock rebounded yesterday, closing at $46.625, up $1.875. Still, Circuit City shares were down 62.5 cents, closing at $33.625, and Best Buy was unchanged at $13, only slightly more than its 52-week low.
Even as the retailers' stocks have slid, manufacturers are reaching all-time highs based in large part on predictions of booming sales of personal computers. I.B.M. has risen $15.75 a share, or about 12 percent in the last week. It closed yesterday at $152.625, down $1.50. Compaq shares slipped 12.5 cents yesterday to $80.375 after setting an all-time high on Tuesday. Shares in the Intel and Microsoft Corporations, which sell the main components of most PC's, have also been soaring.
"You've got money managers chasing performance," said Fred Hickey, the editor of the High Tech Strategist, a monthly newsletter based in Nashua, N.H. "That is how you get the difference between perception and reality."
To Mr. Hickey and other technology bears, retail sales are a leading indicator of overall personal computer demand. Last year, computer stocks also boomed on the eve of the Christmas season because investors were convinced that Windows 95, the new PC operating system from Microsoft, would produce record sales. When such sales did not materialize, retailers were left with large inventories that cast a pall over the industry for much of this year.
Now, just as the industry has gotten over that hurdle, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and other established manufacturers of home PC's are facing stiff new competition from Japanese computer makers that are determined to get a slice of the United States market.
Mr. Hickey said that Toshiba recently cut the price of its home computer featuring a 166-megahertz Pentium microprocessor to $1,699 after Compaq cut the price of its comparable offering to $1,799. Both machines were introduced in September at prices around $2,500. Mr. Hickey estimated that the total cost of producing such a machine was about $1,700, leaving little or no profit for the manufacturer.
But other analysts said that bears like Mr. Hickey were not accounting for some important changes in the computer industry.
Tom Courtney, the analyst at Montgomery Securities who helped send CompUSA's stock tumbling, still says that industry forecasts of 18 percent growth in PC sales over all this year are on target.
That is because measuring growth in stores open at least a year does not take into account the large number of new stores that electronics retailers have opened in the last year.
"While computer sales may be down at stores that were operating last year, overall retail computer sales were up," he said.
The greater threat to computer retailers is not declining demand, Mr. Courtney added, but a change in buying patterns. His recent study of the top seven retailers showed that a growing number of consumers are buying machines through mail-order companies rather than at retailers.
"The retail channel is slowing and the direct channel is growing," Mr. Courtney said.
That would appear to benefit direct computer vendors like the Dell Computer Corporation and Gateway 2000 Inc. But analysts said that Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. would gain because corporate sales will be stronger than usual this year, compensating for the weaker consumer sales.
Computer Intelligence Inc., a market research company in San Diego, estimated that corporate sales would soar in the fourth quarter compared with virtually no growth last year. The biggest driver behind such sales, the company said, is the adoption of Window NT, Microsoft's operating system for corporate networks.
"We saw a strong upgrade cycle starting in the third quarter this year that we believe will extend to next year's second quarter," said Matthew Sargent, a Computer Intelligence analyst.
But Brian Kritzler, a technology analyst at Van Kasper & Company in San Francisco, said that the sales of Windows NT anticipated by Microsoft could not generate enough computer sales to justify the current rally in computer hardware stocks.
Then again, few analysts are able to justify the rally. Daniel Mandresh, the analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company who sparked I.B.M.'s rise on Friday by raising his 12-month price target to $195 a share from $150, is at a loss to explain the market reaction.
"I caught the crest of the wave," he said yesterday. "So help me, to my knowledge nothing has changed other than the fact that more people are willing to say glowing things about the same company that existed last Thursday."

HEADLINE: Christopher, in Beijing, Sees Better Relations With China

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Seeking a fresh start in tattered relations with an emerging superpower, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met today with China's leaders and said he was hopeful of a better, more stable relationship in the future.
After meetings with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Prime Minister Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, Mr. Christopher made no claims to more than slight progress on specific areas like trade, human rights and American arms sales to Taiwan. In those and other areas, both countries acknowledged huge differences that cannot be talked away. 
 But after a first term of the Clinton Administration in which relations with China were buffeted by disputes over Taiwan, protection of copyrights, suspected Chinese sales of nuclear equipment to Pakistan and trade and human rights issues, the atmosphere had improved, American officials said.
"The Chinese have made a strategic decision to build a constructive relationship with the United States, and they'll make some reasonable efforts to insure that it happens," a senior American official said. "Without claiming any major breakthrough, we've made systematic progress since last spring, enough to at least stabilize the relationship."
The Americans, for their part, have made known their desire not to let continuing concerns over China's treatment of political dissidents and religious opponents jeopardize cooperation in other spheres.
Mr. Christopher's visit was meant, in part, to prepare the ground for President Clinton's meeting this weekend with China's President at an economic conference in the Philippines. The two leaders are expected to agree to exchange visits, a gesture China has long sought.
In Australia today, en route to the conference, President Clinton pledged to work for a stronger United States relationship with China.
"The United States has no interest in containing China," Mr. Clinton said. "That is a negative strategy. What the United States wants is to sustain an engagement with China" to try to "increase the chances that there will be more liberty and more prosperity."
At the same time, Mr. Clinton said in a speech to the Australian Parliament, "the United States and China will continue to have our differences, especially in the area of human rights, and we will continue to discuss them candidly."
Today's visit to Beijing was only Mr. Christopher's second in the last four years. In March 1994, he had a disastrous visit to Beijing, talking tough on human rights and linking trade relations to an improvement in them, only to have Mr. Clinton reverse that policy. In 1995, relations chilled after Washington granted a visa to Taiwan's leader for a private visit to the United States.
In recent months the Clinton Administration has adopted a new strategy toward China, in which positive ties will be promoted where possible and no single issue, such as human rights or trade disputes, should dominate the relationship.
The Chinese praised Mr. Christopher for "important improvement" in bilateral ties, and a Chinese spokesman said both sides "indicated a willingness to keep up the momentum for improvement."
Differences between the two countries were serious and would persist, American officials said, but the Chinese were more willing today to discuss them, while concentrating on issues of shared concern like North Korea, the spread of nuclear technology and the global ban on nuclear tests that both countries support.
Given China's improved record on nuclear nonproliferation, since a pledge in May not to ship nuclear-related materials to unmonitored plants, Mr. Christopher said there was room for further, limited cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy.
The Chinese, in turn, agreed today to adopt regulations to prevent questionable exports.
But both sides also highlighted areas of concern. Mr. Qian, in a news conference before meeting Mr. Christopher, said that Taiwan was China's prime concern and how it was handled would help define future bilateral relations. He urged the United States to slow and eventually to halt arms sales to Taiwan, as agreed in a 1982 joint communique negotiated by President Reagan.
"We can only be reassured when this promise is turned into a reality," Mr. Qian said. "China is most concerned about massive sales of U.S. weapons to Taiwan," which is receiving 150 F-16 jet fighters and Patriot antimissile systems.
American officials said they reassure China at every opportunity about Washington's commitment to the 1982 communique and Taiwan's status as a part of China to be eventually reunited with the mainland. But the Americans said they have no intention of stopping arms sales to Taiwan in the meantime.
At the same time, American officials admit privately that their decision last year to bow to Congressional pressure and grant the Taiwanese President, Lee Teng-hui, a visa to enter America for a college reunion was a mistake. The visit led to shows of military force by China and, in response, the United States Navy.
Mr. Christopher and his aides said that he spent as much time discussing Chinese human rights issues as he did on any other topic with Chinese leaders and repeated the American view that the relationship could not reach "its full flowering" so long as China continues to mistreat its own citizens.
Mr. Li, the Prime Minister, was willing to debate human rights but only in general terms, American officials said, and refused to discuss individual cases, which the Chinese regard as matters of domestic law.
For China, one important test of relations is whether the United States will support its entry into the World Trade Organization under terms that will allow a more gradual end to Chinese protectionism than the organization has demanded. The Americans say they are willing to negotiate some concessions, provided there is progress in reducing some trade barriers and in other areas like intellectual piracy.
Chinese wariness about Mr. Christopher and his visit was evident in the heavy security presence in Beijing and the lack of an official banquet for him, although American officials say he was offered one.

HEADLINE: As Debate Over Megastores Rages, One Opens in Queens

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
As the dispute over the future of superstores in New York City continued to boil at City Hall, one of the biggest of the so-called warehouse stores, Costco, opened its doors in Queens yesterday, selling food and household goods in bulk at low prices. And judging by the crowds, New Yorkers appeared eager to welcome the store, a staple of suburban shopping.
Price Costco, a leader in the $45-billion-a-year membership warehouse club industry, owns and operates more than 270 superstores in the United States and abroad under the names Price Club and Costco, and it plans to open another outlet today in Brooklyn. Business owners and individuals must pay an annual fee of $30 or $35, respectively, for the right to use the stores. 
 The Giuliani administration has maintained that the lack of such retailers in the five boroughs has forced many city shoppers to the suburbs, and it has proposed zoning changes to make it easy for the megastores to locate in manufacturing areas.
Yesterday, with most of the 500 parking spaces at the Queens Costco full before noon, it was clear that many shoppers appreciated having such a store closer to home.
David Wolff, 44, a writer who lives on Roosevelt Island, described the supermarket he uses there as "horrible, beyond awful." Having been to Price Clubs in Hackensack, N.J., and Old Westbury, L.I., he had waited for years, he said, for a membership warehouse store to enter the New York City market.
"You can go a little crazy the first time," Mr. Wolff said, leaning over a jumbo shopping cart containing a 2-pound bag of Starbucks coffee beans ($10.99), a 5-pound package of boneless chicken breasts ($13.10) and a 33-ounce bottle of Pert shampoo ($5.70).
The new store, at 32-50 Vernon Boulevard near Broadway in Astoria, consists of two beige warehouse-style buildings covering 130,000 square feet. It sprawls over five acres previously occupied by a steel manufacturer.
The property is in a residential zone. But because the last occupant was there before the passage of the 1961 zoning laws still in effect, Costco was able to put its store at the site without a special review.
George Delis, the district manager for Community Board 1, said Costco encountered little opposition, although there were some concerns about traffic.
"In my opinion, it has taken an area that could use an uplift," Mr. Delis said. "The local community people love it because the Price Club is very popular, and now they have to go to Nassau County."
Many of the shoppers on hand yesterday were already members of Price Club, with some saying they regularly visited the outlet in Old Westbury. One membership is good for all Price Clubs and Costcos.
The store carries a staggering variety of merchandise: 2.5-gallon jugs of Mazola corn oil, best-selling books, 15-roll packages of Bounty paper towels, evergreen wreaths, television sets, 200-ounce containers of Tide detergent, dog food, luggage, diamond engagement rings, cinnamon buns and just about anything else imaginable.
"It gives an opportunity for people at a certain income level to get more value," said Faith Hope Consolo, senior managing director at Garrick-Aug Associates, a nationwide retail leasing company based in Manhattan.
"In today's economy, where we see this happening in apparel and toys, it's important that it be available across the market, and that includes food. Otherwise, those people go out of state to shop."
Last December, a Costco store opened on Richmond Avenue in Staten Island, the first in New York City. The Brooklyn store scheduled to open today is at Third Avenue and 39th Street in Sunset Park. And a fourth store is to open on Eighth Avenue and 34th Street in Manhattan in 1998, said Robert Kyle, a regional marketing manager for Price Costco.
But Price Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., and formed in 1993 with the merger of Price Club and Costco Wholesale, takes its membership concept seriously. Eligible members include those employed in such fields as government, utilities, media, banking, health care and education.
Professional and licensed individuals, including real estate agents, lawyers and architects, are also eligible.
David Poneman, a retailing analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment research firm in Manhattan, said the intent of the restrictions was not to exclude "employed responsible adults" but to keep out minors. "They don't want it browsed by shoplifting teen-agers," he said.

HEADLINE: Chicago, Joined by an Array of Dignitaries, Bids Farewell to Cardinal Bernardin

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
It was a very long goodbye, and it had to be. For three days, all Chicago, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, seemed to be bidding farewell to Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, whispering one last prayer and blinking away a final tear for a soft-spoken religious leader whose life and death touched so many here.
Starting Monday, more than 100,000 people wound day and night past the Cardinal's open coffin in Holy Name Cathedral, a procession interrupted by a series of memorial services there conducted not only by Roman Catholic clerics but also by leaders of other denominations and even other religions. 
 And it was not just Chicago that grieved for its Archbishop, who died of cancer last Thursday at the age of 68. Today, in final ceremonies that rivaled any major state funeral, a cathedral full of civic and religious dignitaries, including Vice President Al Gore and personal representatives of Pope John Paul II, commended to God a churchman whose personality and leadership transcended class, race and even creed.
Then the church bore Cardinal Bernardin's coffin to Mount Carmel Cemetery in the nearby community of Hillside, a journey that, like the Cardinal, spanned the city in all its parts.
One hundred cars strong, the funeral procession passed down Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile through the newly gentrified near West Side close by the convention center where the Democrats met in August. It continued through poverty-shattered neighborhoods, where the people lining the streets were as likely to be Baptist as Catholic and where black and Hispanic children from Catholic schools sang and tossed flowers at the passing hearse. It went on through old affluent suburbs and newer working-class ones to the cemetery, where Cardinal Bernardin was laid to rest alongside other bishops in a special mausoleum. As the coffin was carried into the mausoleum, 15,000 people watched in cold and snow flurries.
Earlier, from the pulpit of Holy Name Cathedral, Msgr. Kenneth Velo, the fellow worker of many years whom Cardinal Bernardin had asked to give the funeral sermon, addressed the 1,300 assembled mourners -- relatives and friends of the Archbishop, and many dignitaries. They included not only the Vice President and his wife, Tipper, but also Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff; Jim Edgar, the Governor of Illinois, and Richard M. Daley, the Mayor of Chicago.
But Monsignor Velo said he was speaking as well to people listening on their car radios or watching television in hospitals and nursing homes.
"You are all dignitaries," Monsignor Velo said, "for God has touched you through the life of Cardinal Bernardin."
"He brought people together," the monsignor added. "He was a unifier."
Although the ceremonies today had a magnificence and a solemnity suited to Cardinal Bernardin's high rank in the church, the funeral liturgy was ultimately the same one, the Mass of Christian Burial, as for the humblest believer.
And it carried the same message, repeated over and over: "that God has created each person for eternal life and that Jesus in death and Resurrection has broken the chains of sin and death," as Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles, whom Cardinal Bernardin had asked to be the chief celebrant of the Mass, said at its outset.
Still, there were aspects of these three days of services that reflected much that was particular about Cardinal Bernardin's role in the church here.
The Cardinal had stitched extraordinarily close ties among different religious groups in Chicago, and especially between Catholics and Jews. That was an achievement reflected in the ecumenical prayer service over his body in the cathedral on Tuesday, and in the Jewish-led memorial there later.
"He was a jewel from God's treasure chest," Rabbi Byron Sherwin, vice president of the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies, said at the latter event, which, although not strictly a religious service, was presided over by three rabbis and four Jewish community leaders, all of whom traveled to Israel with Cardinal Bernardin last year.
Later, on Tuesday night, the steady stream of people paying their respects to the Cardinal was halted yet again, as the cathedral was filled with the archdiocese's priests.
The priests sang, prayed and listened to a two-page letter to them that will be included in "The Gift of Life," a final book by Cardinal Bernardin to be published early next year.
"The things people remember most are small acts of concern and thoughtfulness," the Cardinal wrote. "Years later, that is what they tell you about their priests and other clergy." By "simple goodness," he said, the clergy can be a symbol of the transcendant that people of all faiths, or of none, have a yearning to touch.
That certainly seemed to be true in the Cardinal's own case, especially after he was found to be suffering from cancer and underwent treatment in 1995 -- and then took up helping other cancer patients as a special ministry.
"He seldom said no," Monsignor Velo said in the sermon today. "He would write thank-you letters for thank-you letters."
Again and again, Chicagoans this week have talked of an encouraging note or word they got from the Cardinal, or simply of the example he set in meeting his own suffering.
At 2 A.M. on Tuesday morning, Cindy Jaso, an unemployed data clerk, stood in the line outside the cathedral to pay her respects. "My mom is on dialysis, and my dad was in a car accident," she said. Cardinal Bernardin "was so courageous at the end -- he didn't take time for his own illness. I wish I was handling it as well."
Another in the line, which stretched for two blocks in 35-degree weather, was Paul Janoviak, a 37-year-old police officer in the suburban town of Oak Lawn. "He's a sincere example of decency, which I don't see in my business too often," Officer Janoviak said.
In his funeral sermon, Monsignor Velo did not skip painful episodes: bitter protests that ensued after Cardinal Bernardin had decided that archdiocesan finances required closing some parishes, and accusations of sexual abuse made against the Cardinal in 1994, later retracted by the accuser. But Monsignor Velo noted that such episodes had repeatedly ended in the Cardinal's forgiveness and in reconciliation.
On Tuesday night, beginning a litany at the priests' service, a reader prayed, "For his powerful presence of healing and forgiveness so gently offered to the lost, the alienated and those fragmented by division or blinded by anger, we praise and thank you, O God."
And in the darkened cathedral, lighted only by the candles in the priests' hands and the tall Easter candle burning by the Cardinal's coffin, the response came back: "Blessed be God forever."

HEADLINE: Americans Straddle the Average Mark in Math and Science

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
In the most comprehensive study of science and mathematics achievement by students around the world, students in the United States ranked slightly below average in mathematics and slightly above average in science, according to an international comparison of 41 countries released yesterday.
Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and the Czech Republic were among the top-ranking nations of those surveyed. Colombia and South Africa were among the lowest. The United States results did not differ significantly from some other Western nations like Canada, England and Germany. 
 The survey reflected neither the most extreme proclamations of persistent educational decline that have become part of the political landscape, nor the hopes of some educators that a decade of education "reform" would have produced more striking gains by students in the United States.
But the results are further proof that the United States has virtually no chance of meeting the national goal set out in 1990 to make its students first in the world in mathematics and science by the year 2000. And it reflects the degree to which any education progress in this country is being matched or exceeded by many other countries around the world.
"You can put the results together and say our results compared to the rest of the world are average, but in the United States of America in this education era, average is far too low," said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. "What's encouraging is that this is the best data we've ever had on what works best and what it takes to improve math and science performance."
The findings were significant both for what they showed about the relative ranking of Americans and the kinds of practices and attitudes that have produced more impressive student achievement elsewhere.
And despite an education debate in this country that is focused on politically volatile issues like school choice, many education and scientific experts said the results indicated that where American education really needed to focus attention was on the basics: what is taught, how teachers are trained, what is demanded of students.
The countries that performed best tended to be ones like Singapore, where all students are tracked individually and expected to perform, or Japan, where videotapes of teachers done as part of the study showed that Japanese teachers were uniformly better trained and prepared than their peers in the United States. And almost all the best-performing countries had national standards that were clearly being carried out, unlike the situation in the United States.
"What stands out is that we have failed to really emphasize the importance of learning how to teach in this country: it's not the fault of the teachers, its the fault of the system," said Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences. "We're spending the same hours teaching these things as the Japanese, but they're outperforming us by a tremendous margin. We're working as hard, but we haven't stressed curriculum, we haven't stressed teaching, we haven't stressed learning the way some other countries have."
Indeed, a report a month ago -- part of the same international study -- said that both mathematics and science teaching in the United States lacked focus and coherence compared with other countries. Schools teach too many things in a fragmented way, producing inferior results, the report concluded.
The study, the Third International Mathematics and Science Study is part of a survey of 500,000 students, tested in more than 30 different languages, from 15,000 schools in 45 countries. The survey released yesterday examines the mathematics and science performance of seventh and eighth graders in the 41 countries whose results were methodologically comparable. Later reports will look at elementary and high school performance.
Critics of the two previous studies by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement have objected to the comparative nature of such tests. In many cases, they said, poorer students have dropped out of school or are not included in the sample.
But because this study deals almost exclusively with 13-year-olds, "in almost all the countries except the developing countries, just about all the students are still in school at that age," said Dr. Albert E. Beaton, of Boston College, director of the study.
The scores of United States students showed some improvement from earlier studies, which ranked the United States as below average in both subject areas. But because those studies were smaller and less rigorous than the new one, officials said, it was hard to make direct comparisons with them.
On the new test, eighth-grade students showed an average of 500 in mathematics, which was below the international average of 513. Singapore had the top score of 643. The United States ranked 28 out of 41 countries. In science, American eighth-grade students scored 534 compared with an international average of 516. Again Singapore had the top score, 607. The United States ranked 17 out of 41.
Over all, the scores were viewed as not surprising, but a modest disappointment after almost a decade of calls for education reform and signs that Scholastic Assessment Test scores were showing some improvement.
"My sense is that the scores are somewhat disappointing, not catastrophic, but disappointing," said William H. Schmidt, a professor of applied statistics at Michigan State University who was the national research coordinator for the study in the United States.
Some of the findings were striking in the degree to which study habits and patterns of life around the world have become more alike over time.
In places as diverse as the United States, Singapore, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and England, eighth-grade students reported spending about the same amount of time -- 2.6 to 2.7 hours a day -- watching television. Students in the United States, however, reported spending more time playing sports -- just over two hours a day -- than students in any other country.
But in other areas, cultural differences played a clear role in student achievement. The remarkable performance of Singapore was a source of considerable surprise. Larry Suter, deputy director of the division of research, evaluation and communication at the National Science Foundation, said it reflected, in part, cultural differences that would be difficult to duplicate here. Singapore, a small country with a rigidly centralized educational system, monitors the achievement of every student. If a student falls behind, his teacher and parents are notified and steps are taken to improve his performance.
On the other hand, Mr. Suter said many of the top-performing countries had succeeded in making education a widely understood national priority in the way the United States could do but has not. "Many of the countries that performed best, like Japan, are places where education is a top priority from the time a kid enters school," Mr. Suter said.
Other differences are more narrowly focused on educational practices. All the best-performing nations have clear national or federal education standards and expectations. Nothing comparable exists in the United States and the standards that have been drawn up by professional groups have in some cases been adopted in other countries more than they have been here.
One of the most striking findings in the report has to do with teaching practices.
Mathematics teachers were videotaped in Germany, Japan and the United States, and their lessons transcribed so that they could be reviewed without a cultural bias toward one country or another. Of the American teachers, 87 percent were given low marks for lesson content, 13 percent received medium grades and none were given high grades. Of the Japanese teachers, 13 percent got low grades, 57 percent medium grades and 30 percent high grades.
"In Japan teachers don't teach until they've had extensive mentoring and really professional education on how to teach," Mr. Alberts said. "We tend to throw teachers out on their own as soon as they get out of college. I don't think we have to spend a lot more money on education. But we have to be much more focused and coherent about what we're doing."
In teacher training, curriculum, standards and others areas, the report is an indication that while the United States may be improving its education, others, particularly in the Far East are improving faster.
"Southeast Asian and eastern European countries are the powerhouses in these subjects," the Council of Chief State School Officers said in a statement today. "They have a very high national motivational level to improve achievement in mathematics and science as a part of their overall national economic strategies."

U.S. Trade Deficit Rises As China Talks Near
As President Clinton prepared to press top Chinese officials to open their markets more fully to American goods, the Government provided further evidence that China was supplanting Japan as the primary source of trade tension for the United States.
The deficit with China rose in September to another record. It was part of one of the widest overall monthly trade gaps recorded by the United States in years, $11.3 billion, and was up $1 billion from that of a month earlier. Economists had predicted a decline of $1 billion or more. [Page A1.]
 
Dow Hits Another Record
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped to its 10th record this month, in a rally driven by gains in the shares of General Motors, Caterpillar and Boeing. The Dow rose 32.42 points, to 6,430.02, but broader indexes had smaller gains, with the Nasdaq rising 2.32 points, to 1,264.94. [D12.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.41 percent, after the Treasury successfully auctioned $12.5 billion in new five-year notes. [D22.]
 
Employees Sue Smith Barney
At Smith Barney, which quietly paid $1.35 million to settle claims by a managing partner that she was humiliated and discriminated against because she was black and a woman, 25 more current or former employees have joined discrimination suits in New York and California. Smith Barney denies it tolerated sexual harassment or discrimination. [D4.]
 
Intervention Sought on Texaco Suit
In a Federal court motion, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asked to be allowed to intervene in a discrimination suit settled by Texaco last week, raising the possibility that the record settlement might have to be renegotiated. [D4.]
 
Another Quarter Of Profits at Kmart
Kmart reported its second consecutive profitable quarter, after two years of disappointing results, but the company's stock fell after a big gain the day before. Sales remained sluggish, but the chief executive, Floyd Hall, trimmed operating costs enough to produce earnings of $9 million. The average estimate of 20 analysts polled by First Call was for a break-even quarter. [D2.]
 
A Tax Tightrope on the Net
The Treasury Department, struggling to devise a tax policy that keeps up with the rapid growth of electronic commerce, will publish a draft report that outlines the Administration's opposition to new Federal taxes on the Internet but underscores its determination that the global computer network not become a haven for tax evaders. [D7.]
 
Biotechnology Company to Be Sold
Chiroscience Group, a chemical and drug company based in Britain, has agreed to acquire Darwin Molecular, a biotechnology company whose prominent backers include the Microsoft founders William H. Gates and Paul Allen, for about $120 million. [D9.]
 
It's Not Air Force One
Bob Dole's run for the White House may have failed, but that does not mean he is no longer involved in a campaign. Mr. Dole is appearing in a humorous advertisement for Air France, believed to be the first instance in which a Presidential candidate of a major political party has agreed to allow his image to be used for commercial purposes. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D10.]
 
Norfolk Southern Request Denied
A Federal appeals panel kept alive Norfolk Southern's attempt to thwart the merger of CSX and Conrail, but it declined to block the first step of the deal. The panel denied Norfolk Southern's request for an emergency injunction to block CSX's tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail's shares. [D24.]
 
Channel Tunnel Remains Closed
The rail tunnel under the English Channel, shut down since a fire ripped through a freight train en route to Britain on Monday night, may remain closed until the end of this week. Late last night, the safety commission was reported as saying that freight trains could resume using the tunnel. [A5.]

HEADLINE: Now, Ads Bound For Coffee Tables

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON

 BODY:
"ZONA HOME." "The Table: Diane von Furstenburg." "A Tiffany Christmas." "The Ikea Book of Home Design."
In the flagrant age of the advertorial, could the book-as-brochure -- call it the advertome -- be far behind? 
 On the cusp of Christmas 1996, the phenomenon of cross-marketing is all-pervasive: magazines spinning off CD-ROM's and television shows; basketball players trading on their athletic sweat by hawking haut perfumes; fashion designers conjuring up scented candles.
But few promotional devices today lend the heft of respectability like a coffeetable book.
And so, among the more than 800 coffeetable books about design at Barnes & Noble's Lincoln Center store, self-congratulatory volumes abound. "If you want to do a book on design, your only option is to link up with a celebrity or a well-known store to interest a publisher," said Helen Pratt, a New York book agent. "It's not about information; it's about whose information it is."
Today's linkups are so explicitly promotional that some store owners are complaining that even the coffeetable book has been dumbed down. "Zona Home" (Harper Style, $50) is a paean by Louis Sagar to his home-furnishings empire, which brought Southwestern style to SoHo and beyond. "Shabby Chic" (Harper Style, $30) promotes the rumpled, deshabille style (swiped from English grandmothers) as its own. The author, Rachel Ashwell, founded the four Shabby Chic stores in America that sell the look -- and the book.
"Retailers have come to learn that publishing a book expands their market," said Delsie Brainer, a book reviewer at Publishers Weekly. "And writing a book can make a business seem more legitimate. It's all about promoting an image."
Liz Hennessey, the buyer for life-style and interior-design books at Borders, the national chain based in Ann Arbor, Mich., has an explanation for this trend. "We're obsessed with brand names in America," she said. "When you walk into a supermarket you buy the brand you know."
Some books are subtle in their manipulation: London's reigning minimalist architect, John Pawson, recently came out with "Minimum" (Phaidon/Chronicle, $95), whose subtitle could be "Acropolis, Stonehenge and me." In it, Mr. Pawson maximizes his own handsome projects, which he immodestly sprinkles amid images of awesome contributions to architectural history.
In this regard, "Minimal" is not unlike the deceptively commercial "Extraordinary Furniture" (Harry N. Abrams, $60) by David Linley. The book, bolstered by a tour that began in New York last week and was doted on by a bevy of Trumps and Forbeses, offers a glossy romp with Princess Margaret's son (hailed irreverently in Britain as the most famous carpenter since Jesus) through the history of furniture. Among 192 pages of Viscount Linley's favorite things -- Louis XV's bureau at Versailles; Empress Josephine's bed at Malmaison -- are 16 pages of furnishings made and designed by his own firm. The grandeur by association is hard to miss.
"Yes, of course, to include work we've done in the book is quite crassly promotional," said Ruth Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Viscount Linley. "But we feel we can justify it because the work is quite extraordinary, and it is all done by hand." She added, "Not a lot of people want to print a book about furniture."
Derek Ostergard, of the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, agrees with the premise. "The sad thing," he said, "is there are so many wonderful scholars laboring away in silence who are always being told by publishers that their books are too esoteric." The new breed of book-brochures, he lamented, "are not unethical; they're just bad taste. I'm tired of buying them only to get them home and find they have no depth."
Cynthia Conigliaro, a co-owner of Archivia, the elegant Madison Avenue decorative-arts bookstore, said that to increase sales, big chain stores are forcing publishers to produce design books that she calls "boring, safe and unintelligent."
In response to the charge, Ms. Hennessey at Borders said: "We don't put pressure; we make suggestions. We tell them to publish the books we think will sell."
Not long ago, Ms. Hennessey pointed out to Lauren Shakeley, editorial director at Clarkson Potter -- the publisher of that life-style marketer nonpareil, Martha Stewart -- that no book on African-American design was available and that there was also a huge potential market for books about pillows, lamp shades and small apartments. To Ms. Hennessey's great satisfaction, those books appeared this season.
"The MTV generation doesn't want a house that looks like an English stately home," Ms. Hennessey said. "Maybe the books are lighter and superficial, but that's what a lot of people want." She added that how-to books have evolved into books that are part catalogue, part how-to, which have a wider appeal.
"I understand the economics involved," Ms. Conigliaro said, "but I'm really not interested in selling shallow, self-promotional books that rely upon the fame of the author."
So how does she explain her window display, dominated by Viscount Linley's book? "That's rather tender ground for me," she replied. "He's a very good customer."
The Linley book kept busy a staff that many magazines would envy: a contributing editor, a text editor, an executive editor and a project editor, to say nothing of an executive art editor, two designers and two picture researchers. (When asked to comment on reports that Viscount Linley had neglected to write the book that bears his name, Ms. Kennedy, the Linley spokeswoman, appeared to choose her words cautiously. "He worked very hard," she said. "With a text editor.")
With so many ghostwriters at large, and publishers eager to capitalize on the built-in appeal of brand names, it is easier than ever for well-known individuals and their commercial enterprises to bask in the glory of tomes that bear their names -- without the inconvenience of having to sit down and write them. Having given us "The Bed" and "The Bath," Diane von Furstenberg now offers a privileged peek at "The Table" (Random House, $40), including that of Dolly Parton (who shares her recipe for meat loaf) and Jane Wenner, a publisher of Rolling Stone (who serves up pork tenderloin).
Some close to the book say Ms. von Furstenberg's contribution occupied little of her time. "Yes, of course, I wrote it," Olivier Gelbsmann said of the introduction to the book, one of three he has planned and executed for Ms. von Furstenberg.
I THINK so many of the well-known designers who put their names on books nowadays think of them very much in the same category as having some curtains made," said Stephen Calloway, a former curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and an authority on the decorative arts. "They no more expect to sit down at a typewriter to produce gleaming prose than they would dream of laboring over a hot sewing machine. Why bother if you can pay someone else to do it?"
But Mr. Calloway points out that ghosted design books are hardly new. He lists such titles as "The House in Good Taste" by Elsie de Wolfe (written, he said, by Ruby Ross-Wood) and "The Glass of Fashion" by Cecil Beaton (written by Waldemar Hansen, according to the Beaton biography by Hugo Vickers).
The dream of all retailers desirous of a book to vaunt their fame is to echo the success of Angus Wilkie, former owner of a SoHo antiques store and author of "Biedermeier" (Abbeville, $75). His authoritative book has ridden the Biedermeier wave of resurgence to a fourth printing, though he ultimately turned his back on his good fortune and sold his store. "I became restless," said Mr. Wilkie, now a Christie's consultant and a columnist for Elle Decor. "But doing a book certainly brought a lot of people into the shop."
Ms. Hennessey, in her predictive mode, said she expected more stores to venture into publishing their wares in book form. She expressed astonishment that Pottery Barn, with stores in 22 states, has yet to capitalize on the trend. "They have a strong brand name and a captive audience," she said. "I can't understand why they haven't done a book. Seems like a no-brainer to me."

An article in The Home Section on Nov. 21 about coffeetable books that are explicitly promotional misstated the name and the position of an observer of the retail book market who commented on the value to retailers of publishing a book about their business. She is Dulcy Brainard, not Delsie Brainer, and she is an editor at Publishers Weekly, not a book reviewer.

HEADLINE: Southern Italy Doesn't Merit Bad Reputation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Unfortunately, your Nov. 15 front-page article "North-South Divide in Italy: A Problem for Europe, Too" bashes the Italian south.
The regions of the Mezzogiorno display a complex array of growth and poverty, political probity and policy successes as well as corruption. In Basilicata, Calabria's neighbor and the site of Carlo Levi's autobiographical essay "Christ Stopped at Eboli" and the research that first depicted the culture of poverty in Italy's southern reaches, the years since World War II have witnessed huge increases in levels of education, declines in the density of housing, well-planned highways and railroads, as well as other indicators of social transformation. Indeed, Fiat has just opened a plant in Melfi, formerly a pocket of poverty. 
 Southern Italians are no less willing to work to improve their economic conditions and no more corrupt than northerners. The political scandals that have transformed the Italian polity began in Milan, not Calabria. Why should southerners be prohibited from using funds that provide relief from floods or earthquakes to improve their region?
The tendency for northerners to treat the Mezzogiorno as a colony should not define reporting on Italy. As Italians struggle with calls for secession, it is important to refuse a bias that denigrates southerners.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Gains for the Pound Continue In Britain's Healthy Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The British pound reached another four-year high against the dollar yesterday, driven by fresh evidence of economic health in Britain that is expected to lead to higher interest rates.
The dollar was mixed in other dealings. It retreated slightly against the yen on the diminished impact of a bank failure in Japan, which helped depress the yen on Wednesday. But the dollar rose against the French franc on widespread weakness in that currency, and ended marginally higher against the mark. 
 The pound, which has gained more than 3 percent against the dollar in November alone and has reached levels last seen in October 1992, continued its climb yesterday.
"It's been just a one-way street for weeks now," said Tom Hoge, vice president of corporate foreign exchange trading at the Bank of New York. "You've got an economy over there that's much better than anything else in Europe."
In late trading in New York, the pound traded at $1.6873, up from $1.6770 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 111.29 Japanese yen from 111.55 yen, but rose to 1.4980 marks from 1.4968 marks.
Expectations that British interest rates will rise further have been an underlying element in the pound's rally since the Government increased its base lending rate last month. Rising rates make the pound more attractive.
Britain's economic indicators have all been pointing to falling unemployment and rising inflationary pressure, further increasing expectations of a rate increase before the end of the year. The latest indication came yesterday when the Government said consumer spending rose 1.1 percent in the third quarter, more than expected.
"Every bit of news that comes out reinforces the fact that you're going to see higher rates," said Joe Fetters, vice president of foreign exchange at the Corestates Bank in Philadelphia. "Everything coming out supports the fact that the economy over there is going very well."
In other dealings, the dollar strengthened against the French franc on broad weakness in the franc, particularly against the mark, after rumors of a looming reshuffle in the French Government.
The dollar also gained against the franc from the aftermath of reported comments earlier this week by a former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who urged a broad devaluation of the franc to make French exports more competitive abroad in advance of the plan for a single European currency in 1999.
The franc sold off despite statements from Prime Minister Alain Juppe of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany saying the franc's relationship with the mark reflected economic fundamentals.

HEADLINE: Homely Soup, Dressed Up and Ready to Go

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
IN the soup business, passion rules.
Why else would sensible people wait patiently in line for over an hour even in Arctic temperatures to pay $10 for 16 ounces of soup to be eaten at cluttered desks, on the curb or on a park bench? 
 What else would drive a man to work up to 20 hours a day and on weekends, relentlessly inventing new soups and improving old ones, complaining bitterly all the way?
What else would spur on new entrepreneurs who are trying to turn soup kitchens into big businesses, with visions of soup restaurants not only throughout Manhattan but also all over the country and even the world?
All this passion for humble, homely soup?
In an unlikely makeover, soup has thrown off its terry cloth robe and has dressed up to take a public bow. Five Manhattan restaurants, up from one just two years ago, are specializing in soup, serving thousands of people at lunch each day. Two are about to open other outlets around Manhattan. Not to be left behind, delicatessens, coffee bars and health food stores, most of which had quietly dished out soup in the past, are calling attention to their wares, putting up signs and displaying soup kettles.
The appeal of soup crosses every ethnic and economic line. Soup ranges from the bottom rung of the social ladder, when doled out as the watery broth of prison movies, to the top, when sipped as delicate consomme flavored perhaps with wild mushrooms or foie gras and costing as much as $22 a portion at Daniel, the acclaimed restaurant on the Upper East Side.
"My love of soup is very big," said Daniel Boulud, the chef and owner of Daniel, where he offers at least five soups each day. "I grew up on soup every day."
From soup's current ascendant position, all roads lead back to Soup Kitchen International, the little storefront on West 55th Street that has been drawing huge lines of loyal customers for over 10 years. This is the domain of Al Yeganeh, who painfully bears the stigma of Soup Nazi, as he was caricatured in a "Seinfeld" episode last fall that parodied the precision of his way of selling soup.
Since then, Mr. Yeganeh's business has boomed more than ever, though he feels he has paid a significant price for his fame, both in the public's perception of him and in distraction from his work. "It's made my life miserable," he said.
Not so for Chris Ramani and his partners, who opened Soup Nutsy on East 46th Street last June, openly knocking off Mr. Yeganeh's operation.
"We planned it as soon as we saw the 'Seinfeld' episode," he said. Business has gone through the roof, Mr. Ramani said, and Soup Nutsy has new outlets in the works. Are they considering a Silicon-Valley-style public offering?
"Oh, sure we are," he said. "We basically want to be the Starbucks of soup."
Whatever its hopes, Soup Nutsy is not without rivals. Daily Soup opened in February on East 41st Street, but not, a co-owner, Peter Siegel, insists, because of the "Seinfeld" episode.
"I hear that every day, and I spend a lot of time saying we weren't influenced in any way," Mr. Siegel said. "I am a passionate soup freak, and have been all my life. I was always doing the bread-dip thing with soups, and I just woke up one day and said, 'Hey, let's do it.' "
Daily Soup is doing so well that a second outlet is to open soon on 17th Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue, Mr. Siegel said, pausing to chat just before catching a plane to the Netherlands to discuss the development of Daily Soup Europe. "We are aggressively expanding," he said.
While Mr. Ramani and Mr. Siegel are more businessmen than soup makers, Jonathan Schnipper, the chef and a co-owner of Hale and Hearty Soups, takes a back burner to nobody in his passion for soups. "It's absolutely a labor of love," he said.
When it opened in June 1990 on Lexington Avenue, Hale and Hearty was a health-oriented food shop and soup was a minor part. "For a long time, the first thing people used to ask was what kind of soup we had today," Mr. Schnipper said. "It always seemed to be what people were really interested in."
So in May 1995, Hale and Hearty Soups was born. "That was before the 'Seinfeld' episode," Mr. Schnipper points out, though he concedes the episode did not hurt his business. "It just brought a ton of soup interest in Manhattan," he said. "People ask us, 'Oh, are you the Soup Nazi?' "
Hale and Hearty serves 400 to 500 customers a day, not including a large delivery business. It is just about to open a soup kiosk in the concourse of the World Trade Center and two other outlets in Manhattan.
While the influence of the "Seinfeld" episode is debatable, nobody disputes Mr. Yeganeh's influence. With minor variations, the soup restaurant formula is his: soup served to waiting customers in paper containers, accompanied by bread, fruit, plastic spoon, napkins and perhaps a moist towelette.
When he looks at the soup landscape, what does he see? "A bunch of idiots trying to cash in everywhere," said Mr. Yeganeh, who is not so much bilious as he is proud of his soups and of his single-minded dedication to soup making. "I only compete with my own self."
He said he sleeps little and works endlessly, trying to improve his recipes, and while he scorned his competitors, he was humble about his own products, particularly when comparing them with the platonic ideal of soup he carries in his head.
"I learn from my customers," he said, citing a 90-year-old woman who calls to criticize his matzoh ball soup. "Only call me if there's a problem," he added. "If you love my soup, I'll hang up on you, but if there's a problem I beg you to call me."
Why do people love his soup? Mr. Yeganeh spoke of its healthfulness, said it helps people lose weight, and groped for the mantra from the movie "Field of Dreams."
"If you make it, they will come," he said. "Nobody around was making it, only grandma in the home. I make it, and they come."
Here is a sampling of Manhattan restaurants that specialize in soup.

Soup Kitchen International
259A West 55th Street, (212) 757-7730; noon to 6 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; $6 to $17 for 12 to 32 ounces.
The reputation and the crowds were in place before the famous "Seinfeld" episode, but the public exposure complicated matters for Mr. Yeganeh, who says the curiosity-seekers have made it more difficult for him to serve his loyal customers. The nub of the problem is this: Mr. Yeganeh has boiled down his system for selling soup at his takeout operation to a few, simple rules, and he cannot understand why they are not easy to follow. In addition to the menu listing the 6 to 10 soups available each day, Mr. Yeganeh has posted this sign: "For most efficient and fastest service, the line must be kept moving. Please have money ready, pick up the soup of your choice, and move to the extreme left."
Mr. Yeganeh, who stands behind a line of kettles doling out portions, says simply moving left is not good enough, people must move to the extreme left for their own protection -- to block anyone who would try to steal their soup. "It's happened many times."
Implicit is the threat of what will happen if the rules are not obeyed. "No soup for you!" was the arbitrary punishment in the "Seinfeld" episode. I have never heard Mr. Yeganeh say that to anybody. I've never heard him say a cross word, or offer more than an annoyed glare at having his concentration disturbed. But the regulars are eager to trade war stories while standing in line, which can stretch around Eighth Avenue and up to 56th Street. The wait easily reaches an hour, and the anxiety is palpable.
"One time he just refused to give a woman soup, for nothing," one fellow offers. "How could he do that?"
"Why do we wait here?" another asks. "What does he put in the soup?"
The answer to that question, of course, is known only to Mr. Yeganeh. This much is clear: Mr. Yeganeh's soups continue to set the standard that the others hope to reach.
The reason is the depth and complexity of flavor and the high quality of the ingredients. Corn-and-seafood chowder provokes a swoon on first sip. The rich fish stock, amplified by the corn, has a toasty, almost smoky flavor and is full of chunks of fish, shrimp, scallops, even lobster claw. Veal goulash is a peppery, soupy stew generously flavored with caraway and chunks of veal, potato and celery. Cuban black bean, a vegetarian soup, is more subtle, tasting of cumin, parsley and pepper. The longer it sits, the better it seems to get as the flavors emerge and blend.
Each serving of soup comes with a hefty portion of excellent bread, fruit (grapes, bananas or apples) and belying his dour reputation, a delicious chocolate mint.
 
Soup Nutsy
148 East 46th Street, (212) 972-8800; 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; $5 to $17 for 12 to 32 ounces.
Soup Nutsy began as a parody. Just like Soup Kitchen, it's a little takeout spot with a line stretching out the front. You are asked to make your decision in advance and have your money ready. Step up to the counter, and a stern counterman ladles out one of the 12 to 15 soups in crock pots. A sign reads: "Soup Nutsy: No Soup for You!" Its insignia is a scowling caricature of Mr. Yeganeh, and the operation seems just a step away from show business.
"If they want us to be mean, we can be mean," Mr. Ramani said. "We're not really mean."
To Mr. Ramani, the leading soup makers all put out equivalent products and the Soup Nutsy name is what sets his operation apart.
Not true. While the smirk is there, the soup-making skill is at least a notch below. Chicken with lemon is chock full of chicken and noodles cut into spoon-size pieces, but the broth is weak, overpowered by lemon. Fish chowder is better. The thick broth is full of cubes of fish, celery and flecks of tomato. But the flavors are dull and lacking intensity. Vegetarian mulligatawny, made with lentils, has a peppery, lemony tang, as if the flavors are fighting to come out, but only Manhattan clam chowder offers real satisfaction. The tomato-and-clam broth is complex with long-lasting flavor, full of clams and vegetables.
Soups come with nondescript rolls or bread wrapped in a wax-paper bag and fruit.
 
Daily Soup
21 East 41st Street, (212) 953-7687; 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; $5 to $15 for 12 to 32 ounces.
Daily Soup offers the antithesis of the Soup Kitchen International experience: soup as fun rather than soup as anxiety. Not only can you actually wait inside (though the line at lunch often stretches out the door), you can even sit down to eat on one of the dozen wooden stools in front of a gleaming aluminum counter under black-and-white photos of people enjoying soup. The staff is attractive and happy, full of smiles and laughter, spurred on by the jump blues playing in the background. The whole room is modern and appealing, illuminated by light bulbs shaded by conical strainers.
A dozen or so soups are available daily, labeled nonfat, low-fat, vegetarian, spicy or dairy free. Many of the soups are creative, like Malaysian cabbage with peanut. Even the standards are unusual, like thick, smooth split pea soup with bits of spicy Italian sausage that leave the mouth glowing. Black bean soup is rich and bright, tasting of sherry, herbs, carrots and onions. The beautiful salmon-colored Indian shrimp soup is delicately flavored with coconut and sherry. Moroccan chicken, though, doesn't measure up. It's full of chicken and couscous but tastes mostly of cumin.
Following the formula, the soup comes with bread (thick wedges of crusty sourdough) and fruit (like apples, bananas and mandarins).
On the wall: T-shirts and baseball caps reading, "Thank God for Soup."
 
Urban Hero
245 West 38th Street, (212) 719-0665; 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; $3 to $5.50 for 12 to 16 ounces.
Not much attention is paid to appearances at Urban Hero, a small soup and sandwich shop that is easy to miss in the tumult of the garment district. Most of the business is takeout, though a half-dozen tables, covered in red-and-white plastic, are in the dingy rear between some beverage cases and an unused steam table.
Urban Hero's specialty is creative low-fat sausages, but more and more, it has been turning to soups and offers five a day. Gregory Dal Piaz, the chef and owner, estimates that soup accounts for 30 percent of his daily sales, two to three times the rate of a year ago.
Mr. Dal Piaz's white bean soup with shrimp and crayfish is fabulous, rich yet delicate with a seafood flavor that is subtle rather than overpowering. Chicken minestrone is served daily, full of chicken chunks, tomato, carrot, red beans and corkscrews of pasta.
Chicken soup with ancho chilies and squash is a novel turn, the chilies adding a delicious little kick to the sumptuous broth, while tomato fiorentina is bright in color and in flavor, tasting almost like gazpacho with its freshness, flavored with basil, pepper and garlic.
Urban Hero offers fresh rolls with its soups, but none of the other Soup Kitchen trappings.
On the other hand, the sausages are terrific.
 
Hale and Hearty Soups
849 Lexington Avenue, near 64th Street, (212) 517-7600; 8:30 A.M. to 7 P.M. Mondays through Thursdays, until 6 P.M. Fridays; 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Saturdays. Closed Sundays. $2.25 to $5.95 for 8 to 16 ounces.
Hale and Hearty, narrow and bright, is generally quiet except at lunch, when it feels like Bloomingdale's at Christmas. People lining up to select soup in the rear are wedged between a wooden counter with stools and a second line of people waiting to claim their soups and pay. But cheeriness rules, and the crowd is as decorous as the polished wood table with a marble inset holding the soup pots.
Maybe it's because the 9 or 10 soups offered each day are so elegant, like the fresh, seasonal, roasted butternut squash, a light, smooth puree spiked with apple and flavored with cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, and the rich split pea, with bits of ham.
Soups are served with unbleached paper napkins. Hale and Hearty breaks from the Soup Kitchen mold by offering several tables and chairs and a few salads and sandwiches. Bread is not included, but the rolls and olive twists, available for a modest price, are excellent, as are the fresh juices and yogurt drinks.
 
Veselka
144 Second Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-9682; open 24 hours daily; $1.95 a cup, $2.75 a bowl.
Veselka, my favorite of the Eastern European cafes that dot the East Village, is a full-service restaurant that has always offered at least eight soups a day. It has just reopened after a renovation, but you'd never know it just by looking. Yes, the dining room is enlarged, and a mural in progress is crawling along the rear wall, but it looks as rumpled as ever.
The waitresses, despite their reputation for surliness, still work quickly and efficiently; the specials are still announced on handwritten signs, and best of all, the recipes are intact. That means the most delicious borscht around.
This is Ukrainian borscht, with "true healing powers," the menu claims.
Don't debate it; just eat. The garnet beet broth is rich with just a touch of sweetness, full of tender bites of beef and lima beans. It's the kind of soup that makes me pick up the bowl to drain every drop.
"We reopened about four weeks ago and we've been selling more soups than ever," said Thomas Birchard, the owner.
Mr. Birchard said the borscht was his best-selling soup. With good reason: the others are pallid by comparison.
"This whole soup thing kind of passed me by until a friend was saying soup is a really big thing and you should trumpet your soups," he said. "I never really thought about it before."

HEADLINE: Diplomacy vs. Semantics on China Visit

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to booming Shanghai today to sound a hopeful theme of "cooperation" between the United States and China in the next century, based on common interests of trade and security.
The audience at Fudan University, however, was expecting a speech with a different title: "Building a Partnership for the 21st Century." Those words, based on an earlier draft of the speech, were painted on a big blue sign above the podium to advertise Mr. Christopher's speech, and people had seen it. 
 But Mr. Christopher's address was revised by senior staff members who removed the word "partnership" and replaced it with "cooperation." Some officials objected to what one called the "hackneyed" use of "partnership."
Another official said: "We use words carefully. If we felt we could use 'partnership,' we would have used it. But would it pass the laugh test?" The last question referred to the credibility of talking about a partnership between the United States and a China that is still cited for human rights abuses.
In China, too, words are used very carefully. Ni Shixiong, a professor and deputy director of the Center for American Studies, which was Mr. Christopher's official host, said on Wednesday: "Christopher is using the word 'partnership' in the title of his talk. This is the first time we've heard this word. It's much better than 'cooperation.' It means we have a real chance to improve relations now, and I'm very optimistic."
Overnight, word of the title change was passed to Shanghai, and a new blue sign, reading "U.S. and China: Cooperation in the 21st Century," was hung over the podium two hours before Mr. Christopher's arrival.
When asked about the change, senior American officials were embarrassed and concerned that what they called a normal process of policy-making -- revision and editing -- would be seen as a policy change, which they said it was not.
Some of their caution over the use of the word "partnership" seemed puzzling, however, given that President Clinton, in a news conference in Canberra, Australia on Wednesday, had used the word quite happily in regard to China.
In a news conference, Mr. Clinton said the United States and China could work together, as they did on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and on restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while cooperating on global issues like terrorism, nuclear expansion and the environment. "But I see this in the context of building a partnership with China, not isolating it," Mr. Clinton said.
Asked about the difference between "cooperation" and "partnership," the American Ambassador to China, James Sasser, said: "I don't think we're in a position yet to say we're partners. But there's increasing understanding and cooperation between the two coutries."
President Reagan came to this same place in 1984 and spoke to students then in basic terms of shared humanity and aspirations. "But we know a lot more about one another than we did then," a senior American official said. "There's been a lot more history between us."
Mr. Christopher spoke in fairly specific terms, saying that at times in the past, "distance and differences have blinded us to our common hopes and interests, creating distorted images of each other that drive us apart."
There is now an "opportunity to build a new era of cooperation for a new century," Mr. Christopher said. "We must seize it."
Mr. Christopher went on to say that cooperation must not mean silence on important areas of divergence, and cited disagreements on human rights issues as an example.
"History shows that nations with accountable Governments and open societies make for better neighbors," Mr. Christopher said. "While we recognize that each nation must find its own path, consistent with its own history, we believe that these ideals reflect the values not just of the United States, but of countries and cultures all over the world."
In response to a student's question about the human rights issue, Mr. Christopher responded: "I have been working on human rights problems much of my life. There's no magic wand on this issue. But it is important to remember the dignity of the individual, and the need to treat the individual with dignity, concern and compassion."
Some of the students here were flattered by Mr. Christopher's coming, but not convinced by his speech. Li Meng, 20, a computer scientist, said, "I think both sides should learn how to refrain from imposing their values on the other."
Lin Hao, 21, who is studying international business, said: "Chinese people don't like being pressured. We have our problems. We know that better than anyone. We have to improve our human rights domestically. But we don't need the United States to tell us that. Why is the U.S. always raising a big stick at us? Is this constructive?
"Of course we have problems with human rights," Ms. Lin said. "But look how much better things have gotten. It's much better than during the Cultural Revolution."
Sheng Qiang, 21, a social science major, added, "Christopher's trip shows the U.S. cares about China."
Professor Ni said: "Students now are more aware of the basic differences between the United States and China. We always emphasize collective over individual rights. We always stress economic rights before civil rights. I don't think students have gone from pro-U.S. to anti-U.S. But there is a change. They see things more clearly."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Dares Bratton to Run Against Him Next Year

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday enthusiastically dared former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton to run against him in the mayoral race next year, suggesting that Mr. Bratton would quickly be exposed as a one-note candidate.
A day after Mr. Bratton accused Mr. Giuliani of race baiting and pointed to his own managerial credentials for the post, Mr. Giuliani said he would look forward to raising a variety of issues unrelated to crime -- including education, economic development and welfare -- if Mr. Bratton entered the race. 
 "I'd like to see Bill Bratton run," he said, smiling broadly at a news conference yesterday. "I would like to see him running as a candidate, and getting exposed to all the same issues, the broad range of issues that you have to face when you're mayor of New York City."
Most Democrats and close advisers to the Mayor do not believe that Mr. Bratton, now a security consultant, intends to run. Democratic officials say he has sounded out power brokers about his prospects as a candidate and has been rebuffed, because of his strong Boston-accented background and his limited experience without a badge.
But as the Mayor's laughing encouragement of his candidacy underscores, there is one possible benefit to the Mayor from Mr. Bratton's presence. Mr. Bratton is the one man who is even more tied to the crime issue than is Mr. Giuliani.
Although Mr. Giuliani receives high marks in public opinion polls for having reduced the crime rate, his approval rating falls sharply on other important issues. Democratic opponents are lining up to try to exploit those vulnerabilities.
By next year, the Mayor will apparently need to substantially broaden his appeal beyond the reduction in crime, and standing in contrast to Mr. Bratton, he hopes to be seen as a Renaissance man.
"One of the things that it would do for me politically is, the whole big broad agenda that we have, we could start talking about all of that," Mr. Giuliani said. "There are many many other issues just as important as crime. There are many things involved in being the mayor of New York City. When you know someone's strengths and weaknesses better for having worked with him, you sort of look forward to running against him."
Mr. Bratton changed his affiliation from independent to Democrat this year, and the Mayor suggested that if Mr. Bratton is allowed to run in the Democratic primary, he should be allowed in the primary, as well.
Though Mr. Giuliani, who is all but certain to be on the Republican and Liberal lines, said his suggestion was not frivolous, he did not indicate that he would make a serious effort to add the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Bratton, who did not respond to requests for comment yesterday, has not declared his intentions. But his tone in an interview on the New York 1 cable channel on Wednesday was more combatively political than he had struck before. He accused Mr. Giuliani of race baiting in linking his probable opponents to former Mayor David N. Dinkins and said Mr. Dinkins deserved much of the credit for the reduction in crime by using the Safe Streets, Safe City program.
Mr. Giuliani denied the allegation of race baiting, saying Mr. Bratton "should be ashamed of himself" for repeating the allegation. Mr. Giuliani said it was perfectly legitimate to criticize former mayors and their performance without doing so for reasons of race.
"To inject that into this race is a very big mistake," Mr. Giuliani said. "And probably if he were a little more skilled and a little more seasoned at this, he wouldn't have done it."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Slip, Despite Weak Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly lower yesterday after meandering for most of the session.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 , to 1011/32 , leaving its yield unchanged at 6.41 percent. 
 The yield is at its lowest level since March amid expectations that the economy is growing at a pace too slow to revive inflation.
"The bond market is fully priced for a slowdown in the economy," said Denny Niedringhaus, who oversees $300 million of bonds at the Southwest Bank in St. Louis. "We've gone about as far as we can go if we're expecting just a slowdown" rather than a recession.
Reports confirming the economy's slow pace failed to stir much buying activity yesterday.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its inflation index fell to 14.6 in November from 21.9 last month, meaning that fewer manufacturers in the Philadelphia region reported paying higher prices. Still, its index of regional manufacturing rose to 6.4 in November from 5.3 in October. Analysts at MMS International had expected the index would fall to 5 this month.
The Government said the number of Americans applying for first-time jobless benefits rose 17,000, to 344,000 last week, more than the increase of 5,000 that economists expected.
The rise suggests that "the economy is continuing to soften," said Donald E. Maude, chief U.S. fixed-income strategist at Scotia Capital Markets (U.S.A.) Inc.
The benign environment for slower growth and inflation has bolstered Treasury prices in recent weeks. While prices rose after the Philadelphia Fed and initial-jobless claims reports were issued, the market failed to hold on to those gains, and prices seesawed through the rest of the session.
In the corporate bond market, Daimler-Benz A.G., the Simon Debartolo Group and other companies raised almost $1.9 billion yesterday.
Simon Debartolo, a shopping mall developer based in Indianapolis, led three borrowers that together raised $875 million in the corporate bond market.
Aramark Services, based in Philadelphia, sold $125 million of 10-year notes, and Commercial Credit, a finance unit of Travelers Inc., sold $200 million of five-year notes.
In another large deal, Daimler, the German conglomerate, sold about $795.2 million of bonds backed by truck loans.
The bonds, 5.85 percent-coupon securities, were priced at 99.989256 to yield 5.93 percent. The securities were rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's and sold through Daimler-Benz Vehicle Trust 1996-A. Monthly payments begin Dec. 20. Delivery is scheduled for Nov. 26, with accrued interest from Nov. 20.
In the municipal market, bonds were little changed as money managers sought to raise cash or swap out of existing bonds to buy some of this week's $3.7 billion in new tax-exempt securities.
The new-issue market has captured the attention of many investors in recent weeks as they look for bonds that will benefit most if interest rates continue to decline.
Investors who buy both taxable and tax-exempt securities are also finding muni bonds enticing when compared with other fixed-income investments.
"Munis are attractive right now," said Michael Schroeder, a manager for First International Asset Management in Naples, Fla.
New bond sales slowed to about $400 million yesterday, with most of the offerings by smaller issuers. Debt sales are expected to be slow until after the Thanksgiving Day holiday next Thursday.

HEADLINE: Claims by Jobless Jump Unexpectedly

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly shot up by 17,000 last week to the highest level since last July.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 344,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said today. 
 It was the largest number of new claims since 367,000 were filed during the week that ended on July 13 and the steepest advance since a 23,000 jump in the week that ended on Oct. 26 that was largely attributed to strikes at General Motors plants.
Many analysts had expected a much smaller increase last week, noting the shortened filing period due to the Veterans Day holiday and the continued return of employees after the end of the G.M. strikes.
Claims for the week that ended on Nov. 9 were revised lower to 327,000 from the 328,000 initial estimate.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims also rose, up 6,250, to 336,250, and matching the level reached in the period that ended on Oct. 12. Many analysts prefer to track the less volatile four-week average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: Japan Learns to Love Safety;
For Both Car Makers and Consumers, a New Sales Factor

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 21

 BODY:
"I want to be loved by you, just you," Marilyn Monroe croons seductively, as a mini-van smashes into a wall. Another accident caused by a driver daydreaming?
No, this is a Japanese television commercial for the Toyota Motor Corporation, advertising its new love affair with safety: the mini-van test crash, Toyota says, shows that its car bodies protect passengers. 
 Safety is finally starting to sell in Japan, the home of the tin-can subcompact. Blame a legal system and culture that don't encourage liability lawsuits or consumer activism. Blame Japan's narrow, congested roads, where drivers can't go fast enough to kill each other at American-style rates. For whatever reason, until now, safety took a back seat to fuel economy and style among both Japanese auto makers and consumers.
Indeed, Japanese cars sold at home haven't been as crashworthy as the cars sent to the United States, where safety regulations are stricter.
Now, though, alarmed by a surge in traffic fatalities, Japan's Government is toughening its standards. This year it released crash-test data for the first time -- but for just eight vehicles, and 18 years after the United States began doing so through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
And as their home market has opened to American and European imports that use safety as a selling point, Japanese companies are adding safety features, strengthening their car bodies and stepping up research on electronic systems to prevent accidents.
The new attention to safety could make the Japanese more competitive not only at home, but worldwide, as they catch up in one of the few aspects of car design in which they are not already leaders.
They have already improved the crashworthiness of the vehicles they sell in the United States to meet the standards and competition there. But they have never had a reputation of leadership in safety, as do, say, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. That is now a goal.
One belated addition is air bags, which are finally becoming standard equipment here, five years after the trend began in the United States.
But Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, is also introducing throughout its product line -- including the American-made Camry -- a new body with stronger pillars and wall, floor and roof reinforcements. Toyota says its cars will be as safe as any in the world.
The Nissan Motor Company, the No. 2 auto maker, is advertising a similar "zone body concept," after beating Toyota to the punch in 1994 by making driver-side air bags standard equipment throughout its lineup, as well as passenger-side bags in its medium and large cars.
Now Nissan boasts that it was third in the world, following Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, to install a side-panel air bag in a model: the luxury Cima that it sells in Japan.
Imports have stressed safety to make inroads here. Last year Opel, the German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation that is growing fast in Japan, advertised that all of its cars came equipped with dual air bags, anti-lock braking systems and seat belt tensioners.
Starting in 1992, the Ford Motor Company installed anti-lock brakes and dual air bags on all imports into Japan, even on models -- like the sport-utility Explorer -- that did not include those as standard features in the United States.
But now that Japanese companies have caught on, a spokesman for Ford Japan, Hiroo Tanabe, said, "Safety does not provide a competitive edge at the moment."
Some critics say Japanese companies are still not making serious efforts to make safer cars.
"The Japanese base their safety on the tests the U.S. gives," said Akio Takaoka, a former engineer for the Honda Motor Company who quit after disagreements with his boss about crash testing. Now a safety consultant, he earns a living largely as an expert witness in lawsuits in which Americans sue Honda over defects.
"It's not based on a philosophy," he said of the auto makers' new emphasis on safety. "It's for advertising purposes."
Japanese cars long had a reputation in the United States for crumpling like accordions in a crash, even as they won reputations for superior fuel economy, reliability and -- at least until the recent rise of the yen -- affordability.
Part of the reason was that Japanese cars tended to be small and light. Even compared with other small cars, though, Japanese models tended to do poorly in crash tests and in real accidents.
In 1982, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which compiles data from insurance claims for American insurers, reported that the death rate in Japanese subcompacts was 34 percent higher than in American subcompacts.
By the mid-1980's, Consumer Reports was finding that Hondas and Toyotas had improved in crashworthiness, but that models from Nissan, Mitsubishi, Isuzu and Subaru were still occupying the lower rungs of its safety rankings.
Under competitive pressure, though,the Japanese gradually closed the gap. In 1994, reviewing the results of more than a decade of Federal crash tests, Consumer Reports noted that "the biggest improvements have been in small Japanese cars, particularly Hondas, Nissans and Mazdas."
Robert Knoll, the director of automobile testing for Consumer Reports, said that in terms of safety, Japanese cars now "don't appear to be any different from any other cars."
That, however, is not the case in Japan, where there has been less pressure from government to improve auto safety.
Infant car seats, for example, are not required in Japan, as they are in the United States. There has been little analysis of traffic accidents, so that data on the effectiveness of devices such as air bags almost invariably come from the United States.
And while American drivers are now being warned that air bags can kill children and small adults, and Federal officials are considering giving drivers the option of disconnecting the bags, there has been little discussion of the issue here, and no directives from the Ministry of Transportation. (Air bags here, however, use less inflating power than those in the United States.)
Other pressures on the industry are also absent. Product-liability lawsuits are rare because Japan is not a litigious society, and there are few lawyers. Since Japanese courts do not use juries, large damage awards are even rarer.
In a society where most citizens do not want to stand out as protesters, Japan also has a weak consumer movement. The Japan Automobile Consumers Union appears to be a one-person operation, though that person, Fumio Matsuda, said he calls on a network of 25 volunteer technical experts, such as retired auto company employees.
Safety consciousness among consumers also appears to be low. When Consumer Reports warned earlier this year that Isuzu's Trooper sport-utility could roll over in quick turns at low speeds, almost no attention was paid in Japan, even though the same vehicle is sold here.
And while shoppers say they are paying more attention to safety, it is still often not their top concern.
"I think the style is more important," said 29-year-old Shigeko Utsumi, whose boyfriend was buying a Jeep at a Yokohama dealer. "If I couldn't have a wooden steering wheel with an air bag, I'd take the wooden steering wheel."
Akihiko Hagiwara, a 27-year-old office worker shopping at a Toyota dealership in Yokohama, said he welcomed the fact that air bags and anti-lock brakes are becoming standard, because people would then use them. But, he said: "If it's there, I will take it. If it's optional, I wouldn't."
Mr. Matsuda of the automobile consumers union said that Japanese cars sold domestically tended to lack safety features such as stronger pillars to prevent a roof collapse in a rollover, reinforcing bars in the doors, and collapsible steering columns.
Mr. Matsuda, a former Nissan engineer, said that skimping on safety -- at a saving of $300 to $500 each vehicle -- was one way the auto makers generated profits in their protected home market to finance their export drive.
Mr. Takaoka, the former Honda engineer, said that there were also differences in Hondas made for different markets in pillar strength, seat belts and other features, though they have been narrowing in recent years.
Executives at Honda took issue, saying that the basic construction of its cars sold in both the Japanese and American markets, such as the Civic and the Accord, have always been the same.
The president of Honda, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, said it was natural, however, to tailor cars to the requirements of different markets.
In Japan, he said, people in cars make up a smaller percentage of those who die in traffic accidents than in the United States, and pedestrians a larger percentage.
"If we make the car bodies stronger today, it would probably mean more damage to pedestrians and people riding bicycles," Mr. Kawamoto said.
Traffic fatalities have been on the decline in the United States until a recent rise. But Japan saw a surge to more than 10,000 traffic deaths in 1988, the most since the 1970's, when the construction of pedestrian overpasses sharply cut the toll. While the increase appears in large part attributable to more Japanese driving, traffic deaths have remained at more than that politically sensitive level ever since.
Alarm over the rising fatality count has spurred some action. In 1992, the Government and auto industry established an institute to analyze accident data. Since 1994, new cars have had to meet certain safety standards in a frontal crash test, something the United States required since 1989. A side-impact testing regulation, already being instituted in the United States, will take effect here in 1998.
The Ministry of Transportation has also organized the automobile companies to develop "advanced safety vehicles," prototypes expected to be completed by about the year 2000 that are to feature special safety systems.
These systems, now in prototype form, include cameras and radars to detect other cars or pedestrians in a car's path and apply brakes automatically if necessary. There are also drowsiness detectors which would monitor a driver's eyes or pulse, or the car's steering pattern. If a driver were nodding off, an alarm would sound, or the seat would vibrate. Nissan's design would even include a mechanism to spray a fragrance to keep the driver awake.
Japan has even seen the debut this year of a magazine devoted to automobile safety -- bankrolled by the Takata Corporation, a leading maker of seat belts and other safety equipment. Said Shinzo Yamamoto, the magazine's editor, "For the first time, we're allowed to ask questions about safety."

Graph/Chart: "A New Concern"
In the last few years, Japanese auto makers have responded to competition from imports and consumer concern about traffic fatalities in Japan by adopting many of the same safety features and practices that are standard on cars sold in the United States.
 
AIR BAGS and ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
Both are becoming increasingly common features.
 
COMPARTMENT REDESIGNS
Some auto makers are reinforcing car bodies to protect occupants better duriing accidents.
 
CRASH TESTS
Years after similar tests became standard in the United States, cars in Japan now must meet minimum safety standards in head-on collisions. Side-impact standards are being added in 1998.
 
HANDLING
Steering systems have been improved to increase traction.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
'Only a Matter of Time'

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Aleksandr I. Lebed is the Russian general who became a politician and has no doubt that he will be Russia's next president. He says 25 years as a paratrooper taught him to talk concretely. In New York this week he used one word to describe Russia's efforts to prevent its nuclear warheads and materials from being stolen for terrorists or by rogue missile crews: "unsatisfactory."
But when it came to talking about what would then happen, he could not find concrete words in him. Nobody had ever lived in such a world, he said -- horrors unseen, dangers never conceived. When he said this to a few Russian and American journalists at the Regency Hotel I felt this man who looks like square rock and talks like rolling thunder was even more shaken than we were, because he knows more. 
 At Harvard, Prof. Graham Allison also knows what he is talking about. Normally milder than a Russian general, on nuclear terrorism he is writing and talking even more plainly -- not "if" it happens, but when. He writes in a letter that it is only a matter of time before a terrorist detonates a bomb in America.
Professor Allison heads a team from Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs that produced a book-length report called "Avoiding Nuclear Anarchy." I cannot think of a more important book.
These are some of the major points:
1. "Loose" nuclear weapons and material are the number one threat to America's vital interests.
2. Russia and America have taken some steps to tighten security, but they are inadequate. The personnel and the one-tenth of 1 percent allocated to the job in the U.S. defense budget are not "remotely proportionate" to the problem.
(In late October, Vladimir Nechai, director of Russia's Chelyabinsk-70 nuclear complex, shot himself. He died ashamed at the failure of the Government even to pay scientists the $50 a month they earned. The lesson was inescapable: In a society where bitterness and humiliation can kill a top nuclear director, there can be no security.
3. Nuclear theft has arrived. Six known thefts in Russia have been intercepted abroad.
4. Once they have the material, terrorists have the bomb. It takes only enough enriched uranium or plutonium to fill a soft-drink can. (Since the U.S. cannot prevent tons of narcotics from getting in, the best place to hide it would be a bale of marijuana.)
5. If the bombers in Oklahoma and New York had 30 pounds of nuclear material they could have wiped out downtown Oklahoma City and Manhattan from the Battery to Gramercy Park. No bother with vans.
6. As the most open society, the U.S. is the most vulnerable. But because Russia is in chaos it may be the first target. (General Lebed spoke his own fears: the danger of mutinous takeover by Russian missile crews who have to put to sea or go up in planes knowing that they left behind families without decent food, shelter -- or dignity.)
7. Nuclear weapons and bomb material are scattered in 200 sites across Russia -- including storage depots and laboratories. Neither the Russian or Kazakh Governments had been aware of 1,000 pounds of nuclear material in Kazakhstan. When they came across it Kazakhstan sold it to the U.S.; now it is in Tennessee. But the Iranians -- they were aware and trying to get hold of it.
8. The combination of a demented economy, miserable nuclear workers and security to match, law by Mafia and terrorists with real money make more leakage inevitable.
Still the authors believe dangers can be lessened by increasing cooperation between Russia and the U.S. and the involvement of other countries. But they also say that although a better "political environment" is necessary the four critical players -- Russia, its nuclear ministry, Congress and the Clinton Administration -- have created a "pattern of behavior" that permits only "slow and grudging" progress, at best.
So as a non-scholar non-general I believe one way to avert nuclear terrorism is U.S. retaliation against non-nuclear terrorism, heavy enough to make terrorist nations forgo the pleasure of nuclear murder of Americans.

HEADLINE: Canadian Tribe, Shedding Ashes of an 'Evil Place,' Gets a Chance at Rebirth

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: DAVIS INLET, Newfoundland

 BODY:
All that stands on the windswept bluff where Gregory Rich's house used to be is a tall wooden cross, put there by the Innu Indians to recall the fire nearly five years ago that killed six of their children, and seared the image of this remote community on the conscience of Canada.
There were other tragedies, like the night in 1993 when six Innu teen-agers were found sniffing gasoline in a frozen shack, so intoxicated and so despairing that they threatened to kill themselves. 
 But it is the fire, which killed Mr. Rich's five children and a nephew while he and his wife were out drinking, that marks the low point of this community and the beginning of its healing.
After the fire, Davis Inlet became such a notorious symbol of all that is wrong with Canada's policies toward its more than 800,000 indigenous people that many high schools include the case in social studies classes. Now the national Government says a project to relocate and rebuild the Innu community is a symbol of how those policies have changed from misguided paternalism to an approach stressing self-government and economic development.
The Indians of Davis Inlet signed an agreement with the federal and provincial governments this month to try to help put behind them the drunkenness and desperation, the foul water, the raw sewage, the poverty and debilitating dependence endured on this rocky island off the northern coast of Labrador, to which the Government forced them to move 29 years ago.
After years in which the Innu demanded that to heal themselves they had to leave the island, and after an outpouring of support for the Innu across Canada, the Government has finally acknowledged its mistake and agreed to relocate them.
This time, all 500 Innu will be moved to a spot they selected, a traditional campsite on the mainland called Little Sango Pond, only five miles west but a world apart from Davis Inlet. The relocation will cost the Government $62 million. Although it could be achieved much faster, it will take as long as six years to build the airstrip, streets, sewage system, school and houses that are needed, because the Innu are to be involved in everything from planning to construction.
"In a way the signing represents a victory for this community," said Mr. Rich, now 27 and an Innu leader. He and his wife, Agathe, still face charges of abandonment related to the fire, but he said he had not taken a drink in almost a year or sniffed gasoline for a long time. He is a symbol of the Innu attempt at healing.
"There are things that happen that we can't do anything about," he said, "but the future is something we can control. That's what I picture at Sango Pond."
Ronald A. Irwin, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, said just before signing the agreement during a ceremony at Davis Inlet that the relocation "reflects a new spirit of partnership and working together."
He added: "It reflects the determination of all parties involved to lay the foundation for self-reliant and self-sustaining communities."
The Indians call this island of sand and evergreen Utshimassit, "Place of the Boss." They say they were forced by the provincial government and missionary Roman Catholic priests to give up the last remnants of their nomadic culture and move here in 1967.
Official records are sketchy, but there is evidence that the government and the church felt they were acting in the best interests of the Indians. The chief at the time, Joe Rich, a relative of Gregory Rich, was said to have supported the move to a less isolated place with a better waterfront, room for an airstrip and wooden houses.
However they came to be here, it was soon clear that moving to the island was a disaster. The Innu, who total about 2,000 in Canada, are not related to the Inuit, or Eskimos. Rather, their lineage has been traced to Indian groups in the more southerly parts of Canada. Their lives, like those of their ancestors for 10,000 years, had been attuned to the running of the caribou across the frozen barrens of northern Labrador.
"Davis is an evil place, eating away at the young people," said James Pasteen, 84, who followed the caribou and lived the ancient way of life until he came to Davis.
What Mr. Pasteen and other Innu soon discovered was that Davis had little water, despite the authorities' promises of plenty. Most families had to go long distances to haul what they used. The houses built for them were sturdier than tents but still rattled with the frigid winds that blew from offshore.
When the houses shifted and opened big cracks to the wind, the Innu, not knowing anything about such dwellings, had no idea how to fix them. Without drainage, families used plastic pails as toilets, and often just emptied them out onto the roads.
And worst of all, the Innu say, the forming and thawing of ice made Daniel Rattle, the strait between the island and the mainland, impassable for up to four months a year, cutting them off from their traditional hunting grounds.
By the time of the fire in February 1992, Sebastian Piwas remembers, nearly all the adults in Davis were receiving public assistance and getting drunk on cheap liquor or a powerful concoction known simply as home brew: sugar, molasses and yeast stirred into boiling water and left in five-gallon plastic buckets overnight to ferment.
"I was at a friend's house drinking home brew when we smelled smoke and someone came in and said, 'There's a house on fire,' " he said. It was about 11 o'clock on a night veiled with deadening cold.
"We had no firetrucks or pumps," Mr. Piwas said. There wasn't even enough water nearby to fill a bucket. "People said there was kids in there. But there was nothing to do but watch the building burn."
The next morning they found the charred bones of Wendy, Jeremiah, 9-month-old Daniel, Simon and the twins, Mary Jane and Madeline.
The deaths gave tragic notice that something had to change, and that the Innu themselves would have to make sure it happened. Adults began to sign up for alcohol counseling or leave for rehabilitation programs in the west of Canada. A sober chief and Band Council, an Indian form of governing body, were elected. Indian law enforcement officers, called peacekeepers, were trained.
And the Innu decided they had to move from the Place of the Boss to their own place.
Leslie A. Anderson, director of major projects for the national Department of Indian Affairs, said the tragedies at Davis Inlet focused official attention. No government wanted to be affiliated with that kind of horror, she added.
In 1994, the Government agreed in principle that the 1967 relocation to Davis Inlet had been a failure and that the Innu should be moved. But doing so before the Innu had learned to solve their own problems would have left the door open for another failure, Ms. Anderson said.
That is a departure from traditional policy in Canada. "A situation of dependency has been created by the federal Government," said Adrian Tanner, an anthropologist at the University of Newfoundland in St. John's. "They have maintained a dependency regime."
Under a new national strategy still in formation, Indians are encouraged to take control of their own lives. Thus, before any approval was given for the relocation, the Innu had to come up with a plan that was technically feasible, reasonably priced and supported by a majority of the community. They also had to come to grips with their problems of high unemployment, alcoholism and gasoline sniffing.
Innu elders say the rate of alcohol abuse in adults, once about 95 percent, has been cut in half. A training program has helped many young men become carpenters; they have rebuilt nearly every house here, picking up skills they will use in building at Sango Pond.
But Chief Katie Rich, a cousin of Mr. Rich and granddaughter of Chief Joe Rich, said the Innu were the first to admit that simply moving will not resolve everything.
"It took us 25 years to get where we are now," she said, "and it's probably going to take another 25 years to get where we want to go."
Some Innu even worry that moving may not change anything at all. "I think there could be even more drinking," said Toby Noah, a burly 24-year-old who anticipates getting a construction job at Sango Pond. "They say we'll have running water, but if there is, people can make home brew real easy."
Despite all the tragedy at Davis Inlet, the Innu say they want to see parts of their old home preserved.
One is the cemetery, just off the seal-colored sand of the cove at the far end of the community. There, pencils, a doll's head and a faded blue cap have been placed on the graves of the six children.
Another is the place where the cross stands, where Gregory Rich sometimes goes by himself, to pray.
"It's very hard to go up there," he said, "but sometimes I go and pray. I pray that such things not happen to any other family. And I pray that we Innu can have a healthier community."

HEADLINE: One Airline's Shift to a One-Maker Fleet

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
American Airlines and the Boeing Company left out few superlatives in announcing a widely expected agreement yesterday, in which American will buy 103 jets and perhaps hundreds more over the next 20 years as the carrier moves toward an all-Boeing fleet.
And some of the labels American and Boeing applied to their deal -- unprecedented, unparalleled, innovative -- were warranted, offering plenty of reasons for their shareholders to cheer. Partly in anticipation of yesterday's announcement, shares of the airline's parent company, the AMR Corporation, have risen sharply this month, though they eased 50 cents yesterday, closing at $90.50. Boeing's shares gained $1.125, closing at $97.50. 
 Although some of the broader implications of American's announcement were not exactly heartening to either hardened skeptics about the airline industry or to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, whose prospects have been very much the talk of the airline and aerospace industries in recent weeks, for American, the deal should be beneficial.
Most large United States carriers have cited the need in recent years for a simpler fleet with fewer aircraft types. That would reduce the costs of maintaining spare-parts inventories and of training pilots and mechanics.
But American, not a company known for taking half steps, has pushed the trend further than its competitors in agreeing to rely on Boeing in a deal worth more than $6 billion at list prices for the 103 firm aircraft orders. Even USAir, which said recently that it planned to buy as many as 400 new Airbus Industrie planes, did not rule out the possibility of buying other kinds of aircraft.
American and Boeing also used the term "purchase right," to describe an unusual aspect of their deal. Historically, an airline's option for new aircraft required the carrier to tell the manufacturer two to three years in advance that it, in fact, wanted to buy the aircraft. With American's purchase rights for 527 new aircraft, it can give Boeing as little notice as 15 months to deliver narrow-bodied aircraft, and 18 months for the wide bodies.
That means less guesswork for American in trying to keep its capacity in line with demand, something that has not been easy for the industry -- its propensity to overexpand in good times has been the main reason that carriers have lost billions of dollars since the industry was deregulated in 1978.
"The agreement," Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman, said yesterday, "will enable us to acquire the aircraft we need while avoiding the need to make larger firm commitments, thus preserving the strength of our balance sheet."
The deal was contingent upon approval of a new labor agreement with the union representing American's pilots. The union leaders voted on Wednesday to pass the agreement on to their members, but the aircraft order will not go through if the members vote it down. The contract vote is expected next month.
In recent years, the industry appears to have learned from its mistakes. By restraining capacity in the face of good demand, it has gained more control over pricing and profits.
Still, industry experts are asking whether the industry's troubled history will repeat itself, for United, Continental and USAir have all placed orders for new aircraft in recent months.
Yet some aspects of the industry are different this time. The airlines are all saying that the new aircraft will be used largely to replace older aircraft that will become obsolete in a few years because of tougher noise regulations. American said yesterday that it planned to expand only about 2 percent a year, in line with industry growth.
Candace Browning, an industry analyst at Merrill Lynch who wrote a research report in August entitled "Capacity Creep -- Have Managements Really Reformed?", said she was "not yet overly concerned" by the new aircraft orders. After all, she said, the older planes that will be retired would be costly to refurbish and operate and are therefore not likely to find their way back into service through smaller carriers looking for cheap, older planes to expand their fleets.
Still, "this is something that I am paying a lot of attention to," she said.
Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, also said it would be wise to keep an eye on too-rapid growth in capacity. "Today's order may be good for American Airlines, but is it good for the U.S. industry?" he said, "That is the important issue."
What is certain is that yesterday's big order represented more disheartening news to McDonnell Douglas, the third-largest manufacturer behind Boeing and Airbus, and a longtime supplier to American.
The company has been in a slump of late, acknowledging in recent weeks that it would become a niche player in commercial planes. Last weekend, it lost out on a chance to compete for a huge contract to build an all-purpose fighter aircraft. And Delta Air Lines, another big customer for McDonnell Douglas, has said recently that it is talking only to Boeing and Airbus about buying airplanes to replace many of its L-1011's.
The American and USAir aircraft orders underscore that some airlines are serious about simplifying their fleets and are teaming with suppliers with a broader array of planes than McDonnell Douglas offers.
Industry experts, in fact, said that of the major domestic airlines, only Delta and Northwest Airlines were candidates to place big orders with McDonnell Douglas anytime soon.
"One of those almost has to go to Douglas if they are going to continue to be a viable producer of commercial airplanes," Edmund S. Greenslet, an industry analyst who runs ESG Aviation Services, said. "The list is getting very short for Douglas."
Others, however, contend that concerns about McDonnell Douglas's future are overblown. Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with JSA Research, said that the recent big orders were quickly filling the capacity of Boeing and Airbus, meaning they may have little incentive to bargain with other customers, including foreign airlines.
"There is a very good chance you will see some spillover to McDonnell Douglas in the not too distant future," he said. "And they will be sitting there, arms open, waiting for the next order, and they will survive quite well through this cycle."

HEADLINE: Europeans Link To Chicago Merc

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Two big European futures exchanges are linking up with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, carving up business in advance of the planned single European currency.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has signed a deal with the Chicago Merc to link trading in some interest-rate futures and options. 
 And the French futures and options exchange Matif signed an accord with the Chicago Merc to start Matif's French bond futures, applying to all contracts of a year or more.
With the single currency, to be known as the Euro, planned for introduction in 1999, financial markets have been jostling for position.
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specific date. An options contract grants the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a stock, bond, currency or other instrument at a set price by a certain time. The contracts are used by investors and corporations to make money and limit risk on their other investments.

HEADLINE: FORGIVEN ENEMY: A special report.;
From Suspect in Murders To a New Life in America

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
In the last days of spring in 1985, Pedro Antonio Andrade was a leftist guerrilla commander so committed to overthrowing the United States-backed Government of El Salvador, officials say, that he helped plan the most violent attack on Americans of El Salvador's civil war: the shooting of four off-duty marines and nine other people as they dined at sidewalk restaurants in the Zona Rosa section of San Salvador.
Five years later, Mr. Andrade and his family were living quietly in the United States, their visas approved by American diplomats and their new life financed with thousands of dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency for his services as an informer against the cause he once championed. 
 The facts of Mr. Andrade's admission were confirmed by United States officials this month after nearly a year's investigation by officials of the State, Justice and Defense Departments and the C.I.A. That long inquiry broke into public view after the family of one of the marines killed in the attack pressed a United States Senator to join its battle to have Mr. Andrade, who has been arrested on charges of overstaying his visa, held to account.
"Andrade, an illegal alien and murderer of American marines, must not be allowed to exploit our bureaucracy," Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican, wrote in a letter to President Clinton that was made public yesterday.
Mr. Andrade has consistently denied any direct involvement in the killings and has said he initially agreed to act as an informer only under duress. He also took two liedetector tests, which were described by several American officials as inconclusive. Some of those officials -- including one who came to know Mr. Andrade well -- said they believed that the evidence of Mr. Andrade's role in the Zona Rosa case was far from certain.
Yet, as told by Mr. Andrade, other former rebels and more than a dozen American officials familiar with his case, the story of how one of the reputed masterminds of the Zona Rosa massacre became a highly paid informer for the Salvadoran armed forces reveals the contradictory impulses that guided the United States involvement in the Salvadoran civil war. It is perhaps the most remarkable in a series of recent cases that have illuminated questionable ways in which intelligence agents and other American officials pursued their missions in Latin America in the waning years of the cold war.
Several officials said that among at least some of the C.I.A. agents who sought to broker Mr. Andrade's services as an informer for Salvadoran intelligence, there was a familiar sense of expediency, a belief that in the cause of keeping Marxist rebels from seizing power in El Salvador, distasteful means were often justified.
"Their doctrine is that they'll play ball with the Devil if he can be useful to us now," said one diplomat involved in discussions of Mr. Andrade's fate at the United States Embassy in San Salvador. "And they thought he could be useful."
In a report that is still classified, the inspectors general of the three departments and the C.I.A. criticized the deal to allow Mr. Andrade into the United States, describing it as the product of "significant intra- and interagency problems."
But in justifying the deal, some diplomats, mindful of the risk Mr. Andrade took in providing extensive information on his former comrades, argued that the agreement made with him had to be respected, regardless of his possible complicity.
"We did this out of the best of motives, and we did it with the knowledge that these were Americans who were killed," said Richard J. Chidester, a 45-year-old lawyer and retired diplomat who was the embassy official in charge of the case. "If we had gotten evidence that he was implicated in the murder of the marines, then he would have been prosecuted for that. We didn't, and guys said, 'We think this guy has some real value and can help us hurt the guerrillas.' "
More than six years later, however, the deal that was cut with Mr. Andrade is very much under review.
Two months after being arrested on charges of failing to properly renew his visa, Mr. Andrade sits in a small cell in the Passaic County Jail in Paterson, N.J. The former rebel, who had been living in West New York, N.J., has asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a branch of the Justice Department, for political asylum on the ground that he might be killed by his former comrades if he returned to El Salvador.
Almost from the moment Mr. Andrade fell into the hands of the security forces in 1989, in the waning years of the Salvadoran war, it became clear that he was not an ordinary mid-level commander among the guerrillas fighting to overthrow the government then headed by President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
Less than two days after his arrest on May 28, 1989, Mr. Andrade proved his worth as an informer when he accompanied Salvadoran military intelligence officers to the small construction-supply shop he owned in San Salvador, the nation's capital, and uncovered hundreds of assault rifles and other weapons -- the biggest arms cache seized from the rebels in the 12-year conflict.
Shortly after that, according to officials familiar with his case, Mr. Andrade said he could offer his former enemies other important help as well. His essential condition for providing extensive information on the rebels' operations during the preparations for the last major offensive of the war was that he and his family be protected from the insurgents and be helped to resettle in the United States.
 
The Rebel Attack In the 'Pink Zone'
 As he has consistently, Mr. Andrade told American diplomats after his arrest that he was merely a logistics officer for the smallest faction of the rebel umbrella organization, the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front, known by its Spanish initials as the FMLN, and as such arranged for medical aid, uniforms and other logistical help for the rebels.
In an interview at the Passaic jail last Friday, Mr. Andrade, referring to Americans by using Salvadoran slang, said, "What was proposed was that there was going to be an action against the whities without mentioning a specific target." Recounting his clandestine meetings with another rebel commander, whose nom de guerre was Rogelio Martinez, Mr. Andrade added, "He told me that I should remain at the margins of it because my presence in San Salvador was of strategic importance for the FMLN."
At the time of the killings, in 1985, United States policy in El Salvador was turning an important corner. The Salvadoran military and security forces were beginning to distance themselves from atrocities committed by the armed forces and right-wing death squads in the early 1980's. Advocates of the United States policy grew more comfortable and aggressive in their support for the Government.
The rebels remained strong in the countryside, but they were forced into a prolonged, hit-and-run war of small ambushes and economic sabotage. The specter of the United States' long and deep military involvement in Southeast Asia began to lift from the bitter debates in Washington.
Hoping to remind Americans of that specter, the urban commando group attacked the marines, who were frequent off-duty visitors to the row of small restaurants that anchored the Zona Rosa, or pink zone. The rebel group named the operation Yankee Agressor in El Salvador, Another Vietnam Awaits You.
On the night of June 19, 1985, a group of the guerrillas jumped from a pickup truck in front of the restaurants and opened fire with semiautomatic weapons, killing the four marines, two visiting American businessmen and seven Salvadorans. Three days later, a little-known FMLN guerrilla cell calling itself the Mardoqueo Cruz urban commandos took responsibility for the killings.
It took a full week for the FMLN leadership to endorse the attack, a delay that rebel leaders later attributed to the fact that the commandos had not consulted with them before carrying it out.
 
Investigating The Incident
Within a few months, the Salvadoran authorities had arrested one of the men later convicted of participating directly in the attack and two of his accomplices. Two or three other major suspects were presumed dead.
But according to declassified C.I.A. and State Department cables, a task force made up of C.I.A. and Salvadoran intelligence and military officials had also assembled extensive information on the Mardoqueo Cruz commando, its members and their backgrounds.
One State Department cable lists Mario Gonzalez, the nom de guerre that Mr. Andrade used, as the first among three men who planned the operation and identifies him as "chief of the Mardoqueo Cruz Urban Commandos, later discovered to be Pedro Antonio Andrade Martinez." He is also listed on another United States Embassy cable that named the suspects in 1987 in response to a Congressional inquiry. A C.I.A. report, dated Jan. 21, 1986, that recounted the testimony of an informer in the case told of "Mario" working closely with the rebel who led the commandos and dropping off the weapons that it used.
An extensive report in 1993 of a United Nations-sponsored commission that investigated the worst abuses of the Salvadoran war also implicated Mr. Andrade.
The investigators, who interviewed Mr. Andrade and other rebels and inspected classified documents about the attack, concluded that "Pedro Antonio Andrade was also involved in planning the attack."
After the 1985 attack, at a memorial service for the six Americans killed, President Ronald Reagan promised to use "all available U.S. resources" to insure that sooner or later, those responsible would pay.
"I pledge to you today that they will not evade justice on earth any more than they can escape the judgement of God," Mr. Reagan said, his voice choking with emotion. "We and the Salvadoran leaders will move any mountain and ford any river to find the jackals and bring them and their colleagues in terror to justice."
As a result of pressure by American diplomats, the Zona Rosa case was one of a handful to be exempted from two amnesties that covered human rights violations on both sides of the civil war.
 
Making a Deal With a Rebel
How closely American officials reviewed the evidence against Mr. Andrade after his capture in 1989 remains unclear. But half a dozen officials who served in the embassy at the time said there was no question as to his identity.
According to those officials and others who have seen the report of the inspectors general, a senior official of the embassy's C.I.A. station approached the United States Ambassador, William Walker, and told him that Mr. Andrade had been captured and might provide important cooperation to the Salvadorans. The only problem, the agent said, was the rebel commander's possible role in the Zona Rosa case.
Hoping to arrange for Mr. Andrade to serve as an informer for the Salvadoran military but concerned that he might yet be prosecuted in the case, C.I.A. officials suggested that Mr. Chidester be recruited to help assess the rebel's possible culpability.
Mr. Chidester, who had worked with the Nicaraguan rebels while stationed in Honduras earlier in the 1980's and who described himself as a strong believer in the Reagan Administration's policies in Central America, had retired briefly from the Foreign Service and returned in March 1989 to become Mr. Walker's legal attache.
Along with an F.B.I. agent based at the United States Embassy in Mexico City, Mr. Chidester was briefed on Mr. Andrade and on the Zona Rosa case by Salvadoran military intelligence officers, and questioned him in a cell at the Salvadoran National Police headquarters on June 6, 7 and 8, 1989.
After Mr. Andrade's denials of direct involvement in the Zona Rosa case, mid-level officials of the State and Justice Departments and the C.I.A. met in Washington to discuss the case, and Mr. Chidester, who happened to be in town, joined them. As was the case throughout the debate over how to deal with Mr. Andrade, the Justice Department's representatives strongly opposed his being allowed into the United States in return for his information, officials said. Diplomats at the embassy suggested that he be given a polygraph examination.
Mr. Andrade ultimately underwent two such tests, both of them administered by Salvadoran military investigators and reviewed by F.B.I. agents. Three former embassy officials said the first was viewed as inconclusive, while the second appeared to suggest that Mr. Andrade was telling the truth. But two other officials familiar with the subsequent inquiry into Mr. Andrade's parole into the United States argued that both examinations were of dubious quality.
In October 1989, officials familiar with the inspectors' general report said, the C.I.A. station in San Salvador began providing the Salvadoran security forces with what ultimately became $20,000 for the resettlement of Mr. Andrade and his family in the United States, and $22,400 that was reimbursed to the Salvadoran security forces and other agencies for the cost of keeping him in a special safe house for the next nine months. After continued objections from Justice Department officials, the C.I.A. began to distance themselves from Mr. Andrade, intelligence officials said.
Responding to a request from the station chief in San Salvador, officials at the agency's headquarters said they would not take responsibility for Mr. Andrade's parole into the United States on the ground of national security, officials said. And in January 1990, the office of the C.I.A.'s general counsel lined up more directly with the Justice Department.
"Our office of the general counsel got back to the station and said, 'Whatever was your view of this before, knock it off,' " one intelligence official said, describing warnings from the agency's warnings from its headquarters in Langley, Va.. "It's not going anywhere. Desist."
Two embassy diplomats said the station chief subsequently went to Ambassador Walker and asked if Mr. Andrade could not be paroled in using the Immigration and Naturalization Service's authority over cases "strictly in the public interest."
Mr. Andrade's parole was approved by the immigration agency in June 1990. He lived briefly with relatives in Southern California and then moved to West New York, N.J., in 1991, working mostly as a truck driver until his recent arrest on immigration charges.
 
Deciding the Fate Of an Informer
While Mr. Shelby and other officials said the Justice Department has ruled out trying to prosecute Mr. Andrade in connection with the Zona Rosa case, advocates for the families of the slain marines are adamant that he not be allowed to remain in the United States.
"The dark stain of Andrade's deeds and our Government's de facto ratification of them must not be allowed to spread amidst interminable hearings, wrangling and legal maneuvering," Senator Shelby, who requested the Federal investigation on behalf of the family of one of the marines, wrote in the letter to President Clinton.
But diplomats involved in the case continue to defend their actions.
"There was a moral commitment to this guy when he was brought into the United States," Mr. Walker said. "I'm not saying he would be sent back to his death in El Salvador, but his life would certainly be in danger."
Advised of the Senator's letter urging the President to deny him parole, Mr. Andrade telephoned a reporter yesterday from jail. He denied having received any other money than about $10,000 he said was taken from his San Salvador home when he was first captured, and noted that his children and wife, who has long been a legal resident of the United States, had lived on welfare since 1993 because his earnings as a truck driver were not enough to support the family.
"This situation now is the consequence of a campaign of misinformation that the FMLN and some other people have waged against me," he said. "But I came to the United States because of an offer by this Government, and at its initiative."
In his letter to Mr. Clinton, Senator Shelby described the Zona Rosa episode as "a wound that remains open and untreated"; in El Salvador, it has long since begun to heal.
Two of the three other former rebels who were convicted of participating in the killings have already served their prison sentences and have been released, along with a fourth man who was held for five years before being acquitted in 1993. Two more rebels who were thought to have led the attack are believed to have been killed in fighting outside San Salvador later in 1985.
Yesterday afternoon Francisco Jovel, the leader of the FMLN faction in which Mr. Andrade served, interrupted a conversation about the Andrade case, explaining that he had another debate to attend to. He is now a member of the Salvadoran National Assembly.

HEADLINE: For Blacks, Economic Gain Is Limited to a Few

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Quality of Life Is Up for Many Blacks, Data Say" (front page, Nov. 18) implies that there has been significant improvement over all for African-Americans -- an inaccurate assumption. However, it does reflect that the gap between the haves and have-nots among blacks is widening, as is happening among whites.
The income statistics emphasized are limited to married couples, which gives an exaggerated impression of progress. Yes, the Census Bureau reports median income of black married couples at 87 percent of that of white married couples, up from 79 percent in 1989. But the percentage of married couples among black families declined from 50.2 percent to 46.1 percent, while the absolute number of black married couples fell. 
 More indicative of progress, if any, among blacks are long-term trends in family income. Since 1972, the first year for which comparable statistics are available, the real median income of black families, adjusted by the Consumer Price Index, increased only 3.7 percent. Black median income fell to 57.7 percent of non-Hispanic white median income, down about one percentage point. The reported dip in black poverty below the 30 percent level is welcome, if it starts a trend. But it is 3.4 times the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in poverty, a ratio that has not improved.
Black unemployment remains high and has been rising alarmingly, according to the Labor Department. It increased from 9.9 percent in October 1995 to 10.8 percent in October 1996, while the rates for whites and Hispanic-Americans fell.
Over the year, the proportion of white adult males with jobs went up to 74.5 percent, while among black men the number dropped to 65.5 percent. The white-black gap has widened to nine percentage points. There is still a long way to go.

HEADLINE: Time for a Broader Asian Agenda

 BODY:
During the cold war, Washington saw its role in Asia as clearly defined -- containing the spread of Soviet-backed Communism. The region today defies easy classification. While East Asia is the world's fastest-growing region economically, it is also an arena where four of the world's most powerful countries -- Japan, China, Russia and the United States -- are awkwardly working out new relationships with each other. The Clinton Administration has yet to devise a policy that adequately balances American economic and security interests in this vital region.
President Clinton's current trip underscores the need for such a policy. The trip's ostensible centerpiece, an Asia-Pacific economic conference in Manila this weekend, is largely an empty event. Two years ago, Pacific leaders agreed to create a regional free-trade zone by 2020. But there is no real consensus for taking concrete steps toward this laudable goal. The more vital business is likely to come in side discussions among some of the 16 leaders assembled in Manila. Mr. Clinton, for example, is discussing economic and security issues individually with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan and Presidents Fidel Ramos of the Philippines, Kim Young Sam of South Korea and Jiang Zemin of China. 
 China's economic clout and rising military power are reshaping relations among Asian nations. Japan, an economic but not a military power, is anxiously studying Chinese intentions. But Tokyo also understands that any attempt to rebuild Japanese military power would stir angry memories throughout Asia of past Japanese aggression.
South Korea, guarding the last military frontier of the cold war, worries about a second Korean War and a militarily resurgent Japan. Suspecting that Washington is too complacent about both dangers, it is edging closer to Beijing as a strategic insurance policy. Meanwhile Russia, though militarily weak, cannot be discounted. Traditionally a rival of both Japan and China, it now seems interested in warmer relations with both.
The United States can serve its own interests and the region's by helping to maintain a security balance in the area. As long as China, Russia and Japan do not feel threatened, they can be encouraged to assert themselves economically rather than militarily, sustaining the surge toward prosperity that has characterized the region in the last decade.
The United States must recognize that Russia has a legitimate role to play in the region. Washington can work with both Moscow and Tokyo to encourage the return to Japan of islands Moscow seized at the end of World War II.
American relations with Japan, after several years of trade confrontations, have settled down as Japan struggles to climb out of a recession. This has given the Clinton Administration a chance to re-emphasize security cooperation. Tokyo can continue to rely on Washington for protection from external threats while expanding its own participation in United Nations and other international peacekeeping operations.
China presents the hardest challenge. Washington and Beijing are talking again after last spring's chill over Taiwan. But the Administration has not found effective ways to moderate Chinese behavior or hold Beijing to the agreements it has worked out with the United States and other countries. Mr. Clinton's ability to establish a more productive dialogue with China will be an essential measure of his success in Asia during his next term.
Over the last four years, the Clinton Administration has positioned America to compete effectively in Asia's booming markets. But the growth of those markets now depends on assuring stability in the region. That will require more than a strategy to sell American cars in Japan and to protect American intellectual property in China.

HEADLINE: Victory of 5 Redistricted Blacks Recasts Gerrymandering Dispute

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The re-election of five black members of Congress, in districts recently redrawn to eliminate black voting majorities, has sharpened the debate on a crucial legal and political question: Is it still necessary to gerrymander legislative districts along racial lines to insure minority representation?
Those who have successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to reject districts drawn along racial lines see the results of the five races in Florida, Georgia and Texas as a vindication of their efforts. The success of black candidates in majority-white districts, they say, demonstrates that legislators do not need to consolidate blacks into oddly shaped districts in order to insure that a black is elected. 
 "The idea that minorities have to have a super-majority of black voters to win in their district, that's history now," said A. Lee Parks Jr., the lawyer representing the plaintiffs who successfully challenged two black-majority districts in Georgia.
But civil rights leaders argue that the key to the victories on Election Day was less the design of the districts than the incumbency of the black candidates. Early analysis of the results suggested that whites and blacks continued to vote largely in racially polarized blocs. And most of the winners said that they succeeded only because their previous representation of black-majority districts gave them the name recognition, fund-raising capacity and legislative records they needed to attract the necessary share of the white vote in their new districts.
"The real test of whether majority-minority districts are still necessary will come from the minority candidates who vie for this seat after me," said Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a feisty and flamboyant black Democrat who won 58 percent of the vote in Georgia's newly designed Fourth District.
"It may very well be the case that attitudes in the South have changed for the better," Ms. McKinney said. "But one thing is for certain: representing the old 11th District allowed me to run and win in the new 4th District without having to change my views, my gold tennis shoes, my braids, or having to auction off my principles to the highest bidder."
It is clear that the direst predictions by civil rights leaders have not come to pass, at least so far.
After the Supreme Court struck down racially gerrymandered districts in Texas and North Carolina last June, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the decision would lead to "a kind of ethnic cleansing." Laughlin McDonald, the director of the Southern regional office of the American Civil Liberties Union, predicted a "bleaching of Congress," and Elaine Jones, the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., warned that "the noose is tightening."
But the only black incumbent to lose this year was Representative Gary A. Franks, a Connecticut Republican whose district was not affected by Supreme Court rulings. And while one black incumbent, Representative Cleo Fields, Democrat of Louisiana, chose not to run this year because the courts ordered his district redrawn, another black candidate, Julia M. Carson, won in an Indiana district that has long had a substantial white majority.
Five years ago, under pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department to comply with the Voting Rights Act, state legislatures around the country created several awkwardly designed Congressional districts that linked black population centers. The redistricting plans had both the intended effect of maximizing the election of black candidates and the more surreptitious effect of draining reliably Democratic black voters from districts that then became vulnerable to Republican takeover.
In subsequent years, plaintiffs challenged the districts in several states and the Supreme Court issued a series of 5-to-4 rulings striking them down. If race was a predominant factor in the construction of the districts, the Court ruled, they were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Legislatures were instructed to redraw the districts, and where they failed, the Federal courts stepped in to do the job.
In this year's general elections for the House of Representatives, 53 black candidates -- 38 Democrats and 15 Republicans -- ran and 37 won, 36 Democrats and 1 Republican, according to an analysis by David A. Bositis, a senior political analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. In 10 instances, black candidates ran against each other.
Twenty-three candidates won in districts where at least 50 percent of the voting age population is black, 7 won in districts where 40 percent to 49 percent of the population is black, and 7 won in districts where less than 40 percent of the population is black, Mr. Bositis said.
In the newly drawn districts this year, the most striking results came in Georgia.
Ms. McKinney cruised to a third term against a moderate white Republican in a district that is predominantly Democratic but where blacks represented only 33 percent of the voting-age population, according to the 1990 census. Political strategists estimate that the black voting-age population in the district, which consists of suburbs east and northeast of Atlanta, has grown to nearly 40 percent black in the last six years. But that is still far below the 60 percent of the voting-age population that was black in Ms. McKinney's old district.
A study completed this week by Allan J. Lichman, a professor of history at American University, found that Ms. McKinney won more than 90 percent of the black vote and an estimated 31 percent of the white vote. Turnout among black voters was about 60 percent while turnout among whites was 65 percent, Mr. Lichman said.
In the Second District in southwest Georgia, Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., with a moderate voting record, won 54 percent of the vote in a district where the voting-age population is 35 percent black. His previous district had been 52 percent black. Mr. Lichman found that Mr. Bishop won more than 90 percent of the black vote and an estimated 36 percent of the white vote. Turnout was higher among whites than blacks, 55 percent to 40 percent.
In Florida's Third District, which includes Jacksonville, Representative Corrine Brown won 61 percent of the vote in a district where the voting-age population is 42 percent black. Her previous district had been 50 percent black.
The two remaining districts, in Texas, are somewhat less revealing because black and Hispanic voters combine there to create heavy majorities of minority voters.
Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat, won 55 percent of the vote in the 30th District, in Dallas, where 42 percent of the voting-age population is black and 16 percent is Hispanic. In the 18th District, in Houston, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat, won 77 percent of the vote in a district where the voting age-population is 44 percent black and 21 percent Hispanic.
In all five races, the black incumbents raised more money than their opponents. Ms. McKinney, for instance, had raised more than twice as much as her Republican rival, John Mitnick, as of mid-October.
And Ms. McKinney's pollster, Ron L. Lester, said that her four years in Congress provided her with a voting record on issues like education, the minimum wage, Medicare and the environment that appealed to constituents in her new district, particularly to women.
"By virtue of being the incumbent, she was able to connect with voters on these issues," Mr. Lester said. "I don't think another black candidate could win this seat."
Across the country, well over 90 percent of the incumbent House members who ran for re-election won. Civil rights leaders said that black incumbents benefited along with white incumbents.
"There was a question in my mind whether incumbency would trump race, and it appears that it has," said Theodore M. Shaw, the associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.
But Abigail Thernstrom, an author and academic who has crusaded against racial gerrymandering, said the incumbency advantage was overstated.
"They weren't incumbents in these districts," Ms. Thernstrom said. "These are new districts."
If black contenders run effective campaigns, she said, whites will vote for them.
"I think there is enormous willingness to vote for black candidates in this country," she said, pointing out that many black mayors had been elected in white-majority cities. "People don't want to think of themselves as racists."
People on both sides of the debate believe that this year's results will influence decisions on redistricting by legislatures and by the Supreme Court.
On Dec. 9, the Court will hear an appeal of a lower court's drawing of the district lines used this year in Georgia. The new districts have been challenged by the Justice Department and A.C.L.U. on several constitutional grounds.
Lawyers who have fought racial gerrymandering said they hoped the Election Day results would help reassure Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the most tenuous vote of the five-member coalition that has rejected black-majority districts.
North Carolina's Legislature must redraw the state's Congressional map next year and is likely to eliminate the black majority in the 12th District, which is represented by Melvin L. Watt, a black Democrat. Rather than focus on the results in Georgia, Mr. Watt said, lawmakers should consider the racially polarized voting in his state's Senate race this year. Polls of voters leaving voting booths showed that Harvey Gantt, a black Democrat, won 89 percent of the black vote but only 36 percent of the white vote in his unsuccessful race against Senator Jesse Helms.
Mr. Lichman, the historian, predicted that this year's results, if they are repeated in 1998 and 2000, would affect the next round of redistricting in "a dramatic way."
"It'll be much less likely that you'll get districts that are 65 percent black," he said. "But I hope they affect them in a sensible way, that we don't make blithe across-the-board assumptions. In some states it may well be possible to create districts that provide opportunities for minorities to elect candidates of their choice where the minority population is about 40 percent. In other districts, it may require black majorities, even substantial black majorities."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices End Lower in Dull Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended slightly lower in dull trading yesterday as players squared portfolios ahead of the weekend and braced for new economic data next week.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 12/32 , to 100 22/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.44 percent from 6.41 percent. A week ago, the yield was 6.46 percent. 
 While trading was light, there was some interest in the 10-year note, which ended slightly lower, pushing its yield up to 6.13 percent from 6.12 percent.
"Activity today has been exceptionally light," said John Canavan, a money market analyst with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. "If players are doing anything, it's a little bit of position-squaring ahead of the weekend."
Bond prices rose early in the session after the Labor Department reported that the United States import price index, excluding fuels, declined three-tenths of 1 percent in October. It was the fifth consecutive month that the import price index declined.
The data "reminded us that low import prices have been one of the factors explaining all the good inflation reports," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust.
"All yearlong, import prices, ex-oil, have barely moved," he said, "and that also reflects the sluggish worldwide economy."
Yesterday's report follows recent data on consumer prices, showing that inflation in the United States remains tame. The latest figures showed that the consumer price index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in the month of November.
In another report yesterday, the Treasury said that the total United States budget deficit widened to $40.26 billion in October from $22.58 billion in the previous year, a gap that exceeded analysts' predictions.
 Still, the market was also somewhat disappointed yesterday as the Federal Reserve refrained from carrying out an expected coupon pass operation. Traders said the operation was expected after a flood of fresh supply that entered the market earlier in the week.
The Fed, however, decided to add temporary reserves to the banking system through $2 billion customer repurchase agreements.
"We were expecting the Fed to come in with a coupon pass to prop prices up, which didn't happen," said a trader at an investment bank.
The market also paid little attention to remarks by a Federal Reserve Board governor, Susan Philips.
Ms. Philips said she saw consumer spending rising in the fourth quarter, adding that her best guess was that the economy was to stay moderate but in a sustainable growth path.
Analysts said trading yesterday was in the hands of professional players. Hedge and mutual funds as well as retailers were mostly out of the market. Volume was extremely thin. By late afternoon, total volume as measured by GovPX, a bond pricing service, was $46.35 billion, around 20 percent below average for a Friday in the fall.

HEADLINE: Subic Bay, Minus U.S., Becomes Surprise Success

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, the Philippines

 BODY:
When President Clinton and 17 other world leaders gather here on Nov. 25 for an economic conference, they will stay in new luxury villas built on the site of ammunition bunkers at what was once one of America's main overseas military bases.
They will discuss international trade at a converted officers' club with a balcony that looks out over a vast tax-free port and industrial complex that has quickly become a model for the conversion of a military base to civilian uses. 
 "It is a coming-out party of the Philippines, not only for Manila and Subic but for the entire country," President Fidel V. Ramos said as he toured the former base before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting opened on Wednesday.
The rapid conversion of Subic Bay Naval Station and nearby Clark Air Base over the last four years since the Americans were booted out has emerged as a symbol for the country's economic success under President Ramos, a sign that Filipinos, somewhat to their own surprise, can make it without the Americans.
While much of the region is suffering through an economic slowdown, the Philippine economy is picking up steam, growing by more than 7 percent a year. Inflation has dropped to 4.4 percent, exports are growing, and the budget is in surplus for a third consecutive year.
Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, which administers the port, said officials from around Europe and Asia had visited to study his model of base conversion, including the leaders of Panama, Vietnam and Lithuania and representatives from Guam and Okinawa, in Japan.
In an interview, Mr. Gordon seemed as astonished as anyone at his success; he is the grandson of an American serviceman and had been one of the foremost lobbyists for retention of the bases, arguing that few preparations had been made for their conversion.
Despite lobbying by him and by former President Corazon C. Aquino, the Philippine Senate, fired by a wave of nationalism, voted in 1991 not to extend the lease of the bases. It ended an American military presence in the Philippines that began with the withdrawal of the Spanish in 1898.
When the American flag was lowered at Subic on Nov. 24, 1992, predictions of economic ruin were almost universal. The American Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, predicted that closing the bases would be "a real tragedy for the Philippines."
Together, the bases were the nation's second-largest employer, after the Government itself, directly employing more than 68,000 Filipinos and contributing about $28 million a day to the local economy.
When they pulled out of Subic, the Americans left behind $8 billion in infrastructure, but took with them almost everything portable, including dozens of bowling lanes, the communications system and, most important, the floating dry docks that could have boosted Subic's hopes to be a ship repair center for the region.
"A lot of people were apprehensive," said Ferdinand Roaquin, a local resident who now works in Mr. Gordon's office. "We grew up with the Americans. My mother was a little bit tear-jerk when they left."
Predictions of disaster seemed at first to be confirmed when looters stripped the Clark base of everything from light fixtures to toilet bowls when the Americans abandoned it in 1991 after it was buried in volcanic ash by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
But at Subic, Mr. Gordon enlisted 8,000 unpaid volunteers to guard the empty base and maintain its buildings, power plant and storage tanks until new tenants could be attracted.
With the region's economy growing then, it proved surprisingly easy to attract manufacturing and investment. Now, four years later, employment here has actually risen, Mr. Gordon said, with 55,000 people working in the Subic port alone, mostly in foreign-operated factories.
Some of those are former workers on the American base. Some other craftsmen on the base found similar work in Guam or elsewhere overseas. But many -- like the prostitutes in the now-darkened red-light district of the neighboring town of Olongapo -- dispersed throughout the Philippines in search of other work.
Today more than 200 companies have invested $1.6 billion in Subic, and 150 companies have put $257 million into Clark, according to official figures.
Here at Subic, Japanese and Taiwanese industrial parks manufacture a variety of products, from computer motherboards to armored personnel carriers. Their total exports have risen every year, to $263 million in the first 10 months of this year, Mr. Gordon said.
In its biggest coup, Subic has become the regional hub for Federal Express, which has taken over former military warehouses and now makes an average of 67 landings a night on a newly reinforced runway, ferrying everything from Timex watches to fresh tuna around Asia.
The base is also developing a tourist industry that is attracting planeloads of visitors on charters from Hong Kong and Taiwan to take advantage of its beach front and woodlands as well as the tennis courts, stables, skeet range and yacht club left behind by the Navy.
Nowhere does the Philippines look as shipshape as on this former naval base, where the lawns are as trim, the grounds as clean and and the traffic as orderly as they were under military command.
A secret of Mr. Gordon's success seems to be the almost military discipline he has imposed here. Security guards salute when he approaches and stand at attention to recite, at his command, a 12-point pledge of professionalism.
"It is the Lee Kuan Yew model," Randy David, a leading sociologist, said, comparing Mr. Gordon's methods to those of the autocratic leader of Singapore. "In fact, we call him jokingly Dick Kuan Yew, and he loves it. You won't see that kind of leadership elsewhere in the country -- thank God, if you ask me."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	 U.S. Warns of Terrorism
MANILA, Nov. 22 (AP) -- The United States today warned of "possible threats" at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum where President Clinton and other leaders are arriving this weekend.
"The U.S. Embassy in Manila has received information about possible threats to American diplomats in the Philippines during this conference," the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said in Manila. He refused to elaborate, and a Philippine official denied it.
Since Wednesday, the authorities have found two bombs in Manila, killed two rebels outside the capital and fought to hold back protesters.

HEADLINE: Fearing a Rate Rise, Shippers Await 2d Front In Rail Merger

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Susann D. Felton was in the midst of negotiating railroad contracts last month to handle six million tons of coal a year for the Potomac Electric Power Company when the CSX Corporation disclosed an agreement to buy Conrail.
Ms. Felton, vice president for materials at Potomac Electric, said she felt a sense of dread that only grew after CSX's rival, the Norfolk Southern Corporation, began its own hostile offer for Conrail, setting off a bidding war that continues to this day. No matter who wins the battle, Potomac Electric, which receives supplies for its four coal-fired power plants from all three of the rail carriers involved in the battle, is likely to end up entirely dependent on a single railroad for three of the generators. That will not leave Ms. Felton with a lot of negotiating room. 
 "Was I thrilled?" she said. "No."
She added that any shipper could count on paying at least a 60 percent premium on captive routes above what it costs where competition exists. And then there is the worry that service may deteriorate as the merged railroad struggles to cut costs.
Now on the sidelines, rail users all along the East Coast are waiting for the opening of a second front in the battle for Conrail: The winning bidder must take the proposed merger before the Federal Surface Transportation Board for public review and regulatory approval. Shippers, port operators and state officials hope to be more successful in keeping their options open than they were in their unsuccessful opposition to the giant mergers in the West, where the Union Pacific combined with the Southern Pacific and Burlington Northern swallowed the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe to together control 90 percent of all rail traffic.
Indeed, they have a better chance of extracting at least some concessions this time, in part because the merger is taking place in the East, where the political spotlight is brighter, and because it revolves around Conrail, the Government-subsidized amalgamation of several bankrupt railroads. The Consolidated Rail Corporation has a near monopoly on rail freight in the Northeast, especially in the Port of New York, the richest market in the nation.
Still, opponents of a merger are fighting an uphill battle. The number of major railroads has already dropped to 10 from the 40 that existed in 1980 when the industry was deregulated. Most analysts believe that when the dust finally settles there will only be two or three transcontinental railroads.
"We have a greater interest in this merger than we had in Union Pacific," said Representative Bud Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. "Conrail is a creature of Congress and the American taxpayers put over $7 billion into it, so we have a responsibility going forward. And as consolidation occurs in the rail industry, we have a greater public policy interest in preserving competition than we did with the U.P."
Mr. Shuster is also out to protect his constituents. He expressed concern about the impact of a merger on railroad workers in his rural Pennsylvania district, where Conrail has a locomotive and car repair shop.
CSX recently acquired 19.9 percent of Conrail stock as the first step in its friendly $8.5 billion takeover of Conrail. The company, however, needs shareholder approval in December to take the next step in the process and Norfolk Southern is dangling an attractive lure in front of shareholders: $10 billion cash. Whoever wins, the three-member transportation board would then have the power to require the transfer of track rights or asset sales as a condition of approving the deal.
So far, the consolidation of the industry appears to have done more good than harm. The industry has increased its share of overall freight traffic and, adjusted for inflation, managed to cut rates in half since 1980.
Shippers concede that freight rates have gone down over all. But with the dwindling number of railroads, there are many more routes today that are served by a single railroad. And some shippers, especially those moving bulk commodities, often cannot turn to a trucker or a barge company if rail rates soar. Privately, shippers and port operators angrily talk of a railroad extracting contracts on competitive routes by threatening to raise prices on captive lines.
Moreover, said Ed Emmett, president of the National Industrial Transportation League, an alliance of 1,000 large freight users, the decline in rates appears to be over. Shippers are "afraid that after the mega-mergers it'll go from a steady climb to a skyrocketing climb," Mr. Emmett said. "They view the situation today as possibly just as dire as it was at the turn of the century."
A merger of Conrail and CSX would leave a single railroad in control at 64 cities in the East where competition now exists. A Norfolk takeover would affect 38 of these cities.
But this merger is about more than the couple of dozen cities that weigh in the balance; it is about market dominance in the East. The Association of American Railroads says a CSX-Conrail combination would control 65 percent of the rail traffic originating in the East, leaving Norfolk with less than a third. If Norfolk wins, it would control about 50 percent of the market and CSX about 45 percent.
The ultimate prize, though, is the market that serves New York City and northern New Jersey. David R. Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern, has proposed to end Conrail's stranglehold on the Port of New York, a suggestion vehemently opposed by Conrail and CSX.
"This is the last chance for competitive rail service in the Northeast," Mr. Goode argued. "Now that Conrail is on the block, it is bad public policy to preserve a monopoly in New York and it is unrealistic of CSX and Conrail to think they can."
But Conrail's chairman, David M. LeVan, while conceding that regulators are likely to insist that the merged railroad take steps to "preserve" competition in cities currently served by two railroads, said he saw no duty to "enhance" competition in New York and other Northeastern cities. Besides, he said, Conrail has to compete with truckers. "Our numbers show that trucks carry 80 to 88 percent of the imports and exports coming through the Port of New York," he said. "So there's plenty of competition."
In the end, said Anthony Hatch, an analyst with NatWest Securities, the battle for Conrail may well open up competition in some cities that have long been rail monopolies. "We'll see a more equitable split of the market in the Northeast," he said. "Anything else would create an uproar among shippers, the rest of the rail industry, unions and politicians."

HEADLINE: Our Cures for the Drug Problem Make It Worse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M Rosenthal has attacked me repeatedly as a drug legalizer (columns, Nov. 15, Nov. 8 and Oct. 22). I am not for legalization but for a saner drug policy.
Some form of addiction or substance abuse is endemic to all societies. The way they deal with it has considerable bearing on how healthy they are. A drug-free America is unattainable. We should aim at minimizing the ills connected with drugs. 
 Our policy of treating drug abuse as a crime exacerbates the problem. The adverse effects of our policy are more severe than the adverse effects of addiction. Our policies have increased drug-related disease, death and crime, and incarcerated hundreds of thousands of Americans.
Focusing resources on interdiction ignores basic economics. As long as profits are so high, there is no way to cut off supply. The profits provide ample resources for generating additional demand by drug pushing.
There are no final solutions to our drug problems, but we do know at least some of the steps we should be taking now: making methadone and sterile syringes readily available to addicts; removing criminal prohibitions on the ability of doctors and patients to treat pain with whatever medications work; saving jail and prison cells for violent criminals and predatory drug dealers (not nonviolent addicts willing to undergo treatment), and exploring new means of reducing the harm done by drug use and our prohibitionist policies.
Above all, we need a free and open debate on all alternatives to current drug policies.

HEADLINE: Some Changes In Stock Rules To Be Delayed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission agreed yesterday to delay by a few months some parts of its new order-handling rules that are aimed at revamping the Nasdaq stock market. But it did not change any major parts of the rules.
The rules, which are to be phased in starting Jan. 10, are intended to make it easier for investors to get better prices on trades. Although the rules are aimed primarily at Nasdaq, they apply to all markets. 
 The rules call for quotes in so-called electronic markets, like Instinet, to be posted on Nasdaq if those quotes are better than the ones available on Nasdaq; the S.E.C. did not change that provision.
But while the original order called for trading in the 1,000 most active Nasdaq stocks to be subject to the new rules on Jan. 10, the revision cuts that figure to 50 stocks, with 100 to be added Jan. 31 and the other 850 on Feb. 21. The phasing-in of the other Nasdaq stocks will not be affected.
Major stock markets have minimum quote increments, usually of one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents, for most stocks. But some electronic exchanges do not have such limits. So it is possible that Instinet, say, might have a bid on a stock of $25.0625, or one-sixteenth of a dollar more than the $25 bid on Nasdaq.
Current quote machines cannot display such small increments, so there would be no way to know that there was a better bid. The S.E.C. therefore required that the machines add an asterisk to the price, showing it as $25*, as an indication that a better price was available. The industry said programming for that would take many months, and the S.E.C. agreed yesterday to delay that provision until July 31.
A committee of the Intermarket Trading System, whose members include the major stock exchanges, had asked that the asterisk be deleted. The chairman of the panel, Allan H. Bretzer, said last night that he had not seen the S.E.C. decision, but added that "if the asterisk is staying in, we're going to have a problem."
The other delay that was granted concerned the display of limit orders. Under the rules, if an investor enters a limit order -- an order to buy or sell at a specified price -- and that price is better than what is in the market, the market maker who receives the order must either fill it or post that order for all to see within 30 seconds.
For example, if the best bid for a stock is $20, and an investor puts in an order to buy at $20.125, that would become the best bid if it were not filled immediately. The S.E.C. had said that such limit orders would have to be displayed starting on Jan. 10, but yesterday it delayed that until April 10.
"By setting a tight date, we pushed people to work very hard" on programming for the changes, said Richard Lindsey, the S.E.C.'s director of market regulation. "They have been, but they need a little more time."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 1996, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Nov. 23 about new rules aimed at the Nasdaq stock market referred incorrectly to a rule that a limit order -- an order to buy or sell shares at a specified price -- must be disclosed immediately when its price is better than the market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not delay the rule. But it did say that until April 10 it would not enforce a part of the rule requiring disclosure of the limit order within 30 seconds.
A front-page article on Sunday about Wall Street strategies for minimizing capital gains tax liability misspelled the surname of a financial adviser who was quoted on the strategy of selling a business to an employee stock ownership plan. He is Francois de Visscher, not de Vissher.

GRAPHIC: Photos/Charts: "An Escape For Business Owners"
Owners of private business can avoid the capital gains tax by selling the company to their employees, as long as they put the proceeds in certain investments, like ESOP notes, that Wall Street is eager to provide. "Economically, it a fabulous transaction," said Francois de Vissher, a financial adviser and investment banker.

Graphs: "No Longer Just A Bill for the Rich"
For many middle-income taxpayers, the only source of capital gains is profits on mutual funds. Lately, those taxpayers' gains have shot up, while gains reported by the typically wealthier taxpayers who profited from all kinds of assets stagnated. (Source: I.R.S.) (pg. 1)

"An Umbrella to Shelter Property Profits" shows the total market value of upreits (umbrella partnership real estate investment trust), 1992-96. (Source: National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts) (pg. 45)
Here's how the Western Southern deal worked: Salomon Brothers sold notes to the public and made most of the proceeds available to its client, Western Southern, through a private transaction "whose terms mirror the terms of the DECS sold to the public," said Anand S. Iyer, director of global convertible product analysis at Salomon. Each note sold for roughly the same price as one share of Cincinnati Bell. The notes pay a fixed rate of interest and give the noteholder a share of any future increase in the stock price. If the stock price falls, the noteholder bears all of the loss, which will be reflected in a lower resale price of the note.
When the notes mature, Western Southern can repay its obligation to Salomon with cash or with its Cincinnati Bell stock, either of which Salomon can use to cover what it owes to noteholders. If it pays in cash, no taxes will be owed, because legal ownership of the shares will have remained with Western Southern. In the meantime, it had the use of most of the cash raised from the note sale, free of capital gains taxes.
Because they offer a cheap way to borrow that does not worry credit-rating agencies, most exchangeable-note deals in the last three years have been done on behalf of corporate taxpayers, including Times Mirror and American Express.
But Eli Broad's deal last June marked the first public use of this remarkable product by an individual taxpayer. The deal, tailored like the Western Southern deal, locked in Mr. Broad's profit on a block of SunAmerica stock worth roughly $194 million, just as if he had sold the shares. Although he had shed any risk of loss, Mr. Broad kept the right to any further gains after the stock price had risen 35 percent, and he did not hand over legal title to his shares. Thus, he owed no capital gains taxes.
Mr. Broad's innovative deal has tax lawyers talking. "Actually, I'm looking at a bunch of those products now," said Steven M. Surdell, a partner in the Chicago firm of Jenner & Block. "I have a client who is an Eli Broad kind of guy, and an investment bank has given him a brochure about doing this."
 
The Debate
 
Competing Proposals For a Better System
Wall Street's willingness to cater to wealthy, tax-averse clients is as old as the capital gains tax itself, but the infrastructure that supports the creation of these high-technology strategies is much newer.
The equity swap borrows heavily from the mathematics developed by global bankers in the creation of "interest rate swaps" barely a decade ago. As active markets have developed for these and other esoteric instruments, commonly called derivatives, Wall Street has been able to use those markets to measure and hedge the risks of doing these transactions for wealthy clients. All this is the daily routine of squadrons of so-called rocket scientists -- the mathematicians and software engineers Wall Street has recruited from academia in recent years to find new ways to harness the potential of new software and new markets.
Taken together, these changes allow Wall Street to separate the various attributes that once were knotted into a single security. A security that fluctuates in price but pays a steady dividend can be cut into a fluctuating-price slice and a steady-dividend slice; a bond that pays principal and interest can be cleaved into a principal-paying chunk and an interest-paying chunk. And a stock that has both economic value and voting rights can be teased apart, so that the voting rights stay with the legal owner while the economic benefits flow to others.
"In a world where the distinctions between financial instruments are blurred, or where different instruments are combined in new ways, the practitioners of financial engineering will always be a step -- or, more likely, a mile -- ahead of the regulators," said Mr. Gale, the Brookings economist. "Because of all these instruments that are becoming available, the effective capital gains tax rate is fairly low among the very high-income groups."
Some critics say that Wall Street's ingenuity proves the case for scrapping the tax or at least modifying it. Under the current system, "if you're rich enough, you can hire the entrepreneurial accountant or the entrepreneurial guy at Salomon Brothers who thinks these things up," said Theodore Forstmann, chairman of Forstmann Little & Company and a member of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, commissioned by Republican Congressional leaders to recommend ways to overhaul the tax system. "What I would like is a system that put these guys out of business." At a minimum, he said, the Government should tax only inflation-adjusted profits.
The political debate about the capital gains tax has been devoted mostly to arguments over whether capital gains should be taxed at all, and, if so, how much. Privately, some who believe that capital gains taxes stifle the economy by reducing incentives for entrepreneurs suggest that the country may benefit from techniques that allow such people to escape taxation.
Until the Clinton proposals were introduced early this year, little attention had been paid to whether the existing tax could be levied more fairly.
The Administration's proposals do aim to make it harder for wealthy taxpayers to avoid capital gains taxes, although some less affluent investors would be affected as well. "I think it is clear there are things that are permissible now that should not be," said Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Treasury Secretary. "What are functionally capital gains realizations should be taxed."
Specifically, the Administration has proposed eliminating the rule that allows investors to identify which specific shares of stock are being sold in each transaction, one of the rules that helps middle-income investors save on capital gains taxes. Using this rule, an investor who paid escalating prices for a company's stock over time can specify that only the most expensive shares were sold, which reduces the capital gain subject to taxation. The new rule would require investors who sold their entire stake in a company to use their average cost; if they sold only part of their stake, they would be deemed to have sold the first shares they had bought.
The Administration has also proposed defining as a taxable sale any transaction that "substantially eliminates risk of loss and opportunity for gain" on the underlying security. This rule would eliminate the short against the box and at least some equity swaps, but its impact is uncertain because it does not specify how much risk and opportunity must be retained by an investor to avoid making a sale.
The Treasury estimates that these two proposals would raise $4.5 billion in new revenues over the next five years; Congressional estimates are half that amount.
But many tax experts say the Clinton proposals give Wall Street a lot of wiggle room. Transactions like the one used by Mr. Broad are expected to survive, and the tax breaks for ESOP sales, upreits and the traditional real estate swaps are not even on the policy makers' radar. "And, undoubtedly, Wall Street will soon come up with something new," said Mr. Willens, the Lehman Brothers executive.
Treasury officials acknowledge that the current proposals would be challenging to enforce and might not curb Wall Street's latest techniques. The proposals are a good start, Mr. Summers said, but "the lines are difficult to draw between hedging and transferring ownership." He added, "That's why the area has such complexity."
Mr. Willens of Lehman Brothers agreed that tougher, clearer definitions of a sale were probably the only way the Government could deal with the challenge of Wall Street's ingenuity. "Old-fashioned notions of sale are totally inappropriate for the world we live in today," he said. "You've got to look behind the niceties of language to the substance of what's happening. Have you surrendered the benefits and burdens of ownership? If the answer is yes, you have probably sold it and you should probably pay taxes."
In any case, the Administration's ideas face a tough fight in Congress, where the controlling Republicans say they are still firmly committed to lowering the capital gains rate for top-bracket taxpayers to 19.8 percent from 28 percent.
Administration advisers agree that the loophole-closing steps will probably be adopted only as part of a bipartisan compromise that also lowers the current tax rate and perhaps expands the tax break for selling homes.
 
The Beat Goes On
 
The Latest Techniques Draw a Big Crowd
Last Tuesday morning, more than 200 people jammed a banquet room at the Yale Club on Vanderbilt Avenue in Manhattan to hear specialists from Bankers Trust discuss the latest techniques for raising cash and diversifying assets without incurring capital gains taxes.
One increasingly popular approach with investors who own a lot of a single stock, said Steve Gordon of Bankers Trust, is borrowing against a hedged position -- sometimes called a zero-cost collar with debt attached. A big investor in the XYZ Corporation, for example, sets up a hedge that consists of two options contracts on XYZ stock. One protects him from a drop in the stock's price; the other lets him keep a bit of any price increase. Then Bankers Trust will lend him up to 90 percent of the value of those XYZ shares.
The bankers also reviewed equity swaps, shorts against the box and various other strategies. Although Congress might tinker with some of them next year, one speaker said, wealthy taxpayers still have "a wonderful window of opportunity" to use those techniques now.
Moreover, the bank offered other ideas -- "customized advanced techniques" -- that could be tailored to the needs of different clients. "If you want to stay state of the art," Mr. Gordon said, "you have to continually develop new products."
These strategies differ, the banker told the crowd, but each allows wealthy taxpayers to achieve that coveted objective: the deferral of capital gains taxes, optimally for as long as it takes to avoid those taxes entirely.
"You can have your cake," he said with a smile, "and eat it, too."

HEADLINE: RECORDING VIEW;
Orchestra Finds Means of Survival In Hard Times

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
UNDER OTHER circumstances, it might be tempting to castigate the Czech Philharmonic for unadventurous programming in its Avery Fisher Hall concert this afternoon. Along with Brahms's Violin Concerto, which has already had two high-profile performances in New York this season, comes predictable Bohemian fare: Dvorak's "New World" Symphony and "The Moldau" from Smetana's "My Country."
As it is, however, one is relieved to see the orchestra, long one of the world's finest, alive and presumably well. Indeed, to judge by reports from Prague, the Czech Philharmonic has been engaged in something of a death struggle since its last New York appearance, in 1990, bent on surviving if only to celebrate its 100th anniversary this year. 
 The orchestra gave its first concert as a symphonic adjunct of the National Theater in 1896, led by Antonin Dvorak on his return from America. Having safely negotiated difficult shoals over nine decades, it was brutally buffeted by the rising expectations and falling subsidies stemming from the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Czechoslovakia's return to a free-market economy and the foundation of the Czech Republic in 1993.
Confusion vied with dissension as the newly independent orchestra shunned its estimable music director Jiri Belohlavek, in 1991, in favor of a German, Gerd Albrecht, and found itself leaderless for almost two years. Many players thought that the switch would position the orchestra better internationally for tours and recordings.
Well, here the Philharmonic is, led by yet another principal conductor, Vladimir Valek, who was hired after Mr. Albrecht's departure last season, and facing an international classical-record industry in meltdown. But the former Czechoslovak state label, Supraphon, itself independent since 1992, has remained faithful for its part, celebrating the orchestra's centenary with a release of 100 CD's, encompassing many of its greatest recordings.
It is a fascinating list, heavy, of course, in the usual Bohemian and Czechoslovak suspects, but with outposts of Germanic, French, Russian and Hungarian repertory. The conductors include most of the orchestra's music directors of long standing -- Vaclav Talich, who led it almost continuously from 1919 to 1941; Karel Ancerl, who was principal conductor from 1950 to 1969, and Vaclav Neumann, who followed until 1990 -- as well as shorter-term eminences like Rafael Kubelik, Karel Sejna and Mr. Belohlavek.
Perhaps the most remarkable strain in the list is a sprinkling of no fewer than seven versions of "My Country" ("Ma Vlast"), Smetana's great nationalist epic, led by Sejna (1950), Talich (1954), Ancerl (1963), Neumann (1975), Vaclav Smetacek (1980), Belohlavek (1990) and Kubelik (1990). As a record of a continuing love affair between orchestra and work, the series is exhilarating and treasurable. As a veritable case study in the hard times that have befallen record companies (or, rather, that the companies have brought upon themselves), it is mildly depressing.
These were mostly years in which major conductors could blithely renew the warhorses, confident that buyers were ready to replace earlier versions, inevitably dimming on badly worn vinyl. But the digital compact disk, the ultimate mixed blessing, has changed all that, making permanently available the successive generations of performances, often in excellent sound. Ever more impressive reissues tumble over reissues.
Any buyer stocked with two or three of those Supraphon versions might reasonably overlook whatever new account of "My Country" may appear. For that matter, even other splendid reissues, like Kubelik's classic 1952 Chicago Symphony recording of the work, newly available on a Mercury Living Presence CD, can barely make their way through the throng.
The indispensable classic among the Supraphon versions is the Talich (11 1896-2). The old master's conception is wonderfully warm and wise. To cite just one of its many glories, the muted strings in the moonlight section of "The Moldau" give the river of the title a lovely reflective surface. (Just listen for moonbeams shimmering on water; you can't miss it in this version.) Although the recording is monaural, the performance springs to vivid life on CD.
The few years that separate it from the Sejna (11 1913-2) are crucial in terms of sound. This is another attractive performance, but the recording, taken from 78's, lacks depth; in relation to prominent strings, the winds sound recessed and pinched. Similarly, the Ancerl (11 1925-2), a slightly stiffer performance to begin with, suffers further from hard, glassy sound.
For the rest, sound is not a particular issue. The Neumann performance (11 1958-2), however, is stately, verging on stodgy.
The Kubelik recording (11 1910-2), his fifth of the work, was made live at the Prague Spring Festival in 1990, on the conductor's triumphant return after 41 years in self-imposed exile. It is easily recommendable to those who find Kubelik's marked tempo contrasts within movements and his insistent emphases less disruptive than I do. For me, the modern alternative to Talich would be Smetacek (11 1981-2), for a crisp, powerful statement, or Belohlavek (11 1986-2), for a more expansive account with good clarity in both performance and recording.
As for the orchestra at the center of all this activity, what emerges time after time is individuality. If you listened only to recordings by the great American orchestras, which prize smoothness, blend and seamless interchange, you might never know that the sinuous flute line at the start of "The Moldau" is produced by two overlapping instruments. The Czech players make no attempt to conceal the fact. Their rule seems to require instead that each player put as much character into the sound as possible; if it makes the overall fabric more diverse, so much the better.
The strings, though lean and incisive, provide plushness and warmth as appropriate when they are well recorded. Especially in the Smetacek, the brasses swagger in patented East European style. With due allowance for changing technology, the woodwinds in the Belohlavek recording retain some of the same penetrating warble of the Sejna.
Here's hoping that the qualities that stood up so well through the four decades of these recordings have survived the trauma of the last five years.

HEADLINE: Cutting Lumber In Private Forests

BYLINE: By SAM LIBBY 

 BODY:
THE state's long-dormant lumber industry is back, changing the nature of privately owned forests and raising questions about the effect on the native forest as a whole.
Private landowners are profiting from tax-abated properties by allowing lumber companies to harvest on land that often has gone untouched for decades. The harvest is primarily the oak that is the state tree and an important source of food for the forest's wildlife. 
 As a result, some scientists say, there will be dramatic changes in the ecology of Connecticut forests. Most foresters argue that controlled lumbering poses no threat to the environment, but others are wary indeed of the changes taking place.
Connecticut's lumbering industry grew by more than 25 percent between 1990 and 1993, according to a recent industry survey, pushed on by rising wood prices. Red oak, the mainstay of the state's timber industry, now fetches about $250 per thousand board feet, and can reach $425 for high quality veneer, according to industry publications. A single well-proportioned oak tree could be worth hundreds of dollars to a landowner.
"For the first time, Connecticut forest landowners are in the position to make a little return on their land, and put that back into forest management activities," said George Stephens, a forestry scientist at the State Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven.
"Some people think that clear cutting is just a terrible thing," Mr. Stephens continued. "But if your goal is to get the maximum number of oak on a property, you are essentially forced into it."
When Europeans first arrived in Connecticut, the forest had many more beech, maple and hemlock trees than today, said Jeff Ward, an assistant forestry scientist at the Agricultural Experiment Station. By the 1840's, most of the land had been clear cut for agriculture. As the West was opened to settlement, crop and pasture land was abandoned and second-growth forests quickly appeared, but dairy farmers set fires in them to keep land open for grazing.
Oak trees were best suited to take root under these conditions. Their thick, tough bark, offered protection from fires and their acorns quickly germinated, taking hold on scorched, cleared land, said Mr. Ward.
Oaks, now 45 percent of the state's forests by some estimates, have become an important component of the ecology. Acorns, for example, are an important food source for deer, squirrels, white-footed mice and many other wild animals, he said. But since 1907, forest fires have been suppressed in Connecticut, and as a result oak trees began to decline. Lumbering is now accelerating that decline, Mr. Ward said.
Lumbering increased from less than 55 million board feet per year during the 1980's to about 70 million board feet in 1993, according to a marketing survey of loggers and sawmill operators conducted every three years by the Department of Environmental Protection's forestry division.
The state's resurgent lumber industry depends on the sale of trees by thousands of small landowners. About 60 percent of Connecticut is forested, and 90 percent of that land is in private hands.
Since the state's real estate market crashed in the late 1980's thousands of acres of woodlands have been placed under municipal tax abatement, meant to ease pressure on landowners to develop their properties. Public Act 490, which allows for a dramatically lower assessment and tax, places only minor restrictions on commercial logging.
Now logging companies are looking up the names of those whose land is listed under Public Act 490 and offering to buy their timber.
The tragedy, according to Robert Perschel, regional director for the Northeast of the Wilderness Society, is that the forest never reaches its full potential, either economically or recreationally. Much of the selective cutting is "high-grading" -- clearing all the big trees and leaving the small ones standing.
"It has impacts that we're not even aware of," Mr. Perschel said. "We haven't done the studies to understand the connection between harvesting trees and the effects on all forms of wildlife and wildlife habitat. We have to be cautious, we have to be careful, we have to be conservative with what we do."
In order to encourage the growth of diverse plant and animal habitats, the current trend in forestry is not to automatically shun clear cutting. In fact, the only way to get good oak regeneration is clear cutting, or at least very heavy cutting, Mr. Stephens said, to provide the best conditions for the germination of acorns.
Having a management plan for a forest is similar to having a plan for a garden, said Mr. Ward. It's possible to cut heavily and still maintain a healthy productive forest., he said.
A possible problem is that only one in six timber operations is overseen by a forester, said Stephen Broderick, a forester with the University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension Service.
"A lot of timber buyers take the attitude that, 'If I don't log this lot, the next guy will,' " Mr. Broderick said. And sometimes owners will liquidate forest land for quick cash, without regard to the consequences. "It remains a problem," Mr. Broderick said, "and I think education of the landowners themselves is a big part of the answer."
The state is also working on stricter regulations. This year the Department of Environmental Protection started mandatory certification for all foresters and loggers under the 1991 Connecticut Forest Practices Act. The hope is to prevent unskilled operators from removing too many trees from a property and causing erosion, said a state forester, Donald Smith.
The regulations require foresters and loggers to file annual reports with the state, providing, it is hoped, the first really accurate gauge of the amount of wood harvested.
Future regulations will almost certainly include mandating forest professionals use "best management practices," state-endorsed guidelines that prevent erosion from logging roads during cutting operations, said David Smith, a professor emeritus at the Yale School of Forestry and advisor to the state forester.
Because humans have controlled nature in this region for centuries, the virgin wilderness is gone, said Karl Wagener, director of the state's Council on Environmental Quality.
But scientists are just beginning to understand the ecology of the state's oak-dominated forests.
For example, bumper crops of acorns appear every three to four years, allowing a boom in the populations of white-footed mice and white-tailed deer, two very important hosts of the ticks and pathogens that cause tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, according to an article in the May issue of Bioscience. Because of a recent bumper crop some scientists are anticipating a substantial rise in tick-borne diseases this year.
But white-footed mice, because they eat gypsy moth cocoons, have been an important factor in suppressing gypsy moth infestations and massive defoliation of forests.
Because the large white-tailed mouse population is expected to begin crashing as soon as next year as the local acorn supply shrinks, some scientists are predicting a gypsy moth infestation and defoliation of local forests starting around 1999.

HEADLINE: Changing Patterns of Commuting

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IN the spring, employees of the Philip Morris Capital Corporation will be transferred to Stamford from the Westchester County offices of Philip Morris International. That's to make room for Kraft Food International, another Philip Morris subsidiary, which is leaving White Plains for the Rye Brook location, explained K. Richmond Temple, a spokesman for Philip Morris Capital.
With the Kraft move, "Space became a premium in Rye Brook, which necessitated our looking at which groups could be easily moved, intact, out of that office," Mr. Temple said. "Philip Morris Capital Corporation was one that could, so we looked at appropriate space in the area and settled on Stamford." 
 So how will Philip Morris Capital's 150 employees handle the move? If they are like a growing number of New York residents, they will commute to Connecticut.
For years Fairfield County has been a bedroom community for New York, but there is an increasing flow of traffic in the opposite direction, officials say. From 1989 to 1995, reverse commuter traffic on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad grew 89 percent. "Those numbers were a little surprising," said Janine Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Fairfield County Information Exchange. "Everyone had the sense that people go from Fairfield County to New York, not the reverse."
Transportation officials see the trend as one way to help pay for some of the improvements underway in the county, such as a $100 million center- island platform at the Stamford train station that is designed to double its capacity. If there are fewer empty seats on return trips in the morning and evening, that means more money coming in.
"It's like the airline industry -- we have available seating, and we would love to fill it," said Charles Zabielski, a spokesman for Metro-North. "When you have traffic on the return trips, the revenue falls right to the bottom line." Even more surprising to many is the 121 percent increase in traffic between stops on the commuter rail line: people getting on in Norwalk and off in Bridgeport, for example, a commute that has tripled in ridership over the six-year period.
"The type of intermediate, or intrastate, ridership that Connecticut is experiencing is highly unusual," Mr. Zabielski said. "Typically, metropolitan riders start at one remote location, and don't get off until they've arrived in their major-city destination."
State officials say there are more than $1.3 billion in transportation projects underway in southwestern Connecticut to cope with increased traffic. "None of the work is specifically geared toward reverse commuting, but that doesn't mean that reverse commuting isn't helped by all of the projects," said Harry Harris, deputy commissioner of the State Department of Transportation. "You can't build a highway for commuters going one direction in the morning without building a highway of equal size for them to come home on at night, which creates an infrastructure for people commuting in the opposite direction as well".
"Clearly, reverse commuters are one of the two markets we are most interested in serving, the other being intrastate commuting," Mr. Harris said. That's the case in Danbury, which recently dedicated a new $4 million train station. While there is not a lot of reverse commuting into the city yet, officials hope that making it easier to get there in the morning, and home at night, will encourage economic growth.
"It's there to accommodate existing traffic that's heading south of Danbury," said John Schweitzer, city engineer and director of public works in Danbury. "But we also want to encourage people to use it to come here."
Ms. Johnson said reverse commuting is an outgrowth of the economic boom that Fairfield County is enjoying. Between 1995 and 1996, the number of Fortune 1000 companies in the region increased from 29 to 33, and Entrepreneur Magazine ranked it one of the top 30 areas for small business, she noted.
The strongest measure of commuter traffic is the sale of monthly passes. In 1989 Metro-North sold an average of 228 passes a month for commuters traveling from New York to Connecticut. That increased steadily through the study period, to 431 a month last year. Passes in the other direction still make up the bulk of the sales, but showed a smaller increase, 14 percent over the six years, from 16,726 to 19,114.
Intrastate passes in Connecticut were up 121 percent, from 825 a month in 1989 to 1,823 in 1995. Sales were up 100 percent or more on more than a dozen routes, with Stamford one of the most popular destinations: sales of Stratford-to-Stamford passes tripled, to 214 per month, and Milford-to-Stamford passes nearly doubled, from 132 to 258 per month.
Ms. Johnson said the Information Exchange chose to study the six-year period of 1989 to 1995 because mass transit typically suffers during a recession, which Connecticut endured during that period. The increases, therefore, were even more surprising. "There's been a great deal of interest in these numbers, but they raise as many questions as they answer," Ms. Johnson said. For instance, why are people choosing to commute, rather than move closer to their jobs?
She said many people are either following jobs, like Swiss Bank employees who had their office moved from Manhattan to Stamford. Others are looking for new jobs, like the thousands of IBM employees laid off in White Plains, N.Y., over the last few years, many of them now working at high-technology companies in Fairfield County, just 20 minutes away. For many, the commute does not make it worth moving.
"It's a personal decision," Ms. Johnson said. "People who have established themselves in a community are usually not eager to pick up their families and move."
The majority of Metro-North riders in both directions are in the 35 to 54 age range, which means they probably have children as well as a home, and it would be difficult to move.
"Certainly, people will go where they have to go to keep their jobs," Ms. Johnson said. "But maybe they want to hold onto their homes for a while to see how their new career is going to go, whether the company is going to stay in business, whether they like the area, and so forth."
It is not just rail lines seeing an increase in reverse commuting. Michael A. Sanders, administrator of transit and ride sharing for the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said that when his office started a Stamford-White Plains bus route recently, his office was surprised to see so many of the Stamford-bound buses filling up in the morning and White Plains-bound buses at night.
"We actually have close to even ridership in both directions," Mr. Sanders said. Of about 200 trips a day since the service started in June, about 110 are commuters originating in Stamford, and the rest are commuting to Stamford.
Also encouraging, he said, is the number of people taking the train or another bus into Stamford and connecting with the White Plains bus. In the last survey in August, 31 percent of the riders on the new line walked to the bus stop, 36 percent took a bus, 20 percent arrived on Metro-North, and 8 percent drove or were dropped off at the station. (The remaining 5 percent did not answer the survey.)
Based on projections, he said, the department expects the Stamford-White Plains bus route to be breaking even by 1998, at which point the state could turn it over to a private operator.
Mr. Harris said the reverse commuting numbers demonstrate how improvements in the infrastructure can lead to improvements in the economy -- if you make it easy for people to get to a city, more businesses will tap into its labor pool. Connecticut's investment in railroad improvements has been more than $1 billion in the last 10 years, and the state is averaging $100 million a year now in public transportation projects. In all, about 45 percent of the D.O.T. budget is geared to public transportation, he said.
Ms. Johnson said the question for transportation planners is, how do we get people out of their cars?
"We need to assure them they can get home in an emergency, that their schedule can coincide with day care, that shuttles will take them from the station to work," Ms. Johnson said. "There are some important links that have to happen to see these increases continue."

HEADLINE: State Faces Loss of a Seat In Congress

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT is expected to lose one of its six Congressional seats when representation is reapportioned after the next census in 2000, and that prospect promises some bruising political battles to come.
Possession of the six seats had been shared equally by the Republicans and the Democrats for a dozen years, but in the election on Nov. 5, voters shifted their preference toward the Democrats, who now enjoy a 4 to 2 advantage. 
 But it is the Democrats' newly-won control of both houses in the General Assembly that may prove more advantageous in the future, several political leaders said, because there, and in the Governor's office, is where the battles over which party is more seriously wounded by the loss of a district will take place.
The battle will likely be fought over bread and butter issues like the economy, jobs and education in the next two elections, when the Governor and the legislators who have the power to approve new Congressional district lines will be elected.
Under the State Constitution, the General Assembly, to be elected in 2000, is charged with redrawing the state's Congressional and legislative districts. If the legislature cannot agree on a redistricting plan, the job goes to a nine-member commission.
In interviews following this month's election, officials from each major party blamed the other side for the potential loss of the Congressional seat, and argued why it is the other side who should lose if the state's delegation is reduced to five.
"I would underline the 'if', " added Edward L. Marcus, the Democratic Party's state chairman.
Indeed, nothing will happen until the next census in 2000 determines if the state's demographic forecasts are correct. Several other states in the northeast share Connecticut's prospects in those forecasts, augering a further drain of political power from the region. States in the South and the West will grow the most, according to the Census Bureau.
Massachusetts is expected to lose one of its 10 Congressional seats. New York and Pennsylvania are expected to each lose two, slipping to 29 and 19 respectively.
Connecticut's population has declined by more than 12,000 since 1990, according to Census Bureau estimates, and it is projected to rise only by about 9,000 from 1995 to 2000. That would be a net loss of 3,000 people for the decade in a total population about 3.1 million. The state's population would have fallen more except for large numbers of immigrants, mostly from Central and South America and Asia, who replaced thousands of residents who migrated to the Sun Belt in search of jobs.
Reapportionment of Congressional seats, required every 10 years by the Constitution, normally is hotly fought over by the major parties, because seats in Congress can be gained or lost for decades depending how the district lines are drawn. In 1990, all the parties had to do was maintain the status quo, each sharing three seats. The current 4 to 2 imbalance would be enough to spark a tougher battle by itself. Losing a district will make reapportionment all the more bitterly contested.
In addition to losing a vote in Congress, the loss of a House seat would have other ramifications. For example, the clout of the largest cities in each of the new districts would be diluted because each district would take in more suburban towns, which generally have gained population while most of the cities have lost it.
The state chairmen of the two major parties agreed that the state's poor economy was the cause of its decline in population. "People voted with their feet," said State Representative Chris DePino, the Republican leader.
But they disagreed over whose fault that was. Mr. DePino blamed the Democrats, contending that they were responsible for high taxes that hurt the economy and drove people and businesses away. Mr. Marcus, on the other hand, blamed Gov. John G. Rowland for not bringing more new businesses into the state.
"Right now, the underlying issue in the state of Connecticut is jobs," Mr. Marcus said. "Connecticut is seeing blue collar unemployment and white collar unemployment in this last recession."
He said that Connecticut is the last of the 50 states to recover from the economic slowdown of the early 1990's, and the highest in bankruptcy and foreclosure per capita. At the same time, it is the first or second in income per capita because of concentrated wealth in a few towns, notably in southwestern Fairfield County.
Another point of disagreement between the two party chairmen was how to make five districts out of six. One district must go.
Should it be the first, second, third or fifth, currently held by Democrats Barbara B. Kennelly, Sam Gejdenson, Rosa L. DeLauro and James H. Maloney, or should it be the fourth or sixth, held by Republicans Christopher Shays and Nancy L. Johnson?
Mr. DePino felt the Democrats should lose a seat, since they now hold four. It would be unfair to take one of the two Republican-held districts while the Democrats could lose one and still have more, he said.
Mr. Marcus, however, thought it made perfect sense for the Democrats to have four out of five seats. He noted that Mrs. Johnson, whose district had been considered solidly Republican and in no danger of losing, squeaked by on Nov. 5 narrowly winning by just over 1,500 votes.
By Mr. DePino's reckoning, the First District, large and centered around Hartford and its suburbs, is an unlikely target for dismemberment. The Second District, composed of 54 towns and covering nearly a third of the state, and the Sixth, with 44 towns in the northwestern quadrant of the state, are both too large. The Third and the Fourth are too densely populated.
That left the Fifth District as the most likely to be broken up and dissolved according to Mr. DePino's calculations. It is also the only district that shares borders with all the other five. The Fifth happens to be held by a Democrat, Mr. Maloney, who wrested it away from the Republican incumbent, Gary A. Franks, this month.
Mr. DePino said the Fifth might be divided up between the Third, Fourth and Sixth, "but that's purely speculation on my part," he added.
"It's very likely that Connecticut will go from six seats to five," Mr. Maloney acknowledged. But when told of Mr. DePino's speculation, he laughed and said, "Well, we'll see."
Mr. Maloney said that if the Democrats controlled the State Legislature after the election on Nov. 7, 2000, he did not believe they would do away with a Congressional district held by a Democrat.
Mr. Marcus supposed that the Third and Fourth Districts could be combined, causing the loss of a Republican district.
Mr. Shays, a Stamford resident, suggested that if his Fourth District is extended northward into the Fifth, Mr. Maloney, a resident of Danbury, and he might find themselves in the same district. "There's no member who is free of the possibility of having to run against an incumbent in another district," Mr. Shays said.
Actually, Connecticut gives the job of drawing new district lines do a bipartisan committee. It is routinely supervised by the courts as well. Nevertheless, the party that controls the state legislature can approve a plan of its liking and the party that elects the Governor can veto a plan it doesn't like.
Mr. Maloney, a former State Senator, said he expects that reapportionment and the impending loss of a seat will combine to enliven the gubernatorial race in 1998 and the General Assembly contests in 2000, which is also a Presidential election year.
It was not clear how redistricting would affect candidates' stands on issues though it could, for example, if an incumbent anticipated running in a district distinctly more urban or more rural than the old district.
Another way, Mr. Shays said, would be if membership in one of the political parties is so concentrated that that party's primary becomes the election. That could push a candidate farther to the right or left, he said.
Mr. Shays noted that this year's Presidential campaign highlighted differences over the Federal budget and welfare reform among Connecticut's Congressional delegation. The same will probably happen as the time nears to draw new district lines and eliminate a position.
Nevertheless, both parties tended to run toward the political center this year, Mr. Shays said. He said he did not foresee much change from that in the future.
Nor did Mr. Maloney, who noted that the trend among voters to register unaffiliated to a party is a moderating influence. "There are fewer solid Republican or Democratic districts," he said. "They are all competitive."

The Dish On Dishes: Growth

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IT took nearly eight years for the nation's retailers to sell the first one million color television sets, four years to sell the first million VCRs, and three years to sell the first million compact disk players. By contrast, according to statistics compiled by the Satellite Broadcasting & Communications Association, a trade association in Alexandria, Va., it took only one year, from mid-1994 to mid-1995, for retailers to sell the first million 18-inch digital satellite dishes, making the product one of the fastest-selling consumer electronic items in history.
And though satellite television systems have been of little use to residents in vertical environments like New York City -- the dishes need both a secure exterior perch and a direct line of sight to their satellite -- new marketing strategies along with a recent ruling by the Federal Communications Commission promise to greatly expand both the satellite industry's horizons and the choices available to New Yorkers seeking an alternative to cable television. 
 "I've been jumping between five different news networks all afternoon and I love it," said Arthur I. Weinstein, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, describing a benefit of his new 200-channel digital satellite television system.
For Mr. Weinstein, who lives on Fire Island year round, installing a satellite system was hardly a luxury -- there is no cable television service on the island. In the last year or so, however, many other Americans -- even those who already have access to cable -- have been installing the small, relatively inobtrusive, increasingly inexpensive 18-inch dishes outside their homes and apartments. According to the Satellite Broadcasting & Communications Association, the number of satellite television subscribers nationwide is expected to grow to more than 15.5 million by the year 2001.
That growth, industry experts say, will be bolstered in part by a recent F.C.C. ruling that stunned many industry watchers. The ruling, issued in August, bars local governments and homeowner associations from unreasonably prohibiting property owners from installing the dishes outside their homes and apartments. "This ruling could have serious implications," said Debra Bass, a spokeswoman for the Community Associations Institute, an industry organization in Alexandria. Ms. Bass explained that in its ruling the F.C.C. gives condominium owners the right to install dishes on any property to which the owner has exclusive rights -- areas like private patios or balconies. It left open the question of whether co-op shareholders have the same right.
The commission is expected to rule on that issue, as well as whether individual condominium owners and co-op shareholders have the right to install satellite dishes in common areas, early next year.
"Our feeling is that homeowner associations should have the right to reasonably enforce rules regarding the means, methods and placement of these devices," Ms. Bass said. "You can imagine what will happen if everybody in a building starts installing their own satellite dish on the roof."
The issue of dishes on roofs is significant because of an inherent limitation in existing satellite technology -- typically, the dish must have unobstructed exposure to a specific point in the sky. "There are only so many places you can park a satellite in space," said Richard R. Muller, vice president of multi-unit sales for Direct TV, a Los Angeles-based company that has signed up more than 1.5 million subscribers in the last two years. Mr. Muller explained that Direct TV, in partnership with U.S. Satellite Broadcasting, a St. Paul company, beams more than 200 channels of programming to subscribers from a satellite orbiting 22,300 feet over Texas.
Private homeowners, he said, can generally find a location somewhere around the house that has the required exposure.
But since only those with a clear line of sight to the satellite can receive its signal, Mr. Muller said, and since landlords, co-op corporations and condominium associations understandably want to avoid having scores of individual dishes hanging from the side of their buildings, Direct TV is encouraging owners of high-rise buildings to install one master dish on the roof and run wires into individual apartments.
With that in mind, he said, the company has been signing contracts with system operators who will install and maintain rooftop dishes and wiring in multi-unit buildings. Last month, for example, Direct TV and U.S. Satellite Broadcasting teamed up with RCN, a New York City company that owns Liberty Cable -- which now provides video services to more than 50,000 apartments in the metropolitan area -- to mount an all-out effort to sell the company's programming to landlords and co-op and condominium boards.
Peter Price, president of Liberty Cable, explained that for properties where a master rooftop dish is used, individual unit owners and residents only have to buy the decoder box needed to unscramble the signal received by the satellite dish. Typically, Mr. Price said, it should cost individual customers no more than $400 to purchase the decoder from just about any large electronics retailer. (A decoder box with a dish costs from $399 to $899. Direct TV also offers a $200 rebate to customers who contract for a year of programming when they buy the equipment.)
Mary Kay Wedel, director of commercial business for U.S. Satellite Broadcasting -- (800) 204-8772 -- said that by combining options offered by her company and Direct TV, customers can choose among more than 200 channels.
"Our packages range from $7.95 to $34.95 a month," Ms. Wedel said, adding that Direct TV -- (800) 383-4388 -- offers programming that ranges from $5.95 to $44.95 a month. Customers typically buy a combination of both sets of programming, she said.
Other companies that offer satellite broadcasting include Primestar -- (800) 774-6378 -- Echo Star -- (800) 333-3474 -- and Alpha Star -- (888) 257-4278.
There are some drawbacks to satellite programming, however. Barry Rosenblum, president of Time Warner Cable of New York City, the company that now provides cable television service to Manhattan, Queens and parts of Brooklyn, pointed out that if a customer wants to use more than one television set, it is necessary to purchase a more sophisticated -- and more expensive -- digital decoder. Moreover, he said, the different satellite systems use different dishes and decoder boxes that are not interchangeable.
The most significant shortcoming of satellite television, however, is that unlike cable, it does not offer customers programming from the major television networks and local stations. As a result, satellite customers who want such programming have to either keep their basic cable service or, as a more archaic but economical alternative, dust off those old rabbit-ear antennas.

HEADLINE: A New Mixed-Income Village for Downtown Atlanta

BYLINE: By KEN EDELSTEIN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
SPURRED partly by last summer's Olympics spectacle and partly by a national push to revamp public housing, this city is razing two dilapidated, low-income projects that have long been a public embarrassment and replacing them with new housing.
The Atlanta Housing Authority, in a partnership with private developers, is using tax incentives, Federal grants and the more flexible guidelines that now govern public housing to build a mixed-income neighborhood in place of two of its projects, Techwood Homes and Clark Howell Homes, which are being demolished. The site is next to some of Atlanta's most valuable commercial property. 
 "Nothing that we're doing right now would have been possible a couple of years ago," said Egbert L.J. Perry, the new development's managing partner. Neither the funds nor the motivation existed to deal forcefully with the problem, he said.
Mr. Perry, principal at the Integral Group, a real-estate investment company based in Atlanta, is overseeing construction of the 900-unit residential portion of the new development, which is being called the Village at Techwood. A total of 540 of the apartments will be set aside for low-income residents.
Some tenants have already moved into the first of five residential phases at the Village, which resembles a suburban condominium complex, with three-story wood and brick buildings around landscaped parking lots.
Mr. Perry said that each phase was likely to be architecturally distinctive. The first one is scheduled for completion this winter, with the last phase slated for the year 2000.
Plans call for interweaving the apartments with such amenities as a health club, a shopping center, an elementary school and a community center. As an added fillip, each apartment will get a special high-speed connection to the Internet. "This is really setting a standard for housing revitalization," said Renee Lewis Glover, executive director of the housing authority.
Techwood Homes and Clark Howell Homes were once considered models of a new wave in low-income housing. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the first units of what would quickly sprawl out into 54 acres of red-brick, garden-style apartment buildings.
In recent years, however, civic leaders have bemoaned the crime, drug dealing and vandalism that crept across the projects. At one point the authority declared 500 of the units unsuitable for habitation.
Business leaders fretted that Techwood and Clark Howell were eyesores nestled between downtown office towers, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the fortress-like headquarters of the Coca-Cola Company. The spotlight shone more harshly on the two projects in the 90's when Olympic organizers built their athletes' village on Techwood's northern boundary and constructed a new Centennial Olympic Park two blocks to the south.
Now, most of the 1,100 units have been razed and nearly all residents have been moved out. Some former tenants have been shifted to private housing and enrolled in a voucher program to supplement their rent.
Business leaders are viewing the new development as an anchor in a still unsteady downtown revival that has followed on the heels of this summer's Games. Centennial Olympic Park, small apartment complexes, a new 1.6-million-square-foot Federal office building, plans for a basketball arena and efforts to establish a new entertainment district have raised hopes that downtown's sterile west side will become a showcase on the doorstep of the city's 2.5 million-square-foot convention facility, the Georgia World Congress Center.
"Any time you clear out a blighted area you're certainly going to improve the areas around it," said Gerald L. Bartels, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. But the new housing complex also makes the whole area easier to redevelop, Mr. Bartels said, because it creates a better link between downtown and Georgia Tech. AND since it is a mixed-income development, it may help demonstrate that the downtown area is an acceptable place for middle-income people to live, he said.
The Housing Authority was able to begin razing the two existing projects and start building the Village at Techwood because it received a $42 million grant under the Federal Hope 6 program. The guidelines for this program gave the housing agency more opportunity to join forces with private developers, to reserve some space for middle-income tenants and to require low-income tenants to undergo training aimed at making them more self-sufficient.
"To some extent, the private developer shied away from dealing with HUD in the past because of the types of facilities we were trying to build," said Kevin E. Marchman, assistant secretary for housing in the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD followed up the grant for Techwood and Clark Howell with $46 million for similar efforts at three other Atlanta projects.
The few expressions of criticism of the new development have focused mainly on the rapid pace of change. Edward L. Keating, an associate professor of city planning at Georgia Tech, notes that the authority has a record of mismanaging grant money.
"They're playing an extremely high-risk game," said Mr. Keating, who has worked as a consultant to Techwood tenants and HUD. "You're taking an agency that hasn't performed well in the past, that's got new leadership, and you're asking it to do extraordinary things. It could crash and burn."
Advocates for the poor and some residents worry that the dramatic changes will actually diminish the city's low-income housing stock.
Advocates for the homeless say vouchers don't always work as planned, and argue that bricks and mortar are a surer thing than a federally financed voucher system.
But the redevelopment has been welcomed by many others, including public-housing tenants who are looking forward to living in the new project.
"In the year 2000, I don't want to be still sitting here expecting something," said Frankie Taylor, a mother of three who has already enrolled in the self-sufficiency classes required to become residents of the village. "The suburbs are moving back to the city, I guess, and I think it's a good thing."
Mr. Perry said the opportunity to use a Federal grant as leverage with few strings attached to the physical design kicked the once-unattractive prospect of a public-housing makeover into the "comfort zone" for private developers.
He had overseen private residential projects in other parts of downtown when he served as president of H.J. Russell & Company, an established Atlanta construction and development company. Soon after he formed his own company in 1993, however, Mr. Perry had doubts that he could compete with larger firms to become the development partner for the Village at Techwood.
He therefore formed a joint venture with McCormick Baron Associates of St. Louis, which has managed and developed mixed-income projects in other regions. The joint venture is the developing and managing partner in a partnership for the residential portion of the project.
The other partners are the city's Housing Authority and an affiliate of Sun America Insurance Company, which has purchased equity shares in the project. Sun America will receive tax credits for its investment.
Additional financing is coming through low-interest loans from the Housing Authority and through conventional loans.
To Ms. Glover, the executive director of the Housing Authority, the biggest beneficiary is the authority and its clients. She noted that her agency was guaranteed new low-income housing, managed by a private company. Its loan must be repaid over the 55 years during which the authority will lease the land for a nominal fee to the partnership.
"It is an economically sustainable strategy for us," Ms. Glover said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Slowly, Hoboken's Riverfront Plans Near Reality

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE selection last month of a developer for a key building in Hoboken's attempt to revitalize its waterfront comes at a time when plans for developments on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River are receiving new impetus, but with construction to begin only when a major tenant is secured.
Three more projects are proposed in neighboring Jersey City. And all four have all or most of the needed approvals in place. 
 In Hoboken, hopes for a rebirth of the prized riverfront seemed like little more than a dream for over a decade. But that began to change last year when the tug-of-war between the city and community groups over how to develop the long-dormant southern portion of the riverfront ended in a compromise.
The 50 acres, extending from First to Fifth Streets, will be reshaped by the city in partnership with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey into an urban neighborhood of up to 2.3 million square feet of offices, housing, shops and a hotel with open and recreational space at its heart. There will also be a public waterfront walkway that will reconnect the city to the river.
The plan, drawn with public input, moved closer to reality when SJP Properties of Parsippany, known for its suburban offices, was chosen to build a 14-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office building.
Designed by HLW International in Manhattan, the $200 million brick building with masonry highlights and 50,000 square feet of shops is to rise on First Street, a block north of the landmark Hoboken Terminal, the city's mass transit hub, which is now being renovated. The architecture follows the redevelopment plan's design guidelines, among other things complementing the city's low-rise scale.
"This is the first time companies have the opportunity to take advantage of this prime office location," said Steven J. Pozycki, SJP's president.
As the first project it sets the stage to revive the rest of the riverfront, which in turn "will enhance and extend Hoboken's image as a first-class city," said Robert Drasheff, director of the city's office of waterfront development. It is hoped that the project will also give Hoboken, which missed out on the mid-80's boom, some of the tax relief, open space and jobs it badly needs.
When realized the entire waterfront project -- to be developed with public and private financing -- could generate 7,000 permanent jobs. Up to 4,000 of them could be in SJP's building, said Mr. Drasheff.
Under the redevelopment plan agreed to last year, the city sold the land to the Port Authority for $20 million. It then leased the land for $1 a year and, in turn, is subleasing parcels to developers. The first lease, for 98 years, was taken by SJP, which outbid 13 other developers. It will build, own and manage the structure.
For granting SJP the right to build on the waterfront the city will collect an annual payment in lieu of taxes. The payment, which will be based on a formula tied to the local tax rate, will begin at $2 a square foot and rise over the life of the lease. The city will also get 35 cents a foot to maintain the public amenities it will create using some of the $94 million the Port Authority is investing in Hoboken for infrastructure improvements.
(Under 1984 bistate legislation the authority was empowered to invest in waterfront projects in Hoboken and Hunters Point, Queens.)
SJP also will make land-lease payments to the authority, which Mr. Pozycki said would be about $3 a square foot, as well as 1 percent of the gross project revenues after expenses. The 50-acre waterfront development area will revert to the city once the bistate agency recoups its investment.
The SJP building reflects rekindled developer interest in constructing offices on the Hudson County portion of the riverfront.
IN Jersey City, where a swath of waterfront towers was put up in the 80's, three developers are planning office buildings at the river's edge. One with 750,000 square feet is to be built by the Lefrak Organization at the 400-acre Newport Center mixed-used project; another, of 1.1 million square feet, is being advanced by Columbia Development, a consortium of three New Jersey companies, on four acres at the 52-acre Hudson Exchange property. And at Colgate Palmolive's 20-acre Colgate Center tract a plot is being readied for a 435,000-square-foot structure.
The projects will open up both opportunity and competition, brokers and builders say. Since users are likely to come from Manhattan that city's resolve to keep jobs is also a factor, they add.
Still, most brokers believe Manhattan tenants will continue to come. Part of the reason is the absence of a corporate occupancy tax and the comforting presence of mass transit links, like PATH lines and ferries to Manhattan.
Stoking the push to build is the waterfront's lack of Class A space, the vacancy rate for which is 6 percent, reports Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage.
"Jersey City alone has absorbed 500,000 to 1.5 million square feet of space a year for five years" said Andrew Merin, a senior director at the firm's East Rutherford office. "That will be a problem to duplicate after this year."
No one doubts the waterfront's potential. The question is whether there is enough demand at this time for all four buildings.
"All this competition will do is drive down effective rents, making it difficult for the economics of any deal to make sense," said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City.
But Peter Gilpatric, project executive for the Colgate site, thinks otherwise. "Everyone will try to build a better mousetrap," he said, "but tenants will still have to pay the freight because no one will build a new building at a loss."
Linda P. Morgan, director of the New Jersey office of the Regional Plan Association, added that developing in the state's urban centers and next to transit links is sound.
Jersey City, which started reviving its riverfront 10 years ago, now has a list of corporate residents that some brokers say will be the key in attracting more. So Hoboken is the new kid on the commercial-property block, and Mr. Drasheff, its waterfront director, said that the time was ripe to initiate the redevelopment plan with offices.
Asked why Hoboken had put offices ahead of housing in its waterfront priorities, he said that it was important to first build a tax base and create jobs. He noted that the plan drawn up by the Hoboken Waterfront Corporation and adopted by the city last year called for 380 residences. The corporation, created to devise an acceptable plan, includes city and civic leaders and professional planners.
Beyond SJP's office project the waterfront plan calls for 400,000 more square feet of offices, 75,000 additional square feet of stores and a 300-room hotel. Most important is the 525,000 square feet (17 acres), mostly on two piers, which will be devoted to recreational and open space, parks, an esplanade and a riverfront walkway, said Ron Hine, president of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront.
"For the first time in 100 years Hoboken's riverfront will be open to the public and that's precisely what we have been fighting for," he said, referring to the two earlier waterfront proposals his group helped defeat in referendums. Voters objected to, among other things, the project's scale, which once had 3.2 million square feet of space, and the role of the Port Authority, which then was the master developer.
Yet doubts linger over whether the plan, and in turn SJP's project, will get off the ground. Among those expressing such doubts is Donald P. Eisen, senior managing director of the New York region, based in the office of Cushman & Wakefield in East Rutherford.
While conceding that Hoboken had excellent mass-transit links, he pointed to the city's checkered redevelopment history.
"I will believe a building in Hoboken when I see the steel," he said.
But Joel Freiser, chairman of Hoboken's waterfront corporation, said that the city has built a consensus, adding that "everyone is pulling in the same direction."
Mr. Drasheff added that the site had been cleared and the city would soon begin work on the public amenities and on utilities and sewers.
Mr. Pozycki, SJP's president, said the development agreement also has guarantees and incentives for each party to the accord to speed development. For instance, he said, payments to the city and the Port Authority do not begin until construction on the building begins. He said he expected to start next year.
In terms of the competition, he echoed officials from the city and the bistate agency in voicing confidence that Hoboken's residential character and amenities, like restaurants and shops, would serve it well, as would the planned building's proximity to major mass transit links and clear views of Manhattan.

Plan to Enliven Downtown Stamford Draws Dissent

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD

 BODY:
FOR almost half of the 30-year urban renewal period that has transformed Stamford from small town to big city, a four-acre downtown parcel called Blocks 8 and 9 has remained a pocket of small stores, restaurants, parking lots and empty lotsamid the office towers.
While a new proposal for the parcel's development has the approval of the city and substantial public support, a dispute with the F.D. Rich Company, Stamford's urban renewal developer, and concerns over parking and density have delayed the signing of contracts. 
 The proposal, for a development to be called Park Square West, was presented jointly to the city in July by the Corcoran-Jennison Company of Dorchester, Mass., and Berkeley Investments of Boston. It was one of three proposals for the parcel submitted to Stamford's Urban Renewal Commission, including one by the Starrett Corporation of New York and one by Galbreath-Rich of Columbus, Ohio, and Stamford.
"I love it," said Mayor Dannel Molloy, referring to the Corcoran-Jennison proposal. "It's a good-looking, well-thought-out proposal. It brings added value to all the properties downtown and it strikes the right balance."
Indeed, plans for the complex, estimated to cost $80 million, comply with the city's desire for a lively neighborhood of apartments, shops, entertainment and parking, providing relief from what many local residents feel is a downtown overweighted with fortress-like office buildings.
The plan calls for 400 rental apartments with one to three bedrooms in two buildings of 7 and 14 stories. Twenty percent of the total units would be offered at below-market rates. To qualify for those units, a family of four would be required to have an income of no more than $43,000, which is 80 percent of the median income here. Rent would be 30 percent of that figure.
Seventy-five thousand square feet of restaurants and specialty retailers would occupy the ground floors of the apartment buildings and fill two retail pavilions. Parking would be accommodated in 780 spaces distributed in surface areas, a parking garage and under the apartment buildings.
Among the retail uses being considered are a bookstore and brew pub that would appeal to students at the University of Connecticut branch now under construction in the former Bloomingdales across Broad Street from the site and a 35,000 square-foot, 24-hour "greengrocer" offering groceries and take-home meals. Pocket parks, roof gardens and landscaped pedestrian accessways to downtown theaters and stores are other elements in the proposal.
ALTOGETHER it is a package that municipal officials and many members of the business community and the public have said they find exciting and viable. But concerns have been expressed by the Chamber of Commerce about the height of a 14-story apartment building looming over Columbus Park, a venerable piece of downtown surrounded by several restaurants. And some residents have expressed reservations about density of development.
While Edward C. Steinberg, executive director of Stamford's Urban Renewal Commission, strongly endorses the plan, he acknowledged that "Corcoran-Jennison did not conform to the specifications in our request for proposals."
"They exceeded the 40,000 square feet allotted for retail by 35,000 square feet," he said, "and the limit of 10,000 square feet for a single store by 25,000 square feet."
The larger amount of retail space and a shortage of parking has been criticized by 33 Broad Street Associates, whose partners are the Robert Kahn and F.D. and Robert Rich families of Stamford. The F.D. Rich Company was designated by the city as sole developer of the downtown urban renewal district in 1960, and as such it has approval power over the proposals for Blocks 8 and 9.
At present Sears Roebuck & Company is negotiating to lease 33 Broad Street's 1.6-acre lot across Broad Street from the UConn branch and build a 150,000 square foot store. The 33 Broad Street lot is part of the Blocks 8 and 9 parcel, and is adjacent to the lots that would be used for the proposed Corcoran-Jennison development.
"We are very interested in placing a store back in Stamford," said Tim Conway, a spokesman for Sears, which closed its 44-year-old branch off High Ridge Road here in 1995, "but a lack of parking is a concern that we're hoping can be worked out."
Sears and 33 Broad Street Associates want the city to build a 400-car garage, in addition to the parking envisioned under the Corcoran-Jennison proposal, for the use of Sears and the general public at a cost of $6 million to $8 million. Mr. Steinberg of the Urban Renewal Commission believes that the city should not underwrite the garage because the city does not benefit from retail sales taxes, all of which go to the state. "Rich-Kahn are using their approval authority over Blocks 8 and 9 as a bargaining chip to get Sears in," he said.
Sandy Goldstein, executive director of the Downtown Special Services District, disagrees. "It's very appropriate for the public to play a role in insuring that parking gets built for the entire downtown by participating in the financing," she said. "This dispute is not good for the city."
The disagreement has held up the signing of contracts between the Urban Renewal Commission and Corcoran-Jennison until a parking study by Barton Aschman Associates, of Chicago, can be considered. The study, due this month, was financed by the city, the commission, 33 Broad Street Associates, Sears and Corcoran-Jennison.
CORCORAN-JENNISON is willing to help finance the garage, said its president, Marty Jones. "We are very happy that the city is so enthusiastic about Park Square West," she said, "and we are ready to get moving. But it's disturbing that these external factors are slowing us down."
Tom Rich, Robert Rich's son and a principal in 33 Broad Street Associates, believes that the Urban Renewal Commission is overstepping its authority. "The commission has nothing to do with Sears and our request to the city for the garage," he said. "The Mayor, the Board of Representatives, the Downtown Special Services District and the Chamber of Commerce are the ones who have to support it."
According to Robert Rich, "there are 36 years of history behind all of this." In the early 80's, he noted, the F.D. Rich Company agreed to the city's request to relinquish its right to build a 1,000-car parking garage on the Broad Street site in exchange for 350 surface spaces.
Several years later the company agreed to an additional request allowing the conversion of the lot to housing and limited retail.
"The U.R.C. made a deal with Lincoln Properties [a national development and management company based in Herndon, Va.] to develop Blocks 8 and 9 but it collapsed when the bottom fell out of the market," said Robert Rich. "Now, after they selected Corcoran-Jennison's proposal they came to us and said that they want to build much more retail than we allow. This time we said no. The project is underparked and will affect our options for retail if Sears backs out." The matter has been referred to an arbitration panel that is expected to reach a decision by the end of this year.
Meanwhile, 33 Broad Street Associates filed a breach of contract suit last week in Stamford Superior Court against the city, the Urban Renewal Commission and its director.
Jay Sandak, lawyer for 33 Broad Street, said that a commission survey had encumbered the proposed Sears site with an easement for parking, thereby preventing the Sears development from taking place and violating the commission's contract to turn over the property free and clear.
A temporary injunction is also being sought to prevent the commission from withdrawing 33 Broad Street's development rights if it takes more more than 120 days to file plans for the venture as required. A request for plans was made on Oct. 3. A hearing on the temporary injunction is scheduled for Dec. 9. No court date has been set for the lawsuit.
Carmen Domonkos, chairman of the 40-member Board of Representatives, which will have the ultimate vote on the Park Square West proposal, said that "the Riches were given our whole downtown and they made a good living from it. Yes, they made concessions, but we have a plan that can work. The economy is up now and I'd hate to see this held up until it goes down again."

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE

 BODY:
PICTURE, if you will, a land with dense forests and pristine waters, abundant in wildlife, populated by people innocent in the ways of commerce. Then imagine the place discovered by foreigners from lands with sophisticated economies, who see big profits behind every tree.
The South American rain forest, perhaps? Plunderers from multinational corporations? 
 No. We're talking about New Jersey in the 17th century, Indians known as the Lenape and explorers from Holland, the richest country in Europe, lusting for furs.
Or go back, if you will, another 12,000 years. No lush woodlands, but tundra mixed with spruce and pine. It's cold, real cold. Mammoths, elephants, mastodons and giant beavers roam the land, walruses swim off the coast. A small but hardy people make their living by hunting.
New Jersey, 10,000 B.C.
It may be hard to imagine a New Jersey before diners and turnpikes. But think about all those Indian names -- Secaucus, Watchung, Ho-Ho-Kus, Weehawken -- and a foggy picture of prehistoric New Jersey might begin to form. Then, if you're lucky, spend some time with Herbert Kraft, professor of anthropology at Seton Hall University and one of the world's foremost experts on the Lenape Indians. Or visit his small museum of Indian artifacts in the lobby of Fahy Hall, in the middle of Seton Hall.
With a little imagination, you can hear drums in the distance.
Of course, as in all archeology (Dr. Kraft's branch of anthropology), you do need some imagination -- and a lot of guesswork. "Nobody knows better than an archeologist what he doesn't know, or may never know," said Dr. Kraft, who is 69. "We can never get the songs, the dances, the interpersonal communications -- the ephemeral things, in other words."
We do know an impressive amount about Indians who lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago, though, and for much of that we can thank Dr. Kraft, who recently won the Marden R. Nystrom Historian of the Year Award from the League of Historical Societies of New Jersey. Dr. Kraft has unearthed treasures from a dozen archeological digs in the state, including tools (10,000 B.C.) from the Paleo-Indian period, decorative burial objects (645 B.C.) from the Early Woodland Period and a painstakingly reconstructed 20-gallon clay pot (A.D. 1350) from the Late Woodland Period.
Some of the artifacts are so compelling they seem like telegrams from the past. One such find, also from the Late Woodland Period, is a tobacco pipe carved with a delicate face (A.D. 1500) -- so human-looking you get the creepy feeling that you're being watched. The pipe comes from Minisink site in Sussex County, which Dr. Kraft and 30 students excavated in 1975 and 1976.
Dr. Kraft considers himself a prehistorian; that is, he is concerned with what took place before recorded history. In the case of North America, history officially starts with the appearance of the white man. "I've always objected to the fact that we start history with the Colonial period," he said.
Nevertheless, much of what we know about Indians does come from the letters, diaries and trading accounts of European traders and settlers. "So we see the Indian through the eyes of the European," Dr. Kraft said. Although Dr. Kraft is a prehistorian, he is at his most interesting when discussing the enduring -- and fundamentally wrong -- myths about the American Indian, which stem from these Colonial sources.
If you went to grade school before the era of political correctness, you were probably taught, for example, how foolish the Indians were for selling Manhattan Island to Peter Minuit for just $24 in trinkets. Dr. Kraft says the traditional spin on that story fails to take into account the difference between the way the Indians and the Dutch viewed the concept of land. "In Europe, every square inch of land belonged to somebody," he said. "According to the Indian, land was put here by God for all people. They couldn't imagine that you could sell land any more than you can sell air or water." The Indians accepted the trinkets not as payment, but as a sign of good faith.
Europeans introduced not only the idea of real estate to America, but also the related concept of the fence. In fact, the Indians' failure to grasp the notion of private property led to the Peach War of 1650, near Kingston, N.Y., which started when an Indian woman spied some peaches in a Dutch garden, crossed a fence to pick them and was killed.
Although the Lenape Indians, or "common people," had their own vigorous culture -- including a matriarchal family system, agriculture, medicine and religion -- the Europeans saw them as heathens. "They spoke of naked savages," said Dr. Kraft. "They thought them ignorant." The fact that the Indians went around half naked was baffling to these people who dressed "from head to toe," he pointed out.
THE Indians, for their part, were mystified by these strange new people. "The Indians thought the Europeans very ignorant because they couldn't survive in the wilderness," said Dr. Kraft. "These people would starve to death in a land that had always provided the Indians with an abundance of nourishment."
And if the Dutch thought the Indians were guileless for selling Manhattan, the Indians thought the Dutch were equally misguided in their trades. "The Indians thought the Europeans were stupid for selling something so valuable as a metal knife or glass beads or a brass kettle for something so worthless as a beaver skin," said Dr. Kraft.
Our knowledge of the Indians who lived here thousands of years earlier comes mainly from archeological digs. Among the most important excavations that Dr. Kraft has led was a major project between 1964 and 1976 to unearth Indian artifacts in the 37-mile-long area that extends from the Delaware Water Gap to Port Jervis, N.Y. The project was underwritten by the National Park Service because plans were then being made to build the Tocks Island Dam, which in fact was never built.
"Archeology sometimes only succeeds where you have crisis situations," Dr. Kraft said. "As long as the dam was a threat we were able to get funding."
Among the most significant finds from that project were house patterns consisting of "post molds" -- organic stains left by the posts that once formed the frames of the Indians' houses -- which tell us that Indians of the late Woodland Period (about A.D. 900 A.D. to A.D. 1650) lived in round-ended long houses made of saplings and bark. Reproductions of these long houses are on display at Waterloo Village in Stanhope, N.J., and in fact were designed and built by Dr. Kraft's son John, 44, who accompanied Dr. Kraft on most of the excavations from the time he was 11 years old, and who now serves as manager of operations at Waterloo Village.
Although relationships between archeologists and Indians have been strained in recent years, Dr. Kraft says he has taken care to maintain good relations with the modern Lenape, who call themselves the Delaware Tribe of Indians. He regularly consults with tribe officials, like assistant chief Michael Pace, on matters of protocol involving Indian burial sites and other excavation issues. "He's very sensitive to those things," said Mr. Pace, who lives in Oklahoma, along with 60 percent of the 10,236 surviving Delaware Indians. Good relations are a necessity for a modern archeologist, because of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, a Federal law that allows Indians to reclaim objects they consider sacred from museums and other collections. Dr. Kraft has not been asked to return any part of his collection.
Dr. Kraft and the Indians also learn from each other -- Dr. Kraft from the customs and ceremonies that have survived three centuries of the white man in America, and the Delaware from his research. "We're just in awe of the work that he does," said Mr. Pace. After all, without his work, the Indians themselves would know much less about their own past.

"There Was No Football on TV Either"
The first Thanksgiving, which took place in 1621 in Massachusetts, is a vital piece of American folkore. Dr. Herbert Kraft, professor of anthropology at Seton Hall University, comments that though this 20th-century painting (in an earlier style) is inaccurate in some details, it is essentially true to the event. Dr. Kraft, an expert in prehistoric New Jersey, says that the local Indians would have had somilar traditions to those in Massachusetts.
 
TURKEY was an American bird introduced by the Indians to the pilgrims, venison was also served at the first Thanksgiving.
 
CORN, SQUASH, PUMPKINS were grown by the Indians and unknown to Europeans.
 
THE INDIANS would probably not have sat at a table but on the ground. It is unlikely they would have worn fringed shirts and pants. They would probably dress in lose robes, as the Indian on the left. And they would likely not have eaten while the Pilgrims said grace. (Culver Pictures)

HEADLINE: The Luxury-Decontrol Wars

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
JUST beyond the season of glad tidings, virtually with the drop of the New Year's ball, unwelcome letters from landlords will start popping up in mailboxes at fashionable, rent-regulated buildings, heralding what one landlord lawyer has dubbed "the hunting season."
So begins the annual four-month period during which those tenants must prove that their income did not surpass $250,000 in each of the previous two years and that, therefore, their apartments should not be subject to "luxury decontrol" and their rents doubled, tripled or more. 
 Evoking sympathy for people who earn a quarter million dollars a year while occupying apartments that rent for at least $2,000 in upscale neighborhoods is, at best, a Sisyphean task -- with tenant advocates facing the uphill struggle and landlord representatives more than willing to nudge the boulder back.
And yet, since their passage three years ago, the so-called "luxury decontrol" statutes of New York State and City have affected more than just the affluent. They have also resulted in the dislocation, on technical grounds, of people whose incomes are well below the threshold for deregulation of their apartments. And, in the process, they have raised certain constitutional questions and become a wedge issue in the fractious struggle over whether, or how, the rent-regulation law covering more than a million apartments in the state will be retained beyond its expiration date next June 15.
There is no denying a degree of dread -- almost regardless of the tenant's level of wealth -- when, after months of form filling and appeal filing, he or she rips open that letter from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal and finds in bold type: Order of Deregulation.
"We've been here 36 years, and I expected to live here for the rest of my life," said one tenant of a luxury building on Manhattan's Upper West Side who, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he is appealing his Order of Deregulation. "It makes you very uneasy, it's unnerving," said the man, who now pays $2,400 a month and asserts that a neighbor's deregulated rent jumped to $12,000 -- a possibility confirmed by several market observers.
About 3,000 apartments have been deregulated so far under policies that apply to vacant or occupied apartments renting for $2,000 a month or more, with the number expected to increase.
"It's terribly upsetting," said Peter Sudarsky, 67, a tenant in the Langham at 135 Central Park West, who contends that he received an Order of Deregulation after he became confused by two of the multi-page, look-alike forms he received during the process, and mailed one to the wrong address. Mr. Sudarksy said his household income is well below $100,000.
"When you're over 65, your eyes don't focus so clearly, and the plain fact is I'm incompetent to deal with this form, that form," Mr. Sudarsky said. "I wonder how many little old ladies, people who can't read this thing, people on Social Security, are hit with this."
Under luxury decontrol -- an umbrella term for the two methods by which a landlord can start charging free-market rates -- the regulated rent for the apartment must have already reached $2,000 a month. Under one method, officially called high-rent vacancy decontrol, the apartment must become vacant before a new tenant can be charged whatever the market will bear. Under the other, called high-income decontrol, the gross taxable income for the household must have reached $250,000 in each of the two previous years.
Landlords view luxury decontrol as a just means of liberating at least a segment of the regulated market so that economic benefits will, eventually, flow for all. "You have wealthy people not paying the market rent," said Arnold Goldstein, president of Samson Management and chairman of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord organization. "As a result, the owner's rent rolls are depressed, and, thereby, that deprives the city of an opportunity to raise the assessment and obtain more tax dollars, which they would use to improve city services, so everybody would benefit.
"I just feel it's an injustice," Mr. Goldstein said.
Jeffrey Turkel, a lawyer who represents landlords in luxury decontrol cases, said: "Older folks who are retired but can still afford $2,000 a month obviously are people of means. These people are frequently living in apartments with two or three bedrooms, the children have moved away, and there are families desperate for those apartments that can't get into them. Luxury deregulation makes those apartments available to the families that really need them.
"It's unfortunate that people might have to move, but anybody with $2,000 a month to spend on rent will certainly find a place to live."
BUT it's not always so simple, as one East Side resident -- a businessman who has faced financial difficulties in recent years -- asserts. "There's the disruption factor when you have a family, a tremendous amount of anxiety attached to this," said the man, who spoke only if he would not be identified.
"I've had a substantial drop-off in income, but our income never closed in on the range of deregulation, much as I wish it had," said the man, whose apartment was decontrolled on a technicality.
"The way the rental market is these days, any apartment I looked at that would suitably house my family would already be deregulated," he said. "As I understand it, if it's $2,000 or more now and it's vacant it's already deregulated."
Tenant advocates view luxury decontrol as the first brick yanked from the rent-regulation dike.
"It's bad policy," said Michael McKee, the rent law campaign manager for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "It only helps rich landlords who own high-rent buildings where they are already making enormous profits."
"This is a tough sell to the public," Mr. McKee said, "because they say, 'Why should somebody who has an income of $250,000 a year benefit from rent regulation?' It makes us seem to be defending rich people who don't deserve protection.
"But even if you aren't concerned about people at that income level, once having established a means test for rent regulation, which is what this is, the real estate industry and its allies in the Legislature will always try to lower the threshhold."
And, in fact -- with rent regulation up for renewal in June and a Republican, George E. Pataki, in the Governor's Mansion -- landlords have vowed to do just that. The president of the Rent Stabilization Association, Joseph Strasburg, said recently that, "at a minimum," his group would push for:
* Reduction of the existing income level for luxury decontrol from $250,000 "closer toward $100,000 a year" and of the current $2,000-a-month rent threshold to "something like $1,500."
* Vacancy decontrol of all apartments so that "whenever a vacancy occurs the owner will be free to ask whatever the market will bear."
* Gradual phase-out of all rent regulation.
Mr. McKee, however, calls means-testing "a slippery slope" for a mechanism that is supposed to create "an even playing field" in a city facing a chronic housing shortage. Rent regulation, by law, is mandated when there is a 5 percent vacancy rate and, as of 1993 -- the latest survey available -- the city's vacancy rate was 3.44 percent.
In actual numbers, luxury decontrol has, so far, affected only a small segment of the market. Since the program began, according to Jonathan Grossman, chief of the luxury decontrol bureau at the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, a total of 2,631 apartments have been deregulated, almost all of them in Manhattan.
Mr. Grossman said that 1,298 apartments have been deregulated under the high-income decontrol program, all but two in Manhattan. Of those in Manhattan, 547, or 42 percent, were in the 10021 ZIP code area, on the East Side between 61st and 80th Streets.
Statistics for the high-rent vacancy decontrol program are based on rent-stabilization registration forms that landlords are required to file every year. Numbers for 1996 have not yet been tabulated, Mr. Grossman said, but 526 apartments were deregulated in 1994 and another 807 in 1995, for a total of 1,333. Of those, 1,286 were in Manhattan, 46 in Brooklyn and one in the Bronx.
But the impact ripples well beyond the hard data. "Take the number of people who realize that their time is coming," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a large Manhattan rental and sales brokerage. "They know that it's going to happen within a couple of years and, so, they exercise the choice to move before it does."
"Mostly, they are buying," Ms. Packes said, pointing out that "the rental market doesn't have less expensive options for them" -- especially in a climate where a one-bedroom apartment can easily go for $1,500 or more.
Barbara Corcoran, chairman of the Corcoran Group, agreed: "They don't wait until they receive notice that their apartment is being deregulated. They are savvy people. And, fortunately, they have the financial wherewithal to purchase."
For those who remain in, and those who move into, a deregulated apartment, the rent increase can be sizable. "It's common to see rents double or triple," Ms. Corcoran said, citing a loft in TriBeCa where the rent climbed from $2,000 to $5,000. Ms. Packes said a deregulated apartment on Park Avenue jumped from $2,500 to $7,500.
And Ms. Corcoran said she knew of "some exceptional examples where rents increased tenfold."
"There was a 10-room Park Avenue apartment where an elderly woman was paying $2,000 a month," she said. "Her net worth was more than $50 million. Her family didn't want to relocate her, so her rent was increased to $20,000."
And then there are those whose apartments have been deregulated for procedural reasons, even though their incomes may be nowhere near the $250,000 threshold.
"For me," said Samuel Himmelstein, a tenant lawyer, "the big issue is the issuance of default Orders of Deregulation, which can occur on a variety of technicalities." The tenant may not mail in one of the forms in time, or, for a variety of reasons, fails to respond at all, Mr. Himmelstein said. Sometimes, no decision is rendered in a case that began in one calendar year before the landlord starts the process again the following year. "The tenant's response is often confusion: 'Why should I answer this again?' Or, they get the docket numbers mixed up," Mr. Himmelstein said.
"It points to a fundamental flaw in the statute," he said, "which is that if a tenant doesn't answer or makes some kind of procedural error, the state doesn't check their income. It just presumes the income is over $250,000," then issues a default Order of Deregulation.
"And when tenants attempt to convince D.H.C.R. to vacate these default orders," Mr. Himmelstein said, "in many instances attaching copies of their tax returns, the D.H.C.R. is refusing to open up these cases." D.H.C.R. officials insist they are merely adhering to the letter of the law.
According to the law, every year between Jan. 1 and May 1 -- the period that Mr. Turkel refers to as "the hunting season" -- the landlord for an apartment where the rent is over $2,000 can send an Income Certification Form to the tenant. The form asks the tenant to list all occupants of the apartment and to certify whether or not the household income has surpassed $250,000 for two years. The tenant must return the form to the landlord within 30 days.
IF the landlord disputes the information in the Income Certification Form, or if the tenant does not respond in time or at all, the landlord can file an Owner's Petition for Deregulation with the D.H.C.R. by June 30. The D.H.C.R. then mails a copy of the owner's petition and a response form to the tenant. A failure to respond within 60 days can result in a default Order of Deregulation. "They won't even check with the tax authorities, they just deregulate," Mr. Himmelstein said.
Stanley P. Danzig, a former Civil Court judge in Manhattan who still practices law, claims he returned the Income Certification Form in time, indicating that his income was "embarrassingly lower" than $250,000, but that he never received the Owner's Petition for Deregulation. "The next thing I know I have a notice saying I'm destabilized," he said. Judge Danzig pays $2,160 for a two-bedroom apartment in the Belnord, a 1908 Renaissance Revival building at 209 West 86th Street.
Because Judge Danzig did not respond to the owner's petition, which he says he never received, the D.H.C.R. will not reconsider its order deregulating his apartment, his lawyer, Robert Katz, said. "D.H.C.R. does not ask the state Department of Taxation to verify the income," Mr. Katz said, "they only ask if the person answered the landlord's petition. This is insufficient protection where you are trying to deprive someone of his rights to his apartment."
Mr. Katz said he plans to file a brief supporting a suit brought by Mr. Sudarsky -- the man who claims he was confused by look-alike forms and mailed one to the wrong address -- questioning the constitutionality of the D.H.C.R.'s strict enforcement of the procedures.
Mr. Sudarsky's lawyer, Seth Miller, asserts that D.H.C.R.'s reliance on the reliability of mail delivery places tenants at risk. "The Owner's Petition for Deregulation comes in the middle of the summer, when a lot of people are away," Mr. Miller said. "It looks a lot like the Income Certification Form that was sent by the landlord earlier; the two can easily be confused."
Mr. Sudarsky's suit against both the D.H.C.R. and his landlord, Jeffrey Manocherian, contends that, "on its face and as applied," the law is unconstitutional.
"The statute provides that a tenant's apartment may be deregulated, under the guise of 'luxury deregulation,' merely because the tenant did not answer or did not answer completely, within 60 days, a notice sent by regular mail in the middle of the summer," the suit says. "The statute makes no provision for a tenant to vacate such default, no matter how excusable."
Mr. Manocherian did not respond to a request for comment on the case. But Paul Roldan, the D.H.C.R.'s deputy commissioner for rent administration -- speaking about the agency's policies rather than a specific case -- said the decontrol law "requires the agency to deregulate apartments whose tenants have defaulted in submitting income verification information to the agency.
"Now, that's regardless of those tenants' actual incomes."
The law, Mr. Roldan said, "requires that the tenant's answer be submitted within 60 days of the date the agency sent the landlord's petition -- 61 days is a default, and it's that strict."
Asked if some of the defaults could be avoided if the agency changed the appearance of the forms and used return-receipt mail, Mr. Roldan said: "We're always trying to make the forms more clear. We will look into any suggestion regarding our forms." As to the use of return-receipt mail, rather than just first-class and certified mail, Mr. Roldan said, "That would be something we might want to study."
Landlords, too, have difficulties with the process.
Some tenants intentionally use different versions of their name on their leases and tax forms, said Mr. Goldstein of the Rent Stabilization Association. "The problem is that we make the petition out as the name appears on the lease," he said. "So let's assume it's John Smith on the lease. The tenant may be filing the tax return as J.B. Smith, so we don't get a match. Believe it or not, our application gets rejected."
Mr. Turkel said: "Some tenants file from their summer house. If the tenant provides misleading information, the tax department may not be able to find their return." Also, he said, self-employed people can manipulate their income. "Every other year, they can just pay themselves their bonus on Jan. 1 instead of Dec. 31, so that they never make $250,000 in two consecutive years."
In the landlord-tenant realm, each side of the coin usually bears starkly differing images.
There is the advertising executive who declares that the apartment she uses five days a week at 800 Fifth Avenue is her primary residence, while her husband lives and works in Michigan and comes back East to spend weekends at the home they own in Connecticut -- though it is occupied by their children and grandchildren.
"I filled out the Income Certification Form and, for the last 10 years, the apartment in Manhattan has been in my name," said the executive, who declined to be identified. "And anyway," she said of her court appeal to overturn the order deregulating the apartment, "my net income is under $250,000, so that's not an issue."
But Robert Goldstein, the lawyer for the landlord, sees it differently: "Here is someone who is married and apparently lives with her husband as husband and wife when their schedules allow it. They have an apartment in New York City that is rent-stabilized and, thereby, they are getting a benefit from the State of New York in that their apartment is worth a lot more than they are paying.
"Her husband argues that since he is not a primary resident of the apartment, his income should not be counted. But he gets a benefit by having a New York City apartment. He uses it whenever he wants, and he doesn't pay taxes to the State of New York.
"I mean this is the great example of how people in New York think that they have a birthright to rent-regulated apartments."
And then there are cases that stretch the bounds of credulity.
Stephen and Deborah Weiss, along with their two small children, live in a 35-story, white-brick building at 245 East 63d Street. They pay $2,800 for a two-bedroom apartment.
Mr. Weiss, an environmental lawyer, said his income is "comfortably below" the $250,000 threshold -- as he so indicated on the Income Certification Form that arrived in early 1994, requesting information about his earnings in 1992 and 1993.
SOON after, however, a form arrived asking about the income of his son -- then all of 1 year old. "I wrote to the D.H.C.R. and attached a copy of my son's birth certificate," Mr. Weiss said. And, based on that evidence, the D.H.C.R. denied the landlord's petition to deregulate the apartment.
But then, "about three weeks later," Mr. Weiss said, "we received a request for additional information from the D.H.C.R." The Weisses concluded that the new request "had crossed in the mails with the department's prior order" denying the landlord's petition for deregulation -- and made the consequential error of not responding. "Unbeknownst to us, the landlord had commenced a collateral proceeding, related to income in 1993 and 1994, and they overlapped," Mr. Weiss said.
On Jan. 6 of this year, the dreaded letter arrived: Because they failed to respond to that second request for information, the Weiss's apartment had been deregulated.
They plan to move soon.
"The landlord acted within his rights," said Mr. Weiss. "The regulations were put on the books for his benefit, and he was availing himself of that benefit. But the manner in which the proceedings were executed gives me little confidence that the general populace is being fairly treated.
"I'm a lawyer who deals day in and day out with intricate and sometimes arcane documents," Mr. Weiss said. "What happens to old people?"

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Heads or Tails, a Star Investor Will Fill His Pockets

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
THERE are some people you just don't want to encounter on the opposite side of the table when you are making a deal. They are savvy business people who always seem to know when a market has bottomed out and when it has peaked. If they are buying, you sure hate to be selling.
For many investors, Michael F. Price has been that kind of guy. A renowned value investor who runs the Mutual Series funds, Mr. Price has a knack for finding investments that are undervalued. Likewise, some investors say, when he decides to sell it may be a sign that an investment is fully valued. 
 So coin collectors, take note. After a couple of decades of collecting, Mr. Price is selling his entire cache of ancient Greek and Roman coins. The collection, in gold and silver, has been assigned a presale value of $1.5 million to $2 million.
The estimate could prove low. "When you have a good collection and sell it together, it always generates more money," said Eric McFadden, director of Seaby Coins in London.
Even so, it will be chump change to Mr. Price, who late last month sold his Mutual Series of five mutual funds to Franklin Resources for more than $600 million and a contingency that could add $200 million to the total over a few years. He bought the fund business, known as Heine Securities of Short Hills, N.J., for about $4 million in 1988. Some observers considered his decision yet another sign that the boom in mutual funds had reached its zenith.
Though Mr. Price, 45, has been buying paintings for a new home, he denied that the coin sale signaled a switch in his personal life to serious art collecting. "I pretty much accomplished what I wanted to," he said of the coin business.
"I want to find some other thing to do now -- just like with my business -- and I have no idea what," added Mr. Price, who was recently divorced.
The prices of rare coins have traditionally moved in the same direction as those of other hard assets, like real estate, fine art and precious metals. But they have moved more independently in recent years. Along with bullion, the market for gold and silver coins peaked around 1980 and fell as inflation subsided. Since then, volatility has diminished.
"The market's been relatively stable over the last dozen years," Mr. McFadden said.
But in that narrow range, prices have been climbing of late. "After 1991, prices went down 10 percent to 15 percent," said Harvey Stack, whose Stack's Rare Coins of West 57th Street in Manhattan will sell the Price collection at auction on Dec. 3. "They're now back up, and we're hoping they're better" than they were that year, when Nelson Bunker Hunt sold a much bigger and more valuable collection.
The American Numismatic Association, of Colorado Springs, puts coin collectors' transactions at about $1 billion a year. Ancient coins, those minted before A.D. 1000, account for perhaps $100 million to $200 million of that activity, Mr. McFadden said.
Discoveries this decade have greatly increased the supply of old coins, causing prices to fall, especially for the more common Greek coins, some of which can be had for $10. The ancients buried their wealth instead of banking it, and troves of 1,000 to 5,000 coins have turned up in Europe with the advent of powerful metal detectors.
Edward Milas, owner of the Rare Coin Company of America in Willowbrook, Ill., said he sold his personal collection five years ago. "The very rare coins, the very high-quality coins, still bring good prices," he said. "But for the most part the ancient market has suffered because of the magnitude of coins that have come onto the market."
THE Price collection includes 257 coins, many of exceptional beauty and rarity, minted between the sixth century B.C. and the seventh century A.D. "The quality of the sale is magnificent," said Ira Goldberg, a senior executive of Superior Stamp and Coin in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Coins representing the first 12 Roman Caesars are the backbone of the collection. A real prize is a gold aureus issued by Octavian, which could bring $80,000 to $100,000. "This coin is very difficult to obtain in silver, and he's got one in gold," said Richard Giedroyc, international editor of Coin World, a hobbyists' magazine published in Sidney, Ohio.
The Price sale kicks off a week of activity for coin collectors. There will be several auctions, followed by the New York International Numismatic Convention, Dec. 6 to 8 at the World Trade Center.
The market, however, is not being invaded by speculators. "What we're seeing is a lot of collector interest -- not investors and dealers," Mr. Goldberg said. "And that in itself tells you you're not at the top of the market."
Mr. Milas, of the Rare Coin Company, concurred. "I feel this is not a prime time to be a seller," he said, "but really a better time to be a buyer."
But in a book by Peter Tanous called "Investment Gurus," to be published early next year by the New York Institute of Finance, Mr. Price describes how you never want to be buying what the smart people -- George Soros, the Pritzkers and the Tisches, to name a few -- are selling. Lovely as these old coins may be to hold, ardent believers in Mr. Price's strategy may well conclude that now is probably not a good time to buy ancient coins for investment purposes.

GRAPHIC: Photos: One highlight of Michael F. Price's collection of ancient coins is a silver tetradrachm, shown at right and below, minted in Greece in 405 B.C. It has a full-face portrait of Apollo on one side and a kinetic chariot race on the other. The presale value assigned by the auction house is $35,000 to $45,000.; Mr. Price will sell his entire coin collection at auction on Dec. 3 through Stack's Rare Coins. Lawrence Stack, a friend of Mr. Price since childhood, speculated that the investor paid $1.5 million for the coins over the years and estimated that they would bring as much as $2 million.; One prize in the collection is a gold aureus issued by Octavian, with his portrait on one side and an engraving of a crocodile on the other. Minted in January of 27 B.C., it celebrates his defeat of Anthony and Cleopatra. The aureus could bring $80,000 to $100,000. Stack's said Mr. Price paid $70,000 to $80,000 for it a few years ago.

Montclair's Artists Make Their Presence Known

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
It's official: Montclair is teeming with artists. In what it touts as the first official artist census of a town, the Montclair Arts and Cultural Alliance has tallied the number of artists living in the town, which New York magazine has called "the Upper West Side of the suburbs."
Some 250 self-proclaimed artists responded to the survey, which was circulated this summer, but Paul A. Scipione, a marketing professor at Montclair State University, says that means there are about 1,000 bona fide artists living in the town, which has a population of 38,000. Nearly half of them are visual artists, and a quarter are musicians. But the survey also identified photographers, nonfiction writers, magicians, lyricists, stagehands, choreographers -- practitioners of 40 different arts disciplines. 
 Organizers hope to use the data to obtain financing for an arts center downtown. David Rosenak, a co-chairman of the alliance, argues that artists are engines for economic growth and points to SoHo, Lincoln Center and Theater Row in Manhattan as examples. He added that the survey proved Montclair to be an alternative to New York City for the seriously creative. Artists deserve to "have a home and a family," he said. "We do art here, too."

HEADLINE: Use of Road Salt Endures Despite Concerns

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI 

 BODY:
DESPITE global warming, snow still falls through the winter on much of the nation, ice still forms on highways and road department spreader trucks still pour salt on the problem.
According to the Salt Institute, a trade association in Alexandria, Va., the Snow Belt consumes 10 million tons of rock salt in an average season, and as much as 18 million tons in a severe winter like that of 1994-95. (The winter of 1995-96, especially snowy on the East Coast, used up 14.4 million tons.) 
 The use of salt is anathema to many environmentalists, who contend that runoff into rivers and streams kills fish and aquatic plants, and that roadside plantings are also affected. "Salting the roads affects every facet of the surrounding environment," said Zev Ross, conservation coordinator for the River Alliance of Wisconsin.
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection says much of the damage is caused by runoff from improperly stored salt stockpiles. "There is a potential for water supply contamination," said Andrew Briscoe 3d of the Salt Institute, which recommends storage under a roof on an impermeable asphalt or concrete pad, with all runoff channeled into a catch basin. Health officials say highly saline drinking water, with salt concentrations above 250 parts per million, poses a danger to the 15 percent of Americans who are both sensitive to salt and have high blood pressure.
 Until recently, most complaints about salted roads centered on the corrosion they caused to cars and trucks. But modern vehicles offer far better undercarriage protection from road salt than their predecessors had, and the salt controversy has largely become an environmental concern. Still, despite the complaints, salt remains king in the New York City metropolitan area, its use dictated largely by its effectiveness in melting ice and by simple economics. (It costs $30 a ton, compared with $675 a ton for calcium magnesium acetate, a less-corrosive substitute that is used on some bridges in Michigan.)
Sand is even cheaper, at only $5 a ton, but it doesn't melt ice and, maintenance officials say, requires costly and time-consuming cleanup operations come spring.
Joe Doherty, program manager for snow and ice control at the New York State Department of Transportation, says that in an average winter the state spreads 600,000 tons of rock salt, mixed with liquid calcium chloride so that it forms a solution and stays in place, on some 42,000 miles of icy roads.
"We're aware of the environmental problems, and we have cut back," Mr. Doherty said. "We use just enough to do the job."
New Jersey uses the same chemical mix, according to John Dourgarian of the state Department of Transportation. "We use the salt only when it's absolutely necessary, when our pavement-temperature monitoring tells us of the potential for icy conditions," he said. New Jersey stores 141,000 tons of rock salt statewide, and 632,000 gallons of liquid calcium chloride.
Connecticut mixes two parts of salt with seven parts of sand and uses 300 pounds of the mixture for each mile of two-lane road. "We've had some complaints about auto corrosion and environmental damage," said Michael Turrano, transportation maintenance director for the Department of Transportation. "Now we're experimenting with liquid magnesium chloride, which does less damage and saves a lot of cleanup time because it's a liquid." The experimental liquid sells for 85 cents a gallon.
Mr. Ross of the River Alliance says some states are experimenting with environmentally benign alternatives that also have the advantage of being agricultural byproducts. "In Wisconsin," he said, "they're trying to use the waste from cheese production."

HEADLINE: A Dream Engine Becomes Reality

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
TWO Japanese auto makers have succeeded in developing a new type of gasoline engine that can deliver substantial improvements in fuel economy without sacrificing power.
Proponents say that the new engine, known as a direct-injection engine, could represent the next fundamental change in engine technology, as significant as the shift in the last two decades from carburetors to fuel-injection systems. 
 "This engine should be the base concept for all engines in the future," said Akira Kijima, general manager of engine design at the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. He said the new engine combined the fuel efficiency of a diesel power plant with the power and relative cleanliness of a gasoline engine.
In the direct-injection gasoline engine, fuel is sprayed directly into the cylinder -- where combustion occurs -- rather than being first mixed with air. That allows more precise control of the fuel and air mixture, reducing fuel consumption by 25 to 35 percent, engineers say, while offering slightly greater power and acceleration than conventional engines.
Automotive engineers have been pursuing direct-injection engines for several decades. In the 1960's, a young Mitsubishi engineer, Hirokazu Nakamura, now the company's chairman, visited Detroit to see such an engine under development at the Ford Motor Company. But only now have electronic engine controls advanced enough to allow such engines to become workable.
Some big problems must still be overcome, if the engines are to become as important as their proponents hope. The engines cannot yet meet California's emission requirements, so they will not be offered in the United States in the foreseeable future.
The engines cost more, too, and consumers -- particularly in the United States, where gas prices are low by world standards -- have not been willing to pay extra for fuel economy.
"Obviously, affordability is a big issue," said Gary Smyth, a manager in the advanced powertrain group of the General Motors Corporation in Michigan. He said direct injection was just one of many approaches to reducing fuel consumption.
Mitsubishi is offering its engine, a 1.8-liter in-line four-cylinder, in its new Galant sedan and Legnum station wagon, which went on sale in Japan in late August. Orders have been strong, with 91 percent of Galant buyers and 39 percent of the Legnum buyers opting for the direct-injection engine even though it adds about $300 to the cars' prices.
At the end of next year Mitsubishi plans to introduce the engine to Europe in the Carisma, a car it builds in the Netherlands in a joint venture with Volvo.
Toyota is expected to announce next month that its two-liter, four-cylinder direct-injection engine will be an option in Japan on its Corona sedan.
Even in Japan, where gasoline costs about $3.50 a gallon, consumers have not flocked to a previous generation of engines, known as lean-burn engines, that offer somewhat improved mileage but do not represent a radical technical shift from existing engines. Lean-burn engines have put off consumers because they have less power, which the auto companies say is not the case with direct injection.
Virtually all auto companies are thought to be working on direct-injection gasoline engines, although the Japanese seem to be in the lead. An official of the Honda Motor Company, which prides itself on its engines, said Honda had not decided whether to mass-produce direct-injection power plants.
Tadahiko Takiguchi, a senior managing director of the Mazda Motor Corporation, said the company would first use direct injection in diesel engines. Direct-injection diesel engines have become popular in Europe, and Volkswagen is offering one in the United States in the Passat, a midsize car. But diesel engines are noisier and produce more soot than gasoline engines.
Gasoline engines work by igniting a mixture of gasoline and air, generally at a weight ratio of 15 parts of air to 1 part of fuel. This is done by mixing the air and fuel before they enter the combustion cylinder.
If the proportion of air can be increased, making what is called a leaner mixture, the fuel efficiency climbs. That is because when the fuel ignites, there is more air in the cylinder to expand and to push the piston down.
Lean-burn engines, while mixing air and fuel outside the cylinder, could work with 20 to 24 parts of air to 1 part of fuel. Direct-injection engines use a ratio of 40 or 50 to 1, raising fuel efficiency 20 percent over lean-burn engines.
The key is what is called a stratified charge. Rather than a homogeneous mix of air and fuel, the fuel concentration is kept highest right near the spark plug, allowing combustion to take place. Elsewhere in the cylinder is a lot of air without much fuel.
To accomplish this, the air entering the cylinder is made to swirl so that the fuel, injected separately under high pressure, is swept up in the air flow and carried toward the spark plug without dispersing. The top of the piston, rather than being flat as in a conventional engine, has a sunken area that traps the fuel and brings it to the spark plug.
While this might sound easy, controlling the combustion under different driving conditions requires ultra-precise timing of the fuel and air flow. Direct-injection engines were made possible by modern electronic engine controls and by the ability to simulate fuel and air flow on computers.
The fuel savings are greatest when the engine is idling. In highway driving, or when high power is needed, the stratified approach cannot provide enough power and a homogeneous air-fuel mixture is used.
A big problem is emissions, particularly of nitrogen oxides, or NOx. The three-way catalyst normally used to reduce these emissions does not work for lean air-fuel mixtures, which has kept lean-burn engines from catching on in the United States.
Toyota and Mitsubishi say that in their direct-injection designs, the nitrogen oxide emissions can be reduced by 90 percent through other means, like recirculating exhaust gas through the engine. But even so, the emissions are unlikely to meet American regulations, particularly in California.
Companies like Toyota are trying to develop a catalyst that could operate with lean mixtures, clearing the way for wider use of direct injection. "The lean NOx catalyst will be a major breakthrough," Mr. Smyth of General Motors said.

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "New Technology for Gasoline Engines"
The direct-injection gasoline engine sprays fuel directly into the combustion chamber in each cylinder, where the gasoline mixes with air. The engine provides exceptional fuel economy because the mixture, on average, contains a high ratio of air to fuel. To make the combustion of this "lean" mixture efficient, an indentation in the top of the piston pushes the richest mix into contact with the spark plug.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE;
Rerouted Copters Jar Ears to East

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For the residents of the Upper East Side, already indignant about horn-honking traffic tie-ups at the Queensboro Bridge, the agreement by helicopter operators that went into effect Oct. 1 promised at least one source of peace and quiet: the skies.
But what they got, much like the divisive plan to ease Queensboro Bridge congestion, is an agreement that appears to pit one neighborhood against another. Residents east of First Avenue complain that much of the air traffic that once buzzed west of Second Avenue has been rerouted over their neighborhood. 
 Unlike previous complaints about helicopter noise, which involved seemingly random flyovers on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, the new complaints result from new helicopter routes that took nearly seven months to negotiate. Under the agreement, National Helicopter and Liberty Helicopter, whose tourist flights make up much of the copter traffic over Manhattan, promised to fly higher than before, mainly over water and away from residential areas.
"But they've taken all the copters over there and put them over here," said Patricia Namm Saffran, an artist who lives on the top floor of a six-story apartment building at 65th Street and First Avenue, near the East River. "Have you ever watched a Vietnam War movie? It's like that."
Joy Held, a grant writer who works and lives near 65th Street and York Avenue, counted 36 helicopters flying overhead between 10:30 and 11:30 A.M. on Sunday, Oct. 27. She gathered 93 signatures from neighbors in less than an hour to protest.
Last year, there were nearly 141,000 takeoffs and landings at Manhattan's four principal heliports, according to a study by the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Under the voluntary agreement with La Guardia air traffic control that went into effect last month, National and Liberty agreed to fly at least 100 feet higher than the 1,400 feet now required and fly north over the East River, instead of over Second Avenue, then west across Central Park at 86th Street, instead of anywhere in the park.
Maureen Connelly, a spokeswoman for National Helicopter Corporation of America in Farmingdale, L.I., said that its pilots conformed to the agreement but that corporate and broadcast-media helicopter operators may account for the increased noise. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: An Economy of Happily Ever After?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the White House and Congress prepare to attack the big issues that could shape the economic landscape for years to come, Washington is bathed in something of a rosy glow.
Balancing the budget? Bipartisan cooperation should yield a happier outcome this time around. 
 Saving Medicare from bankruptcy? For all the political Sturm und Drang during the Presidential campaign, the two parties are not really that far apart.
Putting millions of unskilled welfare recipients to work? The nation can create plenty of jobs for everyone.
Most telling of all -- and the presumption on which much of this sunny outlook rests -- is a certain economic cockiness that is rooted in the idea that we do not need to worry about a serious business downturn any time soon. It is a byproduct of nearly six years of steady, if modest, growth; low inflation; strong job creation, and resurgent international competitiveness. Not to mention the stock market, where a post-election continuation of a remarkable two-year run is seen by both parties as a validation of their own policies.
"If we can keep interest rates down with the deficit-reduction package and a balanced budget, keep investing in education and technology and keep expanding trade, I'm not sure we'll be as victimized by the business cycle as we have been in the past," President Clinton said shortly after the election. "We may be able to have much more stable and much longer-term growth than we ever had before."
And that reassuring hue is reflected around the country, where many business leaders and Wall Street investors seem convinced that President Clinton and the Republicans who control Congress will hold each other in check while hammering out solutions to potentially destabilizing problems, allowing the economy to keep rolling along without a recession.
But just how realistic is all this optimism? What if the conventional wisdom both inside and outside the Beltway is wrong?
"I am deeply suspicious of the seemingly smug attitude that we have tamed the once-ominous business cycle, that inflation is dead, and that it is onward and upward for the economy, the markets and for Washington's ability to fix anything and everything that ails America," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
Indeed, we have heard this sanguineness before, often just before the next downturn. Citing the example of the late 1960's -- when policy makers and economists convinced themselves they could fine-tune the economy through any potential peril, only to lead the nation into a deep mess in the 1970's -- Mr. Roach said it was folly to believe that steady growth and low inflation, or policies predicated on them, could be maintained indefinitely.
"A balanced budget amendment can work if the economy stays on a steady-state path of stable growth and low inflation," he said. "As soon as the economy deviates from that path and the Fed takes a shot at controlling the economy and we have a recession, which is obviously going to happen in the next few years, the path gets altered permanently."
To be sure, there are solid reasons for optimism. In Washington, both parties profess to have learned painful lessons about fiscal recklessness, and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy since the last recession has been seen as exemplary. Out in the real economy, there are signs that long-term structural changes have seriously dampened inflation.
Still, it seems a fair question to ask: Is Washington really prepared to cope if a nasty or even moderately unpleasant shock comes along? If it is not, what will it mean for consumers who are amassing staggering amounts of debt, former welfare recipients who are holding down their first jobs, investors who keep plowing money into the stock market and companies that are counting on nothing but steady expansion ahead?
"The probability of a recession is at a historical low point," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. But if the positive scene he envisions gives way to an economic downturn or a return of political gridlock in Washington, he said, the outlook will be very different: a rise in economic populism and possible trade protectionism, and a downturn in corporate profits and stock prices, all contributing to an environment of slower growth.
INDEED, for those with a degree of skepticism, rosy assumptions are a challenge to history. The current expansion, at five years and eight months, is already the third-longest of the century, after the nearly nine-year boom in the 1960's and a slightly shorter one in the 80's. Should it last until 2002, the target date agreed on by both parties for eliminating the deficit, it would be the longest on record.
But if a recession were to occur, either as a result of a mistake in monetary policy or because of an external shock like a sharp rise in oil prices, it could wreak havoc on the effort to balance the budget.
In the economic assumptions that underpin their budget plans, neither the Administration nor the Republican leadership explicitly makes any provision for a downturn. Both sides, though, say their budget numbers reflect the long-term growth potential of the economy, and thereby take into account, to some degree, the possibility of cyclical ups and downs.
On the assumption that a balanced budget plan is implemented, the Administration, in its most recent projections, sees growth running at 2.3 percent for most of the next decade; the Republican estimate is 2.2 percent. Both sides are updating their figures in preparation for next year's negotiations. Because of the upbeat economic outlook, Republicans are most likely to revise downward the estimates of the deficit in coming years.
But consider some bad-news possibilities examined by the Congressional Budget Office. If growth were to prove just one-tenth of a percentage point lower than projected each year, it would leave the deficit $16 billion bigger than it would otherwise be by 2002. If the inflation rate were one percentage point higher than projected each year, it would add $22 billion to the deficit by 2002. If interest rates were one point higher than projected each year, it would mean the deficit would be $53 billion higher in 2002.
And in a study earlier this year of forecasting accuracy, the budget office found that its own five-year economic projections starting in the late 1970's proved overly optimistic -- but not as much so as those made by successive administrations.
EVEN before such long-term concerns can arise, however, there are more immediate political realities at play.
"Don't forget, this isn't easy," said Charles A. Gabriel Jr., a political analyst in Washington for Prudential Securities. "Right now the optimism is very generic, and people are willing to engage in a suspension of disbelief. But there's still residual bad will from the campaign, and there are radically different ideas about how you balance the budget."
Start with the looming fight over the proposed balanced budget amendment, which Republicans strongly favor and plan to make an early test of their legislative strength in the next Congress. The Administration is opposing the measure, despite Mr. Clinton's suggestion this month that he is resigned to its passage.
To Republicans, enshrining fiscal rectitude in the Constitution would remove from the political process all the excuses for why the nation's books cannot or should not always balance. To many Democrats, including Mr. Clinton, that is exactly the problem with the amendment. They maintain that despite the bond market's insistence on public parsimony, the Government should retain the ability to use fiscal stimulus, albeit judiciously, to arrest and reverse a recession, as it has for more than six decades. (The amendment, as most recently drafted, would require a three-fifths vote in both the House and the Senate to run a deficit.)
Indeed, the fight over the amendment has highlighted this question: To what degree should fiscal stimulus be seen as the inevitable and proper response of the Federal Government to a downturn?
If a recession, and a resulting shortfall in tax revenue, came during a concerted push to balance the budget, the Government would be left with a conundrum. Cutting spending further -- or raising taxes -- to keep deficit reduction on track could make the downturn steeper or longer as a result of fiscal contraction. On the other hand, providing some fuel for a recovery through a fiscal stimulus would risk the wrath of the bond market, which could send interest rates higher.
Proponents of sticking to deficit reduction, even in a downturn, argue that fiscal policy was becoming modestly tighter during the 1990-91 recession, and does not appear to have exacerbated the situation. Moreover, they say, the experience of 1993, when the Clinton Administration raised taxes as part of its deficit-reduction plan without noticeably crimping the economy, suggests that the benefits in lower interest rates outweigh whatever drag that fiscal policy puts on the economy.
"The old Keynesian formula, if it was ever true, has proven no longer to be valid," said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group.
But there is an even bigger question in how other policy initiatives, like welfare reform and rescuing Medicare, fit into the balanced budget effort.
The welfare legislation put together by Congressional Republicans and signed by President Clinton last summer will require several million people, most of whom have little or no work experience and few skills, to find jobs in the next several years. Mr. Clinton has proposed employer subsidies and tax credits to encourage companies to hire welfare recipients. But the nation's ability to absorb a big addition to its labor pool will depend, in large part, on how robust the economy remains.
IF the economy softens, the Federal Government will come under additional pressure from the states to provide more money to help create jobs. But at a time when Congress will be looking to cut spending, it is doubtful that Washington will be willing to provide much more cash. As it is, Republicans are counting on the new welfare system to save $54 billion from now through 2002 by cutting specific programs like food stamps and by providing block grants to states, which will have wide discretion in how to allocate the funds.
Moreover, Congress is likely to find it politically difficult to increase spending to help welfare mothers find jobs if an economic downturn raises the unemployment rate, which is currently 5.2 percent.
"If a tight labor market is the best employment program we have and it doesn't work very well, then what are we going to do under more normal times, when labor markets are not so tight?" asked Richard Kogan, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group in Washington that studies programs for low-income people.
Mr. Kogan said that the experience in states with very low unemployment, like Michigan and Wisconsin today or Massachusetts in the 1980's, suggested that even strong demand for labor generated few private-sector jobs for welfare recipients. Yet spending money to create public-sector jobs holds its own perils, especially in a downturn.
"If the United States were to put a fairly hefty amount of money into public-service employment, this raises the question of what you do for people who lose their jobs in a downturn but are not welfare moms," Mr. Kogan said.
A recession, he added, would not only mean hardship for many people who previously would have benefited from social welfare programs. It would also mean that the role of welfare programs in stabilizing the economy would now be limited. .
Welfare spending has always risen more or less automatically as the economy has turned down. But under the block grant system, with its assumption that states bear a responsibility to stretch their funding as far as possible without running to Washington for more, it is questionable whether welfare spending would rise enough to act as a meaningful fiscal stimulus.
The uncertainty about whether Congress will provide more money for welfare is just one of many questions about what a balanced budget agreement will look like. At the top of the list is whether such an agreement would prove credible as the years went by, especially if economic conditions changed.
"While I am fairly confident that a major deficit-reduction package will be enacted next year, I am equally sure that the measure will not be sufficient to achieve balance by 2002 anyway," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office who is now with the Brookings Institution.
"We will dress this proposal up in estimates that suggest it will achieve balance," Mr. Reischauer said. "But then economic weakness, or a failure to achieve the spending cuts that are called for, or unexpected increases in entitlement spending, or some permutation or combination of those factors will insure that we don't reach balance by 2002. If we want to reach balance, we will either have to enact further spending cuts or further tax increases."
MR. CLINTON'S current budget proposal has been roundly criticized by Republicans for containing overly optimistic economic assumptions and for back-loading the really painful reductions onto the last two years of the plan -- after Mr. Clinton has left office.
The President's plan, Republicans say, is full of gimmicks that allow him to minimize or postpone cuts in nonmilitary discretionary spending -- the one-sixth of the Federal budget on which nearly all the reductions proposed by both parties will have to fall.
(Most of the rest of the budget is either fixed or much harder to cut in one way or another: interest on the national debt, which must be paid to avoid a Government default; Social Security and Medicare, which have huge and powerful political constituencies to defend them against assault, and the Pentagon, which has already absorbed deep cuts.)
The Administration, for example, forecasts that corporate profits will be much stronger in coming years than does the Republican plan -- 8.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2002 versus 7.4 percent -- which helps the White House to project higher tax revenues. The Administration also counts on phasing out some of its proposed tax cuts after 2000 -- a step that some analysts said amounts to a stealth tax increase.
The Republican plan has its own problems -- including a question of political viability. While Republican leaders say they have a more credible plan, they rely on even deeper spending cuts than the Administration and continue to promise tax relief.
Neither party at this point has a great deal of enthusiasm for plunging back into the political maelstrom surrounding Medicare. But they have little choice. First up is the necessity for a short-term fix to avert insolvency in the hospital-insurance portion of the program, which is projected to go into the red in 2001, and to address the continuing drain on the general budget from rapid increases in payments for physician care.
Mr. Clinton has proposed dealing with the short-term problem largely by cutting payments to health care providers. The Republicans, wounded by Mr. Clinton's portrayal of them during the campaign as willing to hurt the elderly to fix the program, are unlikely to make any bold proposals of their own.
THE two parties will probably ask an independent commission to propose a solution to the long-term problem: how to reorganize the program to plan for the surge in demand -- and costs to society and the Government -- that will accompany the aging of the baby-boom generation. And eventually, Washington will have to begin looking seriously at how to revamp Social Security to cope with the same demographic phenomenon.
All of which suggests a sobering conclusion: that despite the current rosy economic outlook, the divide between President Clinton and the Republicans over how much pain the electorate will tolerate to solve the nation's problems could well mean that these issues and their progeny will dog America beyond 2002.

"Assuming the Best"
The Republican-controlled Congress bases its forecast that the dwindling Federal deficit will vanish in 2002 on two optimistic premises: The economy will cruise along indefinitely on a moderate-growth, low-inflation, low-interest-rate course, and Federal spending programs and entitlement benefits will be cut deeply along the way.

HEADLINE: The Racism We Condemn

BYLINE: By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University, is the author of "One by One From the Inside Out: Essays and Reviews on Race and Responsibility in America."

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
We emerged from a dream-like political campaign, in which almost nothing of substance was said about racial issues, only to find that from St. Petersburg, Fla., to Pittsburgh the problems of alienation, resentment, contempt and enmity are still with us. And now, out of Texaco's corporate headquarters, out of its executive suite in White Plains, N.Y., comes evidence of unacceptable racist attitudes, and even the possible obstruction of justice.
Reactions across the political spectrum to the Texaco discrimination scandal illustrate the cynicism so rife in American race relations. Civil rights leaders called for a national boycott and demanded that Texaco resolve its discrimination case, expand its diversity training programs and increase its dealings with minority-owned businesses. 
 Peter I. Bijur, Texaco's chairman and chief executive, has moved with breathtaking speed to appease these demands. Texaco agreed on Nov. 15 to pay more than $140 million to settle the lawsuit brought by its minority employees, and the company also pledged to turn its affirmative action programs over to a committee largely appointed by outsiders. This is all well and good, but much of what Mr. Bijur has so eagerly agreed to will do little to lessen racial tensions, inside his company or anywhere else.
Consider "diversity training." Texaco has pledged some $35 million for employee workshops on race relations. Yet Texaco had already held such workshops. (Indeed, during the executive meeting recorded on tape, Robert Ulrich, the company's treasurer, called African-American employees "black jelly beans" -- a reference to something said at a diversity seminar!)
I doubt that anyone astute enough to rise to the top of a major corporation really believes that diversity workshops are the way to get blacks and whites to work together with mutual respect. But few will now dare give candid expression to that view. Hiring a diversity consultant is a primary way for the company to show its concern for minority sensibilities.
Or, consider the corporate focus on so-called economic development -- that is, buying more products from minority-controlled businesses and spending more on advertising in black media outlets. Jesse Jackson, who organized the nationwide boycott of Texaco, has for years made this economic brokering a centerpiece of his strategy. But this "development" rarely trickles down to rank-and-file black folk, and it does very little for those minority workers within the white-owned companies. But it is a relatively inexpensive way for companies to assure civil rights leaders that their demands have been met.
So much for the liberal solutions. But there is cynicism enough here to cover both sides of the political spectrum. For years, conservatives have been saying that we should be a color-blind society, that taking race into account in the workplace inhibits achieving this goal and that racial discrimination should be punished, case by case, wherever it exists. That sounds quite reasonable until one begins to think about the following question: How are we supposed to know whether discrimination exists?
At Texaco, fewer than 1 percent of those earning more than $106,000 a year are black, and not one of the 49 highest-paid executives is black. From these numbers alone, it seems reasonable to conclude that blacks have a hard time attaining positions of real power. Indeed, Mr. Bijur effectively acknowledged that the numerical racial imbalances constitute a problem, ipso facto.
Yet conservatives who advocate a color-blind America think that one cannot prove discrimination with statistics. The color-blind argument insists that looking at employment numbers is wrong, that one should focus instead on the treatment of individuals.
But outsiders or lower-level employees are seldom privy to the complex deliberations and the raft of subjective judgments that go into the selection of the top people in any large, complex organization. Texaco, for instance, had used secret lists to designate which employees had the potential to be senior managers. In proving acts of discrimination, would conservatives always insist that African-Americans produce "hard" evidence like secret tape recordings of senior managers making racist or racially inappropriate remarks?
Of course, corporations also have an interest in collecting their own evidence -- to establish that they do not discriminate. So companies across the country will most likely be paying greater attention to work-force diversity, especially in the upper ranks. And the careers of more and more managers will now probably be determined in part by the number of minority employees they recommend for promotion.
Making the advancement of minority employees a measure of a manager's performance is particularly offensive to the color-blind idealists, since it practically guarantees that some promising blacks will receive preference over equally promising whites.
Another name for this practice is "affirmative action." Experience in the Army, and in a number of large businesses, has shown that some program of this sort -- which does not lower standards but concentrates on finding and promoting qualified blacks -- is probably the single most effective way to eliminate informal barriers to black advancement. Though it may not be politically correct on the right to say so, the Texaco case provides ample support for this point of view.
It is strange that this is a message that conservative theorists must learn from their more pragmatic political allies in business. Yet, I find it stranger still that the deep problems in the inner cities, issues that lie at the core of much racial tension in the country, go untouched despite the frenetic activity by whites and blacks in the Texaco case. It would appear that, when civil rights leaders manage to get rich and powerful Americans to pay attention to racial justice, the most profound and enduring injustices are not part of the conversation.
That $35 million which Mr. Bijur has promised the diversity consultants would do wonders for some inner-city school systems. But asking a penitent business organization to take some responsibility for uplifting the black poor does not appear to be part of the "development package." And, I admit, my proposal is a radical idea.
It's too bad that it takes insensitive and insulting remarks to make powerful businessmen acknowledge their sins and make their amends. And it's too bad that, even then, one does not presume to ask them to surrender too much of their wealth or power.

HEADLINE: Health Cares;
Harry and Louise Were Right, Sort Of

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the frightening things that were going to happen if the Clinton health care plan passed? Like losing the right to choose a doctor or a health plan? How about the slow death of old-fashioned medical insurance and the like-it-or-not march into health maintenance organizations? Not to mention restricted benefits and even rationing.
Harry and Louise, the fortysomething couple created by the Health Insurance Association of America, vented their anxieties about these possibilities -- and, by extension, millions of other Americans' fears, too -- in a series of television commercials in 1993-94, fretting around the kitchen table as health care legislation was furiously debated, and ultimately killed, on Capitol Hill. Now, with the benefit of three years' hindsight, it can be said: Harry and Louise were at least half right. There were indeed big changes in their future. 
 Imagine the surprise around that kitchen table today: The proportion of American workers in managed care plans has grown to 74 percent, up from 55 percent in 1992, when Bill Clinton was beginning his first campaign for health care reform, according to a recent survey of employers by KPMG Peat Marwick.
As for choice, the study found that employers of all sizes have reduced the number of alternative health plans available to their workers over the last year; among mid-size employers, 52 percent now offer their workers only one plan.
"People believed that if the Clinton plan died the managed care revolution would die with it, that you'd be able to keep your choice of doctors," said Bob Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard. "People were calling the Clinton plan socialized medicine because they were going to force you into an H.M.O., and yet we've had this huge growth of managed care since the plan died."
The supposedly halcyon days of fee-for-service medicine, covered by traditional indemnity insurance, have clearly passed for most Americans: Just 26 percent of the people who get their insurance through work are enrolled in the traditional plans, down from 71 percent in 1988. And hospital stays are now so strictly limited by some insurers that Congress recently stepped in and required that new mothers and their babies get a minimum stay of 48 hours.
Still, Louise did not have to deal after all with the new "billion-dollar bureaucracy" that she so often worried about, because the Government was left out of this revolution.
And a lot of analysts argue that, in retrospect, this turned out to be a good thing -- and not just because of the abiding American mistrust of bigger government. Insurance companies and employers had the expertise and the stomach, these analysts say, to do things that elected officials could not do -- like closing underused hospitals, restricting the freedom to choose a physician and taking other measures to squeeze down the costs of health care.
Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, argues that President Clinton ought to be thankful the dirty work was done by somebody else.
"Maybe it's not a bad thing to have it come out that way -- because otherwise government would have gotten a terribly bad name for things that are not really government per se, but things that needed to be done," Mr. Reinhardt said. "Someone had to say to doctors and patients, you cannot have all these resources all the time." He concluded that "the managed care industry has become the flak-catcher for all the things that Clinton would have been the flak-catcher for."
Moreover, there is little dispute that in the realm of cost control, which was always the primary concern of many of the policy elites anyway, the private sector has been quite successful. And it restrained health care spending without the unwieldy, confusing new Government entities that Harry and Louise -- and, judging from the polls, millions of other Americans -- had found so unappealing.
No big new alliances, the much-maligned purchasing cooperatives that Mr. Clinton and the chief architect of his doomed plan, Hillary Rodham Clinton, envisioned as the middlemen between consumers and the insurance companies. No complicated cost controls or global budgets.
 
 
 
Private Choices
 "While it's certainly true that there's been a powerful movement in the direction of managed care, these are private choices rather than government choices," said Bill Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, which led the industry's fight on Capitol Hill.
"Moreover, in an employment situation, if you're really unhappy with the choice your employer made, you often have a union to go to bat for you, or an employee benefit department. You may not always prevail, but it's easier than going to some distant government agency."
But would Harry and Louise be happy with the way things turned out? Do they even realize how much has changed? A survey published last summer for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a health research organization, suggested that most Americans do not perceive the great slowdown in health care costs, not to mention the profound changes in the marketplace.
Still, there are signs that at least Louise, who was usually the one reading up on health care in the commercials while Harry stood by supportively, would have recognized that there was a price to be paid for letting employers and insurance companies work their will.
Paul Starr, another health care expert at Princeton who worked on the Clinton plan, said, "What we're getting is managed care but without the consumer protection and patients' rights that people have a right to expect."
He noted that the alliances, unlike employers, would have been required to offer consumers a variety of health plans, and would have provided many more safeguards for consumers' rights.
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care research group, said, "There are a lot of people out there who feel, or should feel, that they fought off the Government monster only to find themselves faced with changes in the marketplace that they care about a lot more."
Defenders of managed care systems, like Karen Ignagni, president of the main industry group, the American Association of Health Plans, argue that consumer satisfaction within these networks is actually quite high.
"Consumers now have access to a product that is more affordable, that has very low out-of-pocket costs, that has more comprehensive benefits and that stresses prevention," Ms. Ignagni said. Where people have a choice, as is the case with Medicare recipients, they are increasingly choosing managed care plans, she said.
But there is clearly some backlash brewing among the Harrys and Louises of America. Accordingly, Congress has shown a new willingness to regulate the industry in the wake of a flurry of complaints, ranging from shortened hospital stays to restrictions on what doctors in some managed-care networks can tell their patients about treatment options. The law requiring 48-hour maternity stays is only the beginning, many analysts say.
"The big, somewhat underreported health care story of 1996 is that the Congress, in a bipartisan manner, has moved into regulating health insurance, which they have not done before -- and there wasn't a dime's worth of difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on this," said Mr. Gradison.
President Clinton, for his part, has announced that he will appoint a panel of experts to recommend ways of protecting consumers in this fierce new health care marketplace. This kind of bipartisan consensus reflects the broad popularity of these regulatory moves, analysts say.
In other words, Government may not look so frightening to Louise these days, as she sits at her kitchen table fuming over her latest dispute with her new health care plan. Perhaps she has a few regrets. She may even be muttering, once again, her mantra from three years ago:
"There's got to be a better way."

HEADLINE: Meridel Le Sueur, 96, Reporter And Children's Book Writer

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Meridel Le Sueur, who reported on the plight of the poor during the Depression and celebrated the free spirits of early Americans in her fiction for children, died on Nov. 14 in Hudson Memorial Hospital in Hudson, Wis. She was 96 and had lived in the hospital's residential unit in nearby St. Paul, Minn., for the last few years.
Miss Le Sueur, a native of Murray, Iowa, grew up among the radical farmer and labor groups that informed her youth, like the Populists, the Farmers Alliance and the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World. Her first story was published in a literary magazine in 1927, and she kept writing into her 90's. 
 Her mother and stepfather, Marion Wharton and Alfred Le Sueur, were ardent socialists who imbued her with an idealism that never left her. Just beyond their Middle Western kitchen the world was filled with eloquent radicals: Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Lincoln Steffens and Emma Goldman.
Largely self-taught, Miss Le Sueur teamed with kindred souls in literary communal relationships and, sent East by her mother, moved in with Goldman while attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She came to know John Reed and met Theodore Dreiser and Edna St. Vincent Millay at Mabel Dodge's literary salon.
She won acclaim in 1927 for her story "Persephone" and again in 1934 for "The Horse," a strange, powerful novella. With her distinctly personal style of journalism, she rendered detailed observation with a sense of political urgency. She reported on bread lines and unemployment offices and on deserted mining towns and desolate farms.
Blacklisted during the McCarthy period, she continued to write, turning out experimental prose works, novels and poems and storing them in her basement in Minnesota.
Her highly praised children's books, in which she interwove history and regional lore in poetic prose, included "Little Brother of the Wilderness: The Story of Johnny Appleseed," "Nancy Hanks of Wilderness Road: A Story of Abraham Lincoln's Mother," "Sparrow Hawk" and "Chanticleer of Wilderness Road: A Story of Davy Crockett."
Miss Le Sueur's own wilderness relented as collections of her prose began to appear in the 1970's. Her recovery culminated in "Ripening: Selected Work, 1927-1980" (Feminist Press, 1982), a clear reflection of how she had listened from childhood to the stories of immigrants and Indian women.
An early milestone in her career was "North Star Country" (1945), the story of how Minnesota and Wisconsin were settled. It was reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1984. Her recent work included "The Dread Road" (1991), a novel about a mining strike in Colorado.
She is survived by two daughters, Rachel Tilsen of Hudson and Deborah Le Sueur of Graton, Calif.; 8 grandchildren; 27 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Journal;
Popular TV Show Helps Enliven a Neighborhood

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Nov. 23

 BODY:
As Sharon Bondroff walked home one day in the spring, she was horrified to see a man lying on the sidewalk and another man standing over him, pointing a gun. A police officer stood at the corner, apparently oblivious to the scene behind him. Ms. Bondroff raced over.
"Aren't you going to do anything?" she screamed. 
 "You think I'd just be standing here if that was real?" the officer replied.
Ms. Bondroff laughed at the retelling of the incident. In a flash, she said, she realized what was going on. Ms. Bondroff lives in the Fells Point section of Baltimore, a historic waterfront area of cobblestone streets and old brick buildings just east of downtown.
In recent years, as Baltimore's urban renaissance has spread outward from the Inner Harbor area, Fells Point has attracted not only new residents, bars, shops and restaurants but also the production company for "Homicide, Life on the Street," the critically acclaimed police drama on NBC-TV on Friday nights.
What Ms. Bondroff saw that afternoon was the taping of a murder scene, and like many Baltimoreans -- momentary palpitations aside -- she could not have been more delighted.
For five television seasons, "Homicide" has staged all sorts of crime and mayhem around Baltimore, in the process making the city as much a star of the show as its actors. But unlike many other movies and television shows that are shot on location, "Homicide" does not pack up and leave when the eight-month shooting season ends.
Most members of the "Homicide" crew, about 120 people, have made Baltimore their home, working out of the show's Fells Point production office on Thames Street, a converted recreation center, and pumping as much as $27.5 million a year into the local economy, according to the Maryland Film Office, a state agency. The principal cast members rent homes or town houses for the season, and one, Andre Braugher, a Chicago native, who plays Detective Frank Pembleton, lives here year round with his wife and young son.
"It's a nice town," Mr. Braugher said the other day, as he left the production office. "The people are nice. They are more amazed at our presence here than people in Los Angeles or New York, but they are uniformly pleasant."
As a major city between New York and Washington but without their cultural and political clout, Baltimore has always been proud of its assets -- the Orioles of professional baseball, world-class medical centers, ethnic neighborhoods and, in recent years, a thriving film community.
Inspired in large measure by Barry Levinson, a Baltimore native who set his films "Diner," "Avalon" and "Tin Men" in Baltimore, other film makers have come here and used the city's ample supply of electricians, carpenters and art designers. Mr. Levinson created "Homicide" with Baltimore in mind, and lately, other directors, like Jodie Foster, Clint Eastwood and Terry Gilliam, have shot parts of movies in the city, using many of the same production people.
"This is a wonderful opportunity to show off the city that I live in," said Vince Peranio, the "Homicide" production designer, who grew up in south Baltimore and who broke into show business as an art director for another well-known film maker from the city, John Waters.
It is Mr. Peranio and Kathi Ash, the "Homicide" location manager, who are primarily responsible for wedding the city to the show. They drive around town each week, searching for buildings and neighborhoods that might fit future scripts. Often, local residents call the "Homicide" office to offer their homes and businesses for shooting.
But just as the city has taken to "Homicide," so have the featured actors to the city, as residents and as volunteers for charity projects and public school programs. Richard Belzer, who plays Detective John Munch, has been particularly active, helping raise money for Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Boarder Babies Project and the local public radio station, WJHU.
Not all Baltimoreans are enamored of the presence of famous actors and their colleagues. Celie Ives, who owns Celie's Waterfront Bed and Breakfast, a small inn across the street from the "Homicide" headquarters, has complained about blocked streets and the city's willingness to accommodate the production company's needs for parking. Her guests are often forced to use a parking lot several blocks away.
"I haven't lost business," Ms. Ives said. "But for the elderly, it's difficult to walk up and down the street to a parking lot."
Other local business owners say Ms. Ives represents a minority view. They contend that despite the occasional disruptions caused by parking restrictions, "Homicide" has taken a cherished place in city lore, alongside the Orioles and steamed crabs.
"In general, they have been very good for the city," said Steve Bunker, the owner of China Sea Marine Trading Company and president of the Fells Point Community Organization. "The only complaint I ever hear is parking, and that's a minor inconvenience. But they have provided jobs in a community that desperately needs jobs, and they have been good neighbors.
"Besides," he added, "there was never much parking down here, anyway."

HEADLINE: Walter E. Hoffman, 89, Dies; Judge in Agnew Proceeding

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Judge Walter E. Hoffman, who took his turn at historic proceedings that disgraced Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and branded a fellow judge as a felon, died on Thursday at Sentara Leigh Memorial Hospital in Norfolk, Va. He was 89.
At his death, he was a senior judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting in Norfolk. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him to the court in 1954. 
 In 1973, Mr. Agnew went to his political demise in a kickback scandal. He stood accused of a lucrative ward-heeling scheme that dated from his public service in Maryland, where he rose to Governor, and continued with payoffs he reaped while Vice President.
Mr. Agnew engaged in convoluted bargaining with Federal prosecutors to avoid prison and pleaded no contest to a tax evasion charge. Judge Hoffman, presiding over the proceedings, accepted the plea, and Mr. Agnew resigned as part of the bargain. The judge, who would have preferred a prison sentence, made clear that he regarded the nolo contendere as equal to a guilty plea.
Mr. Agnew died on Sept. 17 at 77.
In the case that put one of his peers into the dock, Judge Hoffman was assigned to Reno in 1984 to handle the final corruption trial of District Court Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas, Nev.
The drawn-out proceedings proved highly contentious, with Judge Claiborne fighting to the last. But he was found guilty of tax evasion, the first sitting Federal judge to become a convicted felon. Judge Hoffman sentenced him to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine, and Judge Claiborne was removed from office.
Walter Edward Hoffman was born in Jersey City and graduated in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1928. He received a law degree from Washington and Lee University in 1931 and went into private practice in Norfolk.
He rose to leadership in the Virginia Republican Party and headed the state Republican convention in 1952, straddling a split between Eisenhower and Taft Republicans. He sided with General Eisenhower and supplied support at the National Convention that propelled the General to the White House.
Upon his appointment to the bench, Judge Hoffman was faced with defiance of court-ordered school integration. As he issued rulings to implement the Supreme Court mandate ending racial segregation, some schools shut down rather than comply, and a cross was burned on his front lawn.
He was shunned by friends but persisted in his duty, finally issuing an ultimatum to officials to open the schools to black students or go to jail. In later years, he described his dealing with the Agnew case as easy compared with the personal trial he underwent during school integration.
In recognition of his service, the Norfolk courthouse bears his name.
Judge Hoffman is survived by his wife, Helen Caulfield Hoffman; a daughter, Carole Lee Hancock of Norfolk; a son, Walter E. Jr., of Virginia Beach, Va.; two stepdaughters, Ann B. Shumadine of Norfolk, and Elizabeth B. Libey of McLean, Va.; a stepson, William P. Ballard Jr. of Norfolk; a sister, Mary H. Vellines, also of Norfolk; five grandchildren; seven step-grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Taking Sides in the Superstore Fight

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Even as the political battle over the future of superstores in New York City grew heated and occasionally rancorous last week, executives at Price Costco, a major name in warehouse stores, congratulated themselves for opening two new stores in Brooklyn and Queens, where sales easily matched expectations.
More than 12,000 people streamed through the doors of the company's new outlet in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, on its opening day. And in 12 hours, nearly two tons of ground beef and 12,000 breakfast pastries were sold. 
 But consumer demand for discount retailers and superstores has never been in dispute. Instead, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to allow megastores in certain manufacturing areas faces intense opposition because of concerns that the plan is too sweeping and would remove citizens and the City Council from the approval process.
Mr. Giuliani has maintained that his plan would further the city's economic revival by filling underused industrial areas while drawing retail businesses to the city. City officials have estimated that as many as 57 megastores would open in the next 10 years, recapturing $1.5 billion a year in retail sales that now flows to the suburbs, and creating more than 13,000 jobs.
But Council members made it clear that the proposal would have to be significantly scaled back to win approval when the Council votes on it next month. At the same time, the issue became fodder for next year's mayoral election, with the Mayor running radio commercials supporting the changes and Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a likely mayoral contender, running commercials against them.
Lost in the political bickering are many basic arguments concerning the arrival of superstores in New York City. Interviews with urban planning experts and New Yorkers who believe the zoning changes would have profound effects on the city's economy and quality of life revealed a broad range of opinions. There were assessments that city officials had for too long neglected the evolution of the city's manufacturing and retail economies, and that poor and minority neighborhoods had suffered for it. And there were fears that the age of megastores would drive industrial businesses out of the city, and that homeowners and their rights were being forgotten in favor of moneyed developers. VIVIAN S. TOY

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Michael Beyard -- Senior director for research at the Urban Land Institute
 
"Neighborhood strips may have to make some changes, but the major competition for big box stores is other big box stores and regional malls, not neighborhood stores."
While megastores have been a staple in suburban communities for years, the industry has just recently turned to cities like New York as its last frontier, said Michael Beyard, an expert on commercial development at the Urban Land Institute, a Washington-based research organization.
But while many community groups fear that megastores will hurt New York's neighborhood shopping strips, like they have hurt Main Street shopping districts in small towns across the country, Mr. Beyard said the concerns were unfounded.
"Small towns in other parts of the country have been devastated by the arrival of big box stores, but New York is an entirely different situation because you have more than seven million people and an enormous market," he said. "Adding five million square feet of retail is a blip, and you're adding it to neighborhoods that are being underserved right now." The Mayor expects more than 10 million square feet of big box retail space to open in the next 10 years.
Mr. Beyard said he believed that existing businesses would be able to compete with the megastores.
"I don't see it as the death knell for smaller stores," Mr. Beyard said. "Neighborhood strips may have to make some changes, but the major competition for big box stores is other big box stores and regional malls, not neighborhood stores. People in New York will always want to be able to walk to their neighborhood stores for certain things. You might walk to the corner hardware store for a box of nails because you don't feel like driving to Home Depot for it, or maybe it's a quart of milk at the corner store because that's all you need."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Mark Kupferberg -- Co-owner of Kepco Inc.
 
"The concerns we have about the issue are not a threat to leave but an expression of how much we want to stay. But if the Mayor's policy change goes through, it will put a lot of pressure on us to leave."
Kepco Inc., which employs about 250 people, has produced electronic equipment in Flushing, Queens, for more than 50 years, and its owners said they would like nothing more than to stay there for another 50 years, or more. But when Home Depot opened a 24-hour store next door a year and a half ago, Kepco's landlord called almost immediately to start renegotiating the company's lease, which expires in 1998.
"The concerns we have about the issue are not a threat to leave but an expression of how much we want to stay," said Mark Kupferberg, one of Kepco's co-owners. "But if the Mayor's policy change goes through, it will put a lot of pressure on us to leave."
He said that retail businesses would drive up rents in manufacturing areas, and he warned that the most desirable sites for megastores would naturally also be the best manufacturing sites, making it more difficult for industrial businesses to stay in the city. "I don't think the city understands that this is an unintended consequence of what they're doing," he said.
"The planning people say our company's concerns are not valid because there are technicalities that would keep our site from being developed for retail," Mr. Kupferberg said. "But I find that hard to evaluate, and all we can deal with is the reality of trying to get a deal to stay where we are. And as of right now, the city is not geared to deal with businesses like ours, and there aren't a lot of people to help us with the hurdles that we face."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Brendan Sexton -- President of the Municipal Art Society
 
"The point is we need to get an urban orientation for superstores in terms of design, placement and community input."
City dwellers may share many of the same concerns and desires as their suburban counterparts, but cities offer very different challenges to the superstore industry, said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society.
"In a lot of ways I think we're more ready for superstores than they are for us," he said.
When Bradlees opened in Union Square in 1995, for example, it was stocked like a suburban store, with lawn mowers and other suburban accouterments.
"They have since changed their whole buying strategy," Mr. Sexton said. "But the point is we need to get an urban orientation for superstores in terms of design, placement and community input."
An influx of sprawling stores in manufacturing areas will neither change the face of retailing nor wreak havoc on industrial businesses, he said, but the city should retain some form of community review because of the character of its neighborhoods.
"There's real opportunity to improve the economy, and this could be very profitable for New York City," Mr. Sexton said. "But we are a city of neighborhoods, each of which is unique and should be handled in its own way."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Patricia Dolan -- Vice president of the United Civic Council of Queens.
 
"We are fearful that this is the opening salvo in a campaign which is going to ultimately take away all community review and input on siting decisions."
The Giuliani administration maintains that the existing rules have discouraged some businesses, like supermarkets and discount retailers, from going to the city, while not regulating others, like large Home Depots or Toys "R" Us stores. If creating a more sensible and uniform approach means taking away the ability of some communities to arbitrarily reject megastores, so be it, officials have said. They add that the proposal actually offers more protection for many areas.
To community leaders like Patricia Dolan, vice president of the United Civic Council of Queens, which represents about 70 neighborhood groups, that kind of attitude does not bode well for the ability of residents to control the quality of life in their neighborhoods.
"We are fearful that this is the opening salvo in a campaign which is going to ultimately take away all community review and input on siting decisions," she said.
City planning officials, she said, have given short shrift to the fact that many manufacturing zones abut residential areas or may even have homes mingling with businesses inside those zones.
"This entire proposal has been designed to meet the needs of developers and not the needs of people who live in the neighborhoods that make up the city," she said. "At issue here is the way people believe government should work, and either it's an open process where people's opinions count and they have a right to have a say over their own lives, or they don't."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Kathy Goldman Executive director of the Community Food Resource Center.
 
"To compete, stores will have to pick up a little and change what they're doing. They'll get modern refrigerators, put in a deli counter, and maybe the meat will look fresher and more produce will be available."
The Community Food Resource Center, an advocacy group for poor and minority neighborhoods, has often been at odds with the Giuliani administration over benefits for the poor. But on the megastore issue, the center has been one of Mayor Giuliani's strongest supporters.
Poor neighborhoods, where people spend a disproportionate amount of their income on food, desperately need more food stores, and large supermarkets would offer better prices and more variety, said Kathy Goldman, the executive director of the center.
"Low-income people now are leaving the city in droves, using car services, car pooling, taking buses and doing whatever they can to get to better selection and fresher produce in stores in Westchester, New Jersey and Long Island," she said.
"The impact on these neighborhoods is going to be very big, because a lot of these manufacturing zones aren't that far out of their neighborhoods or they're within a short bus ride."
She also said that competition from a 24-hour Pathmark or a Price Costco store would improve the quality of existing food stores.
"To compete, stores will have to pick up a little and change what they're doing," she said. "They'll get modern refrigerators, put in a deli counter, and maybe the meat will look fresher and more produce will be available.
"When you're the only game in town, you can get away with offering less and charging more. Changing that means that people who are constrained will finally be able to get more for their buck."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Mitchell L. Moss -- Director of New York University's Urban Research Center.
 
"Retail is a very dynamic sector because it's constantly restructuring, and New York City cannot afford to act like an island and only have some types of retailing and not others."
The current zoning for manufacturing areas was enacted in 1974 and the prohibitions on certain kinds of retail developments, primarily supermarkets and department stores, were intended to try to keep existing industries and to lure new ones.
But Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said that manufacturing businesses nevertheless continued their exodus and that what remained of the sector has evolved in recent years. But the city, he said, has yet to respond to those changes.
"New York's land use system has really been very inert and the city has been excessively concerned with maintaining space even if those activities aren't there any more," he said.
"The decline in manufacturing has been profound but there also has been a resurgence of small-scale manufacturing because of immigrant entrepreneurs and a growing demand for customized products, and it doesn't require the same enormous spaces that industrial businesses used to. The economy and manufacturing in New York City has changed and so should our land use policies."
He said that city regulations have inhibited economic development and that officials have also ignored the fact that the retail industry has evolved.
"Most of the great famous names like Best & Company, Gimbels and Wanamaker's are all out of business," he said. "Retail is a very dynamic sector because it's constantly restructuring, and New York City cannot afford to act like an island and only have some types of retailing and not others."

HEADLINE: High Schools Get Less Aid Than Elementary and Middle Ones

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The superintendents who oversee New York City's elementary and middle schools have long complained that the city's sprawling high schools soaked up a disproportionate share of precious education dollars.
So it came as a surprise last week when Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, in the most exhaustive accounting in the system's history, concluded that the high schools actually get much less -- an average of about $398 less per student than the elementary schools and $760 less than the junior high schools. 
 "They would always say we got more money," said John J. Ferrandino, who retired recently as the supervising superintendent of city high schools. "I would always say we didn't. No one would believe me."
Until now.
While individual school spending in the city's 32 community school districts has been publicly scrutinized by previous chancellors, none has done so as extensively as Dr. Crew and none has included the city's high schools.
An examination of those 1996 figures, sifted out of the 41-volume report prepared by Dr. Crew's budget staff and the accounting firm Peat Marwick, shows several discrepancies in spending for high schools.
High schools with the biggest concentrations of poor students, for example, spend less city tax money in the classroom than those with more middle-class students, an analysis of the figures shows. But the schools with poor students more than make up for the difference with the sizable supplements they receive from Federal, state and private grants. It was not immediately clear from the data whether the city was adjusting its allotment to these schools because they get these grants.
The figures also confirm, in many cases, the suspicions of some of the city's larger high schools: that the batch of small, experimental academies that have proliferated in the last four years often receive more money per student.
But the findings that created the greatest buzz within the system last week were those that, for the first time, measured budget allocations in the high schools against other schools in the city. The breakdown shows that high schools receive an average of $6,831 per student, compared with $7,229 for elementary schools and $7,591 for the junior high schools.
In many systems across the country, the high schools spend the most money per pupil because high school students require more extensive guidance services to prepare for college and take more expensive and specialized courses, like advanced-placement chemistry, that have smaller class sizes.
New York City is, apparently, different. While the reasons are varied and not always clear, the most salient factors are the share of budget cuts the high schools absorbed in the last three years, the severe overcrowding of high school buildings and the need to provide meals to younger students.
Part of the difference can be explained by size. It costs less per student to administer and supply teachers to a large high school because those costs can be divided among more students. And when taken together, the city's high schools are filled to nearly 140 percent of capacity, a degree of overcrowding that dwarfs most elementary and middle schools.
Thus, the salary paidto the principal at Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens, is spread over 4,573 students, while that at Public School 209 in Whitestone must be absorbed by just 511 students.
Line items like food also increase the budgets of elementary and middle schools, where students eat in school more often. In Community School District 9 in the South Bronx, for example, the $356 spent per pupil on food was more than double the average spent on food in all Bronx high schools.
But per-pupil spending in the high schools was also affected by something far less fixed: the more than $1 billion in budget cuts imposed in the last three years. And while no school in the system was spared, Chancellor Crew and his predecessor, Ramon C. Cortines, tried to preserve the spending on children in the younger grades because they are at a critical stage in their development.
Some elementary schools gave up music and art classes, as well as assistant principals. But many high schools were hit harder. They lost elective courses like psychology, sociology and advanced-placement history; had to raise guidance-counselor caseloads to 1,000 students or more; were forced to eliminate junior varsity sports and bands, and, in dozens of cases, even pared the school day to below the five and a half hours required by the state, drawing a reprimand.
"The whole system has been underfunded," said John Soldini, an economics teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island and the vice president for academic high schools in the United Federation of Teachers. "But the high schools were placed in even greater peril."
The budget report released last week makes clear that there are wide variations in spending among the high schools -- particularly in schools with large pockets of students living below the poverty level.
A computer analysis by The New York Times of the Chancellor's data on 153 high schools -- 90 with high concentrations of poverty and 63 with low concentrations -- found that those with the highest number of poor students spent an average of $348 less, per pupil, in city tax money on direct classroom services.
But in the end, the spending in schools with the poorest students was $480 more per student because those schools get more of the private, state and Federal grants. Most of those dollars came from the Title 1 program, which last year added $323 million to budgets of schools with poor students so they could hire teachers, teachers' aides and after-school counselors.
In preparing the report, the Chancellor's aides said they were not able to specify how many of those supplemental dollars reached the classroom, in the form of teachers' salaries and textbooks, and how many provided instructional support outside the classroom. The omission is substantial, given that that money represents 13 percent of the system's $8.2 billion overall budget. The Chancellor said he hoped to account for the money in future reports.
And what of the system's bumper crop of experimental, alternative academies? How did they fare financially?
Designed around themes like the city's museums or its underground infrastructure, more than 100 such schools have attracted several thousand students in the last four years. The amount allotted per student at three Bronx academies -- Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom ($10,340), South Bronx Academy for Community Leadership ($9,212) and Wings Academy ($8,796) -- exceeded that at two larger, more traditional high schools, William H. Taft ($5,790) and Bronx Science ($6,463).
But again, school size plays a role. And far more analysis will be required to determine if the schools that spend more per student actually get their students to achieve more -- the ultimate measure of how well their dollars are spent.
"We've got to caution people not to make too much out of the financial numbers alone," said Robert Berne, the vice president for academic development at New York University and a longtime student of the Board of Education budget. "This report only increases, exponentially, the number of questions that can be asked."

Last week, for the first time, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew opened the books on New York City's 1,100 public schools, issuing a detailed breakdown of 1996 budget allocations. Figures are for the 195 high schools; the five highest in each category in spending are in bold; the five lowest have asterisks. Spending specified by grants includes antipoverty and antidrug and programs from government and private sources. (pg. 42)

HEADLINE: CONCERN IS VOICED OVER THE QUALITY OF ECONOMIC DATA

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Almost every business day, the Government produces economic statistics that affect financial decisions, from buying a new house and expanding a business to monetary policy and the Federal budget.
But a senior Administration official warns that the quality of those statistics has been eroding steadily, increasing doubts about how accurately they depict economic activity. That, he says, is hampering policy makers and threatening to undermine the confidence of investors. 
 Others warn that remedies could involve reducing the growth of Government benefits, including Social Security, and raising taxes.
The official, Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said in an interview on Friday: "Our statistical system is failing to keep track with a rapidly changing economy. The data we provide give us a good picture of where we are in the business cycle but risk misrepresenting such long-term phenomena as inflation, productivity growth and the economy's changing composition."
A panel appointed by the Senate is expected to report in early December that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by as much as two percentage points, which would cost the Government as much as $634 billion over the next 10 years, primarily because of inflation-linked payments for Social Security and other Federal benefit programs.
Government officials say their methods have become outdated in the face of the increasing globalization of business and the growing economic role of services, which are generally harder to measure.
There are more down-to-earth reasons, too. The price index, for instance, tends to overstate costs. It does not reflect the fact that people tend to substitute, say, chicken for steak when the price of beef rises, and that they are more frequently buying during sales and at discount stores rather than paying full price.
Mr. Ehrlich is proposing a three-year, $150 million program to combat the problems.
But while some proposals by officials and experts would stir passion only in an accountant, others, like changes in the price index that could reduce Social Security checks -- could raise considerable opposition.
Concerns about the quality of the systems used to produce the figures were also voiced recently by the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee, which sets short-term interest rates and influences the rates on loans, from mortgages to corporate bonds.
In September, facing a difficult decision on interest rates, committee members complained about poor data, especially on productivity, a basic element of economic well-being, according to minutes of the meeting released recently..
The committee's minutes, which did not identify any participants but reflected publicly expressed views of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, called figures on productivity in services "implausible" and suggested that they had been considerably understated.
Among other things, raising the measure of productivity would increase figures for the gross national product and result in a calculation of real wages that would show an increase, rather than the stagnation that has been widely reported.
Widespread agreement among economists that inflation measurements were inaccurate led the Senate Finance Committee in 1995 to appoint the commission to study the Consumer Price Index, which is used to determine the annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other Federal programs and for indexing Federal tax brackets.
Headed by Michael J. Boskin of Stanford University, the commission, also plans to make recommendations on how to fix the price index. That may well set up a confrontation with the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Labor Department, which compiles it and has denied charges that it is widely off the mark.
Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, took exception to Mr. Ehrlich's appraisal of Government statistics, contending that those produced by her agency, at least, are getting better despite a budget that has not risen in real terms since the late 1970's.
But she acknowledged knotty conceptual problems and said it was now harder to keep the gauges up to date, partly because economic activity is more concentrated in sectors like services, in which activity is much harder to measure.
She also acknowledged that more people are complaining about statistical flaws, largely because of the increased "pocketbook implications" of relying on the figures to adjust everything from Social Security to union contracts.
"The stakes certainly have gotten higher," Ms. Abraham said.
Joel Popkin, an economic consultant, said the system had deteriorated because companies were less willing to respond to Government requests for data, partly because those businesses have fewer people to do such work. Also, budget cutbacks have made it ever harder for the Government to attract high-caliber economists and statisticians.
Mr. Ehrlich of the Commerce Department, who is in charge of one of the biggest Government agencies that gather economic statistics, said that unless the measurement flaws were corrected, financial markets could lose confidence in the Government's data.
"Good data allow markets to anticipate economic policy and, by doing so, make it more efficient," Mr. Ehrlich said.
He said more attention needed to be paid to measuring intangibles like insurance coverage, rental activity, wholesale trade and on-line transactions. The numbers also fail to capture fully such "phantom" production as a construction company building something for itself instead of for a paying customer.
One measure of how the system has failed to keep up, he said, is that the number of businesses that defy traditional categorization has grown considerably.
Government hardware also needs to be improved, Mr. Erlich said, to minimize the risk of a disastrous computer failure.
He estimated that any crisis from data erosion was "years, but not decades," away.

HEADLINE: In Manila, Asians Pore Over Washington's Inner Truths

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Anyone wondering why Asian business leaders showed such intense interest in the inner workings of the American political system this fall -- and such eagerness to contribute to both Democrats and Republicans in record amounts -- could find the answer this week in the sprawling ballrooms of the Shangri-la Hotel here.
In the days leading up to President Clinton's arrival this evening with the leaders of 17 other Pacific Rim nations, the region's billionaires and bankers, its industrial planners and its real estate investors poured into this city to assess how a second Clinton Administration will affect billions of dollars worth of new investments from Indonesia to California. 
 There was, of course, the usual cliches about doing business in the global village. But it was quickly evident that many of the villagers are more nervous than ever about Washington's increasingly central role in setting -- or vetoing -- the rules of global trade. After years of insisting that America is a diminished world economic power, Asian executives have concluded that decisions made in Washington are more important to their prosperity than ever.
So while Mr. Clinton was scuba diving off the Great Barrier Reef, the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, was besieged with questions about the conditions under which Washington would let China join the World Trade Organization -- an issue little discussed in the United States but one on which fortunes could be made or lost here.
When Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor spoke today about the emergence of a "Clinton Doctrine" -- "not mutually assured destruction and a policy of containment but mutually assured prosperity and a policy of engagement" -- clusters of Asian executives debated whether these were code words for more pressure to open markets.
Business executives around the world have always had a close interest in Washington, of course, not least because the United States remains the world's richest market. But as the controversy over foreign campaign contributions so vividly demonstrated, that interest is taking on a new form.
As American foreign policy increasingly intrudes on how other nations organize their economies -- insisting, for example, that Indonesia change the way it treats factory workers -- foreign executives say they feel increasingly compelled to make themselves heard from Capitol Hill to the White House.
"You see this phenomenon all over Southeast Asia these days, and it reminds me of the political awakening of the Japanese 30 years ago," Thomas Hubbard, the American Ambassador to the Philippines and one of the State Department's most experienced diplomats in the region, said this week as his embassy scrambled to prepare for Mr. Clinton's arrival. "There is this sudden awareness that every large company has to deal with the way Washington works, and not just the executive branch. That's largely a good thing."
But it also carries considerable risks, as Mr. Clinton and his aides have learned the hard way in the past two months.
In an interview before he left for Asia, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the flip side of growing economic engagement in Asia is that his Administration has become the target of far more vigorous foreign efforts to influence policy, which he and his aides insist the White House has resisted. But those efforts are in full view this weekend in Manila.
With the United States enjoying a robust economy, and Japan mired in a recession and a banking crisis, business leaders who once eschewed American politics now say they have reluctantly concluded that they must begin lobbying in Washington.
The assumption here is that that is exactly what James Riady, Mr. Clinton's old friend from Arkansas and head of one of the largest financial conglomerates in Indonesia, the Lippo Group, had in mind when he helped ease a top aide into the Commerce Department.
Until this year Mr. Riady had been a regular at the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, which Mr. Clinton inaugurated in 1993 in Seattle. Previous meetings of the organization, established in 1989, featured trade ministers rather than heads of state.
Two years ago, at the meeting in Jakarta, Mr. Riady held a flashy party for visiting Arkansans, and Mr. Clinton stopped by. This year, perhaps deciding that a little discretion is in order while the Congressional investigators circle, Mr. Riady did not show up. But his competitors did, and they said they envy his accomplishments.
"We were impressed that James was so well connected in Washington," said a top executive of an Indonesian conglomerate that competes with Lippo. "What was the problem? He did things the Asian way: He used his connections, but he was subtle about it.
"And you know, now if you cannot show your clients that you have a deep connection in Washington, you might as well shut down your international business."
That new regard for Washington as a hub of economic decision-making is a very different note than the one commonly struck throughout Asia just three or four years ago.
At the time, the United States was frequently portrayed as a declining power, a large but shrinking slice of the global economy. (Statistically, it still is.) Japanese politicians talked about "lazy" American workers, and the image stuck. Executives confidently proclaimed that the move toward open markets was making governments less and less relevant.
But an unexpected combination of forces -- from the surge in American financial markets and the recovery of its industrial prowess, to the Clinton Administration's sometimes intemperate threats of trade sanctions, to Washington's dominant role in the new World Trade Organization -- have restored the United States to a central role that many Asian executives say they occasionally find reassuring, and often find infuriating.
Money talks louder than free-trade promises in Asia, and the United States has generated surprisingly large amounts of it. Everyone agrees that much of the $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion required over the next decade to finance huge infrastructure developments will have to come from the United States.
"That money is going to have to come from someplace, and clearly Japan is not going to be in a position to provide as much of it as people once thought," said Maurice Greenberg, the chairman of American International Group Inc., one of the largest American insurance firms in Asia.
Supplying some of that capital should give the United States considerable power throughout the region. In fact, the 400 business executives who gathered here to put together recommendations to the leaders of the group's 18 "member economies" -- the term "member nations" is banned to sidestep delicate issues like the inclusion of Taiwan -- heard warnings today that there could be a backlash against the West.
"There must be careful management of these relationships so there is no fear of technological dominance" by Western software and computer firms, said Manuel Pangilinan, chairman of the First Pacific Company in Hong Kong. His words echoed those of American executives who warned in the 1980's that the United States was in danger of becoming a "techno-colony" of Japan.
America's new prickliness in the trade realm also explains Asia's new fixation on who is making decisions in Washington. While publicly lauding its commitment to settling trade disputes through international forums like the World Trade Organization, the United States has often short-circuited that system, threatening China, Japan and other nations with sanctions unless they cracked down on software piracy or opened their auto markets. Many Asian countries call this bullying, or worse.
On Friday Rafidah Aziz, the Trade Minister of Malaysia and one of the most outspoken critics of the United States, looked directly at Ms. Barshefsky, the trade representative, when she cited "countries that try to impose their norms and standards" on the world.
In fact, only a few years ago Malaysia was pressing its Asian neighbors to join an alternative organization that pointedly excluded the United States, among others. That effort to build an Asians-only organization faded, but Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, was well received today when he argued against too much American-style trade liberalization.
Sounding like many Americans in the last days of the Presidential campaign, Mr. Mahathir said he was worried about those who use their "economic strength or political influence" to attempt to change a nation's policies. But he was clearly not talking about mysterious donors to the Democratic National Committee pressing their case in the White House. Instead, he seemed to be talking about all those mysterious Americans -- hundreds of them -- lurking in the Manila's luxury hotels.

HEADLINE: Clinton Opens Tense Talks With the President of China

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MANILA, Sunday, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Trying to calm a stormy relationship, President Clinton met with President Jiang Zemin of China today. It was their fourth set of talks in neutral settings during Mr. Clinton's Presidency.
The two men met in the Green Room of the Central Bank of Manila, stopping first to pose for pictures, shaking hands warmly and smiling. 
 Mr. Clinton rejected suggestions that he should not meet with Mr. Jiang because of human rights problems in China, saying, "We're doing the right thing to have this meeting."
At the meeting, as expected, "the two presidents have accepted each other's invitations for state visits," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman said. The time and the sequence of the state visits are still to be determined, he added.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	 The President's Goals
 By STEVEN ERLANGER
 MANILA, Nov. 23 -- President Clinton arrived in a steamy Manila tonight with some tense business to transact with the leaders of a coming superpower, China, and a sometimes difficult ally, South Korea.
As he arrived, his Cabinet secretaries for foreign and trade policy were pressing toward an agreement to reduce tariffs radically on information technologies so important to the United States and the booming Pacific Rim, which is having its fourth economic forum here.
The sprawling 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, which includes such diverse members as Australia, China, the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong and even Taiwan, represents two-thirds of all American global trade and 50 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
The group's yearly meetings, since Mr. Clinton raised them to summit level in 1993, are a kind of economic and diplomatic convention. The bilateral meetings between leaders and ministers are considered more important than the effort to remove all obstacles to free trade among members by 2010 for industrialized countries, and by 2020 for others.
The most drama here is expected to come from Mr. Clinton's meeting with the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin. The meeting could mark the restoration of relatively stable relations after three years of conflict and confusion over Taiwan, human rights, trade, copyright, nuclear and missile proliferation and other disputes.
After the groundwork laid by Secretary of State Warren Christopher last week in Beijing, the two leaders were primed to announce a series of higher-level meetings, beginning with Vice President Al Gore's going to China in the first part of next year, then Mr. Jiang's going to the United States on a long-delayed state visit, then a visit by Mr. Clinton to China in 1998.
But their meeting must also deal with continuing conflicts over trade, human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong and reports of continuing Chinese arms deals with Iran and Pakistan.
Mr. Clinton was also ready to repeat the United States' eagerness for Beijing to join the World Trade Organization, but only if China moves more sharply to open its markets.
The United States wants a relationship with China that embodies regular meetings, as it used to have with the Soviet Union, where even profound differences can be discussed and the relationship will not be frozen by any one issue, whether it be human rights or trade.
Mr. Clinton will also meet the Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to try to reassure him that closer ties to China will not be at Japan's expense.
But he will have to work hard to reassure the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, whom he also meets on Sunday, that the United States supports South Korea in its rage over North Korea's recent submarine incursion.
South Korea demands a North Korean apology before continuing with the American-brokered deal to replace North Korea's military-related nuclear plants, which were producing weapons-grade materiel, with less dangerous South Korean ones.
The Americans, who are desperate that the North Korean nuclear deal not founder, have said they expect a gesture of contrition from North Korea, but South Korea continues to demand more, while wanting further reassurance from Mr. Clinton about the permanence of the American commitment to defend South Korea.
"It's now one of our weirder relationships," an American official said, "but it's no less dangerous for that."
The American economic push this year is on freeing up trade in information technologies, and APEC foreign and trade ministers agreed over the last two days to try to reach a global deal to phase out nearly all tariffs on computers, software, memory chips and telecommunications equipment by 2000. Such trade represents $500 billion a year today, and should reach $800 billion by 2000.
There are disagreements among the countries here, including Malaysia and China, about how many protections to retain for certain forms of technology and for how long, with even the United States seeking special treatment on some items to try to protect smaller companies.
But Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor today pronounced himself delighted with a unanimous statement that urges all members of the World Trade Organization to conclude a deal by its first big meeting less than three weeks from now in Singapore.
The real American target for pressure is the European Union, which has considerably higher tariffs on key elements of information technologies.
Negotiations on the World Trade Organization pact are continuing in Geneva, and American officials wanted "clear political will" and "a deadline" coming out of APEC, said the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky. She said a deadline would help push other parties, especially the European Union, to negotiate in earnest.
"Without a deadline, no one would ever wrap it up," a senior American official said.
The officials tried to play down APEC's refusal over two days of negotiation to endorse a zero tariff in 2000. Instead, the joint statement by group's ministers said only that they "endorsed the efforts at W.T.O. to conclude an information technology agreement" by the Singapore meeting "and urged all other members of the W.T.O. to work toward that end."
Ms. Barshefsky said she never tried to get an endorsement of the terms of the agreement, which she said is predicated on the general understanding of zero tariffs by 2000. Every country will have specific reservations over certain products and the timing of gradual tariff reductions, she said, which is what the Geneva negotiations are about.
Her main intention, she repeated, is to bring pressure on all countries to finish the negotiations by the Singapore meeting.
Mr. Clinton, who deals on Monday with the summit meeting itself at Subic Bay Freeport, the former American naval base, is unlikely to get much deeper into the issue. His main task is to reassure all of Asia that America remains a Pacific power pursuing its economic interests while providing a generally benign security guarantee for the region.
But his main success will come if he can reassure Asia that the United States has figured out a policy to deal with the realities of a huge, transitional China that is already dominating the security and economic planning of every Asian-Pacific nation.

HEADLINE: Beware a Global Economy's Many Consequences;
Strong Franc, No Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Global Forces Batter Politics" (Week in Review, Nov. 17) blames "globalization" for the incongruence of the restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that France has pursued while unemployment rates are rising. In so doing, you accept the excuses of French politicians who would like to avoid blame for dubious decisions related to the "strong franc" policy, decisions that have a lot to do with national pride and little with economic forces. 
 The lack of success of policies to fight unemployment in France is related more to lack of interest in tackling its causes than to any global force. When Alain Madelin, the French Finance Minister, was forced to resign last year after he insinuated that civil servants had too many privileges, the reason was not turmoil in the capital markets but the refusal of large sectors of French society to acknowledge that the enormous and hyper-regulating public sector comes at a price.
The inability to adjust one's life style to one's own resources is neither new nor a consequence of globalization. While French and European politicians justify their inability to lead their countries through difficult choices, their citizens must live with Eurosclerosis.

HEADLINE: THE BIG CITY;
Virgin Territory

BYLINE: By John Tierney

 BODY:
MICHAEL AULT IS content. At 1 A.M., he is sitting in his new SoHo club, Chaos, a loft on Watts Street whose red velvet settees are currently occupied by an extraordinary concentration of beautiful young women with long legs and high cheekbones. "Models are the most wonderful turbocharged creatures," Ault says. "I worship them." Today, like all days, he has been on the phone with dozens of them.
 
 "We have a couple of thousand models' names in our data base," says Ault, a veteran of clubs-of-the-moment like Spy, Merc Bar and Surf Club. "If they need anything - a roommate, an apartment, a boyfriend, a lawyer, an agent, a place to sleep in the Hamptons, a plane ticket - you provide it. Then, when you call, they come by the hundreds. The difference between a local bar and the hottest club in New York is the models." He looks around the room. "Don't they put a smile on your face?"
 They do. But I try to stop gawking long enough to consider Ault's metaphor: turbocharged creatures, which by coincidence is precisely the topic I came to discuss. I've brought a copy of "The Dynamo and the Virgin," the famous chapter from the 1918 autobiography "The Education of Henry Adams." During my days as an American-studies major, I never quite understood the scholarly reverence for Adams's laments about American society - to me, it all sounded like the grumping of a Boston Brahmin appalled to discover that going to Harvard and being named Adams was no longer enough to guarantee a man the Presidency. But his dynamo-Virgin theory was at least original. It was occasioned by Adams's visit to the hall of dynamos at the Exposition of 1900 in Paris. Watching the 40-foot machines churn out electricity, he decided that they had supplanted the force that had driven all previous civilizations, that had built cathedrals and inspired artists: the power exerted by the Virgin and Venus and ancient fertility goddess.
 "The Woman had once been suspreme," Adams wrote. "She was goddess because of her force; she was the animated dynamo; she was reproduction - the greatest and most mysterious of all energies. ... At the Lovre and at Chartres ... was the highest energy ever known to man, the creator of four-fifths of his noblest art, exercising vastly more attraction over the human mind than all the steam-engines and dynamos ever dreamed of; and yet this energy was unknown to the American mind. An American Virgin would never command; an American Venus would never dare exist."
 This is not an easy theory to explain in a noisy club, particularly when a six-foot model in a halter top is dancing five feet away. But Ault is a quick study. "He's right about the pwoer of virgin deities," Ault says, reaching into his shirt to show me the ancient Greek coin he wears around his neck. "This is the face of Athena, powerful virgin - the protector of heroes like Hercules and Jason. She's the ideal protector for my business. Women are the core of this machine. When a beautiful woman - I'm talking about a '12' - walks in the room, everyone responds, women as well as men. Beautiful women come here because they want to look at other beautiful women."
 "Virginal" may not be the first word that one associates with today's models, but there actually is a certain purity to their cultists' devotion. Doormen and bouncers at clubs have the same mission as the guards at the Temple of Vesta: to ward off lustful males. The're trained to exclude unattached herterosexual men and eject anyone who bothers the models. These women are to be admired, not touched, like the celestial images of Claudia Schiffer and Linda Evangelista hovering above Times Square. "Models are visual bait," says Baird Jones, a gossip reporter at The Daily News who spent 20 yearsas a party promoter for Studio 54 and other clubs. "Once you get them into a club or a restaurant - the easiest way is to bribe a low-level booker at an agency, someone who's handling the B-list of young girls just starting out - the rest of the food chain follows. The odd thing is that most of the men don't even make an effort to talk to them. Even the serious playboys, the rich guys who live to chase models, often aren't that interested in sex. They mainly want their fellow wolves to see them walk in with a model. The term they use is 'shoulder candy.' "
 The objects of this veneration know that a model can go out at night carrying just enough money for the first cab ride: meals, drinks, cigarettes and spending money will be provided by her followers. The profusion of offerings seems suspect at first - you mean all I have to do is show up? - but the models soon realize how much of New York's economy depends on their standing around doing nothing. And thye come to appreciate proper forms of devotion.
 "I feel protected here," says Kara Sands, a model with the Elite agency who has joined Ault at the table tonight. "They make sure nobody hits on me. They take care of anything I need. Today Michael was on the phone with me for an hour as I was babbling about my breakup with my boyfriend. When someone does that, you're glad to show up and help the club's business."
 I try to explain Adams's theory about the decline of the Virgin's power in modern America. Sands shakes her head. "Women have always had power," she says, "and they always will."
 An American-studies major might still argue that Adams was correct in his day about the dynamo: that contemporary New York is obsessed with female. icons because it's a postindustrial culture ruled by images instead of machines. But I think Sands has it right. The Virgin's power has never waned. It may have been displayed more discreetly during the Victorian era, but there were plenty of establishments not unlike Chaos. To understand the force that drives humans to build dynamos - or cathedrals or computers - it's essential to observe where the builders spend their earnings at the end of the day. If Adams had known the right places to go after dark, he could have beheld visions far more powerful than anything in the hall of dynamos. They might have even put a smile on his face.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Lebedtime Story

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Russian general, standing ramrod stiff in a business suit, waved aside another plate of American food. "Bread, salt and onions," he requested.
After a round of interviews with and speeches at many of America's opinion leaders, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed -- peacemaker of Chechnya, surprise political challenger to Yeltsin, recently bounced out of the Yeltsin Kremlin after pushing for too much power -- was relaxing at a reception given in the Bethesda home of businessman Fred Bush. 
 When a diplomat gently brought up the subject of Russia's negotiations with Ukraine about the former Soviet Black Sea fleet, Lebed said he was part Ukrainian and told a little joke:
"Russian soldier was carrying a wounded Ukrainian on his back. Ukrainian says, 'I am suffering, I want to die, shoot me.' Russian takes out his gun but then says, 'I have no ammunition.' Ukrainian says, 'I'll sell you a cartridge for two rubles.' "
I ingratiated myself by laughing at this thigh-slapper, and then put a political question to him: Why had Lebed taken the thuggish and corrupt Aleksandr Korzhakov, recently forced out as Yeltsin's confidant and bodyguard, to be his close adviser?
Eyes narrowed, the pugilist's face hardened: "I am here," he said, holding his flattened hand up to chin level, "and Korzhakov is down here," dropping his hand well below his waist. I took that to mean that Lebed was affirming his alliance with yesterday's worst influence in the Kremlin, but that he was using Korzhakov and not vice versa.
Lebed's purpose in coming to America was to impress Russia's moneyed interests with his ability to reassure U.S. investors that a Lebed regime would not be bad for business. Up to now, he has seemed like a loose cannon, gruffness concealing ignorance of economics, prone to ultranationalist gaffes.
He is the first Russian politician forced to make a good impression here, as well as in Russia's outlying provinces, to win the financial support centered in Moscow. Lebed makes no bones about it: "One information flow goes through the Russian regions and then returns to Moscow," he tells U.S. executives, "and the second flow goes abroad and then again returns to Moscow, and there they meet."
How goes the flow from here? After 40 minutes seated in a corner with a few members of the journalist persuasion, Lebed left the impression that he is not the political blockhead he was cracked down to be. He is well briefed to give answers Americans want to hear.
Thus, he is "not going to have a hysterical fit because of NATO's expansion" (plays well here) but talks vaguely of a "new security system," as if Russia were threatened by the West (plays well at home). His next trip will be to China.
Sprinkling salt on his bread but passing up the onions, Lebed said he agrees with Grigory Yavlinsky on economic reform (though the two could not get along) and warns that Yeltsin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, whom he despises, is no free marketer.
The general has tried to assure Jewish groups here that he was "misquoted" about there being only two religions in Russia, though his subsequent praise of Jews as "managing money well" assuaged nobody. But when Susan Eisenhower asked why he should be President of Russia one day, his reply -- drawing on experience in Moldova and Chechnya -- had both power and appeal: "I stop wars."
To test for candor, I asked about the deal he made early this summer to split the anti-Yeltsin vote. Did Yeltsin give him money and television time in the final week that enabled Lebed to come on suddenly and take 14 percent of the vote? Answer: "No. I raised that money from my own sources." Baloney.
Early assessment: Lebed is smarter than expected, absorbent of briefings and trainable in the avoidance of deep water. He exudes the command presence that strikes some as arrogance, others as leadership. If this work in progress gets to power, I suspect he would shuck the impressive advisers he brought here with him for the likes of the repugnant Korzhakov.
When I passed along a plate of cookies, the General raised a hand in firm denial: "Sweets are for the weak."

HEADLINE: Malraux Joins the Greats in the Pantheon As the French Exult in the Pride of Image

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
It is no doubt a measure of the importance that France gives to culture that the 20th anniversary of the death of Andre Malraux was celebrated here this weekend as a great national occasion. After all, it was Malraux who, as De Gaulle's Culture Minister from 1959 to 1969, decreed that the arts should be part of the lives of ordinary Frenchmen and women and not simply of the Parisian elite.
But there is more. Jacques Chirac, the first Gaullist President in two decades, was also eager to tap the Malraux legend, to boost his own eroded popularity and revive Gaullist dreams of French grandeur. He therefore presided over a grandiose ceremony in which Malraux's remains were transferred to the Pantheon, France's final resting place for illustrious men (and, so far, one illustrious woman, the physicist Marie Curie). 
 "Andre Malraux, you incarnate more than anyone the Gaullism desired by the General, a Gaullism neither of left nor of right, but of France," Mr. Chirac said on Saturday on the Pantheon steps, addressing Malraux's coffin shortly before it joined those of Voltaire, Rousseau, Hugo and Zola. "Because you lived your dreams and made them live in us, Andre Malraux, enter the Pantheon of the Republic."
Yet, for all that, the best explanation for the interest awakened by the anniversary may well lie in France's current mood of pessimism about its economic and political future. The country needs a hero to lift its spirits, and who better than Malraux? Writer, philosopher, adventurer, lover, bon vivant, anti-fascist and anti-Nazi fighter, orator and politician, he personified that almost-mythical figure, the man of letters who is also a man of action.
True, with Churchill and Roosevelt now well enshrined as 20th-century icons for Britons and Americans, France is not alone in turning past heroes into symbols. Yet there is something peculiarly French about the veneration of Malraux: many of the French like to think that he mirrors their own romantic, passionate, anarchic and idealistic free spirit, that he represents the sort of swashbuckling image they would like to project.
The past few weeks, then, have been turned into a veritable feast of Malraux nostalgia, with newspaper and magazine articles galore as well as television documentaries, radio debates, new books, university seminars, posters in squares and subway stations and even a new 3-franc stamp that reproduces a famous photograph of Malraux by Gisele Freund (albeit with his ever-present cigarette airbrushed as a nod to the times).
Intellectuals have also waxed poetic. "This melancholy, restless and impatient young man, consumed by a dream of grandeur, taking in revolutions like a bird of prey in search of space to spread his wings, this is the Malraux preserved in legend," Jean-Marie Rouart, a writer and editor of Le Figaro's literary supplement, wrote. "No one else has embraced the century with such impetuosity, passion and intelligence."
The real Malraux is more difficult to pin down. As a writer, he cannot be compared with, say, Proust, Gide or Camus; as a philosopher he was overshadowed by his ideological foe Jean-Paul Sartre; in the French Resistance, there were many greater heroes, and as a Gaullist politician, the former leftist opposed the May 1968 student movement. Yet his varied life and many talents give both leftists and rightists something to admire in him.
Born in Paris on Nov. 3, 1901, he dropped out of school at 17 and was soon drawn into the lively Paris world of writers, artists and intellectuals. In 1923 his sense of adventure took him to Asia, but the trip proved disastrous. He, his new wife, Clara Goldschmidt, and a friend were arrested for looting a temple at Angkor Wat in Cambodia. A three-year prison term was later reduced to a one-year suspended sentence.
He nonetheless continued to travel regularly to Indochina and China, where he saw the beginning of the power struggle between the Kuomintang and Mao Zedong's Communists. He used what he saw of an insurrection in Shanghai as the basis for his third and perhaps most successful novel, "La Condition Humaine" ("Man's Fate"), which in 1933 won the Goncourt literary prize, France's highest literary honor.
By then he was a committed leftist, denouncing Germany's new Nazi regime as early as 1933 and, three years later, organizing an international air corps to help the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War, an experience that led to the book "L'Espoir" ("Man's Hope"). When World War II broke out, he joined the army, but he was captured by invading German forces in May 1940 and was held until he managed to escape six months later. He then hid on the Cote d'Azur until 1944 when, somewhat late in the day, he joined the Resistance under the nom de guerre of Colonel Berger.
By the time Paris was liberated in August 1944, Malraux was in charge of a Resistance group in Alsace. More significantly, he was by then openly anti-Communist. And the following year, when he met De Gaulle for the first time, the General named him his spokesman. But soon afterward, De Gaulle stepped out of public life, and Malraux returned to his writing, showing growing interest in the visual arts.
De Gaulle's return to power in 1958 immediately brought Malraux back into the limelight. Named France's first Culture Minister, he made his mark by creating cultural centers throughout the country as well as by promoting contemporary art, cleaning Paris monuments, preserving the prehistoric art of Lascaux by closing the caves to the public, and organizing major retrospective art exhibitions visited by hundreds of thousands of people.
Yet perhaps the final proof that Malraux was more artist than politician is that he is best remembered for a masterpiece of oratory that he delivered on Dec. 19, 1964, when the remains of Jean Moulin, a Resistance hero murdered by the Gestapo, were being transferred to the Pantheon. Quotations from this speech have been reproduced on posters displayed throughout France in recent days.
After his death at the age of 75, Malraux's flaws -- as a person, writer and politician -- were soon forgotten. Jack Lang, President Mitterrand's Culture Minister, tried to emulate him, while French intellectuals of the left and right felt almost duty-bound by his example to take stances on political conflicts around the world. And now, it seems, Malraux's job is to remind the French that panache and flair are good antidotes for pessimism.
"I think everyone needs this commemoration, the Government, the media, the intellectuals," said Bernard-Henri Levy, a French philosopher whose support for Bosnian Muslims prompted critics to snipe that he was "playing" Malraux. "It's probably because the French feel their identity is threatened, that their identity is being shaken to its very foundations. So it's understandable that we hold onto our memories in times like this."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Chinese Counterpart: A Weak Old Panda?

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 24

 BODY:
President Clinton can certainly sympathize with Jiang Zemin.
The 70-year-old Chinese President and Communist Party boss has no mandate at home to chart any new course in foreign or domestic policy and his ability to lead China into the next century is an open question. His critics call him "the panda" and his staff complains that he never initiates policies, he just responds to pressure. 
 Mr. Clinton, who just emerged from a re-election campaign where the same questions were raised about his leadership and where some Republicans disparaged him as "Bubba," might have had a sense of "I've been there" this weekend in Manila as he saw the Chinese leadership stall on the substantive issues that divide the two nations.
With a new chapter opening in United States-China relations, Mr. Clinton's 85-minute discussion in Manila today with President Jiang affirmed, if nothing else, that China is in the midst of a paralyzing leadership transition in which Mr. Jiang's power remains weak and may not be consolidated until late next year, if then.
Though Mr. Clinton has sent every conceivable signal that a new consensus in Congress for assisting China's economic and technological development may be sustainable, China's rulers remain absorbed in domestic politics. With a Communist Party congress scheduled next fall, Mr. Jiang is, in essence, running to stay in office before an exclusive electorate that consists of a few hundred members of the Communist Party and military hierarchies.
No Chinese leader in his shoes could be expected to undertake any bold new initiatives with an American President.
During months of diplomacy leading up to the meeting today, Mr. Clinton sent emissaries to push and cajole. He suggested amending United States trade laws to cement China's trade privileges in the American market, and he shared intelligence on Iran's nuclear program to try to convince Beijing to stop doing business with Teheran.
China sent the message back that it is not ready to take down the market barriers necessary to enter the World Trade Organization, although Mr. Jiang signaled today that he might be willing to do something on that issue.
Beijing refused to make any pledge to stop selling nuclear and missile technology to Iran, and it was adamant that it would continue to imprison anyone who speaks against the Government at home, as it did with the former student leader Wang Dan, who got an 11-year sentence just three weeks ago.
It may be possible for China to make progress on these fronts in the future. But As Mr. Jiang knows all too well, to make progress on these fronts requires a carefully prepared consensus among powerful institutions, including the Chinese military, major state industries, regional leaders and party factions.
When these stars are not in alignment, Mr. Jiang is left the hapless job of temporizing.
While Mr. Clinton looks at 1997 as a clean slate on which he would like to write a more constructive text, Mr. Jiang looks at the next 12 months like a barefoot man facing a bed of coals.
Before the end of next year, Mr. Jiang must show his skill in managing Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1. This will include a perilous choice between confrontation or accommodation with the pro-democracy forces that have flourished among the six million residents of the British colony.
Then, as part of the preparations for the 15th congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Jiang must orchestrate major personnel changes in the seven-man Politburo, including the retirement of the hard-line Prime Minister Li Peng.
It is at the party congress that Mr. Jiang is hoping for an unequivocal mandate to succeed Deng Xiaoping.
Even if he gets the mandate, Mr. Jiang could still turn out to be the weakest leader to rule Communist China in the four and half decades since the Communists came to power.
And, strangely, a number of Chinese seem content with that.
"Someone once said to me that Jiang Zemin is a nothing," said a member of one of China's most prominent families and a Communist Party stalwart, adding that he replied by saying: "That is what we need -- a nothing, because he must work within the system. He must consult with the other leaders, like Qiao Shi, the chairman of the National People's Congress, and Prime Minister Li Peng, and he must consult with the military."
"We need a leader who has no ideas," the official continued, "because he will get his ideas and his advice from within the system."
In this way, he said, "China needs a leader like Bill Clinton. Clinton was a nothing in 1992, just like Jiang Zemin, but look at Clinton now. He knows how to work within the system; he consults with the leaders of Congress and the military and then he makes his decisions."
Mr. Jiang might not find the analysis flattering, but its seems clear that as time passes and Mr. Deng, 92, slips deeper into Parkinson's disease, the collective leadership of Communist Party elders and Mr. Jiang's contemporaries find him a comfortable leader because he tries to accommodate all factions.
That may not be a prescription for progress in United States-China relations, but it is a prescription for staying in office.
And though he has been almost desperate over the last two years to convince Mr. Clinton to fete him with a state visit, Mr. Jiang can now undoubtedly see the risks of traveling to Washington with an empty briefcase and facing an onslaught of protesters who would take the opportunity to remind him how unpopular Chinese policies are on religious persecution in Tibet and on the harsh treatment of political dissidents.
For Mr. Clinton, too, there are risks in giving too much "face" to a Chinese leader who might crack down on Hong Kong's pro-democracy party after Chinese troops move in, and who might greet Vice President Al Gore in Beijing next spring by throwing dissidents into jail.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Clinton Surveys Manila Bay: What, No Corncob Pipe?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Bill Clinton came into office self-conscious about the military, his salutes less than crisp and his interest in foreign affairs sporadic at best. All that has long since changed, his aides insist, pointing to Mr. Clinton's new reputation in Asia as the President who sent carriers into the Taiwan Strait this year as a warning to China.
But in every sense Mr. Clinton may have reached a new comfort level as Commander in Chief on Saturday night when he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, settled into Gen. Douglas MacArthur's palatial suite at the Manila Hotel overlooking Manila Bay and Corregidor, the site of MacArthur's last stand in defending the Philippines against Japan. 
 Mr. Clinton did not show up at his morning staff meeting with a corncob pipe clenched between his teeth, but he was clearly enjoying the international status accorded by the size of his re-election victory.
The Chinese, who froze relations with Washington a year ago and made clear that they were rooting for anyone but Mr. Clinton in the election, were suddenly talking summit meetings and trade deals. The South Koreans were backing down, ever so slightly, after an ugly breach with the Administration over how to deal with the Communist North.
Tonight at Malacanang Palace, where Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos used to hold court before the People Power revolution of 1986, Mr. Clinton was twisting arms to get stronger wording in support of a worldwide trade deal to end tariffs on information technology.
"The other leaders realize that they are going to be dealing with this President for some time," Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said from more modest digs in the Manila, where every wall appears to be made of some shade of teak and hand-rolled cigars are still sold -- and smoked -- in the lobby.
But Mr. Clinton's moment to play the American Caesar in one of Asia's great landmarks came at a political price. Delighting conspiracy theorists of all stripes, his neighbor at the hotel is Suharto, the aging Indonesian dictator.
Mr. Clinton spent a lot of time before he left for Asia insisting that he has never let his ties to James Riady, his multimillionaire Indonesian friend, influence decisions about his relations with President Suharto's Government. Nonetheless, his aides say they could live without pictures of the two men chatting it up in the lobby, and their exits and entrances seem timed to insure that there was no risk of their running into each other.
That left both of them more time to run into the the Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's richest men and the hotel's other famous weekend denizen. At past Asian summit meetings he was known to hand out thousand-dollar tips to bellhops, which is perhaps why, on the greeting board in the lobby, the Sultan's name is listed first, Mr. Suharto's second and Mr. Clinton's third.

Mundane, Gritty Reality
Modern economic diplomacy, of course, lacks some of the drama of retreating under fire, declaring, "I shall return."
The broad political goal of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the clunky name for the summit meeting here, is to rip down trade barriers and promote economic growth. That's the lofty, job-creating stuff that the national leaders here love to talk about.
But the gritty reality this year is that every country has to submit a ponderous document, called an Individual Action Plan, laying out specific steps that countries are taking between now and 2020 (2010 for developed countries like the United States and Japan) to lower tariffs and remove trade barriers. These documents have become bureaucratic tributes to the art of making the trivial seem earth-shaking.
Anybody looking to export fish, cement and sugar to Papua New Guinea, where the gross domestic product is a little over $1,000 a person, take heart: there is a plan afoot to open the market.

Ramos Is Out to Impress
Five years ago, Fidel V. Ramos, then the Philippine Defense Secretary, was walking the streets of this city in a flak jacket, putting down monthly coup attempts against the famous but hapless President Corazon C. Aquino.
This morning, now President himself, Mr. Ramos was comfortably ensconced in an office in the Coconut Palace, an Apple computer sitting on his polished wood traditional Philippine table, receiving a stream of heads of state celebrating the recovery of the country once known as the sick man of Asia.
Mr. Ramos knows that the key to the recovery is keeping investment flowing in, and he is clearly out to impress. In a city that only a few years ago could not produce enough electricity to keep traffic lights on during the day, he now litters his desk with every type of electronic organizer, each flashing his politically convenient initials -- F.V.R. He has replaced his military terseness with trade-speak.
But it has not been an entirely easy week for the cigar-chomping former general, as he conceded in a chat a few minutes after Mr. Clinton came calling. This is the first time that a large summit meeting has been held in a country that still has an active, if weakened, Communist insurgency.
If that were not enough to put the Secret Service on edge, two bombs were found at midweek -- one in the passenger terminal of Manila's airport and another at Subic Bay, the former American naval base where the 18 leaders will meet on Monday. The Government put out a story that the bombs were planted deliberately to test security, but Mr. Ramos allowed today that he was not convinced that it was true.
"We are still investigating," he said.
He has also been plagued by a series of protests, from unions who threatened to bring Manila to a standstill and from motorists who resented the "Friendship Lanes" on city streets that allowed delegates to the conference here to zip past traffic that has gone from ordinary gridlock to perpetual parking.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Chinese President Agree to Exchange State Visits

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Despite deep and unresolved differences, President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China agreed today to exchange state visits over the next two years. They would be the first such extended meetings between their nations since the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
The White House hopes the reciprocal visits -- to be preceded by a trip to Beijing by Vice President Al Gore in the first half of next year -- will cement the first steps toward improving a relationship that has floundered badly in the last four years over human rights, trade, nuclear proliferation and Taiwan. 
 But after an 85-minute meeting at an economic summit meeting of 18 Asian-Pacific leaders here, it was clear Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang had made little substantive progress on those issues.
The one possible exception, Administration officials said, was Mr. Jiang's apparent willingness to move ahead on opening markets to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization and thus diminish a source of longstanding tension between Washington and Beijing. The organization, which includes more than 100 countries, aims to promote trade and remove barriers that inhibit it.
In a separate meeting with President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, Mr. Clinton apparently succeeded in persuading him to maintain his country's minimal links with North Korea, despite Seoul's outrage over the incursion of a North Korean submarine and its crew into South Korean territory in September.
After that incident, the South demanded an apology from the North, which threatened to break the few remaining lines of communication across the Demilitarized Zone. But today Mr. Kim and Mr. Clinton issued a statement simply calling on the North to take "acceptable steps" to resolve the matter.
American officials said the precise timing of the Chinese-American state visits remained to be set, depending in part on the smoothness of the transfer of Hong Kong to the Chinese next July. But the assumption has been that Mr. Jiang will travel to Washington sometime next year, perhaps after the next scheduled APEC talks, in Vancouver in November, and that Mr. Clinton may go to Beijing in 1998.
As he posed with Mr. Jiang in front of American and Chinese flags before their meeting at the Central Bank building here, Mr. Clinton said, "We're doing the right thing." Afterward, he said: "I think it went very well. It was a good meeting, and I think that the next steps were appropriate."
An American translator later told reporters that Mr. Jiang had said that the timing of today's meeting, just after Mr. Clinton's re-election, gave it special importance.
In a gesture of goodwill aimed at American public opinion, Mr. Jiang also told Mr. Clinton that the Chinese had recently discovered the remnants of what appeared to be a B-24 bomber from World War II containing human remains in Guangxi province in southwestern China. Chinese officials first informed Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the discovery while he was in China last week, and today Mr. Jiang gave the President a videotape and an album of photographs and invited him to send an American team to the site.
Officials said Mr. Clinton made it clear that the United States would not back down on its longtime support for a United Nations resolution condemning China's record on human rights, while Mr. Jiang repeated China's longstanding objections to American arms sales to Taiwan.
But neither of those disagreements was at all unexpected. In fact, the Director of Central Intelligence, John Deutch, visited China last month and told Mr. Clinton's senior aides that he did not believe Mr. Jiang was in a strong enough political sitituaion to make concessions in any substantive area over the next year.
American officials said today that it was the Chinese who proposed leaving the timetable for the visits open, in part to wait until after the Communist Party congress next fall. Mr Jiang hopes the congress will solidify his control of the country before the death of Deng Xiaoping, 92, China's ailing paramount leader.
Over all, officials said, the disagreements did not dominate a session that one senior Clinton aide called "animated, responsive, a real conversation." Aides said the tone of the meeting -- the fourth between the Presidents -- was serious but friendly, with Mr. Jiang at one point suggesting Mr. Clinton try Chinese medicine or acupuncture for the hoarseness that often bothers him and that has dogged him on this trip.
Human rights groups swiftly denounced the decision to hold high-level meetings, saying it had removed an important lever in American efforts to persuade China to improve its handling of dissidents, workers and women.
"In his eagerness to announce a U.S.-China summit and tout the strengthening of the U.S.-China relationship as the major foreign policy achievement of his second term, Clinton seems to be on the verge of selling out on human rights," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia, who is here in Manila.
"It's true that U.S. officials continue to express formal concern about human rights at official meetings," he said. "But if there is no political or economic pressure behind the words, the Chinese Government will continue to do what it's doing now: arbitrarily arresting anyone who gets in its way."
But Administration officials made just the opposite argument. Except for Jimmy Carter, every American President since Richard M. Nixon has visited China, and officials said their goal was not to let differences over individual issues -- however significant -- derail the entire relationship.
They noted, for example, that Washington maintained high-level contacts with the Soviet Union during the cold war.
"Human rights is very important," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs. "So is peace on the Korean peninsula, nonproliferation, trade and many other issues, and we're going to press all these issues. And we believe that regular, high-level dialogue is the most effective way to make progress on all these issues, including human rights."
Mr. Lord said the Administration recognized that "serious problems remain," adding, "You're not seeing any euphoria or complacency or naivete."
The session was in marked contrast to Mr. Clinton's approach to China earlier in his term, when disagreements over human rights, Taiwan and trade threatened to unhinge relations with Beijing.
Still, the meeting was as notable for what it did not achieve as for what it did: the Administration had hoped it might win medical leaves for Chinese dissidents, for example, not recovery of half-century-old remains from a war in which the United States and pre-Communist China were allies.
One senior American official said the two Presidents had made "no concrete progress" on China's membership in the World Trade Organization, the international body that adjudicates trade disputes.
As a condition of membership, Washington wants China to be bound by most of the rules on lowering tarriff barriers and the like that apply to the developed world. But China is heavily dependent on state-run industries and has worried that stripping away trade protections could risk serious unrest.
But another senior American official said tonight that Mr. Jiang had showed that China had the political will to go forward on the issue, with an attitude that was "extremely impressive and greatly helpful."

HEADLINE: E.P.A. ADVOCATING HIGHER STANDARDS TO CLEAN THE AIR

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency is recommending tighter national standards for emissions of the chemicals and particles that form smog and soot, some of the most pervasive and unhealthy forms of air pollution.
The new definition of how clean the air must be to protect the public's health is sure to be one of the biggest environmental fights of the coming year, raging from the Oval Office to Capitol Hill and drawing in Federal judges and governors. 
 Under the proposal, hundreds of communities that comply with the Clean Air Act under the current rules could fall out of compliance, roughly tripling the number of counties where state and local officials must take further steps to clean up the air. At least 100 million people live in these areas.
"This is one of the most important decisions I will make to protect public health in this country," said Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator. "We believe very, very strongly that there are real and significant health problems from this kind of pollution and that our final decision must be standards that protect against those."
Business groups are lobbying hard against the proposal, whose details will be announced within a few days, predicting that it will cost them billions of dollars trying to meet standards that they contend will offer no important benefit.
Environmentalists and public health groups, for their part, say that tens of thousands of people could be protected from illness or even death if the rules are toughened and that the E.P.A.'s proposal is unlikely to go far enough in that direction.
The environmental agency predicts that the costs, while running into billions of dollars, will be much less than industry studies predict and that most areas will eventually meet the standards without taking extraordinary steps, providing important health benefits to the public.
But complying with the new rules would be especially hard for many large metropolitan areas, like the New York City region, because they are still struggling to meet the current air quality standards.
The E.P.A.'s proposal has been years in preparation. And it has been the subject of especially intense debate in the past few days at the White House, with some senior officials urging that a major part of the package be delayed a few weeks or months, as big-business lobbyists have repeatedly requested.
It would be the first big environmental proposal since the election. Pollution issues played a prominent role in the Clinton-Gore campaign.
"The magnitude of this is not lost on anybody," said Kathleen A. McGinty, the head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. "The President sees both the compelling importance of the public health issue and also, frankly, the need for pushing to try to minimize the economic costs."
She added: "The current standards don't sufficiently protect the public health, particularly children. The economic toll of hospital visits, days of work lost -- those are big, and those are real costs."
In Congress, Republican leaders have already signaled that they will challenge the agency's rule, perhaps seeking to overturn it next year under the terms of a new law that gives Congress the power to review major Federal regulations. In a report accompanying the agency's spending bill for the current year, Congress already ordered the E.P.A. to give serious consideration to the idea of leaving the current standard unchanged.
The E.P.A.'s decision is expected to be announced after a final review by senior regulatory officials at the White House. It follows an extensive study by the environmental agency of scientific studies documenting the damage that is done when health problems are exacerbated by soot and smog, especially in children, the frail elderly, asthmatics and outdoor workers. But there are heated arguments about whether this research is convincing.
Business groups and environmental and public health groups will also fight over the costs and benefits that could result from the change. By law, questions of cost should carry little weight because the Clean Air Act requires that health, not economics, dictate air quality goals. But politically, the potential expense of compliance is a major factor.
Among the strategies that states might include in their Federally approved compliance plans could be mass transit projects, incentives for companies to limit emissions, new requirements for pollution controls on factory smokestacks and improved programs for vehicle inspections.
State governors, stirred into action by a far-reaching industry campaign, have repeatedly written the Administration to raise concerns about the proposed rule change, which would tell many state and local governments that their past progress in cleaning up the air is no longer enough to satisfy the demands of the Clean Air Act.
The details of the new rule must be announced by Nov. 29 under a court order obtained by the American Lung Association, which sued to force a review of the existing standards for particulate matter, the fine particles of pollution formed largely from burning coal, oil and gas. The agency decided to issue at the same time a new standard for ozone, another harmful gas that helps form smog. The Clean Air Act requires that national standards for the six major types of air pollution, which include ozone and particulates, be reviewed periodically.
Even though those two types of pollution are not chemically identical, they share many common characteristics: where they come from, how they accumulate and travel, and the fact that they damage people's lungs.
The E.P.A. wants to regulate them simultaneously, both because it would be more efficient and because it is easier to defend the rules on the basis of protecting health if they are combined.
It has been clear for months that the E.P.A. wants to tighten the rules. The biggest questions are precisely how tight the new proposal will be and what formula for measuring pollution will be adopted.
The agency is widely expected to seek a standard of around 80 parts per billion of ozone in the air, compared with 120 parts per billion under the current rule, and to lower the size of the particles that are regulated to 2.5 microns, compared with 10 microns currently. (A human hair is about 70 microns thick.) But those numbers alone do not tell the whole story; other factors include the duration of violations, how frequently they occur, how precisely they are measured and much more. Every decimal in these complex equations will be debated at length by technical experts on both sides, as they have been disputed for years. The proposal is a first step; the agency will take public comments before reaching a final decision next summer.
Among the business groups most actively fighting the proposal are those representing oil companies, electric utilities, auto makers and other manufacturers. Together they have mounted a large, well-financed campaign to defeat the proposal, saying that the current air quality standards are strong enough and that attaining the new ones would be far too expensive to be worthwhile.
"We are not against protecting the public's health -- my gosh, you have got to do that," said Robert A. Beck, vice president of environmental affairs at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for power companies. "But we already have a good law here, and we are implementing it. We don't want to waste money and at the end of the day not get where we want to go."
Environmental and public health groups, for their part, have sought for years to get tougher standards, and they are likely to criticize the E.P.A. for not going far enough when it announces its proposal. They are expected to be especially critical of the proposal for the regulation of small particulates. But the environmental groups generally favor the direction the agency is going.
"This will get the communities where there really are health risks back on the nonattainment list and will get them doing something about it," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.
He predicted that industry lobbyists would have a hard time getting Congress to overturn the rule. "They are picking a fight on something people really care about, which is their children's health, and they are going to get creamed," he said.
Major rules like this one are always reviewed at the White House by the regulatory branch of the Office of Management and Budget, and industry lobbyists have been pressing the Administration for weeks either to retain as one option a final decision not to alter the standards or to split the rule in two, issuing only the part that addresses sooty particles, while leaving for later the part that deals with the chemicals that form smog.
Industry lobbyists, intent on fighting each part of the rule on highly technical grounds, would much rather separate them.
To the proposal's advocates, splitting it in half would be an early concession to industry groups, which have been pursuing what one Government official called a "divide and conquer" approach.
But a White House official said the Office of Management and Budget was no longer seeking substantive changes in the standards, which could have caused a lengthy delay. "This is not the Quayle White House; we are not here to weaken the standard," said this official, referring to the days in the Bush Administration when Vice President Dan Quayle and Office of Management and Budget officials routinely overturned agency proposals on the environment.
In meetings and correspondence last month with Sally Katzen, the head of the O.M.B.'s office of regulatory affairs, automobile industry lobbyists had asked that the combined rule on ozone and small particulate matter be split in half.
The biggest debate is over interpreting hundreds of scientific studies on how human health is affected by ozone and small particulates. A science advisory committee spent months reviewing the evidence and the E.P.A. staff's analysis. In the end, it gave the agency's plans a qualified endorsement.
Business groups have seized on the advisory panel's critique as ammunition to defeat the proposal, and the panel's chairman, George Wolff, a top scientist working for General Motors, is frequently quoted by lobbyists opposing the proposal.
But the panel's conclusions, like a communique from the United Nations Security Council, are open to many interpretations, and they are not the final word on whether the agency is moving in the right direction.

European Currency System To Readmit the Italian Lira
Finance ministers and central bank governors from European Union nations, meeting in a special session, agreed to readmit the Italian lira to the European exchange rate mechanism. Officials said the ministers agreed to let the lira return to the currency grid at 990 lira to the German mark.
The lira had been dropped from the system in 1992 during a currency crisis in Italy, and re-entry was seen as crucial for Italy's hopes of being in the first wave of nations to adopt a single European currency in 1999. [Page D2.]
 
U.S. and China Agree on Visits
President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China agreed to exchange state visits in the next two years, the first such meetings since the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square. White House officials also said that Mr. Jiang had signaled a willingness to move ahead on opening markets to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. [A1.]
 
Settlement Reached in TLC Case
The singing trio TLC, their recording label and managers settled a yearlong battle over how the fruits of the group's success should be divided. The trio had filed for bankruptcy at least in part to void their contracts; the case was important to the industry, because the royalty restrictions that TLC could have shed are common in the business. [D2.]
 
Endless, Unattainable Love
Shiori Fujisaki is a 17-year-old high school junior, Shingo Hagiwara a 21-year-old college sophomore who idolizes her. One problem: Ms. Fujisaki, left, is only a character in a video game, the goal of which is to get her or a friend to date you and fall in love. "Love simulation" games have become a hot category in Japan's home video game industry, and Mr. Hagiwara, who is quite real, is one of a legion of young Japanese men who have lost their hearts to a virtual girl. [D5.]
 
Tighter Clean-Air Provisions Sought
The E.P.A. is recommending tighter national standards for emissions of the chemicals and particles that form smog and soot. Business groups are lobbying hard against the proposal to redefine how clean the air must be, saying it would cost billions of dollars to meet standards they contend offer no important benefit. [A1.]
 
Departing Editors Are Sued
When the publisher and 2 editors quit Orchard Books to start an imprint at another publisher, it seemed just one more industry realignment. But in Orchard's case, nothing has happened in the usual way since. [D7.]
 
Big Shift in Health Care Billing
After signing large numbers of New York doctors, the nation's health maintenance organizations are radically changing the way they pay physicians there and have begun to reduce reimbursements. [A1.]
 
Paper Guides to Internet Sites
At least 10 ink-and-paper publications are fighting to become, in effect, the TV Guide of the World Wide Web. And, as bigger and better-financed magazines jump in, the competition is turning into a demolition derby. [D10.]
 
Chat as a Marketing Opportunity
Advertisers for the most part have either ignored on-line "chat" or poked fun at the phenomenon. But a study suggests marketers ought to take those cybercommunities seriously. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]
 
Michael Jackson's Global Reach
Though Michael Jackson's two-year-old album "HIStory" has failed to meet expectations in the United States, it remains a hit in dozens of other nations, selling 11 million copies worldwide. Sony Music ships as many as 100,000 overseas each week. Entertainment. [D7.]

HEADLINE: ALTERED MEDICINE -- A special report;
Reduced H.M.O. Fees Cause Concern About Patient Care

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
After signing up large numbers of New York doctors and establishing a seemingly unshakable position here, health maintenance organizations are radically changing the way they pay physicians and have begun to reduce reimbursements.
Patients who see the same doctor in the same office are generally not aware that a change has occurred. But while the health maintenance organizations assert that new types of payments help control medical costs, the region's doctors, and medical experts, are warning that the quality of care will suffer and that in some cases, it already has. 
 Managed care plans that have continued to pay old-style fees for office visits have been cutting rates, sometimes on a monthly basis. Beyond that, however, is a growing trend among many of the large health maintenance organizations like Aetna, Sanus and Pru Care, which have stopped paying many of their doctors for each patient visit. Instead, they give most general doctors a small fixed sum -- generally $100 to $300 a year -- to cover office care for each enrolled patient. Rare just a few years ago, the new payment system now accounts for nearly half of all the dollars paid by health plans to general physicians in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Although doctors admit that traditional insurance, which paid handsomely for each office visit, rewarded doctors for doing too much, many say that the new reimbursement method -- known as capitation -- has pushed them to skimp on care. Some now acknowledge hurrying office visits, treating too many complaints over the phone and avoiding patients with illnesses like diabetes or AIDS that require frequent doctor's visits.
"These plans put you in the funny position of doing better financially if you withhold care, and that seems unethical," said Dr. Laurence Miller, a pediatrician in North Bellmore, L.I., who like dozens of doctors dropped out of Aetna this fall when the H.M.O. offered him a contract that paid as little as $5.25 a month for some patients. "People are going to get treated very differently under these arrangements."
But insurance executives said that set fees make more sense in a system in which doctors are paid to manage the entire scope of a patient's health. Sometimes, advice over the phone or arranging a physical therapy session makes more sense than an expensive office visit, they said. They added that doctors will not go hungry, estimating that current capitation rates should translate into doctor incomes of more than $150,000 a year.
Indeed, some health economists suspect that when H.M.O. patients are shortchanged, the culprit is not just a new type of payment but also a doctor who is unwilling to adjust to a new type of health care.
"When you hear physicians bellyaching, it's often hard to know if the dollar figures are unfair or if the docs are going through the five stages of accepting the death of the good old days of medicine," said Dr. Alan Hillman, a professor of health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
Such fixed-fee contracts have become standard in many parts of the country in the last decade, covering over 60 percent of health-maintenance payments to doctors in places like California. But the adjustment for doctors and patients in New York may be traumatic, in part because the change here has occurred rapidly and in part because of smaller medical practices that are poorly suited to the new payment plan.
One New York City internist in solo practice recalled treating a man with AIDS-related pneumonia who was insured under the new payment method, and resenting the daily trips to the hospital -- trips for which he felt he was not being adequately paid. He said that another patient, who had recently tested positive for the AIDS virus, had asked him to continue as his doctor. But instead, he declined, forcing his patient to change doctors.
"I don't have tons of experience with the disease," he said, "but if I got reasonable compensation I might say, 'O.K., I'm his doctor and this is what I should do.' But knowing that I'd be doing it for free, I won't."
No one knows how many doctors have dropped plans over the new contracts, health experts say, and it is even harder to measure the subtle ways in which care might be affected. "A lot of these plans are trying to squeeze out money from doctors, and what worries me is that our ability to measure quality is still primitive," said Marc Rodwin, a professor at Indiana University and the author of "Medicine, Money and Morals." "We need to have better protections for consumers."

The New Rates
A Fixed Monthly Fee For Office Visits
Most of New York's managed care plans still pay doctors for office visits, although the rate is often only about three-fourths of the customary charge. But many have now switched to monthly fees.
"A few years ago, this was unheard of in New York," said Steve Kern, a lawyer with Kern, Augustine, Conroy & Schoppman, a law firm that represents physicians. "Now, most all primary care providers are participating in capitated plans."
These fees depend on the age and sex of the patient as well as the size of their copayment. Although most health maintenance groups offer these fixed fee contracts only to general doctors, some are also beginning to cap fees for specialists.
At Sanus, now known as New York Life Care, general doctors are paid $31 to $42 a month for infants under the age of 1, a rate that drops quickly to $5.80 to $7.97 for children ages 5 to 18. After adolescence, the rates start to climb, averaging $7.50 for men 19 to 39 years old and about $9.00 for women. The rates for men and women over 65 are $21 to $31 a month.
U.S. Health Care rates are higher for infants and young children, but lower for adults as they age. While Sanus pays $29.68 a month for a man over 65 with a $5 copayment, U.S. Health Care pays $22.52.
Some plans supplement these monthly fees with payments to cover the cost of vaccines; others add bonuses for doctors who use referrals judiciously, or submit billing information promptly.
These payments are supposed to cover all of a patient's office health needs, from exams for an ear infection to the treatment of conditions like asthma and high blood pressure; in New York, they do not generally cover the cost of specialty referrals. They are the same whether a patient is well or suffers from a chronic disease like diabetes, the logic being that the expense of the rare patient who is ill will be counterbalanced by the dozens of healthy people.
But in the New York region, where office overhead is high and hospital clinics charge $200 for a routine physical, many doctors feel that the new rates do not even cover the expenses for the healthiest patients.
"It is very easy now to get caught in a rate that is so low that you can't provide the kind of care you should provide," said Dr. Charles Aswad, vice president of the Medical Society of the State of New York.
Some doctors, like Dr. Miller, have resigned from plans when the fee structure changed. But many others say that they have so many patients in certain managed care plans that they cannot afford to quit.
And patients feel the fallout. Linda Girardin of East Meadow, L.I., who belongs to Aetna's plan, said that her husband's internist never checked his blood pressure and cholesterol levels -- later found to be dangerously high. And when the plan switched its doctors to fixed monthly fees, the family pediatrician dropped out.
"I wouldn't resent this so much if the money they save on us was buying medical care for someone who is poor," she said. "But who's benefiting here? Not the patients. Not the doctors. Not the uninsured."

The Patients
The Seriously Ill Face Big Risks
In interviews, doctors said that the new rates affected how they do business, with economics challenging lessons learned in medical school.
"Most earaches are infectious, so there is a great temptation if a child says his ear hurts to just prescribe antibiotics without seeing him," Dr. Miller said. "But that is not good medicine."
One Manhattan internist, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing his contracts, said: "You try not to look at what kind of insurance patients have because it will bias you. If you know you're getting $6.10 a month, you're not going to extend yourself."
The general effect of the new rates is to reduce the cash that flows into doctors offices, often forcing doctors to share at least some of the insurer's risk. As a result, some doctors said that they now shied away from patients who were seriously ill or hid areas of expertise from the health plans and patients, for fear of attracting sicker individuals.
"I hate to talk about patients this way, but if I get a 50-year-old diabetic who I have to see every month, it's a major economic disaster," said one doctor, who practices both general medicine and endocrinology. He is paid about $175 annually for patients in that age group.
Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, the chief medical officer of Aetna U.S. Health Care, a managed care company recently formed by the merger of two large H.M.O.'s, said that "corrupt physicians could learn to take advantage of any system," but that his company carefully monitored the quality of care. He noted that U.S. Health Care doctors who scored high in availability and patient satisfaction could receive bonuses 29 percent above their base rate.
"Our aim is to provide doctors with fair pay for taking care of patients without giving them the old incentives to do extra things," Dr. Lebowitz said.
But Professor Rodwin said, the new fee schedules "create an incentive to underuse services, and it's very hard to measure that."
In an increasingly cutthroat market, managed care groups are constantly revising their contracts with doctors, searching for a fee structure that will save money and promote cost-effective care.
Camille Carbonaro, executive director of the Richmond County Medical Society, said that she had received many complaints about contracts whose terms had changed or the rates had dropped within a month of signing. Indeed, virtually all contracts now contain a clause allowing organizations to change the payment structure midstream without the physician's consent.

Doctor's Predicament
Business Clashes With a Mission
Doctors say they are overwhelmed by the shifting sands, as some plans have created elaborate hybrid systems that still pay doctors per visit but still limit the health plan's expenses.
Oxford Health Plan organizes doctors from a given geographical area into "pods," with fixed yearly budgets. The doctors bill Oxford for each office visit, but if the pod comes in over budget one year, their rates can, in theory, be reduced the next.
Earlier this year, Cigna announced that it would allot a fixed sum each month to cover large groups of specialists, such as ear, nose and throat surgeons in Queens. Each surgeon submits monthly bills to the insurer at an agreed upon discounted rate: $300 for a tonsillectomy, for example. But if the bills for the borough surpass the monthly allotment, each bill is discounted further so that Cigna maintains its budget. Some surgeons resigned in protest.
But Dr. Zoltan Brody, a physician from Staten Island, said that most doctors just sign on. "Many doctors don't even read contracts because what's the point?" he said. "They have no recourse and no bargaining power."
Earlier this year, a group of patients and doctors from Long Island sued Aetna, claiming that the company's recent shift to fixed monthly fees jeopardized patient care. Last week, Judge Denis R. Hurley of United States District Court ruled that Aetna had to provide the patients with its internal data regarding quality of care.
But some health care analysts said that the system had advantages. Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a partner in the Washington office of Ernst & Young, said fixed payments improved cash flow by infusing funds regularly and eliminating bill collection.
"Physicians have to start thinking like actuaries to understand how this will work and that is very hard," he said. "Doctors think of these payments as a fee -- they think I'm just getting $10 for this person and they keep coming in. But maybe they have 4 like this but 96 who rarely show up, who they're paid for anyway."
Dr. Kongstvedt said that good H.M.O.'s use statistical data to arrive at a fair rate, but he acknowledged that others would cut rates as much as the market would bear.
Rob Parke, an actuary at Milliman & Robertson, a Seattle consulting firm , said that many of the monthly rates being offered to doctors in New York seemed "reasonable," if the rates paid by Medicare are used as a yardstick. But those rates are quite a bit lower than many private physicians in the area now charge.
Many medical experts say that the capitated systems that have succeeded in states like California might not translate well here.
While most doctors in New York still practice in small groups, fixed-fee payments work best in practices with tens of thousands of patients. If a solo practitioner happens to take on a child with a devastating chronic illness, it has much more impact on the finances of the business than if a practice with 50 doctors and 25,000 patients gets the child.
A Manhattan internist in a two-doctor practice, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "Lets say in New York City I get 6 AIDS patients -- who I'm paid $108 a year to take care of -- that could put us in the toilet."
Large practices are also better able to hire staff, like physicians' assistants, to dispense services like blood pressure checks at lower cost. They can take on lawyers to review their contracts and they are in a much stronger position to negotiate with insurers as well.
Health economists predicted that the region's doctors would be forced to band together to gain these advantages and that, over time, market forces will correct injustices caused by payment schemes that are too stingy to support good office care. But that offers little solace to Linda Girardin, whose 11-year-old son cried when he learned that he would have to switch pediatricians. "So for now we're going to pay out of our own pockets," she said. "And that won't be easy."

HEADLINE: Texas Meeting Seeks A Rebirth of Populism

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HUNT, Tex., Nov. 24

 BODY:
In 1877, a group of poor and angry farmers gathered in the hill country of Texas, vowing to fight the banks, railroads and other "monied interests." It was the spark that set off the Populist movement, a network of cooperatives and political action that grew into one of the largest democratic insurgencies in the nation's history.
Invoking that same spirit and directing their ire at modern forces like health-insurance companies and entertainment conglomerates, some 250 unabashedly left-leaning activists from 32 states met here in the hill country this weekend for the founding convention of what they pledged would be a populist alliance for the 21st century, "a new national force to end the corporate rule of America." 
 Just how significant this new movement will become is anybody's guess, though 45 local "alliances" -- most urban-based and committed to projects like gardening cooperatives, protests against Nafta and "sweatshop watch" programs -- have quietly sprouted around the country in the last 15 months.
Whether any of the oratory here will prove as enduring as William Jennings Bryan's legendary "Cross of Gold" speech in 1896 is also uncertain, though not for any lack of passion on the speakers' part. "The divine right of kings has been replaced by the divine right of C.E.O.'s," thundered Ronnie Dugger, an author who helped organize the convention.
And even what form the group should take politically remains unclear. Some of those on hand called for formation of a new People's Party. Others, apparently agreeing with the remark by Jim Hightower, the former Texas Agriculture Commissioner, that "America doesn't need a third party, it needs a second one," said the new movement should work to push the Democratic Party back to the left, much as the original Populists did.
Nonetheless, with its boisterous debates and free-wheeling proceedings, the convention here in central Texas offered an engaging contrast to the made-for-television, scripted-to-the-second conventions of the two major parties over the summer.
The proceedings also touched on one of the more intriguing questions that has coursed through recent American politics: just what does it mean to be a Populist?
As a means of rallying the disaffected or the downtrodden, so-called "populist" themes have been embraced by a remarkable range of politicians in this decade alone, from Pat Buchanan and David Duke on the right to Jesse Jackson and Ralph Nader on the left, not to mention Ross Perot, somewhere in the middle.
To organizers of the convention here, though, "Populism" is squarely grounded in the kind of anti-corporate sentiment of the agrarian revolt of the late 1800's, when many farmers firmly believed that rate-gouging railroads and bankers charging high interest rates were all part of the "system," which kept them poverty-stricken no matter how hard they worked.
Lawrence Goodwyn, a history professor at Duke University and author of "The Populist Moment" (1978, Oxford University Press), the definitive history of the 19th-century agrarian revolt, said that strains of the same general sense of alienation or anger exist today, whether spawned by the influence of corporate money in politics, the high pay and protected benefits of the nation's top business executives or the prospect that a Wal-Mart will open in town.
But, Mr. Goodwyn cautioned, mass movements based on that kind of wrath have historically proved "indescribably difficult to put together," which is one reason that the Populist movement of the late 1800's was such an extraordinary event in American history.
"The American people know that this is a corporate-dominated society," said Mr. Goodwyn, a keynote speaker at the convention. "Their problem is, they don't know what to do about it."
Actually, there was no lack of ideas on what to do about it at the convention here, held at the remote Mo-Ranch Conference Center. One proposal called for limiting any political contributions to $100 or less and requiring that they be from "flesh-and-blood" human beings rather than political action committees. Nationalizing the oil industry and doubling the minimum wage were also suggested.
Despite the meeting's radical undertones compared with the typical dialogue of a political campaign today, there were, perhaps predictably, those who insisted the whole exercise was not radical enough.
"You're chasing your tail here," complained Don Kemner, a retired insurance agent from Missouri, who advocates a national initiative system under which Americans could basically bypass Congress and pass laws directly. "You're playing their game with this kind of talk."
The convention grew out of an August 1995 article by Mr. Dugger in The Texas Observer, a liberal journal of opinion and investigation, that ran under the headline "Real Populists Please Stand Up." Mr. Dugger, the founding publisher of The Texas Observer, was clearly the guiding spirit behind the weekend's proceedings.
"We are ruled by big business and the government as its paid hireling, and we know it," Mr. Dugger said to raucous applause at Thursday night's opening. "The big corporations and the hundred-millionaires and billionaires have taken daily control of our work, our pay, our housing, our health, our pension funds, our bank and savings deposits, our public lands, our airwaves, our elections, our very government. It's as if American democracy had been bombed."
There were shades of correctness, political and otherwise. Those at the convention were asked, in deference to the fragrance-sensitive, to refrain from wearing hair spray, perfume or cologne. And many in attendance fretted over the minuscule number of African-Americans, Hispanic people and other minorities at the event.
Still, for those who attended, the meeting certainly reflected democracy in action, at times fulfilling Mr. Hightower's observation that "getting progressives together is kind of like loading frogs in a wheelbarrow."
After a long and somewhat contentious series of discussions, those on hand narrowly selected "Alliance for Democracy" as their group's name, over "Alliance for a New Democracy" and "People's Alliance."
"Pure democracy has its drawbacks," Al V. Krebs of Everett, Wash., said with a laugh. "But all in all, we really do feel that we're the beginning of a significant economic and social-justice movement."

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, an article yesterday about a convention of delegates intent on forming a new populist movement referred incorrectly to an article headlined "Real Populists Please Stand Up," written by Ronnie Dugger, who helped organize the convention. The article appeared in The Nation, not in The Texas Observer.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Sharply in Reaction To Europe's Accord on Lira

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged against most leading currencies yesterday as the Italian lira moved closer to joining a proposed single European currency and an official in Japan hinted that interest rates there would remain at their historic lows.
The lira rallied against the German mark after a weekend meeting approved the lira's re-entry into Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The reaction sent the dollar sharply higher against the mark as well. 
 "The dollar strengthened on the back of the decline in the mark against the lira," said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Barings.
A report showing western German consumer inflation fell in November also hurt the mark by dampening expectations for higher interest rates in Germany, dealers said.
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.5230 marks from 1.5065 marks Friday. In addition, the dollar rose to 112.63 yen from 111.46 yen and to 1,510.75 Italian lire from 1,496.00 lire.
 In Tokyo, the executive director of the Bank of Japan, Tadayo Honma, warned a banking symposium that more failures of Japanese financial institutions remained a possibility. His comments suggested that Japan's economy was still too weak to allow an increase in the official discount rate, which is now at half of 1 percent.
"The financial backdrop in the U.S. is pretty dollar supportive, while the focus in Japan is on the soft environment highlighted by the banking problem," said Lisa Finstrom, an analyst at Smith Barney.
In other trading, the dollar surged to 1.2877 Swiss francs from 1.2708 francs, reaching the highest level since mid-January 1995. The Swiss franc slipped on talk that Swiss pension funds were considering broadening their investments to include more foreign assets, traders said.
The British pound slipped to $1.6686 from $1.6798. The pound rose early in the session but lost ground later as investors took profits after a strong rally in recent sessions.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, denied reports that Britain would seek to link the pound informally to the proposed single European currency, insisting that the pound would remain independent.
With Britain set to announce its 1997-98 budget today, investors sold pounds to book profits.

CLINT EASTWOOD
A Biography
By Richard Schickel
Illustrated. 557 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50
For nearly three decades, he has been the screen embodiment of an all-American masculinity: the solitary gunslinger who rides into town to exact his own brand of vengeance; the squinty-eyed cop who defies bureaucratic politesse to get his man; the ravaged Secret Service man who battles age and memory to protect his honor. Lean, lanky and laconic, he has always specialized in loners with a slyly ironic smile: men cut off by temperament and circumstance from the world around them. 
 This is a minimalist cowboy who could make you feel lucky (or unlucky). This is someone who could make your day.
In his new biography of Clint Eastwood, the film critic Richard Schickel writes that the actor has "taken the American male deeper into the country of disaffection than he has ever ridden before on screen, reversing the great theme of our adventure movies, which has been male bonding, and insisting upon the opposite, the difficulty men have in making connections -- not just with other men, but with communities, with women, with conventional morality, with their own best selves." Mr. Eastwood's screen character, he goes on, "represents an isolation more radically withdrawn than anyone has ever offered in movies intended for, and embraced by, a popular audience."
As he has demonstrated in his excellent short essays, ("Schickel on Film," 1989), Mr. Schickel knows how to use his prodigious knowledge of cinematic history to create portraits of film artists that illuminate their individual talents while at the same time situating them within a social and esthetic context. In this volume, he does an authoritative job of tracing Mr. Eastwood's development as an actor and director, and he also gives the reader a highly nuanced appreciation of Mr. Eastwood's iconographic role as a symbol of American manhood and American individualism as it has evolved in the second half of the 20th century. In addition, he provides a persuasive repudiation of critics like Pauline Kael, who have consistently underestimated Mr. Eastwood's enduring talents.
Unfortunately, Mr. Schickel's unabashed enthusiasm for Mr. Eastwood -- he has known the actor for almost two decades and seems to regard him as a kind of friend -- also leads him to hagiographic excess. He devotes pages and pages to lesser films like "Every Which Way but Loose" (in which Mr. Eastwood starred with an orangutan) and "The Beguiled" (in which he played a wounded Union soldier who recuperates at a girls' school), frequently rationalizing their weaknesses and inflating their importance. Even an early guest appearance by Mr. Eastwood on "Mr. Ed" (the television series about a talking horse) is carefully assessed.
Mr. Schickel tends to be equally verbose when it comes to Mr. Eastwood's personal life, repeatedly telling us about his kindness toward animals ("his humane relationship with the lower phyla") and his loyalty to friends. On the matter of Mr. Eastwood's contentious breakup with his longtime girlfriend, Sondra Locke, Mr. Schickel portrays the actor as having been remarkably "indulgent" over the years, given Ms. Locke's continuing relationship with her husband, Gordon Anderson.
The Eastwood who emerges from this book is an agreeably reserved man who usually keeps "the nuclear capability of his anger" under wraps. That temper, Mr. Schickel suggests, has roots in Mr. Eastwood's Depression-era childhood, when economic hardship forced his family to relocate repeatedly and made him feel lonely and displaced.
Those experiences, Mr. Schickel writes, taught the actor two lessons: "Do everything in your power to lessen the impact of mischance, whether it be cosmic or mundane; do not trust institutions to do this job. Or, to put the point more positively, turn yourself into an institution and set your own rules of work and conduct, your own boundaries against intrusion. Then insist that this institution, this lengthened shadow of yourself, devote itself to the celebration of characters variously subversive, antisocial, rebellious. In a phrase, place the rage for one kind of order in the service of a rage against a different sort of order."
This outlook led Mr. Eastwood to form his own production company, and to try, as he gained increasing power and recognition, to achieve a kind of autonomy within the business to direct himself or "employ people he knew would defer to him." As for his suspicion of institutional authority, it would be reflected in Mr. Eastwood's choice of movie roles (from the outlaws in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns through Dirty Harry and Will Munny in "Unforgiven"), roles that would not only establish his distinctive screen persona, but that would also help revise the genre conventions of the western and the thriller.
Although Mr. Schickel gives the reader a palpable sense of Mr. Eastwood's career, from his early days on the television series "Rawhide" through his latest movie, "The Bridges of Madison County," his descriptions of Mr. Eastwood's achievement have a way of curdling into pretentious overstatement. Of the evolution of the actor's screen persona, he writes: "A rude beast had been perceived slouching toward the Bethlehem of the New Masculinity, waiting to be reborn in more cuddlesome form." And of the characters in "Unforgiven," he writes: "We have no trouble seeing Will M. as Josef K., seeing Little Bill Daggett as the keeper of a dark castle, or as the judge at an endless trial where no one knows exactly what he has done to deserve such hard punishment."
Such passages have one effect: they make the reader wish that Mr. Schickel had emulated Mr. Eastwood's own "appraising taciturnity," his "preternatural cool."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Bill Clinton's New America

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
With determined concentration, President Clinton has worked a historic change in American foreign policy. Foreign policy amounts to a nation's political, moral and military stance in the world, its role and values. For America, the change will affect all these, and for ill.
Mr. Clinton has made trade the foundation of his foreign policy, far surpassing other traditional American goals and values, like democracy and human rights, and often overriding security interests. 
 Central to this change is China, with whose President he has decided to exchange state visits, to further his suddenly proclaimed "partnership" between the world's largest democracy and its largest tyranny. The message he sent to all who hoped the U.S. would help them attain some relief from political oppression and religious persecution is: Don't.
Easily grasped everywhere. Today China and occupied Tibet, tomorrow Cuba, Burma, Indonesia, Africa, the Mideast -- who can know this inconstant heart?
Mr. Clinton worked long to achieve the turnaround. Diligently he broke his promises of help to China's victims and instead tied his Administration to the overarching trade value. Consistently, he and the people with the stomach to carry out his policy underrated Chinese violations of agreements against sales of missiles or nuclear-warfare material.
And in tireless duplicity, they told America the issue was to "isolate" China or not. False: Human rights supporters cheered when Nixon-Kissinger "opened" China. They wanted it opened not for the weird so-called realpolitik of building Chinese power, but precisely to bring China's people out of the isolation of despotism.
Once, conservatives could be expected to oppose strengthening Communist power. No longer; as the left abandoned anti-Communism, the right has abandoned human rights. On this -- nothing to choose, between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton.
Once liberals opposed dictatorships that conservatives found congenial. No longer; Democrats grub money from the Indonesian dictatorship and rationalize the Chinese.
Senator Sam Nunn says China did not make much progress in our definition of human rights, but made a lot in a "broader" definition -- economic betterment.
This is the classic rationalization by dictators and for dictators. Now it allocates different human values to Asians. It says that America was able to rise economically from its revolution while expanding freedoms, but Asians are not.
Also corruptive of democratic values is the libocon position that the business of the world is now business, so if the right to talk without risk of arrest and torture has any lingering interest, let American businesses in China handle it.
It was never the business of business to take over from the American people and government the responsibility for human rights or even workers' rights. That protected America from the corporate government so dear to totalitarians.
At home, the rights to collective bargaining, Social Security and defined working conditions were not granted by business but came through the appropriate mixture of public opinion, legislation and business needs. Abroad, that mix created embargoes against South Africa and Cuba, and refusal to obey rules of the Arab boycott of Israel.
In China, U.S. businesses grow in numbers but not in inclination to walk up to one of Mr. Clinton's Chinese partners for a stern chat about the Chinese gulag. The idea that U.S. business would do that now because its own Government was abdicating on human rights may ease the conscience but is self-deceiving.
Mr. Clinton did not even get a decent bid for his change of policy. Economically China promised him only huge American trade deficits. Now China blackmails U.S. companies with demands for technology that would put more Americans out of work. The Clintonians failed with limp attempts to persuade China not to keep selling missile and nuclear technology to terrorist nations.
So, we must understand. Those human rights promises he made in the 1992 campaign -- he never intended to keep them. So be it. The human rights cause had been sold out before Mr. Clinton came cozily along. It rose, and will again.

HEADLINE: House Resales Fell by 1.5% In October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing houses dropped by 1.5 percent in October, the fifth consecutive monthly drop, the National Association of Realtors said today, providing further evidence that the housing market is slowing.
The association said house resales declined to an annual rate of 3.97 million in October, and it revised its figure for September to 2.7 percent. The October figures were lower than expected; analysts had predicted a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent last month. 
 The figures reflect actual closings.
Even though mortgage rates are falling, the housing market for 1997 is not expected to sustain the big contribution it made to the economy this year, analysts said. "Housing has gone as far as it will go for now," Jim Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc. in New York, said.
Despite the decline in resales, John Tuccillo, the chief economist with the association, said the average of monthly resales would set a record of more than four million this year. "It's been a banner year for housing," he said. "Next year, while it will be a good year, probably will be off 5 percent."
Even if the housing market slows, many economists still think the economy will sustain its moderate growth and low inflation through next year. That is the view of the National Association of Business Economists, which released a forecast today by 44 corporate economists, saying that the economy will grow at a 2.3 percent average annual pace in 1997 and that the Consumer Price Index would rise 2.9 percent.
That is in line with expectations of the Federal Reserve, which decided last month to leave the overnight lending rate for banks unchanged at 5.25 percent.
Resales of houses fell 1 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 1.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said, and 5.8 percent in the South, to an annual rate of 1.45 million. In the Northeast, resales rose 3.3 percent, to an annual rate of 620,000, and in the West they rose 3.5 percent, to an annual rate of 880,000.
The strong resales rate in the West is chiefly the result of activity in the San Francisco Bay area, where resales rose 15.4 percent last month from October 1995, a real estate information service said last week.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Heating and Crude Oil Down On Apparent Iraq-U.N. Deal

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices for crude and heating oil retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday after Iraq agreed to the terms of a United Nations plan that would allow Iraqi oil to return to the world market.
On other markets, copper prices rose. 
 Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's representative at the United Nations, confirmed in a letter to U.N. officials that Iraq no longer objected to some terms of the deal, which had originally been reached on May 20.
The United States had insisted all issues relating to the deal must be addressed before approving a pricing mechanism, while Iraq had wanted to first approve pricing.
"People after all these delays are taking the approach, 'We'll believe it when the oil's being loaded,' but this is the closest it's been in a long time," said Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group.
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said that a pricing mechanism still must be completed; other officials also said that hardware for physical shipments of oil must be repaired.
The United Nations plan would allow Iraq to export as much as $2 billion of oil during a six-month period to pay for food and medicine.
Iraq estimated that oil would be flowing by mid-December. Analysts estimated that it would be mid-January before oil reaches the market.
Crude oil for January delivery fell 26 cents, to $23.49 a barrel. Other energy futures were also lower. December unleaded gasoline rose 0.19 cent, to 67.99 cents a gallon, and December heating oil fell 0.56 cent, to 72.23 cents a pound.
Copper prices rose on expectations that the London Metal Exchange would again report a sharp decline in its warehouse supplies today.
The International Copper Study Group said yesterday that its analysis of the market suggested that supply and demand would be in balance this year, which was taken as positive since most expectations have been for a surplus.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, December copper rose 1.35 cents, to $1.059 a pound.

HEADLINE: U.N. Reports a Billion Adults Not Fully Employed

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The number of adults worldwide who were either unemployed or underemployed rose to one billion in 1995, according to a United Nations report that also warned that such levels are not sustainable.
The International Labor Organization report, to be officially released Tuesday, rebuked industrialized countries for dropping the goal of full employment and suggested ways to decrease joblessness. 
 "Current levels of unemployment make no economic sense and are neither politically nor socially sustainable," the agency's head, Michel Hansenne, wrote.
The 1995 figure was an increase of about 180 million people over 1993 and 1994, when the United Nations warned that the estimated 820 million underemployed or unemployed represented a crisis not seen since the Great Depression. Although the situation has worsened, the agency did not refer to that assessment in this year's report.
Unemployment in the 15 European Union nations increased in 1995 to 11.3 percent of the work force, compared with 2 percent in the 1960's, the report said. France, Germany, Italy and Sweden showed the biggest increases in unemployment, and Spain had the highest jobless rate at 22.3 percent.
In central and eastern Europe, unemployment remained at double-digit levels in most countries, the report said. Nearly one-third of the jobless were below the age of 25.
Unemployment increased in many Latin American countries. Although there were few figures for Africa and Asia, underemployment exists on a large scale in the developing world, the report said. Overall, about 30 percent of the world's labor force was either unemployed or underemployed, it said.
The organization said sustained economic growth is the best way to get people back to work, citing the United States as a success.
From August through October, the United States jobless rate has been at about 5.1 percent, a seven-year low, according to Labor Department figures.

HEADLINE: Iraq and U.N. Make Deal on Oil Sales for Aid

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Iraq and the United Nations announced today that they had reached a final agreement on the long-delayed deal allowing Iraq to sell oil for food and other emergency goods for the country's suffering civilian population.
Diplomats said Iraqi oil could begin flowing again as early as next month, for the first time in six years. The plan has seemed close to implementation before, only to be stalled because of disputes or objections raised by the United States or Iraq. 
 "I think we made an important step forward today," said an American official who has worked closely with the negotiations.
The plan allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil in a renewable six-month period can go into effect as soon as the Security Council committee overseeing the sanctions agrees to a formula for determining the price of the oil.
Citing strong demand and low reserves at refineries, oil analysts said the sales are likely to only slightly reduce the cost of a barrel of oil on world markets.
Oil experts will also have to verify that oil-metering equipment on the Iraq-Turkish border is functioning. Iraq had removed the meters but has promised to reinstall them. Most of the oil is expected to flow through a Turkish pipeline. A smaller amount will be exported through the Iraq port of Mina al-Bakr.
"The United States is very pleased at this action," Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations said today. "For the last two years we have been working on a way to make sure that the people of Iraq are able to have additional humanitarian assistance."
Iraq has been under sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Although the government is permitted to import food, medicines and other urgently needed commodities, it has not done so.
After international agencies began reporting the deteriorating health and living standards of Iraq civilians, especially children, the Security Council proposed the oil-for-food plan in the spring of 1995 as a limited exemption to sanctions. A year and a half of haggling followed.
Sanctions are intended to stay in effect until Iraq eliminates or accounts for all its weapons of mass destruction. Baghdad has consistently stalled or lied about its arsenal to United Nations weapons inspectors, and no early lifting of sanctions seems likely.
Ms. Albright denied today that the Clinton Administration had been holding up the implementation of the new oil-for-food plan until after the American presidential elections. European diplomats had voiced suspicion earlier this fall that the Americans would not want to be seen doing anything that might be construed as relaxing the sanctions while Mr. Clinton was pursuing re-election.
Ms. Albright said President Saddam Hussein was responsible for recurring delays in agreeing to the plan's details, following an agreement in principle last May.
In August, the Iraqis put the plan in jeopardy by sending troops into the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq to takes sides in a flareup of an old civil conflict between Kurdish factions under international protection. The oil-sale plan mandates that about $130 million to $150 million in oil-sale purchases go to the Kurdish areas, to be distributed by relief agencies working with the United Nations.
American diplomats now seem confident that the distribution can go ahead in the Kurdish areas without Baghdad's interference. Iraqi officials will distribute goods in the rest of the country, observed by international monitors appointed by the United Nations.
A third of the oil proceeds will be earmarked for a compensation fund for victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Claims have been accumulating at the fund's headquarters in Geneva, where there is no money to pay them.

U.S. to Evacuate More Kurds
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 (AP) -- The United States will evacuate some 5,000 Kurds and others from northern Iraq because of fears that they may be in imminent danger from Iraqi security forces, the State Department said today.
In the next few days, the Kurds and others will be taken to Turkey and then flown to Guam, where they will be processed for asylum in the United States, said a State Department spokesman, Glyn Davies.
Those being evacuated worked for 24 organizations supported or financed by the United States, Mr. Davies said, and "they bear the mark of the U.S. on them."
The mission to evacuate them will be a joint operation with Turkey, and the impact on relief efforts in northern Iraq was not clear. The latest evacuees were left behind after an American-led rescue in September of 2,000 others from the region, including Kurds who had worked for United States Government agencies.

HEADLINE: Clinton in Manila: Successes Are Not Spectacular, but Still Useful

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Nov. 25

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton assembled Asia's leaders for their first summit meeting, three years ago in Seattle, he talked grandly about building a "Pacific community," stitching together countries with no natural alliances, few common ethnic ties, vastly different economies and centuries-old rivalries.
Curiously, on his 12-day tour of the Pacific, which concludes on Tuesday in Thailand, Mr. Clinton has yet to use that term. His own Asia hands concede that in this age of atomized foreign policies, even the common bond of booming trade and investments across borders creates something well short of a community. 
 Measured by the overarching vision that Mr. Clinton sketched out, the annual meetings he inaugurated have accomplished little but vague assurances of "free and open trade" over the next 25 years.
But by other measures -- less headline-grabbing, certainly, and far short of a grand architecture for America's relationship with the most vibrant economies of the world -- the meetings have become enormously useful for Mr. Clinton.
And in at least three significant ways, they have changed the dynamics of how America negotiates with Asia and the rest of the world.
Mr. Clinton pointed out the most important of those changes at a private lunch today with the 17 other leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group at the former American naval base at Subic Bay.
"If it wasn't for APEC, Jiang Zemin and I would have barely met," he said, pointing to the Chinese President. In fact, Sunday's 85-minute meeting with Mr. Jiang was the third one at a Pacific summit, and none of the encounters would have been likely if the annual gathering did not exist.
Dialogue, of course, is very different from progress, and certainly the meetings have done little to resolve differences between the two countries. But those sessions may have also kept their uneasy relationship from jumping the rails at critical points.
The same might be said of Mr. Clinton's tense meeting with President Kim Young Sam of South Korea over how to handle military provocations from the North, a subject that has caused a rift between Washington and Seoul in the last two months.
The second change wrought by the summit meetings has as much to do with Europe as with America. With remarkable speed, the Administration has used its new relationship with Asia's vibrant economies to persuade -- and sometimes bludgeon -- recalcitrant European officials into agreements that otherwise would have taken years to achieve.
Mr. Clinton said as much at dinner at Malacalang Palace last night, corralling his opposite numbers to endorse a worldwide agreement to wipe out tariffs on computers and information technologies, an agreement that will benefit America and Asia far more than Europe.
"This was the big surprise," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides said the other day. "The Europeans are terrified of being left behind in our relationship with Asia -- technologically, economically, diplomatically. And you can play on that fear to accomplish some good."
And finally, the summit meetings have eased, but hardly eliminated, Asia's recurring suspicions about America's intentions.
Those suspicions take many forms, from worries that the United States is no longer committed to keeping 100,000 troops in the region, to the often-voiced certainty that America is manipulating the global trading system to its own advantage, forcing countries to swallow free trade agreements before they have a chance to nurture protected infant industries, the way Japan and South Korea did.
"It's taken us years to convince people, at home and in Asia, that we really do see economic security and national security as a seamless whole," Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said here. "The advantage to having the President meet every year with Asia's leaders -- more often with a few of them -- is that it gives you new ways to demonstrate that economic interdependence builds peace and stability."
The problem is that no one has yet figured out how to build a strategic vision of the world out of this merger.
Even Washington cannot quite figure out how to integrate the two. Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary who died in a plane crash in Croatia in April, used to call the kind of work that Mr. Clinton was engaged in this weekend "commercial diplomacy," building ties by doing deals. Under that umbrella the Administration has focused enormous attention on "big emerging markets" like Indonesia and India, which never commanded the attention they should have in Washington.
But before he died, Mr. Brown conceded that he had yet to prove that more and more commercial interaction with the West would bring China, for example, around on human rights or prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.
The other problem with commercial diplomacy viewed at the ground level is that it can be excruciatingly boring. Arms control talks were jammed with unintelligible acronyms, but at least the subject matter involved life and death.
Mr. Clinton found himself compelled today to describe as "a big deal" an important but unexciting agreement-to-agree on lowering tariffs on computers, chips and a range of other products.
Under the Administration's first term, there is little question that such accords, while unexciting, have become the building blocks of deeper relationships.
Coming up with acceptable wording on the information technology accord, for example, forced Mr. Clinton to deal directly with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, the most persistent critic of America's central role in the Asia and Pacific group. It was an interesting encounter, because Dr. Mahathir had boycotted the first summit meeting in Seattle. He has apparently decided since then that Malaysia cannot afford to sit it out, and he called today's summit meeting a success.
Similarly, the first sign this spring that the Administration's relationship with China was slowly emerging from the deep freeze came when the two countries ended a fight over the piracy of software and videos.
Such political gains have become the subtext of these purely economic summit meetings.
"You can look at these narrowly and say that we are just slogging through, talking about goals for the year 2020," said C. Fred Bergsten, who led the "eminent persons group" that set the early agendas for these meetings. "And by that measure there isn't much to celebrate. But think of how little these countries talked four years ago, and how much they are talking now."

HEADLINE: Republicans Outline Proposal To Press for Modest Change

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Nov. 25

 BODY:
In a sharp contrast to their post-election gathering two years ago, Republicans meeting here today outlined an "incrementalist" 1997 agenda of specifically directed tax cuts, modest changes in Medicaid and as much cooperation with President Clinton as possible.
The Republican governors and Congressional leaders also promised swift action in the House and Senate on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. They said that after this month's elections, they appeared to have the decisive votes for the measure that died by a single vote in the Senate last year. 
 As the governors promised to lobby hard to get the amendment through Congress and then ratified in state legislatures, they appealed to Republican Congressional leaders for help on a number of Federal issues with huge effects on state budgets, from Medicaid and job training programs to next year's reauthorization of the Federal highway program.
"We take very seriously working together with the Republican governors," Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said.
Two years ago, the post-election meeting between Republican governors and Congressional leaders took on extra meaning because the Republicans had just won control of Congress and 30 governorships. Then, Mr. Gingrich led a parade of speakers who promised governors a Republican revolution that would balance the budget, cut taxes deeply and shift power over welfare, Medicaid and scores of other programs from Washington to the states.
Welfare changes were enacted late last year, but some of the other promises never materialized. And much of their success was overshadowed by the budget battle with Mr. Clinton that, in the eyes of many voters, made the Republicans seem harsh and overly combative.
So even as the Republicans celebrated their success in defending their control of the House and Senate, this year's meeting was conducted in a pragmatic atmosphere.
"I think we have learned some good lessons," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. "I'm not interested in making a statement. I'm interested in producing results."
The tone seemed to suit most of the governors, although several favor a more aggressive push for tax cuts than was outlined by the Congressional leaders.
"The election results proved people don't want their leaders to stray too far to the right or to the left," said Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois. "The Congressional Republican leadership is a very pragmatic bunch."
Pushing the balanced budget amendment is a safe way for Republicans to begin the new year. It was clear, however, that the Republicans were prepared to be cautious on more controversial issues.
The Republican budget plan in 1995 called for $245 billion in tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit and reductions in taxes on capital gains. Mr. Clinton has embraced the child credit and called for other specific tax cuts to help pay for college and to exempt most home sales from capital-gains taxes.
In 1995, Republicans had a take-it-or-leave-it approach on taxes. But Mr. Gingrich said the party was happy to take "an incrementalist approach" for the next few years, passing the "largest signable tax cut" in 1997 and then revisiting the issue every year after that.
"It adds up to a whole lot by the year 2000," he said, predicting that Republicans would do even better in the 1998 midterm elections than they did this year.
Mr. Lott, likewise, said Republicans had no magic number for tax cuts in 1997. He supported the thrust of Mr. Clinton's plans but said Republicans would seek a broader reduction in capital-gains taxes to stimulate an economy that he said was showing signs of sluggishness.
On Medicaid, the Republicans said they would bow to political reality and seek incremental reforms if Mr. Clinton did not change his position.
In the last Congressional term, the Republicans were adamant that the program be converted into block grants to the states, an approach Mr. Clinton rejected, saying it would put the poor and the disabled elderly at risk. "In order for anything to be effective," Mr. Lott said, "he has to be part of the solution."

HEADLINE: Dow Surges 76.03 to Top 6,500 As Post-Election Rally Roars On

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average, continuing its post-election surge, leaped past 6,500 points for the first time yesterday, a move that came only six weeks after the index first topped 6,000.
The Dow gained 76.03 points, to 6,547.79, pushing the widely watched barometer up 8.6 percent so far this month. If the market hangs on to these gains for the rest of this week, it would be the best month for the Dow in almost five years. 
 The surge has come amid enthusiasm over the status quo election results, which Wall Street hopes offer more of the same, and amid a spate of fairly weak economic statistics, which have reassured investors that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates.
"The market perceives we are in a perfect environment, with a Goldilocks economy and Goldilocks politics," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, with the economic and political porridge neither too hot nor too cold.
Many other indexes also moved to highs, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock rising 8.30 points, to 757.03, and the Nasdaq composite index up 6.01 points, to 1,280.37. Utility stocks were especially strong, with the Dow Jones utilities average rising 2.72 points, to 238.12, a three-year high.
Mr. Shulman said that based on his estimate for earnings by the stocks in the S.& P. 500 that index ended the day at 18.9 times 1996 profits. Pointing to data since 1950, he said that the index had occasionally traded at higher multiples of earnings when those profits had been depressed by a recession, but he said it had never traded higher in the middle or late stages of an economic recovery.
At the peak in 1968, he said, the multiple was 18.8. It was at 18.7 at the high in 1972, before the disastrous 1973-74 bear market, and peaked at 18 in 1987, before the crash that year. "I'm getting very worried," Mr. Shulman said.
But he appears to be in a minority. Money continues to pour into mutual funds and companies continue to announce plans to buy back their stock. And the greater fear of both investors and money managers seems to be that they will miss a further increase, not that they might be caught in a price decline.
The Dow is now up 28 percent for the year. That is not quite as good as the 33.5 percent gain in 1995, but it is otherwise the best since 1975, when the Dow was recovering from the 1973-74 bear market.
And the two-year gain for the Dow, assuming the index closes at current levels, would be 70.8 percent. That would be the best such stretch for the index since 1954-55, when it rose 73.9 percent. Should the Dow climb to 6,667 by the end of the year, it would be the best two-year showing since 1927-28. The current month is in line to be the best since December 1991, when the index rose 9.5 percent.
But those statistics overstate just how well the stock market has done this year. Particularly since July, when the market suffered its worst dip of the year, this has been a rally dominated by large stocks. The Nasdaq composite has moved to highs because it is now strongly influenced by large companies, like Intel and Microsoft.
But the Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of 2,000 stocks that, by market capitalization, are smaller than the 1,000 largest, is up just 11.5 percent for 1996 and is still below the peak it reached in May. Yesterday it rose 2.37 points, to 352.29, not nearly as strong a showing as larger indexes. Among money managers, the July dip seemed to create a desire for the safety represented by large, well-established companies.
Intel, for example, fell 7/8 yesterday, to 121 1/2, but is still up 89 percent since its July low. During that stretch, its market capitalization has risen by $47 billion. By contrast, the common stock of General Motors, which rose 3/4 yesterday, to 58 1/4, and is up 27 percent since its July low, has a total market value of just $43 billion.
The strongest performers among the Dow industrials yesterday included Philip Morris, up 3 1/4, to 105 1/2; J. P. Morgan, up 2 5/8, to 93, and General Electric, up 2 3/4, to 103 3/4. Philip Morris and other tobacco stocks surged on the news that David Kessler had resigned as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Banks were among the market leaders, with other strong performers, aside from Morgan, including BankAmerica, up 5 3/8, to 103 1/8, and Banc One up 1 1/2, to 46 1/4.
One of the oldest market theories holds that a bull market is clearly in force only if both the Dow industrials, which make the goods, and the Dow transports, which move them, are setting highs. By that standard, the current bull market has not been confirmed, because the Dow transports remain below the peak of 2,296.20 reached on May 22. But it is getting close, rising 24.41 points, to 2,289.75 yesterday. The strongest stocks in that index included Federal Express, up 1 7/8, to 44 1/4; USAir, up 3/4, to 23; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, up 1 5/8, to 92 5/8, and Union Pacific, up 7/8, to 57 7/8.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Owners to Meet Today On Labor Agreement

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Reject or ratify. Once more into the breach the owners step, given a second chance today to act on a labor deal they resoundingly rejected three weeks ago. Although no one can say what the outcome will be when the owners meet in Chicago today, the talk in recent days was that enough owners were prepared to change their votes to reverse the result.
But for the agreement to be ratified, 11 of the 18 owners who voted against the agreement on Nov. 6 would have to reverse their positions and the 12 ayes would have to remain in that column. Those numbers indicate that the optimism with which some people are viewing the second vote could be wishful thinking.
Owners could change their votes from no to yes for two reasons: 
 They are furious that Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox gave Albert Belle a record $55 million contract after leading the opposition to the agreement with the argument that the pact needed greater restraint on player salaries.
They have spent the past three weeks staring reality in its ugly face and concluded that they don't want to continue operating under the existing economic system and at war with the players.
Even Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, was said by an owner familiar with his thinking to be tiring of the fight. At the last meeting, Selig refused to take a public position on the agreement despite pleas from others to do so. According to one person who attended the meeting, Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers said repeatedly: "Bud, you are our leader. You must have a position. Tell us what your position is."
The owner familiar with Selig's thinking said that Selig was considering altering his stance today. A Selig endorsement, many management people have said, would prompt an undetermined number of other owners to vote for the deal. Selig did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking comment on his position or plans.
One indication of Selig's position could be the location of Randy Levine, the owners' chief negotiator, when the owners discuss the agreement and vote. At the Nov. 6 meeting, Levine was asked to leave when the meeting reached the critical stage of final discussion and vote. If Selig asks him to stay in the room today, it could be a sign that Selig will push for the agreement.
Selig's position aside, it was clear that some owners were upset with Reinsdorf for the Belle contract and for what they called his hypocrisy.
"You can't advocate one position publicly and do another thing privately," one owner said. "I have no idea what people are going to do, but I hope it will shock some of my peers and they'll say, 'Let's get this deal done.' "
Another owner said: "A lot of people are infuriated. You can't say one thing and do another."
Like Reinsdorf, who also owns the Chicago Bulls, Stan Kasten of the Atlanta Braves has a basketball team, the Hawks, as well as a baseball team. He defended Reinsdorf, saying: "I don't see anything hypocritical about it at all. Jerry is consistent. Jerry, in the two sports I'm familiar with him, competes as hard as he can under the prevailing system. All he says is the system is severely flawed in baseball."
However the owners vote today, the vote clearly will be the last chance for interleague play next season. Clubs have clamored for the 1997 schedule so they can start selling tickets, and Selig is feeling pressure to release it. If the owners reject the deal again, the teams will play a traditional schedule next year.
If the owners ratify the agreement, Levine will have to discuss two issues with the union. One is the free-agent status of certain players, including Jimmy Key, whom the Yankees retained by offering salary arbitration. Under the new agreement, Key would have been a free agent.
The other issue is the size of the players' pool from the first round of the playoffs. Under the new agreement, the players would have received 60 percent from that round this year, but without the deal in place, shares were computed on the basis of 80 percent, which the players had previously received.
It's too late to change back to 60 percent because the checks are in the mail. They were put there yesterday.

HEADLINE: Biting Into Food Industry Profits;
Downsizing Prevails as Customers Resist Paying More

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J.

 BODY:
It may be every grocery shopper's fundamental right to complain, but in these days of low inflation and competing superstores on every strip, there is less than usual to complain about. Walk down the wide aisles of the Pathmark 2000 supermarket here, for example, and you will see shelves jammed with a record variety of new goods in a time of stable prices.
Good times for consumers, though, have meant hard times for the packaged-food companies putting all those soups, cereals and cookies on the shelves. Unable to raise prices, and with margins squeezed by competition among retailers, the industry is looking inward for ways to please Wall Street, and its employees are paying. Consider these examples: 
 Shoppers here pay $3.29 for a 20-ounce box of Kellogg's Raisin Bran, 26 percent less than a year ago. The price for Kellogg Company workers: 1,400 fewer employees by the end of 1996, analysts estimate, on top of 6,000 lost over the last 15 years.
A can of Campbell's chicken noodle soup has 33 percent more chicken than a year ago. But the Campbell Soup Company is eliminating 650 employees this year, more than 100 of them in its poultry-processing operations. The company is cutting costs by buying from outside contractors and yesterday it announced yet another internal reorganization of its food operations.
Shelves of Pathmark stores, owned by Supermarket General Holdings, are crowded with new low-fat offerings from Snackwell's, like Iced Fudge Toaster Pastries for $2.19. Yet Snackwell's, the sales phenomenon of 1995, is struggling as other companies weigh in with similar products. Its owner, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, is undergoing a $428 million reorganization.
All told, at least 100,000 jobs have been lost in the food industry, in a relatively invisible reorganization that is still reminiscent of more high-profile contractions in the banking and aerospace industries. This time, the impetus is nothing so dramatic as deregulation or the end of the cold war, but rather the food companies' inability to raise prices in the era of shareholder value, when profit growth is an imperative.
"These days, supermarket aisles are the most violent places in the world," said Bob Messenger, editor and publisher of Food Trends Newsletter in Palatine, Ill. The big food companies are trying to adapt to a marketplace "that is more fickle and competitive, dangerous and risky than ever before," he said.
"People may want lower prices," he said, "but some of them end up as victims of downsizing."
John M. McMillin, a securities analyst for Prudential Securities Research, said that at least 100,000 jobs had been lost. "My guess is that about 10 percent to 15 percent of the employees in the entire packaged-food industry have been terminated in the last 18 months," he said.
Most food companies had already reorganized, even while inflation allowed them to pursue a favorite strategy for raising profits: routine price increases.
But now, consumers are resisting "pricing," as sticker increases are called, shopping for bargains among less expensive private-label and store brands, buying in bulk from warehouse clubs, and benefiting from price wars among a profusion of grocery chains, discounters and convenience stores.
"The routine across-the-board, 4 percent price hike twice a year is a thing of the past," said Paul S. Walsh, chief executive of the Pillsbury Company in Minneapolis, a subsidiary of the London-based Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. "You may be able to eke out a 2 percent rise if your costs spike up, or go up 1 percent here or there. But that's it."
At the same time, retailers are charging more for shelf space for new products, and those higher slotting fees now come directly out of earnings, instead of price rises. But flat earnings are fiscally incorrect. And so the industry is resorting to new rounds of reorganization, cost-cutting and downsizing. The only other option is to expand abroad, where European giants like Unilever N.V. are adopting the American lean-and-mean strategy to defend their turf.
"Most of the larger companies are looking at fairly modest growth in a mature United States market," Terry Bivens, an analyst at Donald & Company, said. "So if you're going to have growth, you have to find it overseas or cut your costs."
The poster company for this new environment is the once-stodgy Campbell, whose chief executive, David W. Johnson, woke up a roomful of sleepy securities analysts in September by announcing that his new plan for the company was more reorganization -- expected to cost $160 million and 650 jobs.
Campbell had already undergone six years of reorganization under Mr. Johnson, which helped to lift its share price 240 percent while cutting 9,000 jobs. Investors happily responded to yesterday's announcement by lifting the stock 25 cents, to $83.125.
The world's largest soup maker is hardly alone in the roster of the incredible shrinking food companies. The H. J. Heinz Company, Unilever, Conagra Inc., Nabisco, the Quaker Oats Company and Kellogg have all recently announced cost-cutting or major reorganizations.
Consumer resistance to high prices has caused tumult in the $8 billion cereal category, where shoppers have turned to private-label products or abandoned cereal for "breakfast substitutes" such as bagels and muffins.
"Those high prices were so out of line, I boycotted cereal," Barbara McGee, a mother of two from Greensboro, N.C., said. "We realized we could do very well without it."
In April, Post, which is owned by Philip Morris Companies, announced a 20 percent reduction in the retail prices of its Post and Nabisco cereals; Kellogg and General Mills Inc. followed suit. At the same time, jobs were crunched, too.
The work-force cuts in the food industry are deep, going beyond blue-collar workers into departments like marketing. Many executives have left the industry for "careers in the world of telecom and service industries, where they can bring their skill sets to high-growth areas," said Miles McKie, a partner with Heidrick & Struggles Inc., a search firm that has found jobs for many food-company executives.
Among the white-collar workers who have stayed in the industry, the job search is more challenging than ever. "The problem isn't so much finding a job, but finding a good job," said Robert Black, who was the vice president in charge of the high-growth Old El Paso Mexican-food brand at Pet Inc. in St. Louis, when Pillsbury acquired it last year.
Mr. Black said he had worked with Pillsbury for a while, "but we all knew that they would want their own management to take over." Though he helped many of his subordinates get jobs with Pillsbury, "a lot of people at Pet were let go," he said, "and a lot of people didn't want to leave St. Louis."
It took the 53-year-old Mr. Black a year to find a new job that was appropriate for his experience. He is now general manager of Barilla America, the Norwalk, Conn., subsidiary of Barilla S.p.A., the Italian pasta maker that has entered the premium pasta battleground in the United States.
Consumers are still willing to pay more for high-margin premium products such as coffees, salsas and snack foods. But even the growing variety available to consumers has a downside for the food companies.
"It costs $20 million to $80 million to introduce a new product, but it's sort of like throwing mud at the wall," Mr. Messenger said. "Whatever sticks, sticks. And whatever falls, falls. But there's not as much sticking as falling."
All of these factors have fueled a wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to shed mediocre performers and acquire new category leaders. Companies are swapping divisions "like kids with trading cards," Mr. McMillin said, transforming the food business.
At the same time that Campbell announced its $160 million reorganization, for example, it also said it was paying $210 million to acquire the German soup maker Erasco Group from Grand Metropolitan to speed its expansion in Europe.
McCormick & Company sold its Gilroy Foods unit to Conagra. CPC International bought Entenmann's to combine with its Thomas's bakery business. And Heinz bought the Quaker Oats Company's $725-million pet-food business, while announcing in September that it would sell other units in the United States and abroad to concentrate on its core businesses.
The reorganization wave in the American food industry has begun to reverberate beyond the United States. The new co-chairman of the British-Dutch Unilever P.L.C., Naill Fitzgerald, recently traveled to New York and Boston to tell analysts and investors that the company planned to sell underperforming units, reorganize management and tie executive compensation to earnings growth.
"We are talking about rationalizing companies' total portfolios," Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. "In the past, companies would hang on to small businesses even if they were No. 2 or No. 3 in the market. Now they can no long afford to."
Campbell's reorganization announcement was a significant symbol of the new competitive landscape, Ms. Ghez said. "Everyone thought Campbell had done all the restructuring it could do -- and then they told us there is a lot still to be done," she said. Yesterday, Campbell did even more, stitching together its international bakery, grocery, frozen and specialty food operations into a new global business unit.
Yet as consumers benefit, each round of reorganization takes a new toll on the industry. "There are no nags anymore in this industry," Mr. Messenger said. "They are all thoroughbreds, and that's raising the level of competition to a killing level."


GRAPHIC: More and more, the packaged food industry is caught between consumers unwilling to pay more for their products and investors looking for higher returns. The result: endless rounds of reorganization and increasing revenues per employee.
 
CAMPBELL SOUP COMPANY
Chart/Graph: "More Productive, but at a High Price"
 Announced a major corporate realignment yesterday. This followed a September reorganizing plan that will reduce its work force by 650 employees and result in a $160 million charge, the latest step in six years of cost-cutting.
 
H.J. HEINZ COMPANY
 In September, it said it would sell businesses in the United States and abroad as part of a plan to jettison unprofitable operations and reduce debt.

Bond Prices In Mild Rally On New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A weak housing report and a strong dollar combined to raise the prices of Treasury securities yesterday, with the 30-year maturity leading the mild rally.
Investors bought after the National Association of Realtors reported a 1.5 percent drop in the number of October home resales, to an annual rate of 3.97 million. That was less than the 4.01 million annual rate expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Business News, reinforcing investors' perception that the economy was indeed cooling, reducing the chances of a rise in inflation and higher interest rates. 
 The 30-year benchmark issue was up 7/32 , to a price of 1011/32 , for a yield of 6.42 percent, down from 6.44 percent on Friday. The yield has been hovering at eight-month-low levels.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager of the Private Bank at the Bank of Boston, said that although activity was thin in Treasury trading, the corporate side saw a substantial amount of activity. The day's largest deal was by Chase Capital Securities, a subsidiary of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which made the public offering of preferred capital notes through Morgan Stanley & Company.
"Out of the $600 million offering by Chase Capital Securities," Mr. Ablin said, "I only got half of what I wanted, and that has to show you how much investor interest there was."
The preferred capital notes carried a 7.67 percent coupon, with a 30-year maturity and a 10-year call provision. They were priced to yield 120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage points, more than the 6.75 percent Treasury issue due Aug. 15, 2026.
"Coming into today the bond market was on a down note," Mr. Ablin said, "but then the Treasury took a positive turn that was helped by a weak housing report. More notably, it was the October home resale data and a strengthening dollar in overnight trading that contributed to the positive tone of the market."
Other factors keeping bonds on a solid footing included continued bullish sentiment, along with a buy-on-the-dip mentality, which kept profit taking to a minimum. In addition to the strong dollar, bonds were aided by stock market gains as the Dow raced through the 6,500-point level and by investors covering short positions. In addition, the day's move was exaggerated by thin volume ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Rates at the Treasury's regular auction of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday were unchanged from a week ago and in line with expectations.
Following are the results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo.

HEADLINE: At Island Plane Crash Site, Sorrow and a Souvenir Hunt

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MITSAMOULI, Comoro Islands, Nov. 25

 BODY:
In the clear tropical waters rocking the shards of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, a variety of emotions rose and ebbed with the tides today.
For dozens of Comoran villagers and fishermen, what was left of one of the deadliest airline hijackings in history was a thrill. It was a chance for them to wade the reef where the wreckage had broken apart, scavenging bits of clothing, playing on the shattered tail, stripping cushions from the airliner's seats and then, using chunks of coral as hammers, pounding the steel seats themselves apart for scrap metal and souvenirs. 
 For a State Department team of eight Americans, it was a vigil, waiting somberly for a flattened tunnel of fuselage on the beach to be cut open and the bodies added to a tally that is expected to include 127 of the 175 passengers and crew aboard.
Among the bodies inside the beached section of fuselage were those of a colleague, Leslieanne Shedd, an official at the United States Embassy in Ethiopia, and another American who has not been publicly identified.
Near the team's feet was a small pile the scavengers were being kept far away from -- passports and other items that would help identify the bodies inside.
For the Comoran police and army, it was a day of chasing curious crowds away with nightsticks and arguing about who was going to cut open the fuselage and recover the last, largest group of bodies -- the Comorans, with their inadequate chainsaws and their self-reliant pride, or the French Navy, with its modern cutting torches and its desire to command the operation without local interference.
For the guests at the remote Galawa Beach Hotel, it was a curiosity that was growing into an irritation. Scuba diving and parasailing were canceled for the third day, though water-skiing started up in the afternoon, creating the jarring picture of vacationers joyously filling the air with spray a few hundred yards from a beached tomb for rows of cadavers hanging upside down in their seats.
"The ones who were here the day it crashed understand," said Susan Ellis, the hotel nurse who was one of the heroes of the lifesaving efforts. "But the ones who arrived afterwards -- for them it's just a nuisance."
And for the police 25 miles away in Moroni, the capital, it was a day for the startling discovery that the two men they have under arrest in the hijacking are probably innocent.
The co-pilot, who was badly beaten in the ordeal, finally saw the men today and said they were not among the three hijackers.
The arrested men say they are from Djibouti and Kenya, while the hijackers are thought to have been Ethiopian. The two are being held in protective custody while the investigation proceeds.
One body apparently remains in the cockpit 150 feet underwater -- presumably that of the lead hijacker. The other two are probably among the dead, officials said.
"So we may never know what they wanted," said Mary Ryan, assistant secretary for consular affairs and head of the State Department team. "I guess we know they did want to die, flying around in the ocean until they ran out of gas like that."
By late today, all the injured survivors except the co-pilot had left the Comoros on charter flights.
As the horror of an airline disaster turned into the grind of salvage operations, the scene of the crash seemed increasingly bizarre. The beach -- one of the small stretches of white sand on this island of lava flow -- was cordoned off for the work, so guests in bikinis gawked from the hotel side and a large crowd of locals gawked from the public end. When the guests strolled too close, Comoran soldiers politely shooed them away. When the locals edged in, the soldiers would lunge at them, waving nightsticks, until the crowd broke and fled up the sand.
Rescuers had criticized police crowd control on the day of the crash, when the beach and road were so packed with people that some victims could not be treated quickly.
Meanwhile, 200 Comorans wading in the shallow water atop a coral reef 500 yards offshore were definitely having fun, looting the plane's skeleton without any police pestering. Women with their heads wrapped in bright Indian scarves were sifting the white sand between the beds of sea urchins. After some shiny buttons that probably came from a crew jacket were found, they were hoping for gold, they said.
But they were settling for flotsam. Jimba Mgondidi proudly carried off the volume control from an armrest, its wires still dangling. "Souvenir," he said. Another man had an oxygen cylinder. A third balanced a piece of aileron on his head.
One who gave only his first name, Selemano, was hanging off the side of a massive jet engine, sawing away at its Rolls-Royce innards with a kitchen knife, yanking out expensive connectors and piping like a mad surgeon.
"I'm a mechanic," he said. "I use it for bush taxi."
The Comoros -- volcanic islands with little fertile soil where huts of palm fronds rise from foundations of lava brick -- are the poor relations of the Seychelles, Maldives, Mauritius and other Indian Ocean islands now frequented by South African and European tourists. In a country where the gross domestic product is about $527 a year per person, fishermen with outrigger pirogues were suddenly making $12 a trip taking tourists to gawk at the scene on the reef.
"Usually, I fish at night, with a hand line," said one of them, who would give only his "business name" -- Bababoshe, meaning "Beach Father. "I catch barracuda, wahoo, tuna, and sell in village."
He was making extra money today.

HEADLINE: Cisneros Tells St. Petersburg To Heal Scars

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Wrapping up a three-day visit to St. Petersburg, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said today that any lasting solution to the problems that led to two recent racial disturbances in that city would hinge on effectively addressing the "historic tension" between black residents and the police.
Mr. Cisneros visited St. Petersburg as leader of a Federal task force set up to help the city recover from the two riots. He said the group, which met with city leaders and residents, would recommend that the Clinton Administration pump about $20 million in Federal money into the city for minority business loans, job training, housing redevelopment and neighborhood crime-fighting programs. The recommendation would need President Clinton's approval. 
 Mr. Cisneros said the Federal effort, which came at the request of Mayor David J. Fischer, should in no way be characterized as papering over problems by doling out Federal dollars, or as a reward for disruptive behavior. "Rather," he said in a conference call with reporters, "it is an attempt to apply meaningful Federal resources to longstanding problems in the community."
Mr. Cisneros said that the Administration was committed to helping St. Petersburg and that his plans to leave office in January would not affect that aid. He said the Department of Housing and Urban Development would assign a coordinator to oversee of the Federal response.
But any meaningful change, he said, must start in St. Petersburg with relations between the police and black residents.
The Secretary said that during his visit, he talked to a cross-section of the city's black residents -- young professionals, elderly women, religious leaders -- who all complained of police mistreatment and offered emotional descriptions of "the indignities they endured."
Mr. Cisneros said he found the consensus among such a wide group of people to be unusual.
But just as "stunning," he said, was that in talks with white city leaders, many seemed to be unaware of the grievances.
"Clearly, this is a community where people need to learn to talk to each other," he said.
Racial unrest erupted last month in St. Petersburg, a city of about 245,000 residents, after a white police officer fatally shot a black teen-ager in a traffic stop, and again earlier this month when a grand jury ruled that the shooting was justified. The Department of Justice is investigating the shooting, and the United States Commission on Civil Rights has scheduled hearings in December to review race relations in the city, whose population is 19 percent black.
Although St. Petersburg officials say blacks have reached representative numbers on city boards and commissions and in the rank-and-file of the police department, economic inequities and complaints about police treatment have been persistent, simmering problems in the mostly black southern part of the city.
St. Petersburg hit one of its lowest points in 1992, when a black city manager dismissed the white police chief after the chief had canceled cultural diversity classes for officers and had been widely accused of insensitivity to minorities.
The current Chief, Darrel W. Stephens, has stepped up community policing efforts and tried to ease the racial discord inside and outside the department since he was hired in 1993. Although Mr. Cisneros said Chief Stephens, who is white, was making "good progress," the challenge was in evidence recently when the chief had to order an internal investigation shortly after the second riot because someone in his department sketched two racially offensive drawings of the teen-ager killed by the white officer.
St. Petersburg officials and civic leaders said they welcomed the Federal involvement with hope, particularly because the task force had called for the creation of a community advisory group to offer its views on whatever was done.

HEADLINE: A $7.7 Billion Union of Gas, Electricity

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Duke Power Company, one of the nation's largest electric utilities, and the Panenergy Corporation, one of the biggest natural gas companies, said yesterday that they would merge in a $7.7 billion stock swap, creating a marketing juggernaut to sell power and other services nationwide.
Unlike most other combinations in the utility industry, which have been driven by the need to save money and extend companies' service areas, the merger between Duke and Panenergy is intended to create a huge network to market natural gas and electricity as states open their utility markets to competition. 
 Under the merger agreement, Panenergy stockholders would receive 1.0444 shares of Duke Power for each share of Panenergy.
The deal would combine fast-growing marketing subsidiaries from the two companies with the goal of providing customers with one-stop shopping for all their power needs and eventually managing energy use to save money.
Customers' ability to bypass their local utilities and buy directly from a marketer has grown rapidly in natural gas, but is only beginning with electricity.
Units such as Panenergy Trading and Market Services, which has teamed up with Mobil Oil to become one of the nation's largest natural gas marketers, are building a valuable base of customers like fast-food chains and retail stores.
As the electricity market is opened to competition -- California, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, for example, will allow customers to begin choosing their suppliers in the next few years -- major producers of low-cost power like Duke will benefit.
While Duke has built up its own marketing subsidiary, the Duke Energy Group, and maintains a partnership with Louis Dreyfus Electric Power, it does not have the long experience and customer base in the freewheeling and risky field of selling as Panenergy does.
Utilities like Duke that have operated as regulated monopolies have found it hard to make the transition to a free market.
"The model that has been developed in the gas industry in the last decade will be the model for the electric industry," Richard B. Priory, the president and chief operating officer of Duke, said in an interview. "The management team at Panenergy will be helpful to point the way in electricity deregulation."
Under the deal, first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Priory will become chairman and chief executive of the Duke Energy Corporation, as the merged company will be known.
As marketers have geared up to sell natural gas in states like New Jersey and New York, which are among the dozen that have opened their gas utilities to competition, subsidiaries of gas utilities or producers and pipeline companies have often emerged as the big winners.
Paul M. Anderson, president and chief executive of Panenergy, which operates 37,000 miles of gas pipeline handling about 15 percent of the gas consumed in the country, said his company had found it highly advantageous to have a pipeline system and its own supplies and storage. "You have more certainty over prices and guaranteeing delivery," he said, adding that this was an important consideration to big commercial and industrial customers.
Mr. Anderson will become president and chief operating officer of Duke Energy, which will have its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., where Duke now has it headquarters. Panenergy will continue to run its pipeline operations from Houston.
Another area where the two companies will expand is in building power plants overseas, a fast-growing field where some American utilities have become successful competitors.
William H. Grigg, Duke Power's chairman and chief executive, predicted that shareholders would see the operating income of the new company grow by $225 million by the year 2000. Mr. Grigg will retire when the merger is completed.
The new company's board would have 18 members -- 11 from Duke Power and 7 from Panenergy.
Duke serves about 1.8 million customers in North and South Carolina and operates 3 nuclear power plants, 8 coal-fired generating stations and 38 hydroelectric dams.
Mr. Priory said Duke would be in the market to pick up some of the many power plants that are being spun off by other utilities, notably in California, where the state, as part of deregulation, has asked utilities to sell about 50 percent of their generating capacity.
The reaction of the stock market to the deal was mixed. Duke Power shares fell $1.75 yesterday, closing at $46.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Standard & Poor's put Duke on credit watch since the combined company could be weaker financially because of an increase in debt. S.& P. also said, however, that the merger would enhance the competitive position of both companies.
The shares of Panenergy rose $1.75, closing at $44, also on the New York Stock Exchange.

Big Philippine Gas Deal
MANILA, Nov. 25 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The Philippine units of Occidental Petroleum and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group will spend $5 billion to tap the Philippines' largest natural gas reservoir and use the fuel to run power plants.
According to the agreement announced here today at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Occidental and Shell plan to spend $2 billion to develop the offshore Camago-Malampaya field and build a pipeline to Luzon, the main Philippine island. Shell and Occidental's agreement is with the state-owned National Power Corporation.
"The development of the vast natural gas resources in Camago-Malampaya will drastically change the country's overall energy outlook for the next 30 years," said Guido Delgado, president of the state utility.
An Occidental vice president, Carlos Contreras, said about $3 billion more would be pumped in to convert a mothballed nuclear power plant and to build a gas-fired installation. Another group will build a second power plant.
Shell and Occidental, equal partners in the joint venture, discovered the Camago-Malampaya field off Palawan island in 1989. It contains 2.7 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves and may hold 3.4 trillion cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Dalai Lama Movie Imperils Disney's Future in China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company is planning on a big future in China: The appetite for animated features like "The Lion King" seems limitless, sales of merchandise at Disney-owned "Mickey's Corner" stores are growing fast, and Disney's president, Michael Ovitz, has traveled here repeatedly this year to discuss the possibility of opening a Disney theme park in southern China.
And Disney, like most other foreign businesses operating in the huge and growing China market, has been willing to follow China's imperative that politics be kept out of the movies, books and toys it sells here. 
 But Disney has suddenly learned the hidden perils of entering a country that takes its politics so seriously, and the company now faces an agonizing dilemma. Its grand plans for expansion here have been thrown into doubt because of a movie being co-produced by a Disney subsidiary that is not being made in China and is not even intended for distribution in China.
The Chinese authorities warned Walt Disney executives recently that the studio's role in a major film about the life of the Dalai Lama that is now being shot in Morocco by the director Martin Scorsese would force China to reconsider Disney's extensive plans for investment in China's entertainment market.
Few issues have been touchier for the Chinese than their country's control of Tibet, a policy that has been condemned as repressive by human rights advocates. A Chinese official explained the Government's position that anything portraying the situation in Tibet from the point of view of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan religious leader, is unacceptable.
"We are resolutely opposed to the making of this movie," said Kong Min, an official at the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Radio Film and Television. "It is intended to glorify the Dalai Lama, so it is an interference in China's internal affairs."
Disney executives now face an alarming choice: jeopardize the huge business potential in China or capitulate to pressure on a creative issue, one involving a renowned director and a cause supported by a number of movie stars, led by Richard Gere, as well as human rights advocates around the world.
Disney executives, whose Asia-Pacific operations are based in Hong Kong, declined to comment today. Some people familiar with the Western film business in China said they had a hard time imagining that Disney would jeopardize its vast potential for sales in China to take a stand on one film.
"You can't ask an American company to ignore its very treasured freedom of expression, unless it affects other business worth hundreds of millions of dollars," said William A. Brent, publisher of China Entertainment Network in Beijing and an adviser to American media companies in China.
But if the company were to bow to the pressure and withdraw from involvement in the film, which is nearly finished shooting, its reputation could be damaged.
The movie, titled "Kundun," is about the life of the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of Tibet whom the Chinese authorities regard as an enemy to their control over the Himalayan region. It is being co-produced by Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Refuge Productions.
Mr. Kong, the Chinese official, said the director of the Film Bureau, Liu Jianzhong, traveled to the United States in October and told a senior Disney executive that China would be unhappy if the film was made, making it clear that other business could be affected.
As to precisely what China might do to Disney, Mr. Kong said it was too early to discuss specific measures.
"We're not sure how to answer this question yet," he said. "We have to discuss it with the Foreign Ministry and other relevant departments."
Disney has enormous ambitions in China. Mr. Ovitz, the company's president, has traveled here repeatedly this year to discuss its growing array of business plans, including a Disney World-type theme park as well as the further sale of Disney merchandise and release of films. The stakes are high; "The Lion King" was one of the biggest-grossing movies in China last year.
The story of Tibet in the middle of this century seems like a natural for Hollywood, with a gripping political drama, striking Himalayan landscape and a charismatic central figure in the Dalai Lama, who resisted China's growing control in the 1950's and finally fled to India in 1959.
A second Tibet feature now being filmed, in South America, is Columbia Pictures' "Seven Years in Tibet," directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and starring Brad Pitt in the lead role of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who broke Tibet's veil of secrecy by venturing there in the 1940's and becoming the Dalai Lama's personal tutor.
Asked whether the Film Bureau had contacted Columbia about "Seven Years in Tibet," Mr. Kong said he had not heard of the film.
"Is this a feature or a documentary?" he asked. "Maybe we should talk to them, too."
China's position will be the same for all Hollywood studios, he added.
Mr. Brent, the media company adviser, notes that the warning to Disney comes as China is trying to exert strict control over its film, television, newspaper and publishing businesses. Economic growth in China has meant loosened government control over most businesses and more exposure to information from overseas, and the authorities seem nervous about losing control over the media.
Led by the Minister of Propaganda, Ding Guangen, a campaign to stress "politics at every level" this year has instructed editors, studio heads and publishers to toe the Communist Party line in all manner of topics.
At the same time, Chinese leaders fear that allowing Disney and other studios into China too fully would undermine their own state-run film industry, which is having an increasingly hard time staying solvent.
China's position is that Tibet is historically a part of China that has periodically enjoyed greater or lesser amounts of autonomy through the centuries. Many exiled Tibetans argue that the land was traditionally independent.
Chinese officials proudly point to the hospitals and schools they have built in Tibet, and denigrate the closed and brutally elite nature of Tibetan society before the Chinese Army arrived in 1951. But human rights groups say China has sought to destroy Tibetan culture, and the Chinese have been largely unable to melt the adulation for the Dalai Lama among many ordinary Tibetans, who revere him as a god and a king.
Orville Schell, an American writer who is writing a book about American perceptions of Tibet, said that if the feature films attracted popular attention, it would inevitably fuel popular concern over human rights abuses in China.
"There's a building groundswell of interest in Tibet which is going to break like surf on the beach," said Mr. Schell, author of several books about China. "I don't know how the Chinese are going to handle it."
Undoubtedly, Chinese officials will use whatever leverage they can muster, whether or not they actually have to carry out their threats.
Cui Tiankai, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said Hollywood studies should know that while they have the freedom to make whatever movies they want, anything perceived to be "anti-China" is likely to have consequences on the studios' efforts to do business here.
As Mr. Brent put it: "The Chinese have absolutely no ground to stand on, except that they have all the leverage. And they're very good at using it."

We Can't Do Business, the Dons Tell a Big Donor

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: OXFORD, England

 BODY:
What university would turn down a gift of $34 million for a new business school? Hardly any -- except, that is, Oxford, the oldest university in the English-speaking world.
The dons of Oxford, to which the bright and the well born have flocked since the 12th century, recently said no to the money of Wafic Said, a Saudi billionaire of Syrian origin. 
 The Daily Telegraph, a conservative newspaper, called the 259-to-214 vote against the offer, among dons who came to a meeting about the issue on Nov. 5, elitist bias against business. It is, it said, "an old British disease that lies behind much of our industrial decline into not-so-genteel poverty."
Opponents of the project to build a "world-class School of Business Management" at a cost of $64 million -- the university would raise the rest of the money -- said it was a triumph for "the historical values of the university." A campus newspaper, The Cherwell, reflecting a widespread approval of the vote among students, published a banner headline "Dons Whack Wafic."
The two camps are gearing up for a new battle over the issue. The university is resubmitting the proposal to a wider congregation of dons -- 3,200 academics -- who are to vote by mail early next year. Between now and then, the lobbying is certain to be furious.
In conversations all over the university's colleges, it was clear that the issue is not so much business studies -- which already exist at Oxford -- but enshrining business management in a majestic new school destined, as Oxford administrators assert, to become a major center for management research in Europe.
"Things move slowly around here," said Yoav Harel, 26, a Canadian graduate student who came here this year to study business. "Intellectual debate on whether business is a legitimate pursuit of knowledge has been settled a long time ago everywhere else."
Business schools in the United States graduate some 80,000 Master of Business Administration students a year. By contrast, Oxford will graduate its first class of 49 M.B.A. students this year.
Mr. Harel and his colleagues are stuck on the second floor of the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford's old hospital, which is the only space Oxford has for them. The new school, which would be named for Mr. Said, would be palatial by comparison.
The debate over Mr. Said's offer has focused on issues of business education, not on his construction business or his nationality. Irritated by the vote rejecting his donation, Mr. Said, who made much of his money-making deals between British businesses and the Saudis, said, "One of the driving forces behind America's economic strength has been a close relationship between industry and universities and especially prestigious business schools."
That, precisely, is a notion viewed with suspicion at the colleges of Oxford.
The Saudi businessman, who has been giving $160,000 a year to Oxford for several years, said his offer was good until February. He vowed to persist -- despite a chorus of criticism in the Arab world of his "misplaced generosity" -- because, he said, Britain "has been good to me and my family."
Indeed, the question of whether Oxford will have its School of Business Management is far from settled.
If it does, the administration will probably choose a site for the school other than the 400-yard-long field in the center of Oxford that Mr. Said proposed. Opponents noted that it is a sole remaining patch of grass there, framed by unattractive science buildings and two roads jammed with cars. They revived an unwritten commitment, made by the administration 30 years ago, not to build on it.
But the basic obstacle comes down to persuading a majority of academics in this rarefied intellectual atmosphere that there is nothing unwholesome about a business education. Everyone readily admits that it is an uphill fight.
Maurice Lubbock, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, acknowledged half-jokingly that the whole point of an Oxford education has been precisely to teach people to "do without the kind of money" they would earn with an M.B.A. Prevailing views, he and others said, are that education should prepare people for public service, not profit.
Kenneth King, director of the Emerging Markets division of Kleinwort Benson, a huge investment firm in London, said: "Most British institutions are not going to worship an M.B.A. Unlike Wall Street, this is not, yet, a major qualification to enter into business."
Prof. Colin Mayer, acting director of the tiny School of Management Studies, for which the new headquarters would be destined, said, "The horror comes from people who see that business education is all about how to make a half a million in six months.
"What motivates us is the intellectual aspect of the subject, the sociology and psychology of business. We believe this school is well placed to build on Oxford, and that is why we want it in the heart of Oxford."
That is not good enough, argues Alexander Murray, a professor of medieval history, who wants the school and the aura of wealth that surrounds business far away from the pure heart of Oxford. He has emerged as the leading voice in the opposition.
"I want to serve the truth above all things, to demand no more than a reasonable salary, to seek cooperation with colleagues rather than competition," he wrote in a widely publicized essay this month in an Oxford publication.
But Prof. Anthony Hopwood, deputy director of the existing School of Management Studies, said that with the globalization of the world economy, such arguments amount to an abandonment of academic responsibility.
Since business has become the most powerful institution of the 20th century, Professor Hopwood said, "can it seriously be argued that we should be any less interested in its workings than we were in the church, the monarchy or government in previous generations?"

HEADLINE: At Asian Meeting, Support for Free Trade

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Tuesday, Nov. 26

 BODY:
President Clinton persuaded the leaders of 17 other Asian-Pacific nations on Monday to endorse efforts to "substantially eliminate" tariffs on computers and other information technologies by the year 2000 as the next step in breaking down barriers among America's biggest trading partners.
In their final declaration after a two-day meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, known as APEC, at the former American naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines, the leaders endorsed a process that American officials hope will lead to zero tariffs on most technology products by the turn of the century. 
 The meeting on Monday was the centerpiece of the President's 12-day trip from Hawaii to Australia to the Philippines and on to Thailand, and the President pronounced the agreement "a big deal."
The leaders' agreement was nonbinding, but it could give the countries a new impetus to reach a binding agreement to begin phasing out tariffs.
Further action could occur as early as the first meeting of the 123-nation World Trade Organization in Singapore about two weeks from now.
More than 80 percent of global trade in information technology occurs among the APEC member nations, which account for 50 percent of the goods and services produced in the world. Technology products are a $1.8 trillion economic sector worldwide, with global trade amounting to $500 billion a year, fueling perhaps 200,000 export-related jobs in the United States alone.
The agreement fell just short of the flat-out declaration of support for zero tariffs that Mr. Clinton had hoped for, instead allowing member nations enough flexibility to continue protection measures on a few products, which virtually all of them, including Washington, want to do. Individual exceptions would have to be negotiated case by case at the World Trade Organization.
But American officials said Mr. Clinton's polite arm-twisting at meetings with the leaders on Sunday had left the agreement stronger than what might have been expected from such a diverse group of nations, some of which have tariffs on computer technology roughly 20 times as high as those of the United States, which are minimal.
For example, the officials noted that the draft agreed to by APEC foreign ministers last week contained no specified target date.
"Thanks to the President and others, we now have a firm date," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs.
If the conference produced nothing like the "thrilla in Manilla" that Mr. Clinton gently joked it might be in an interview before he left Washington, it amounted an international equivalent of the sort of modest, small-bore domestic programs that Mr. Clinton successfully campaigned on in the election this year.
In a brief appearance at the United States Embassy in Manila on Monday night, Mr. Clinton said computer and information products are "at the core of America's competitiveness."
"These products are to the 21st century what highways and railroads were to the 19th century, or in my recent language, they are a big part of that bridge we have to build to the future," he said. "Imagine if we went to zero tariffs in the entire world what that would mean to America in more exports and higher-paying jobs."
As the meeting began on Monday morning, President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines, chewing on an unlit cigar, welcomed the leaders to Subic, a onetime Spanish outpost that was captured in a Philippine-American operation in the Spanish-American War in 1898 and later became an important American naval base. The base closed in 1992 and is now undergoing conversion to civilian use as a special economic zone.
In keeping with the tradition of these summit gatherings, all the leaders at the Manila meeting wore a typical local costume, in this case a barong tagalog, the traditional Filipino shirt of beige silk and pina fiber, hand-embroidered in the province of Laguna.
The garment is lovely, but not especially suited to Mr. Clinton's husky middle-American frame, and he seemed at times to be wearing a very elegant straitjacket.
Mr. Clinton, alone among the leaders, was tall enough to have room for embroidered bamboo trees on his shirt, which fit him much better than the batik shirt the leaders wore in Indonesia two years ago. At that session, the President's shirt had to be retailored at the last minute beause it was too small.
Asked if he liked the shirt issued in the Philippines, Mr. Clinton said, "I think it's good; it's cool and airy, very nice."

HEADLINE: 100,000 Serbs Take to Streets Against Milosevic

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 25

 BODY:
More than 100,000 jeering demonstrators hurled eggs at the state-run television headquarters, blocked city streets for more than eight hours and roared their approval when opposition leaders vowed to shut Belgrade down until the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, was removed from power.
The largest anti-Government demonstration here in five years was staged to denounce a decision to invalidate opposition election victories in 33 local council seats because of unspecified "irregularities." 
 Leaders of the opposition coalition, Zajedno, called on their followers tonight to carry out the kind of sustained daily street gatherings that began in Prague in 1989 and eventually brought down the Communist Government there.
If the protests, which are also taking place in other cities, continue, the oppositon could force President Milosevic to use force to clear city streets, Western diplomats said. That would sharply step up -- or abruptly end -- the growing confrontation with the Government.
But either way, if Mr. Milosevic resorts to violence, his effort to rehabilitate his image with the United States and Europe is likely to suffer serious damage.
He began that campaign by accepting the role of representing the Bosnian Serbs at the Dayton peace negotiations last year and lending his support to the accord that was reached. Because of his assistance, especially in the latter part of the war, the Clinton Administration has been reluctant to challenge him.
But his own people have shown no such reticence. "The mood in the streets is very angry, very hostile," said Zoran Ziukovic, a leader of the opposition. "We are going through what Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Poland went through six years ago.
"In those countries the fall of the Soviet Union saw the collapse of the Communist system. In Yugoslavia we hung on because Milosevic astutely switched from Communist to nationalist rhetoric. Now he is being unmasked, not only because of these elections, but because of empty stomachs. It only remains now to see what kind of a revolution this will become."
There were some signs that the protests were spreading, especially when students decided to take over university buildings. But the Government, which has barred the state-run press from covering the demonstrations, said the protests would not interfere with plans to press ahead with a final round of local voting, which the opposition plans to boycott, on Wednesday.
The protests are the largest since 1991, when Mr. Milosevic announced his decision to go to war against republics seceding from Yugoslavia.
Now, Mr. Milosevic dominates what remains of Yugoslavia -- Serbia and tiny Montenegro. Mr. Milosevic's reputation for autocratic rule, culminating in his flagrant dismissal of the opposition victory, has proved too much for many people.
The state-run press has the difficult job of trying to dismiss the protests as insignificant and yet present them as jeopardizing law and order. The press quoted Ivan Markovic, the editor of Radio Yugoslavia, who attacked the protesters for fomenting "disorder, aggression and terrorism."
Although tens of thousands of protesters trapped television reporters and editors inside their offices for hours this afternoon as eggs splattered against the windows, the event was never mentioned on the air.
Many in the opposition say the President, who has presided over a deteriorating economy and turned his country, for the duration of the war, into an international pariah, may have gone too far.
"The decision to steal the local elections was the final straw for many Serbs," said Zoran Djindjic, one of the opposition leaders, as he prepared to move onto a balcony overlooking tens of thousands of boisterous supporters. "The regime pushed too far. There were many who were prepared to let Milosevic keep power for himself but hoped that the opposition would take control in some of the cities.
"His decision to discard the fig leaf of elections that helped cloak his dictatorship may prove to be his biggest mistake. Now we know that removing him by democratic methods will be impossible."
The crowd, which included large numbers of students and retired people, was spirited and often boisterous to the point of making lewd suggestions directed at the President. Many waved Serbian flags, blew whistles and sang.
Mr. Djindjic told the crowd: "This is no longer an election rally or a protest rally. This is a democratic revolution that Serbia has been waiting 50 years for."
The crowd, in response, chanted: "Serbia has risen! Serbia has risen!"
"Milosevic cannot fool anyone now," said Miroslava Mandic, 36, a bank employee who stood in a crush of people near the television building. "He has cheated us once too often."
When the polling ended eight days ago, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party conceded that it had lost control of the city councils in industrial cities and towns across Serbia, including Belgrade. But the Government-run electoral commissions appointed by the President swiftly annulled the results in almost all of the districts won by the opposition bloc.
Few expect the President to go down without a fight. When confronted with citywide protests in 1991, he called out tanks to secure Belgrade's streets. The deployment resulted in at least two deaths. Opposition leaders hinted darkly today that the crowds might have to be ready to confront violence.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 29, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about anti-Government protests in Serbia misstated President Slobodan Milosevic's public stance on the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia in 1991. Although Serbia was instrumental in the Yugoslav military response to the secession of Croatia and Slovenia, Mr. Milosevic never formally announced a decision to go to war to oppose the breakup.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Swiss and French Francs Fall, Aiding a Rally in the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher yesterday, strengthening after Switzerland's biggest bank reported a large loss and two influential French officials called for a weaker French franc.
The gains built on the dollar's strength from a day earlier, when it advanced broadly on a large selloff in the German mark because of renewed optimism that Europe's plan for a single currency will proceed as scheduled in 1999. Italy's weekend readmission to the European exchange rate stabilization system after a two-year absence was the catalyst for that optimism. 
 "We've seen a turnaround in the dollar," said Jim Powers, vice president of foreign exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landes Bank in New York. "It's caught a lot of people leaning the wrong way."
The dollar rose to 1.5244 marks, from 1.5230 marks on Monday. The dollar also advanced against the Swiss franc, French franc and Italian lira. The British pound, though, rose slightly to $1.6714 from $1.6686.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar ended slightly lower at 112.47 yen, from 112.63 yen.
Traders traced part of the dollar's strength yesterday to a selloff in the Swiss franc, which declined to its weakest level against the dollar since early January 1995. The dollar was quoted at 1.2913 Swiss francs in New York, up from 1.2877 Monday.
The Swiss franc declined after the Union Bank of Switzerland, the nation's biggest bank, announced a revamping and a projected 1996 loss of 500 million francs.
The news was seen as further evidence of the poorly performing Swiss economy and the likelihood that interest rates in Switzerland will not rise anytime soon.
The dollar's advance against the French franc was spurred by calls for a weakening of the franc against the dollar by a Bank of France official as well as by the former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who is now head of the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee. The dollar ended at 5.1706 French francs, up from 5.1550.
In a radio address, he said he would like to see the dollar around 5.50 francs. A few hours later, the central bank official, Paul Marchelli, suggested the franc was 10 percent overvalued against the dollar.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hails Thais in Visit At Conclusion Of Asia Trip

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 26

 BODY:
President Clinton ended his 12-day Asia-Pacific trip today with a 24-hour state visit to this kingdom of glittering temples, teeming waterways and bustling economic development, honoring the 50th anniversary of the reign of its American-born, saxophone-playing King, Bhumibol Adulyadej.
In a speech at a major university and a state dinner at the storybook Grand Palace on the Chao Phraya River, Mr. Clinton celebrated the longstanding Thai-American military alliance. 
 He also witnessed the signing of a treaty intended to end double taxation on American companies doing business here and basked in the ebullient reception accorded the first American President to visit Thailand since Richard M. Nixon in 1969.
"The United States and Thailand, for all the distance and differences between us, share a common vision -- the dream of an Asia-Pacific region where economic growth and democratic ideals are advancing steadily and reinforcing one another," Mr. Clinton told an afternoon audience at Chulalongkorn University, named for the 19th-century modernizing monarch best known to Americans as the little Crown Prince in "The King and I."
As he wrapped up a three-nation swing across the Pacific rim, Mr. Clinton also praised the Thai Government for its cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.
Mr. Clinton's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, retired, preceded him here for talks with his Thai counterparts aimed at fostering increased interdiction efforts.
"In all your work in this area," the President said, "Thailand is sending a clear message to drug lords: We will fight you. We are determined to stop you. And America has a clear signal to Thailand: We will stand with you all the way."
Mr. Clinton also met with the recently defeated Prime Minister, Banharn Silpa-archa, and with his successor-to-be, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and received assurances of the Government's willingness to press forward with legislation favored by the United States, chiefly a law to prevent money laundering and another to protect patents, American officials said.
The First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, arrived in Thailand a day earlier than the President, offering a serious message of her own. She visited former child prostitutes dying of AIDS and praised the Thai Government for enacting a law providing jail terms for owners, agents and families who exploit children for prostitution.
"Expanding educational opportunity for children, curbing the spread of AIDS and ending the exploitation of young girls in the commercial sex industry will not only help individual Thai girls and their families, but Thai society as a whole," Mrs. Clinton said in a speech at Chiang Mai University in northern Thailand.
But the Clintons' visit was mostly an occasion to celebrate the anniverary of the ascension of King Bhumibol, who is the world's longest-reigning monarch. The city is flooded with golden decorations commemorating the popular King's rule, and his 69th birthday on Dec. 5.
The King, who was born in Cambridge, Mass., when his father was studying at Harvard Medical School, is an amateur scientist and environmentalist -- and a prize-winning composer whose skill on the saxophone is widely regarded.
"You know, he's been a very constructive influence in his country, and he loves jazz music," Mr. Clinton told reporters on the flight here from Manila on Monday night. Tonight the President brought the King a series of vintage black-and-white photographs by Herman Leonard of jazz musicians from the 1930's.
From the moment King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit met the Clintons at Don Muang Airport in a pale yellow Rolls-Royce on Monday evening, the visit has been one grand spectacle after another in this sprawling city where dozens of new skyscrapers under construction share space with 300 Buddhist temples, crowded markets, crooked byways and steaming canals.
Tonight the central courtyard of the Grand Palace was aglow with thousands of tiny white lights in topiary trees as the couples filed into a French-style dinner of foie gras in aspic, roasted veal and vegetables from the royal garden.
This morning Mr. Clinton witnessed the signing of a tax treaty by William Itoh, the American Ambassador, and Amnuay Virawan, the outgoing Thai Foreign Minister.
The treaty, which was under negotiation for 15 years, specifies the circumstances under which various kinds of income derived by residents of one country may be taxed by the other. American companies in Thailand pressed hard for the measure, because they have been at a competitive disadvantage with other multinational companies that have already concluded such treaties. It now goes to the Senate for ratification.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Hughes Signs Up to Launch Satellites on Japan Rockets

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Japan's fledgling effort to develop a space business received a major boost today as the Hughes Electronics Corporation became the first company to sign up to launch commercial satellites on a Japanese rocket now under development.
Hughes said it would use a new version of Japan's H-II rocket for 10 launchings over a five-year period starting in 2000. There are also options for an additional 5 to 10 launchings, according to Hiroshi Imamura, executive vice president of the Rocket System Corporation, the Japanese company handling the launchings. 
 Mr. Imamura also said today that his Tokyo-based company was close to receiving an order for 10 launchings plus options from Space Systems/ Loral, a unit of Loral Space and Communications.
Rocket System -- which is financed by 73 Japanese corporations, including the Mitsubishi Corporation, NEC, Nissan and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries -- was formed to market the H-II rocket, which was developed by Japan's space agency.
But until now there have been doubts that anyone would use Japan's rockets because the cost of a launching has been about twice as much as that of competitors like Lockheed Martin and Arianespace.
The Hughes order, which a Hughes official said could be worth as much as $1 billion, and a Loral order, believed to be of a similar magnitude, could start erasing those doubts.
Exact financial terms of the Hughes contract, which was signed on Monday in Los Angeles, were not disclosed. But it appears that by ordering so many rockets so far in advance, Hughes was able to get a good deal from the Japanese company, which is anxious to establish its credibility.
The National Space Development Agency of Japan is aiming for costs of about $75 million a launching with the new version of the H-II, which will be called the H-IIA. But Mr. Imamura suggested that Hughes would pay less than that.
Donald L. Cromer, chairman of Hughes Space and Communications International, a division of Hughes that builds communications satellites, said in a statement that the terms of the deal were "very competitive."
Hughes, based in Los Angeles and a division of the General Motors Corporation, also called the contract a "continuation of our partnership with Japan." That suggested that one reason for its order was to maintain relations so that Japan would continue to buy its satellites. Hughes, along with Japanese partners, is also preparing to start a Japanese version of its DirecTV service, which transmits digital television from satellites to homes.
The new contract is the latest effort by Hughes, which is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial communications satellites, to drive down launching costs by arranging bulk deals to use still undeveloped rockets. It has signed similar contracts with McDonnell Douglas for its Delta III and with the Sea Launch venture led by the Boeing Company, which plans to use a Russian rocket to launch from an offshore platform.
Despite its general technical prowess, Japan has never been a power in space. It did not launch its first satellite until 1970, a year after the United States landed on the moon.
But it has been hoping to change that with the H-II, the first Japanese rocket able to hoist large communications satellites used for television and telephone service into geosynchronous orbit, about 22,000 miles above the earth.
The rocket, developed at a cost of about $2.4 billion, was also the first to be built using exclusively Japanese technology. Previous generations of rockets had relied on technology bought or licensed from the United States.
The H-II made its maiden flight in 1994 and has so far proven reliable in the four times it has been used to launch government satellites. But the cost for a launching of 19 billion yen, or about $170 million, is twice as high as the going rate.
To cut that cost in half, the new H-IIA, scheduled to be finished by 2000, will have a simplified design and will use less expensive imported parts, even if that means diverging somewhat from the goal of using only Japanese technology.
Japan's space agency has another problem. Because of opposition from fishermen near its launching site on Tanegashima island in southern Japan, launchings have been restricted to a 45-day period in winter and a 45-day period in summer. That has allowed only two H-II rockets at most to be launched each year, meaning that Hughes's order alone would fill all the available launching slots over a five-year period.
To expand capacity, a second launching pad is being built and the Government is negotiating with fishermen to lengthen the season.

HEADLINE: The Mouse Makes a Stand

 BODY:
By announcing yesterday that it would go ahead with a film about the Dalai Lama despite threats from China, the Walt Disney Company demonstrated that it would not accept censorship as the price of doing business in China or anywhere else. That is a welcome stand at a moment when the American Government and American companies seem increasingly prepared to set aside important democratic principles in hopes of expanding commerce with China. China must understand that it cannot impose its repressive practices on the free global marketplace.
Like many other companies, the Disney organization has hit a lucrative bonanza in China. From Mickey Mouse to "The Lion King," Disney merchandise and movies are increasingly popular, and the company is talking about opening a theme park in China. Unrelated to all that, the movie about the Dalai Lama, who fled China when Tibet was conquered in 1959, recently went into production in Morocco, directed by Martin Scorsese. 
 Chinese authorities warned that Disney's business opportunities in China would be curtailed by the Government if the company went ahead with the movie. The Chinese warnings were especially outrageous because Disney has no plans to distribute the movie in China itself.
Tailoring movies, music and other forms of entertainment before distributing them to different audiences in different countries is common. But for Disney to have dropped a movie simply to save its business operations in China would have set a disastrous example, effectively letting Beijing dictate its own version of history to audiences beyond its shores. That kind of behavior, at the very least, is unacceptable for a country trying to become a member of the World Trade Organization, which China seeks to do.
Chinese leaders delight in lecturing Westerners that it is culturally imperialist to impose human rights standards on Beijing. Free expression and political pluralism, of course, are not a preserve of the West and are honored in some Asian countries. But the Chinese argument is now contradicted by its own insistence that it can force its peculiar form of repression on the global economic system.
Censorship seems on the rise in the world today. In the United States, self-appointed moral guardians have hectored the movie and music industries in Hollywood about tailoring content to suit their view of mainstream America. It is gratifying in the case of Chinese interference that Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman, has come down on the side of artistic freedom, albeit without any ringing statements explaining the decision.
The Disney action ought to be carefully studied by the Clinton Administration, which has just participated in an economic summit conference of Asian leaders in Manila. President Clinton was right to demand that all the countries of Asia work harder to lower trade barriers in the coming decades. The Disney episode shows that free expression is essential to the success of free markets. It should embolden the Administration to press China on human rights and other sensitive issues, even if China's leaders object. China must adjust to the dynamic world of free markets. That world does not and cannot operate by Chinese rules.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence in Economy Holds Steady

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy held steady in November, although most Americans remain optimistic about current business conditions, a private research group reported yesterday.
The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index was 107.3 this month, the same as the revised October figure. The index jumped 5 points in August and 6.9 points in July, hitting a six-year high before weakening slightly in September and October. 
 The Board's Present Situation Index, a measure of sentiment on current business conditions, rose to a seven-year high of 131 in November, up 6.4 points from October.
"Consumers are more positive about current business conditions than at any time this decade," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
"The strong level of confidence coupled with low unemployment, modest inflationary pressures and continuing wage growth should translate into healthy holiday sales in coming weeks," she said in a statement. But consumers were less optimistic about the future than they had been in October.
Consumer confidence is watched closely for indications of consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economy.
The November figures were in line with economists' expectations.
The Consumer Confidence Index, calculated from a base of 100, is derived from responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide, polling them on matters ranging from job availability to home-buying plans. The Conference Board's report comes as financial markets scour new data for signs of economic weakness and low inflation, two factors that could cause the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising interest rates at its Dec. 17 policy meeting. Today's report shows consumers are quite confident about the present economic picture, with only 13 percent of those surveyed saying current business conditions are bad.
But the outlook for the next six months was not as rosy, with only 14 percent of those surveyed expecting better business conditions ahead.
"This is telling us that the economy is moderating and it will not take off and cause the central bank to raise interest rates," said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
Interest rates fell in the inflation-sensitive bond market on the consumer confidence figures.

HEADLINE: Stock Rally Halts, With Dow Dropping 19.38

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks fell short yesterday in a late bid to extend November's surprisingly resilient rally, having recovered from a sudden wave of profit taking.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which seesawed from an early 42-point gain to a 50-point loss before steadying near midday, briefly pulled into positive territory amid some late bargain hunting, but then trailed lower to close at 6,528.41, down 19.38 points. 
 Although relatively minor, the retreat was the largest for the Dow since late October, underscoring the blue-chip barometer's almost uninterrupted ascent this month. The Dow jumped 76.03 points on Monday for its first close ever above 6,500, pushing November's advance to more than 8 percent.
Most broad stock measures ended slightly lower after rebounding from their lows, although the technology-laden Nasdaq market managed to pull higher in the last hour, padding Monday's record high.
Stocks jumped in the morning as bonds rallied on the latest economic news, sending interest rates toward their lowest level since early March.
In another sign that economic growth may be moderating enough to contain inflation without an interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve, the Conference Board research group said its Consumer Confidence Index held steady in November. The index had jumped in July and August, hitting a six-year high before weakening slightly in September and October.
Bond traders were also heartened by news that economists surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are predicting a fairly steady ride in 1997, firming hopes for continued growth with stable inflation and interest rates.
As bond prices rose yesterday morning, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a barometer of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- briefly fell near 6.36 percent from 6.42 percent on Monday.
With investors nervously awaiting what many analysts consider an inevitable pullback after such a sharp advance in stocks and bonds, the early spurt set off a round of profit taking. As bonds fell, the long bond's yield rose to 6.44 percent, pressuring stocks. But as usual, the drop was viewed as a buying opportunity for those with cash on the sidelines.
"Investors are very nervous, and that's reflected in the action of the market," said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at the IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis. "They're afraid not to be in it, but scared to be in it. One hour they're more afraid than greedy, the next hour they're more greedy than afraid."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.07 points, to 755.96, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.88 point, to 397.98.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.83, to 1,281.20, its second straight record finish.
The Dow's biggest decliners included many of the high-fliers of recent weeks. Caterpillar fell 2, to 78 1/8, and General Electric fell 1 3/4, to 102, while Procter & Gamble fell 1 1/2, to 109 3/8.
Walt Disney was the Dow's strongest issue, rising 2 1/2, to 76, after the company reported a 27 percent gain in quarterly profits, which beat expectations.
Deere fell 2 3/8, to 44. The company reported earnings that fell short of some expectations. Linens 'n Things Inc. was one of the most active stocks on the Big Board, with almost six million shares changing hands in its Wall Street debut. The shares rose 1/8, from the initial public offering price of 15 1/2. The company, a retailer based in Clifton, N.J., had expected the shares to be sold for between $15 and $17 each.

HEADLINE: The Japanese Money Mill Sputters;
Nation of Global Investors Isn't Venturing Too Far Now

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Tetsuo Ishii stood near a poster of Christopher Columbus, beckoning him to plunk his money into a fund that invests in America.
But Mr. Ishii, a 46-year-old chemical engineer, decided not to send his money to the New World. And he has lots of company in Japan, particularly in the cash-laden board rooms of companies and pension funds. 
 "You never know how the currency will fluctuate," Mr. Ishii said warily. "Personally, I'm not ready to accept that risk."
So Mr. Ishii's savings will not be used to lift stock prices on Wall Street, and the savings of many of his countrymen will not go to back mortgages in California or buy bonds in Massachusetts. Interest rates may be higher in America, but Mr. Ishii and many of his compatriots feel more comfortable keeping their money at home.
Mr. Ishii is part of what many financial experts say is a broad and potentially worrisome trend: Japan's role as moneybags to the world may be diminishing. In the long run, that could mean higher interest rates in the developing world and in countries like the United States that have come to rely on Japanese capital.
Financial experts are focusing on Japanese investment behavior because Japan has finally accomplished something American trade negotiators have demanded for several years. It has shrunk one of the most closely watched measures of global competition, its current account surplus, the bounty generated when exports of goods and services by Japan exceed its imports.
What does all that have to do with the price of bonds in Boston?
Except for a few years in the late 1980's when it declined, Japan's current account surplus had seemed to be made of helium, and this nation plowed its money back into investments abroad. Japan's export wave put some American workers out of jobs, but the accompanying flood of financial investments by Japan also kept American interest rates down, probably helping other Americans hang onto their jobs.
But now, some financiers are asking a crucial question: If the Japanese no longer have an expanding pile of cash or a willingness to invest overseas, could there be a shortage of capital, perhaps even a global capital squeeze?
For many economists, the answer is yes.
"It is one of the most serious problems for the world economy," said Makoto Utsumi, a business professor at Keio University and a former Finance Ministry official who negotiated financial issues with the United States. The reliance of America and other industrial countries on capital from Japan, he said, is a fundamental weakness of the global economy.
In the past, Japan swallowed nearly 40 percent of bonds sold at United States Treasury auctions; it bought chunks of American companies; it provided financing for everything from planes to trains and overall growth. Over the years, Japanese institutional money -- about $1 trillion of it -- swished through financial markets around the world.
But that infamous surplus has declined from a high of $132 billion three years ago to an expected $70 billion to $80 billion this year, economists here say. And though ups as well as downs are likely in the level of surpluses, a few even raise the possibility of a deficit in coming years.
Deficits are not inherently bad, but in this case it would mean Japan was no longer able to generate enough trade earnings to finance its growth. If it has to borrow, not only will there be less Japanese capital flowing abroad, but Japan will also be competing, perhaps with the United States, for capital from other countries.
In September, the monthly surplus dropped to 727.4 billion yen, or $6.6 billion, down 36 percent from the period last year. Likewise, investment in overseas securities, one big component of total capital flows from Japan, tumbled 93 percent, to 192 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, in the first eight months of this year. And while levels of direct investment overseas rose 40 percent in that period from the period last year, they are about half the levels of five and six years ago.
At the same time, the appetite for funds is expanding around the world. Emerging market economies need money for development, planned economies want to finance their transition to market economies and growth in most industrial countries is fairly robust. Many stock markets are at record highs, needing new investment to sustain the momentum. Many countries have gaping budget deficits. And all this must be financed.
The demand for imported capital among big countries, beyond what Japan can provide, is likely to expand in 1996 by 44 percent, to $74 billion, and even more in 1997, according to projections by Merrill Lynch.
"You can't square the market to the circle without a lot of money, and a lot of money that we've been able to get in the past is from Japan," said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist in Tokyo for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Capital Markets, referring to the need to keep up with the expanding demand for money around the world. "It's not as though they will pull it away from us. They don't have it to recycle."
To be sure, not everybody agrees that a possible shortage of savings, or capital, from Japan is a problem, so long as there are other deep pockets around. If Japan, for example, is no longer earning American dollars from trade and using them to buy Treasury Bills, Americans may hold on to the dollars themselves and use them to buy Treasuries on their own.
Still, experts worry, in part because Japanese were pretty efficient at recycling American dollars, and Japanese save much more than Americans. Last year, Japan's capital outflow exceeded the combined sum of the 14 next highest capital-exporting countries, Mr. Courtis said, and Japan's outflow was six times that of the second-largest capital exporter, Switzerland.
Japan exported about $100 billion in excess savings last year to countries like the United States, which bought more foreign products than it sold of its own. So while the United States ran a huge trade deficit, and borrowed from the Japanese to pay for it, Japan ran a current account surplus of $100 billion.
"It's not so much a risk of capital not being available, so much as capital not being available at a certain price," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist in Tokyo for Salomon Brothers Asia. "A cheap price."
No one thinks Japan's current account surplus is going to dry up overnight, and until it does, Japanese capital will still be flowing out. And with capital flowing into markets around the world, it is hard to see how a shortage will suddenly emerge to end that.
"They've had a very large decline in the surplus, but it's difficult to say that it's been an enormous detriment to overseas markets, when global markets are at all-time highs," Michael Hartnett, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said. "At the end of the day, there's been enough liquidity overseas to fund upward the value of stocks in the States."
One reason is that while Japan is likely to play a smaller role in global capital markets, some European countries may take on a greater burden, Mr. Hartnett notes. Countries in Europe, like Switzerland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, in general have growing current account surpluses and have been easing shortages by providing capital, at least to industrial nations like the United States, Britain and Canada.
Moreover, while Mr. Ishii and many other Japanese remain hesitant, some individual investors -- appalled by low interest rates at home -- are beginning to think about sending their savings abroad. The amount of outflow from individuals is rising and could swell to a total of $30 billion or more by the end of the year, as long as people like Chieko Emoto continue their financial experimentation.
Mrs. Emoto, 43, took her 21-year-old son, Akimine, to a Daiwa Securities outlet to show him how to buy foreign bonds. But she will not touch United States Treasuries or American stocks. Instead, she owns Australian securities.
"There has been less currency fluctuation for the Australian dollar," she said.
Indeed, wild currency swings and the uncertain direction of the yen are keeping many Japanese corporations and pension funds from moving into foreign securities. For instance, Matsushita Electric Industrial keeps huge sums on hand but does not invest in securities overseas -- mainly, it says, because it will not accept the foreign exchange risk.
Many life insurers and other Japanese institutional investors are still smarting from losses on dollar investments because of exchange rate movements. Since 1990, for example, the yen has zigzagged from 155 yen against the dollar to 80 in April. After that, it reversed direction and dropped to 114, partly with the fall of the current account surplus; it settled above 112 today.
As a result, the Japanese Government has been pouring some money overseas to compensate for the lack of investment by individuals and companies. But because the Government is a conservative investor, that money is going into United States Treasury bonds, not oil rigs in China or subways in Thailand.
No one knows whether Japan's current account surplus is going to continue to fall or by how much, but some say the trend may soon stop, now that the yen is much weaker. Already, the surplus may have hit bottom in April, based on monthly seasonally adjusted data, according to Mr. Feldman at Salomon Brothers, and since then, the surplus seems to be edging up.
Even if the surplus rises and is recycled overseas again, Japan's role in global capital markets may be exaggerated.
"The market is too big for anyone to influence or for there to be a major change of behavior," Mr. Feldman said. Referring to Japan's role in the market, he added, "It's overemphasized in many people's thinking."


GRAPHIC: Japan is finally beginning to buy more imported products, reducing its huge annual trade surpluses. But some economists are warning that Japan's shrinking surplus may have a downside: less money for Japan to invest abroad. The result could be a credit squeeze, leading to higher interest rates, worldwide. Though Japan's overall income is up, its exports are flat, even as Japan spends more on imports, leaving Japan less money to invest abroad, and raising the prospect of a global capital squeeze.

HEADLINE: Cairo Journal;
Egypt Adding Corn to Bread: An Explosive Mix?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
In Egypt, the word for bread and the word for life are the same: aish. And that is where things begin to get tangled.
The small loaves have a place at every Egyptian meal, scooping beans and falafel at breakfast, sopping up stewed vegetables at lunch and sharing plates at night with bits of salty white cheese. 
 But to keep bread cheap and plentiful, Egypt pays a heavy price, importing wheat from abroad and subsidizing flour at home, and it has decided to draw the line. Beginning next month, its planners have decreed, bread will be 20 percent corn.
The change has gone all but unadvertised; the Government seems to be hoping that few will notice. But in a city whose food chain begins at state-owned mills, there is worry that something basic will change.
"They'll add a little corn flour now, and then it will be 50-50, and sooner or later we will be eating a loaf with no wheat at all," complained Ahmed Ismail, a baker who gets up before dawn each morning to shape the small rounds.
Unlike the French, the Egyptians take no particular pride in their bread, a rough blend from whole-grain flour. Barely distinguishable from bakery to bakery, it is sold in tall stacks or heaped onto trays that deliverymen balance on their heads as they weave on bicycles through the Cairo traffic.
Its main virtue is price -- about a penny a loaf, one-third its real cost, thanks to $750 million a year in Government subsidies. Bread is so cheap that Egyptians are among the world's leading consumers of wheat, gobbling up nearly 400 pounds per person per year, more than three times the average rate in the United States or Europe.
But with its fertile land limited to the Nile Valley, Egypt can grow only enough wheat for about half its 60 million people. Last year alone, it had to import more than 6 million tons of wheat, most of it from the United States, and with world prices soaring, the price tag leapt to more than $1 billion.
To ease those financial strains, the Government could have chosen to cut subsidies or to cut imports. Instead, its planners decided that the most palatable solution was to transform the bread itself.
"The aim is to reach self-sufficiency," said Alaa al-Khouli, First Under Secretary of the Ministry of Supply and an architect of the plan to replace one-fifth of the wheat flour in every Government-milled sack with flour made from Egyptian corn.
In fact, officials concede, the rapid growth of Egypt's population will make it impossible for the country to reduce wheat imports. But the Government hopes at least to cap the total at its current level while using corn, which is cheaper, to help bridge the gap between what bread costs to produce and the pittance the Government asks Egyptians to pay.
Because bread remains so inexpensive, Egyptians tend to waste it, so much so that the Government a few years ago published scolding advertisements that showed goats feasting on discarded loaves.
But Egyptian officials are well aware of the link between bread and domestic discontent. At least one-third of its population live in poverty, and rely on bread for half of their calories, experts say.
The last time the Government announced an increase in the price of bread was in 1977, and then street riots forced Anwar el-Sadat, who was President at the time, to back down. Since then the Egyptian authorities have operated more subtly, introducing a higher-priced loaf in 1987 and touting its qualities while gradually making the cheaper loaf impossible to find.
In the years since, most Egyptians swear, the loaves shoveled from the ovens of state-sponsored bakeries have grown noticeably smaller.
But as soon as a price increase in Jordan last summer prompted bread riots there, the Egyptian Government quickly declared that it planned to maintain its subsidies, which for more than a decade -- despite steady inflation -- have kept the price of the simplest bread fixed at just five piasters a loaf.
"Bread is essential," said Alaa Mohammed, a clerk and the father of three who, like millions of other Cairenes, stops on the way home from work every afternoon to wait his turn at a modest bakery where men and women keep strictly to separate lines.
In some ways, Egypt has lightened the heavy hand it once imposed on the economy. It has ended subsidies on goods like soap, rice and tea, and this year it has moved rapidly to lower trade barriers and to privatize state-owned companies as part of what President Hosni Mubarak has called its decision "to join the world economy."
But nearly one-third of Egypt's economy is still in the hands of public enterprises -- including the mills that produce 80 percent of the country's bread flour. And even as delegates to an economic conference here this month were talking eagerly of the day when Egypt might look something like Singapore, one top official confided that the plan to reinvent Egyptian bread may have its roots in something closer to the old Soviet Union.
To guard against backlash, the Government plans to introduce the new flour only in phases, without telling bakers whether what they are baking is still 100 percent wheat. An experiment last winter in which the blended flour was quietly introduced in scattered neighborhoods produced few if any complaints, officials now insist.
At the United States Wheat Association, whose clients would miss out on potential new business, officials grouse that the new bread will be more prone to grow stale.
At bakeries, owners like Mohammed Iwedia say their worry is that the pockets so characteristic of Arabic bread may no longer puff properly. But whether or not the new dough is different, Mr. Iwedia said, he plans to keep right on loading it into his coal-burning oven to produce the bread that Egyptians so depend on.
"What can I do?" he said with a shrug. "I would bake anything the Government gives me, even if they ask us to bake dust."

HEADLINE: Japan May Approve the Pill, but Women May Not

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The spread of the birth control pill in the West more than three decades ago is widely regarded as a milestone in the liberation of women and a turning point in social history.
So when is the pill coming to Japan? One of these years, the Government says. 
 Japan is one of a tiny number of countries -- perhaps the only other is North Korea -- where the pill is still banned for contraceptive purposes by law. But these days, there are signs that the pill may be legalized in the next few years, perhaps even next spring, because of recent favorable technical data and declining bureaucratic resistance.
The next question is whether women will use it. For now, the answer many Japanese women offer is: Not me!
"I don't think I'll use it," said Sayuri Ogawa, 36, a gynecological nurse. "There are many other contraceptive measures. I don't mind if other people use it, but I myself don't dare."
Japanese women tend not to see the pill as an icon of feminism or of sexual liberation, but rather as an untrustworthy chemical concoction that affects the natural rhythm of their bodies. Moreover, many couples hardly discuss contraceptives, although this reticence is easing among young people, and people know little about contraceptives and are reluctant to ask doctors for such intimate advice.
In Japan the condom is the most widely used form of birth control -- the choice for contraception three-quarters of the time, according to surveys -- followed by withdrawal. When condoms fail -- for they are one of the least reliable forms of contraception -- many women turn to abortion, which is easily available here.
"Japanese women have reached a certain stage mentally, so that whether or not the pill is approved we are already making our own decisions as to whether to have a baby," said Chiemi Amano, 44, who runs an export-import company with her husband. "The approval of the pill would not be a new advancement for women."
Women obviously have a say in the making of babies, and indeed, even without the pill, many are not having them. According to World Bank figures, Japan now has 1.4 live births per woman, and this is one reason the Government has not been pushing the pill: it worries that effective contraception would lower the birthrate even more.
Another concern is AIDS and the fear that use of the pill rather than condoms would allow the disease to spread. But data indicate no higher incidence of AIDS among those who use the pill.
So an advisory council to the Ministry of Health and Welfare may recommend approval next spring, and American pharmaceutical companies like the idea of millions of Japanese women taking their product every morning.
But even if the ministry lifts the ban, there will be another battle to win over the Ms. Ogawas of Japan. While millions of women around the world take the pill for granted, in Japan the pill conjures up frightening memories, awkward feelings and a general sense of aversion.
Some remember Japan's thalidomide babies, who were born more than three decades ago with shortened arms after their mothers took sedatives to alleviate morning sickness. Some have heard about side effects that may occur with high-dosage pills, which were once used for medical purposes in Japan.
Others say not enough research has been done about the potentially serious side effects, like cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity, cervical cancer and thrombosis, a serious blood-clotting affliction.
"Since this is a male-dominated system, the side effects tend to be neglected," said Dr. Reiko Takeda, a gynecologist and hormone specialist who endorses condoms over pills. "We should not be like that. Women should study about the side effects more seriously.
"If someone has to have sex every day, like 30 times a month, in that case, a pill would be called for. As one of the choices, it is necessary. But we should avoid it as much as possible."
A medium-strength form of the pill is currently available in Japan for medical purposes, and some women are using it as a substitute for the low-dose contraceptive pill normally taken by American women.
When Mrs. Amano, who has two children, once had a gynecological problem, her doctor prescribed the pill. She took it, but vomited and felt so sick that she stopped taking it after three to four days.
"I have the image that it could be a dangerous thing because of the side effects, and I'm interested in using it," Mrs. Amano said. "But I may not have the courage to take it."
Some women worry that taking the pill would send a signal of promiscuity. And the Government had earlier resisted the pill because it thought it would promote the spread of promiscuous sex.
Indeed, for many women, the pill could upset the delicate dynamics in the relationship between Japanese men and women.
Even married women tend not to discuss contraceptives openly with their husbands, and traditional Japanese men often are used to taking the lead in the relationship, especially in sex.
Yumiko Kurita, a 43-year-old married woman who spent a year in the United States, said she was awed by the independence of American women, who made their own decisions about whether to take the pill.
"I thought they were basically different from us -- they were so independent in their lives, while we just followed our men," Mrs. Kurita said after a gynecological checkup in a clinic in Tokyo. "But even now, if I look back, I have to say, I couldn't do that."
Mrs. Kurita says she is a traditional Japanese wife, and when her husband stumbles in the door at 2 or 3 in the morning, she is up waiting to welcome him home.
Since her husband is a doctor, she is never wanting for medical advice. But when she has questions about contraceptives, she asks her gynecologist, not her husband. In fact, she says, contraception is not so essential for her anyway.
"Considering how busy my husband is, there's no danger -- I don't have to talk with him about contraceptives," she said. "He's so busy that we go for two, three months without a relationship, sometimes even six months."
Other women quietly worry that if they took they pill, they would scare away their boyfriends and offend their husbands.
"There is a feeling among men that it is intolerable that women take the lead, and if women did, it would hurt their pride -- it is the Samurai principle that men should take the lead," said Dr. Ikuko Ikeshita, who promotes the use of the pill. "The husband of one of my patients started not wanting to have sex with his wife when she started to take pills."
Doctors say some women do not even consider whether to use contraceptives, leaving the matter totally in the hands of their partner, who is not always so careful. To Dr. Ikeshita and others, that means that abortions end up becoming a dangerous form of birth control.
"Between married couples, wives often have difficulty asking their husbands to wear condoms," said Nobuko Sema, an advertising manager who formed a small informal group to support the pill. Ms. Sema, who is divorced, added half jokingly, "I told my husband very clearly my views, and that may have been the cause of our divorce."
Statistically, Japan's health care is among the world's best, with the lowest infant mortality rates and better health care coverage than is found in the United States. But only 56 percent of women of childbearing age use any form of contraception, including condoms, according to World Bank statistics, and education about sex and human reproduction is sparse or virtually nonexistent in schools.
"They teach the parts of conception, like the sperm and the egg in a flower, where the female part and the male part meet and conception occurs," said Yoshiaki Sato, a gynecologist who sometimes visits schools to give lectures on human reproduction. "But they skip the step before that, the sexual intercourse."
The Education Ministry ardently defends its reluctance to have more classroom instruction about sex. "Some people say the United States gives more sex education to kids," said Kazunari Asanuma, an official in charge of education about AIDS and sex. "But then, who has more teen-age pregnancy?"
Japanese women often do not see a gynecologist until they become pregnant or are in their mid- to late 20's, partly out of a fear and dislike of gynecologists. The result is that men and women often learn about contraceptives from magazines and their friends, and because there is little publicity about the pill, they know almost nothing about it.
The Mainichi Shimbun, a national daily, published a survey this summer indicating that nearly 67 percent of women who responded and had heard of the pill said they did not want to use it, up from 53 percent who gave the same reply two years ago.
Kazuyo Kariya, a 25-year-old gynecological nurse, has been explaining the merits of the pill to all her friends.
"I understand how wonderful the pill is and how safe it is, and I recommend it," said Miss Kariya, as she was about to finish up her work one evening. Her first choice for contraceptive?
"My first choice would be the condom, and then the pill," she said with hardly a moment's hesitation. "Even if the pill is a low-dose pill, it doesn't mean it is totally free of side effects. And a condom is successful at least 90 percent of the time."
Her second reason for not taking the pill may also echo a common attitude.
"I have no intention of taking the pill," Miss Kariya said. "I am single. I have no steady partner, so I have no opportunities for sex."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned mixed yesterday, gaining early on signs that consumer confidence is not rising and that the economy is not growing rapidly, only to fall as some traders began to take profits.
Analysts said market participants began unloading securities after the price on the benchmark Treasury bond had risen enough to push its yield down to 6.37 percent, the lowest since March 4 and a key resistance level for technical traders. 
 The 30-year bond finished the New York session down 7/32, to a price of 100 26/32 to yield 6.44 percent, up from 6.42 percent on Monday, but still down near its eight-month-low levels.
The Conference Board's November reading of consumer confidence was unchanged at 107.3 from October's reading. Market reaction to the data was minimal, with early buying caused by the report drying up quickly. However, prices of Treasury securities remained firm in thin trading as the market next reacted favorably to a report by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve that economists it had surveyed expected slower growth in the fourth quarter. Market watchers also noted that there was year-end portfolio squaring by some dealers, which gave the market some of that early support, as money managers bought securities with longer maturities.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that although the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for November was unchanged, consumer confidence was still quite buoyant, and certainly created a conducive environment for a favorable Christmas shopping season. He expects to see more evidence of that in today's release of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index.
Other economic statistics are to be released today, but Mr. Fine does not anticipate that any of them will change the market's psyche. Third- quarter G.D.P. is expected to be revised downward, mainly as a result of lower inventory levels. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is expected to show only modest gains in that region's industrial sector, and a decline in October durable goods orders is foreseen.
"But all the recent data are very much in line with what the great preponderance of economic statistics have been indicating for some time," Mr. Fine said, "a moderating economy, but one that is certainly not faltering." He added, "Neither is the economy growing quickly enough to warrant fear about an overheating that could produce inflationary pressures."
The yield curve, Mr. Fine said, is likely to remain in a neutral Fed position. "At the same time the long end seems bounded by the continued sustainable growth of the economy setting a floor on yields in one hand, while on the other hand, the lack of inflationary pressures puts a cap on how high yields can go," he continued.
Analysts noted also that the long end of the government securities market was being pressured by issuance of corporate debt, which competes for investor dollars.
Stephen W. Carter, an analyst at MCM Corporate Watch, said about $1.56 billion of fresh investment- grade corporate debt was priced yesterday, including $750 million of 30-year capital securities issued by JPM Capital Trust I, a financing vehicle of J. P. Morgan & Company.
The bank capital notes, as they are called, are a new debtlike trust preferred stock.

HEADLINE: Time to Lower Rebel Flag, A Southern Governor Says

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: ANDERSON, S.C., Nov. 26

 BODY:
South Carolina is the last state in the South to fly the Confederate battle flag from its statehouse. Some look to that white-starred blue X on a field of red and hear the roar of cannons. Others hear only the clink of chains.
It has been a divisive symbol since it was raised in 1962, not only in remembrance of the Civil War but more so to show the state's resistance to the civil rights movement. 
 Now, in a decision that goes against the wishes of a majority in his own party, the Republican governor says it is time to bring it down.
In a remarkable live statewide television address Tuesday night, Gov. David Beasley, asked South Carolinians to "compromise on the Confederate flag, and teach our children that we can live together." He wants the flag to be removed from the capitol dome and placed at a Confederate memorial on the statehouse grounds.
Mr. Beasley's speech tonight was the first time in more than a decade that a South Carolina governor has asked for time on public television to address an issue to all corners of the state, from the mill towns around Anderson, Greenville and Spartanburg through the midland part of the state in and around Columbia down to the coast at Charleston.
The public television station broadcast not merely Mr. Beasley's address, but also rebuttals from opponents. Several commercial television stations around the state, seeing the issue's importance to people here, also carried the address live.
The first-term governor opposed bringing down the flag in his 1994 campaign, when three of four voters in the Republican primary said they wanted the flag to continue flying atop the statehouse.
But racial incidents have hammered the state week after week in the last year, as South Carolina became the dateline for embarrassing and -- to many people -- heartbreaking confrontations.
Governor Beasley said he changed his mind after the recent burnings of black churches and a drive-by shooting of blacks outside a rural nightclub by men linked to the Ku Klux Klan.
"The true meaning of the flag has nothing to do with racial hatred," Governor Beasley said, but hate groups -- now and in the past -- have adopted it as their symbol.
"Hate-filled cowards cover their heads and hide under the cloak of night," said the Governor, and because of them and their misuse of the Confederate symbol, "those of us who honor the flag are called racists."
"It is inexcusable when we are called a racist state," he said. "We are not."
A 1995 amendment to the state's budget act requires any change in the location of the flag to be approved by the Legislature. The Governor said he would ask the General Assembly to vote to remove the flag and place it in the less prominent place on the grounds in 1997, reviving a plan that died for lack of support in 1994. Political experts have said Governor Beasley may have the votes to accomplish the flag's relocation this time, if he can get a sliver of Republican support to go with the Democrats who like his plan.
Just 40 percent of South Carolinians want to keep the flag atop the statehouse, according to state polls. The rest either want it down or do not care.
Black ministers have pushed for years for its removal, as a majority of whites opposed them. But in the last few years, business leaders have stressed that the flag and the divisiveness it engenders are hurting the state's economic growth.
Still, emotion -- not money -- is at the core of this fight.
Carl B. Grant is a black lawyer in Columbia. He recently represented a 10-year-old black boy tied to a tree and terrorized by a white couple and two white children.
"We all know that at the Klan rallies, at incidents of hate crime, this flag is their symbol," Mr. Grant said. "The flag embraces and perpetuates the ideology of white supremacy."
That is what he sees when he looks at it, and what he has seen since he was a child carried along by his mother to civil rights demonstrations. If a flag is supposed to be a proud symbol of the people who live under it, he asks, then how can the Confederate flag possibly be such a symbol for black people.
"That symbol only embraces the heritage of a particular people," he said. "That flag tells me that, because of the color of my skin, I am considered a second-class citizen. If it represents history, put it in a museum."
Any decision to bring it from its place of honor is, he said, "a victory."
Mr. Beasley said he wanted to continue to honor the flag, but did not want his children debating the flag's place above the capital 10 years from now.
Some black leaders have said they will be satisfied with nothing short of its complete removal from the grounds.
After Mr. Beasley's speech, leading state Republicans lined up to refute the Governor's claims that the flag had to come down for the good of the state.
Two powerful state Republicans -- Attorney General Charlie Condon and Senator Glenn McConnell of Charleston -- said they wanted a referendum on the issue. Mr. Condon said it was the "editorial writers and politicians" who should "be ashamed of themselves" for bringing the issue up over and over again.
They have created the problem, he said.
"If that flag is a symbol of honor," Mr. Condon said, "then there should be no controversy. If it is a symbol of racism and hate, it shouldn't be flying at all."
As for the argument about the flag's driving away business, he said, "we should never compromise our principles for money."
But Mr. Beasley said the state had little choice. "The issue is about a people that need to look deep into their heart, deep into their soul, and figure out how are we going to be a better people," the Governor said. "To say we can't resolve this is giving up, is saying to our children we're not capable of compromise, we're not capable of working together."
Mr. Beasley's flowery address was filled with words of praise and pride about the State of South Carolina and its proud history, including the Civil War, making plain his reluctance to push for the flag's removal.
But, he said, "hate struck the match and hate pulled the trigger" in the church burnings and drive-by shootings. It is better for the flag for it to be placed where its historical significance is clear, such as at the Confederate memorial, than to allow it to continue to be misused by some as a symbol of modern-day racial divisiveness.
Mr. Condon and Mr. Beasley both have ancestors who fought in the Civil War. But while the Governor said those ghosts could still be honored by the placement of the flag in a more historical setting, the Attorney General said it cheapened the memory of the war's veterans to have the flag take from its place atop the symbolic crown of state government.
"The Confederate flag did not burn those churches," Mr. Condon said.
Some political observers have said the debate between the two men is a preview of the race for the Republican nomination for governor two years down the road. It is expected to be damaging to Governor Beasley politically, but not fatal.
One young woman, who asked not to be identified because she said any white person who supported the flag was branded a racist, said she would prefer that the flag remain, "but we can live with it, if it has to come down."
A flag, Mr. Beasley said tonight "should be a symbol of all the people."

HEADLINE: A Former Stronghold Turns Against President of Serbia

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: NIS, Serbia, Nov. 26

 BODY:
His old blue raincoat flapping in wild gusts of wind, the newspaper editor pushed his way through the demonstrators in the central square of this industrial city like a man with a mission.
"Look," said Velimir Rakocevic, spotting a young man selling his small, 12-page tabloid, the only independent newspaper in the city. "A week ago anyone seen carrying a stack of our papers was beaten. Now we can't print enough of them. This is the first time we have been able to distribute our paper in public. We are even making a profit." 
 Nis, a city of 200,000, once a stronghold of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the old Communist party, has turned violently against the Belgrade Government since the decision last week to annul the opposition victory in local elections here and in other cities. The Supreme Court ruled today to uphold a court ruling nullifying the vote.
Eight days ago, tens of thousands of angry blue-uniformed workers began the daily street protests that have now swept the country. Students and professors have occupied all of the city's university buildings and the local ruling Socialist Party leader, whose huge frame used to dominate the evening news, has disappeared from public view and ordered the party headquarters closed.
"We have every ill that besets Serbia here, only compounded," said Zoran Ziukovic, the head of the Nis opposition coalition. "Our industry is dead, people can barely make a living and we struggle under one of the most distorted and primitive forms of socialism in Serbia."
The protesters do not come from any one political party or represent any particular ideology. They range from nationalists to social democrats, but they have a common goal: They're tired of the Government.
Mr. Milosevic, who represented the Bosnian Serbs at negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, last year and who supported the peace agreement that was drafted there, has been helpful to the United States, at least for the period near the war's end, and Washington has avoided challenging him.
The Serbian Government, rattled by the protests, has moved some 5,000 police officers from an elite unit in Kosovo to the city's back streets. Opposition leaders say their presence is meant to counter the open support many local policemen have expressed for the protesters.
Nis perhaps epitomizes everything that has gone wrong under Mr. Milosevic since he took power in 1987.
The sprawling Elektronska Industrija Nis, one of two huge state-run factories here, has collapsed under mismanagement. A decade ago wages averaged $800 a month, but have now fallen to $40 a month and generally arrive three months late. The few hundred boxy television sets and washing machines that roll off the assembly line can barely keep 200 of the 23,000 workers employed.
The streets of the city, 140 miles south of Belgrade, are also in dismal condition. Lights are burned out; garbage lies uncollected; potholes look ready to swallow the small, sputtering Yugo cars that chug along the roads, and a layer of grime and pollution hangs over the city.
Presiding over Nis is the widely unpopular Socialist Party leader, Mile Ilic. He and his followers have milked City Hall for gleaming new Mercedeses, choice apartments and glittering new office towers where tenants turn their checks over to Mr. Ilic's wife, according to local business leaders.
Mr. Ilic, who travels with a group of armed bodyguards who are also trained kick-boxers, is a close associate of Mr. Milosevic. He led the movement to nominate Mr. Milosevic for the Nobel Prize, and in a recent public appearance said he "thanked God" that the Serbian nation is blessed with a "visionary" like Mirjana Markovic, Mr. Milosevic's wife and partner in state and party business.
The local elections, however, proved to be the ruling party's undoing. Party workers brazenly carried sacks of marked ballots into city polling stations and stuffed them in the boxes as outraged voters watched.
Thugs with crew cuts entered polling stations and savagely beat opposition election monitors.
And when 17 polling stations had the tenacity to report opposition victories, the city government annulled the vote and, without releasing figures, declared the ruling party victorious. On Wednesday a third round of elections is to be held, but opposition members have promised to boycott them.
Opposition leaders said they hesitated to mention Mr. Ilic's name at the daily rallies, which draw about 30,000 people here, because of the violence it could unleash, something they fear will play into the Government's hands.
Vladimir Djordevic, a 52-year-old clerk, stood in a cold drizzle in the city center today as opposition leaders addressed some 20,000 people from the concrete frame of a building that was designed to be the city's first McDonald's, but was left unfinished when economic sanctions were imposed during the war.
He said he monitored the vote for the opposition until he was attacked and badly beaten by kick-boxers and the deputy chairman of the city assembly inside a polling station.
"I remember lying on the floor screaming 'Thieves, thieves, thieves!' as they kicked me," he said, "and every time I remember that moment I vow to stand in this square until we drive them from power."

HEADLINE: Adopting a Cat Gets Complicated

BYLINE: By CLARE COLLINS 

 BODY:
IF you're looking to adopt a cat at Christmas, the peak adoption time, be prepared to prove you are the perfect parent.
Take the case of Margot C. Bright, who decided to adopt a kitten from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals -- and assumed it would be easy. 
 A corporate banker, Ms. Bright could well afford the expense of pet ownership. And while she worked long hours, she said she told the A.S.P.C.A. that she planned to be home most evenings and weekends to give her kitten "quality time."
So imagine Ms. Bright's surprise when the shelter on East 92d Street refused to let her adopt a kitten. Why? She works too much.
"I was told that because I work more than four hours a day outside the home, I was ineligible for a kitten," Ms. Bright said, fuming. "It's ridiculous. It's like saying only retired people or people who don't work should have a kitten."
The shelter suggested that Ms. Bright adopt an older cat that could better handle being alone all day. She declined. "I really wanted a kitten that I could raise myself," she said. "With an older cat, you don't know what kind of baggage it has, what kind of temperament."
Ailurophiles might also learn from the efforts of the suburban family who attempted to adopt a cat from the Central Westchester Humane Society in Elmsford. Their daughter, 4, spent hours picking out her favorite while her parents responded to the shelter's written queries: would they let the animal out during the day? Yes, chaperoned by family members. At night? No. How did they feel about having the cat declawed? Ambivalent.
The family was deemed unsuitable; the shelter's policy was to reject families who do not promise to keep the cat indoors at all times or who plan to declaw it.
More and more animal shelters have enacted strict standards for cat adoptions. In addition to rules about keeping cats indoors and keeping kittens sufficiently entertained, most shelters will not give a cat to someone who plans to have it declawed. Prospective owners are likely to be asked to supply proof of employment and references (which are usually called on the spot). Adoptions are refused if the applicant is unemployed or, in the case of a kitten, has children 6 or younger.
Applicants should expect to fill out a lengthy questionnaire covering everything from their work schedule to the number and ages of their children living at home to who will care for it should they become unable to. A growing number of shelters are checking for a criminal record of cruelty to animals. Some also make unannounced follow-up checks on the home, looking for signs of mistreatment or neglect.
While such stringent requirements have long been in place for dog adoptions, the attitude toward cats was always somewhat laissez-faire. That has changed over the last five to seven years, said the Human Society of the United States, in Washington. The precise criteria for adoptive cat parents currently vary, and are something that shelters are careful not to reveal.
"We don't want to give people a chance to rehearse their answers," said Michael M. Arms, the director of the North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, L.I.
Mimi Stone, the director of the shelter in Elmsford, agreed with that approach. "I'm not going to tell you our secrets," she said. "It doesn't work well for us if people know all the questions we tend to ask."
According to the Humane Society, there are no standard regulations for what shelters may require when considering an adoption, and no governing body to regulate animal adoption policies. "We offer adoption guidelines, but nobody is obliged to follow them," said Sally Fekety, a spokeswoman. "It's really up to the shelter's board of directors to decide what constitutes appropriate criteria. And that criteria may be a little subjective."
Dr. Sandra Bushmich, a veterinarian and an associate professor of pathobiology at the University of Connecticut, said pet adoption regulations are usually made out of concern for animal welfare. Most shelters forbid declawing, for example, calling it inhumane and saying it makes it difficult for a cat to protect itself outdoors. But sometimes, rules can be carried to extremes.
"There's no question that issues such as whether a cat should be spayed or neutered, or whether people understand the long-term commitment associated with a pet, are very real," Dr. Bushmich said. "But many other issues that shelters cover tend to be a matter of opinion."
For that reason, she said, adoptions should be made on a case-by-case basis, rather than by holding everyone to the same standards. "Otherwise," she said, "a shelter might overlook a very good home. You really don't want a cat languishing in a shelter or being euthanized if someone is out there willing to care for it."
Hedy Litke, director of adoptions for the 92d Street A.S.P.C.A. shelter, said that the shelter's guidelines are intended to prevent failed adoptions: of the 150 dogs and cats adopted on average each month, 25 percent wind up back at the shelter. She also noted that cats who remain in cages too long may become unadoptable. Pacing around a cage all day isn't good for a cat's mental state. These cats, she said -- which might not allow anyone to pick them up, or might hiss or stop eating -- are euthanized, as are cats with significant health problems. (Some shelters, like Elmsford's, are "no-kill" shelters.)
According to the Humane Society, which strongly advocates keeping cats inside, an indoor cat is likely to live 16 years, while the average outdoor cat survives only 3 to 4 years and is more likely to pick up diseases. But Dr. Bushmich said such risks are outweighed by other considerations. "I have two cats, and they would not be happy staying inside," she said. "It's not just length of life, but quality of life you should be concerned with."
The shelter in Elmsford rarely allows adoptions to families who plan to let the cat outside, even when accompanied by the owner. Ms. Stone, its director, said she makes exceptions. "I go by instinct," she said. (One tip: be sure to have a landlord's approval for a pet before heading off to the shelter.)
The North Shore Animal League turns down one of every three people seeking to adopt a pet from its shelter, Mr. Arms said.
"We do exercise a lot of quality control," he said. His criteria include that the cat is allowed outdoors only in rural or suburban areas, that it is not given to someone as a gift and that the owner is employed. "We feel it's better for a cat to have a long, safe life, rather than a short, happy one," he added.
To make sure that happens, the shelter makes an unannounced visit within 90 days of an adoption and can repossess the cat if an owner hasn't produced papers showing the animal has been neutered or vaccinated.
What recourse do you have if you feel you've been rejected unfairly? Ms. Fekety of the Humane Society recommends writing a letter to the shelter manager or board. "It may be that the board of directors needs to revisit a given policy," she said. Or a shelter employee may be applying the rules with a broad brush.
It is also wise, as Ms. Bright found, to shop around. She eventually adopted a kitten through a shelter in Rochester, where she had gone to visit her brother. There, she was told that full-time work was not an impediment to adopting a kitten. Go figure.
Alternatives to shelters include the classified sections of the newspaper (sometimes listed under "Free to a Good Home" or "Pets") and pet stores.
But even stores are getting picky. "We require people who want a cat to fill out an application," said Susie Park, owner of Animal House, a pet store on Ninth Avenue near 42d Street, which asks $50 for a cat (shelters charge $30 to $75), a fee that covers the cost of vaccines and spaying or neutering. "We then interview the person by phone."

Chart: "The Right Answer: It Will Stay Indoors, With Claws"
Adopting a cat from an animal shelter these days requires more than choosing between the tabby and the calico. Expect plenty of questions -- and possibly a refusal.
 
Declawing. Almost all shelters will refuse a cat to someone who plans to declaw it.
 
Home Alone. Stricter rules apply for kittens; the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals requires you work no more than four hours a day outside the home. Other shelters recommend adopting two kittens to keep each other company.
 
Indoors or Out. Every shelter recommends not letting the cats outdoors, and many will refuse adoptions to those who say they plan to do so -- even if the cat would be chaperoned or on a leash.
 
Windows. Shelters in the city, including the A.S.P.C.A., require full screens on apartment windows (no matter what floor), because a cat can squeeze through a window guard.
 
Children. If there are children 6 or younger in the family, most shelters will refuse a kitten adoption. Some are more extreme -- when a caller told I Love Animals Inc. in Manhattan that she had a 6-year-old and an 11-year-old, the representative said, "Cats don't like kids," and hung up.
 
Pregnant. Some refuse adoptions to pregnant women because cats can transmit toxoplasmosis, a disease that can harm the fetus.
 
Employment. No job, no cat -- unless you can prove you can afford it. Students are almost always refused. Military personnel may need to show they have a place to leave the cat should they move.
 
Spaying and Neutering. Every shelter requires it. For kittens, some require leaving a deposit for spaying or neutering after eight weeks. Most will check up on the phone; at least one shelter will make an unannounced visit to your home.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs Broadly, Aided By Signs of Weakness in Japan

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by fresh signs of economic weakness in Japan and renewed calls for a stronger dollar from European officials.
The Bank of Japan reported its quarterly survey of business sentiment, known as the tankan, improved only slightly in November, leading traders to sell Japanese yen for dollars. The report suggested Japan's economy was still too weak to tolerate higher interest rates.
"The tankan report was not terrible, but the market had been short dollars against expectations of a slightly better report," said Ben Strauss, a currency trader at Bank Julius Baer & Company.
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 113.33 yen, from 112.47 yen on Tuesday, and the first close above 113 yen since Nov. 6. The dollar rose to 1.5268 German marks from 1.5244 marks, but fell to 5.1690 French francs from 5.1706 francs. Trading was light ahead of Thanksgiving, when financial markets in the United States are closed. Most markets overseas are open.
The dollar gained against European currencies after Prime Minister Alain Juppe of France told an audience in Paris that he thought the dollar was undervalued. Mr. Juppe also said he would ask other leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to discuss the dollar's weakness.
The comments by the Prime Minister helped bolster the dollar against the mark and briefly against the French franc.
"Certainly it's his 'undervalued' statement in line with yesterday's French comment that's doing this," said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.
The dollar had less success against the British pound, which climbed on renewed talk of higher interest rates in Britain.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, told a London news conference that he was prepared to raise interest rates if necessary to counter inflationary pressures as the British economy continued to expand.
"The comments gave sterling a little bit of firmness," Mr. Strauss of Bank Julius Baer said. "It had had a pretty good selloff the last couple of days and now it's bouncing."
In New York, the pound rose to $1.6781 from $1.6714.

HEADLINE: CATCHING UP WITH: Bill Gates;
Filling Potholes In 'Road Ahead'

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
IN the techno-future foreseen by Bill Gates, people will have no need to carry money, identification or a watch. They will use a wallet PC, a hand-held computer that stores digital cash and information.
These quotidian encumbrances are already obsolete for Mr. Gates. When he wanted to know what time it was during breakfast the other day, he asked an aide, and the aide looked at his watch. After Mr. Gates finished his meal at Sarabeth's on the Upper East Side, the aide, a member of Microsoft's press office, pulled out a gold card and signed for the check. 
 For Mr. Gates, the future is already here, in the form of a Personal Nondigital Assistant.
The Microsoft founder and 41-year-old zillionaire had flown in from Lake Placid, N.Y., where he, his wife and their 7-month-old daughter had spent an unwired weekend ensconced in a resort hotel. Mr. Gates read The Economist front to back and worked on a devilishly difficult jigsaw puzzle. As his wife and only child returned home to a Seattle suburb, he chartered a plane to New York for business. But in some ways he was still in family mode.
He ordered a "Papa Bear," a large bowl of porridge, typical fare at Sarabeth's, a countrified place favored by mothers and toddlers. He seemed fascinated not so much with computer technology as diaper technology. "At home we have this thing, a special diaper pail, that if the diaper doesn't smell good you just put it in and twist it around and there's no odor," he said. "I think it's new only in the last year or two. I can't imagine what it was like before."
As he spoke, he folded his arms across his stomach, hands grasping elbows, and rocked back and forth on the banquette. It was not a grown-up's posture. Mr. Gates's several adolescent mannerisms -- he is fond of words like "cool" -- together with his tousled mop-top and pallid skin have fueled the myth that he is the original computer nerd.
In fact, since dropping out of Harvard to sell software to computer hobbyists, Mr. Gates has always been more cutthroat businessman than programming whiz. Microsoft built its near-monopolistic dominance of the software industry on his shrewd decision to license the computer operating system MS-DOS to I.B.M., rather than sell it outright; thus, it pockets a fee every time an I.B.M. PC or clone is sold.
Today the perception of Microsoft as the Evil Empire is greater than ever, measured in personal attacks on Mr. Gates from rival computer moguls, and on the Internet, the collective unconscious of computerdom. An Internet search of the name "Bill Gates" brings back numerous "proofs" that he is the Antichrist. One example (http://jr.ttisms.com/ pjf/666.html) uses numerology to show that the name Windows 95 adds up to 666. "Coincidence?" writes the anonymous author. "Or just the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total enslavement?"
Mr. Gates seems to pay no heed to such populist rumblings and dismisses the criticism of competitors as posturing. "We're about making great software, that's our deal," he said. "The current state of affairs, where we have a growing number of customers, and competitors don't like us, that's the ideal thing."
It had been 30 minutes since he ordered breakfast, and the food had not yet come. An embarrassed waitress appeared and said: "I'm sorry your order is taking so long. There's a computer problem."
If Mr. Gates felt a wave of cosmic irony breaking, he gave no hint. All he said was: "Sheesh. I wondered."
Eventually the food came, and Mr. Gates, wearing a plush green sweater, brown slacks and tasseled black loafers as smooth as baby skin, dug into his oatmeal.
He was in town to discuss the Penguin paperback edition of his 1995 best seller, "The Road Ahead." The new book is an upgrade, with 20 percent more material, a figure it is possible to give precisely because Microsoft tabulated the number of words in each chapter of the original edition against the number in each chapter of the new book.
The revision was needed because when Mr. Gates peered down the road ahead a year ago, the view looked far different. As he acknowledges, he was late to grasp the significance of the Internet's explosive growth, and the book has been rewritten to give it prominence.
In a now-famous speech on Pearl Harbor Day last December, Mr. Gates announced that every Microsoft division would be refocused to develop products for the Internet market and that henceforth, "we are hard-core about the Internet."
Since then, Microsoft has gone head-to-head with Netscape Communications in a war over competing software to browse the World Wide Web; entered a partnership with NBC on a cable news channel and Web news site, MSNBC, and redesigned the Microsoft Network, with 1.6 million subscribers, to be primarily an Internet access provider.
The bottom line: at a time when the stocks of many once-hot Internet companies have cooled, Microsoft shares have climbed 74 percent this year, and Mr. Gates, who owns 23.6 percent of the company, is worth a staggering $20 billion.
Still, the Internet's future may be dimmer than expected if the personal Web-browsing habits of America's No. 1 computer guy are an indication. On his own time, Mr. Gates is not all that hard-core about the Net. He has used it to buy books, and when his wife, Melinda French Gates, a former Microsoft executive (they married on New Year's Day 1994), was pregnant, the couple retrieved childbirth information from hospitals' Web sites. But mainly they consulted traditional paperbacks.
Their daughter, Jennifer Katharine, was born in April. "The first six months have been much more of a thrill than I expected," Mr. Gates said. "I thought, 'Well, when the kid starts talking, we'll do things together.' But even a kid who doesn't talk has little triumphs and a personality."
In the past, he has maintained that he did not believe in inherited wealth and intended to give away the vast bulk of his fortune in his lifetime. The reality of having an heir has not changed his view. "I'll make sure my kids have enough money to be good and safe," he said, "but I don't think it's helpful to have a ton of money."
He said he expected to leave his children less than $10 million -- adjusted for inflation.
Since 1992, Mr. Gates has put $200 million into a foundation, administered by his father, that gives mainly to education, population control and the United Way.
His main personal indulgence is a much-delayed 37,000-square-foot house that he and his wife are building on Lake Washington. He denied a rumor among Microsoft employees that Mrs. Gates dislikes the house, which has cost upward of $30 million, and will never move in.
The rumors can probably be traced to the shotgun marriage between the house's rustic stone-and-wood-beam architecture, designed when Mr. Gates was a bachelor, and the plush Euro-style typical of Mrs. Gates's chosen decorator, Thierry Despont, who usually seems more at home in the 18th century.
Curiosity about the house has run feverishly high from the first descriptions of its 20-car garage, trampoline room for Mr. Gates to exercise in and computer-controlled music system that pipes a visitor's favorite sounds into whatever room he or she enters. Watch Bill's House Grow, an unofficial Web site, posts updated photographs (www.morsepr.com/ MMdocs/Bill.html).
While Mr. Gates leaves most of the decisions about furniture to his wife, he is in charge of the guy-type stuff -- in particular, 30 or so wall screens throughout the house that will display a shifting series of digitized artworks and other images.
"One of the screens is the size of that wall there," Mr. Gates said, pointing at a 20-foot-long row of windows on Madison Avenue. "It's the most unique aspect of the house. We make it so easy to call up images, whether art or people or beaches or sunsets or Nobel Prize winners."
With all that, who needs family portraits?

HEADLINE: Growth Is Revised to a Slightly Slower 2%

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The Government said today that the economy grew just slightly more slowly in the third quarter than initially estimated, and other new statistics suggested that the nation was continuing to enjoy modest growth and low inflation in the final three months of the year.
The Commerce Department said the economy grew 2 percent in the third quarter. Its original estimate last month had been 2.2 percent. Citing subsequent reports about the economy's performance at the end of the quarter -- particularly a larger-than-expected trade deficit in September -- many economists had expected the revised growth figure to be as low as 1.7 percent. 
 The Commerce Department also reported today that orders for durable goods rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Most analysts had been expecting a decline after September's robust increase in orders of 4.6 percent. The slight rise provided tentative evidence that the economy remained on solid footing early in the fourth quarter.
"Orders are still exhibiting enough forward momentum to keep the manufacturing sector gainfully employed at least into early 1997," said Kenneth Mayland, the chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland.
Other indicators issued today showed no signs of any pressures that could push the economy either to stall or overheat.
The number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment last week held steady, compared with the previous week, at 342,000. The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising fell 2 points, to 82, suggesting a slight easing of demand for workers at a time when unemployment, at 5.2 percent, remains near a seven-year low.
A survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area found a slight acceleration in business activity this month in that region, while a similar survey in the New York area found a somewhat stronger pickup.
"The data is consistent with a slowdown in the third quarter, but it doesn't look like there's any sign of cumulative weakness or a process that's headed toward a recession," said John E. Silvia, the chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago.
Since it became apparent late in the summer that the economy was slowing substantially from its 4.7 percent growth rate in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve and the financial markets have become considerably less worried about an outbreak of inflation, despite the continued low unemployment rate.
Analysts said the balance enjoyed by the economy should allow the Federal Reserve to keep short-term interest rates unchanged well into next year. The Fed, which next meets to consider monetary policy on Dec. 17, has held rates steady since January, betting successfully that a brief surge in growth last spring would give way to the current stable environment.
The Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product contained further evidence that inflation remained contained. The two main price indexes used by the Government to adjust for inflation remained unchanged from last month's initial estimate and in both cases were below the second-quarter rate. The chain-weight price index was 1.9 percent in the third quarter, down from 2.2 percent in the second quarter. The implicit price deflator for the third quarter stood at 1.6 percent, down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter.
The downward revision in the growth estimate was largely a result of a decline from the previously projected level of exports and a drop of $6.8 billion from the previous estimate of business inventories, the department said.
The slight increase in durable goods orders was driven by a 17.3 percent surge in orders for electronics and other electrical equipment. That rise more than offset an expected drop of 7.9 percent in orders for transportation equipment, including aircraft. Aircraft orders, which tend to bounce sharply up and down on a month-to-month basis, had been particularly strong in September.
The Commerce Department also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell 2.6 percent in the third quarter, the weakest showing since a 5.8 percent drop in the first quarter of 1994. Profits had dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds End Short Session A Bit Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher in a shortened session yesterday, retreating from session highs on economic data that were somewhat stronger than expected.
The market retains a bullish tone, despite returning some early gains and even though the numbers released yesterday suggested a strong economy that could get stronger. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 7/32 yesterday, to 101 1/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.42 percent, from 6.44 percent on Tuesday.
The market will be closed today in observance of Thanksgiving, and trading ended at 2 P.M. yesterday. The market will again close early tomorrow since many market participants are not expected to return until next week.
Bonds rose in early trading yesterday, bolstered by a surge in the dollar against the Japanese yen. The yen weakened following the release of the Bank of Japan's survey of business sentiment, known as the tankan, which showed that the Japanese economy was recovering more slowly than expected and suggested that interest rates would not be rising in the near term.
The dollar's climb raised the bond market's expectations that foreign buyers would continue pouring money into the United States as a strong dollar makes investments here more attractive.
Indeed, Japan's eight biggest insurance companies have said that they plan to increase foreign bond purchases in the second half of their fiscal year, which ends March 31.
But bond prices were held down by several reports that pointed to a strengthening economy. The Chicago Purchasing Managers said that its index of business activity rose to 57.6 in November, from 56.9 in October, more than economists' expectations of a drop to 55.2. Readings of more than 50 suggest that manufacturing is expanding.
The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for November rose to 99.2, traders said, from the final October index reading of 96.5 and the highest reading in more than 10 years. The Michigan consumer survey is released only to subscribers.
And while the economy in the third quarter grew at a slower pace than an earlier reading had shown, gross domestic product data released yesterday were stronger than many Wall Street economists had predicted. The Commerce Department reported a revised 2 percent rise in G.D.P., compared with an earlier estimate of 2.2 percent.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for durable goods rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Most analysts had been expecting a decline following a sharp rise in September.
"Today's economic numbers were stronger and more positive than expected," said Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, "and as the day progressed pushed Treasury prices to their lowest levels" of the session.
"The strong numbers showed the economy is still moving forward and with that the potential of a rise in inflation pressures," he said.
Even after the market ended virtually flat, Mr. Regan said that the overall sentiment was still bullish, "but you do have a cautionary feeling coming into the marketplace."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The E.P.A.'s tough standards: cost isn't a consideration.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AFTER years of hinting, the Environmental Protection Agency now wants to tighten air quality standards for ozone and the tiny particles in dust and soot.
That's good, right? After all, the new rules are designed to meet the letter and spirit of the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to "protect public health with an ample margin of safety." But they are raising eyebrows among economists inclined to look much more critically at the costs of regulation as well as the benefits. 
 Lumping together standards for the two pollutants, these economists say, uses the strong case for reducing particulates to mask the relatively weak case against ozone. More important, the tighter standard for ozone pushes regulation into little-explored territory where the costs of pollution control are large and obvious, while the likely benefits are ephemeral.
So how will the Government reconcile the stern dictates of the law with the cool realities of economics and politics? Good question. "Los Angeles never had a prayer of meeting the old ozone standard," Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, said, "let alone the new one."
The good news here is that the E.P.A. is updating particulate standards to mesh with scientific findings that very small particles (2.5 microns, or millionths of a meter, in diameter) are as damaging to health as larger ones. It is still not clear, however, that all new particles being regulated are equally dangerous. Exposure to nitrogen compounds (from car exhausts and power plants) may be less risky than contact with sulfur compounds (mostly from burning coal).
Even less clear is the logic in linking the regulation of soot and ozone. Killer smog, still a phenomenon in the third world, is typically loaded with both particulates and ozone. And reducing emissions of one often reduces emissions of the other. But those rationalizations mask big differences.
The epidemiological case against ozone is weak. For example, a study of the horrific air pollution in Mexico City by the widely respected Health Effects Institute found that particulates rather than ozone did most of the medical damage. And while researchers have been looking for the smoking gun on ozone for decades, Paul Portney, president of the economically aware environmental group Resources for the Future, says that "all they've been able to prove is that exposure causes short-term reversible effects," like bronchial irritation and watery eyes.
Above all, what the E.P.A. ruling will do is raise the bar for meeting air pollution standards to a qualitatively higher level. Under the old ozone standard of 120 parts per billion, some 70 urban areas fail to make the cut. But only Houston, New York, Philadelphia and a few cities in California were under pressure to make radical changes in order to meet the standard. And only Los Angeles was hopelessly out of compliance.
By ratcheting down to 80 parts per billion, Los Angeles will have plenty of company in the E.P.A.'s dog house. Mr. Lave expects that "much of the Eastern Seaboard" will fall into this category.
In a society that could cope rationally with these issues, Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, suggests, the appropriate response would be to change the law. Rather than an absolute Federal health standard, Congress may create a test in which the value of lives lengthened (along with other benefits) are weighed against the cost of compliance. Cities that want to pay for cleaner air -- resorts, say, or places catering to retirees -- ought to be allowed to find "local solutions for local problems," he argues. But no one is going to force Cleveland or Baltimore to abandon the internal combustion engine.
That is not how Washington works, of course. It has dealt with the Los Angeles compliance problem in the past, for example, through a process of endless delay. That has led to significant progress but has also allowed everyone involved to avoid confronting the serious trade-offs involved. The region has repeatedly been given more time to comply as long as it was making a good faith effort -- electric cars, reformulated charcoal lighting fluid and the like.
In the end, though, the only way around the impossible is to fudge the health standards. Today, noncompliance means the failure to keep the average ozone level below 120 parts per billion for more than one hour on more than one day a year. Raising the averaging period to a full day, along with allowing four or five noncompliance days a year, would effectively double the permissible level of ozone.
This approach is untidy and a bit cynical. But, then, democracy has always been untidy. And unless you can imagine members of Congress publicly debating whether asthmatics should be asked to stay indoors on heavy smog days, cynicism is probably the order of the day.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Posts Another Rise; Dow Retreats

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq rose for the fourth consecutive session yesterday, lifted by a rally in computer issues.
But the Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.07 points, to 6,499.34, as investors took profits before the Thanksgiving holiday. It was the Dow's first two-day losing streak in more than a month. Even with the two-day drop of nearly 50 points, the Dow is up about 470 points, or 7.8 percent, in November. 
 The stock market is closed today for Thanksgiving and will reopen tomorrow for an abbreviated session, ending at 1 P.M.
Stocks started the session lower as the bond market slipped from an early rally that briefly pulled interest rates back down toward their lowest level since early March.
But bonds pulled back amid a flurry of economic data suggesting a faster pace of business activity.
The indications of rising consumer demand eroded some of the widespread confidence that the economy was slowing enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to keep inflation in check.
"There's an awful lot of anticipation factored into the slow-growth scenario and a non-Fed intervention environment," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer for the Bank of Boston. "Any announcement to the converse will have an adverse effect on the bond market."
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-11 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 377.8 million shares , down sharply from Tuesday's heavy pace of 540.5 million.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.96 point, to 755.00, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.50, to 397.48.
But the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology and smaller companies, rose 6.12 points, to 1,287.32.
Intel rose 2 5/8, to 126 5/8, as the Nasdaq's most active issue, and Microsoft rose 1 3/4, to 155 1/2.
Other computing issues gained. International Business Machines edged up 1/8, to 158 1/8; Micron gained 1 1/8, to 33 1/4; Bay Network rose 1 1/2, to 26 5/8, and McAfee Associates surged 4, to 49. Texas Instruments rose 2 7/8, to 63 3/4, after Salomon Brothers raised its opinion on the stock, and America Online rose 2 1/4, to 34 7/8, after an upgrade from Cowen & Company.
Oil shares were among the Dow's weakest components amid worries that the potential return of Iraqi crude to the world supply would lower prices, which are currently at the highest level in years. Texaco fell 1 5/8, to 98 7/8; Chevron fell 1 1/2, to 66 5/8, and Exxon fell 1 1/8, to 93 3/4.
The Dow's biggest decliner was Disney, which gave back most of Tuesday's rally on a strong earnings report, falling 2 1/8, to 73 7/8.
Vacation Break jumped 6, to 16 3/4, after agreeing to merge with Berkley Group, a privately held developer and marketer of time-share resort properties in Florida and Virginia.
Armor All Products rose 1 25/64, to 18 57/64 a day after Clorox said it would buy the company for $408 million in cash, or $19.09 a share,
Shares of Conrail Inc. declined by 3/8, to 96 1/2, after The Wall Street Journal reported the purchase of the company. Whether by CSX or Norfolk Southern, the purchase is already facing stronger-than-expected opposition.

HEADLINE: Philip Birnbaum, 89, Builder Celebrated for His Efficiency

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Philip Birnbaum, the almost anonymous architectural hand behind many of the most imposing apartment towers in New York City, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
Unlike his contemporary, Philip Johnson, Mr. Birnbaum enjoyed no public celebrity and little critical acclaim; "banal" was among the kinder words used to describe his work. But his output exceeded that of Mr. Johnson -- and just about any other architect in recent decades -- and his buildings are familiar to New Yorkers, even if they do not know who gets the credit. 
 What made him so popular among developers was the efficiency of his apartment layouts. There was virtually no wasted floor space in his units, meaning that builders could fit more apartments on a floor. Because he tried to eliminate interior hallways, occupants also got more usable room. He said he designed for the people who lived in his buildings, not the elite.
Among some 300 buildings designed by Mr. Birnbaum, alone or in association with others, were One Lincoln Plaza, also known as the Ascap Building, at Broadway and 63d Street (1971); the Galleria, 119 East 57th Street (1975); 1001 Fifth Avenue, near 82d Street (1979); the Hotel Parker Meridien, 118 West 57th Street (1981); and, cater-corner across Third Avenue, the Savoy, 200 East 61st Street (1986) and Trump Plaza, 167 East 61st Street (1984).
"Most people don't know Philip Birnbaum, yet he probably designed more buildings in New York than anyone else," Donald J. Trump said yesterday. "Not all were great but they all made money. And some were, in fact, very good."
"Whereas many people would design a building from the outside in, he would design a building from the inside out," Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Birnbaum was responsible for the apartment plans in Trump Tower.
Layouts were not his only trademark. Mr. Birnbaum also counted the rooftop swimming pool among his innovations. His daughter, Dara Birnbaum, a video artist in Manhattan who originally followed her father into architecture, said the idea was that "people need to have their own open space, even in a city of high-rises."
"He would say, 'Let's use the roofs for the common good,' " Ms. Birnbaum said. She traced this concern to a youth spent in railroad tenements so dark he would study outside by streetlight.
Mr. Birnbaum grew up in Washington Heights, attended Stuyvesant High School and earned his architectural degree at Columbia. He was accepted at Princeton but was cautioned in a letter from the university that, as a "Hebrew," he might not fit into the environment. Mr. Birnbaum carried that letter around for many years, his daughter said.
In the building boom following World War II, Mr. Birnbaum did a great deal of work in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, Queens, much of it for the developer Alfred L. Kaskel. Over the years, his practice was known as Philip Birnbaum, the Office of Philip Birnbaum or Philip Birnbaum & Associates.
For Mr. Kaskel, Mr. Birnbaum designed the Doral Beach Hotel in Miami Beach and the Doral Country Club in Miami, but most of his major projects were in Manhattan. The 47-story Excelsior, at 303 East 57th Street, was for a time New York's tallest apartment building.
Other significant apartment towers included 45 East 89th Street, at Madison Avenue; Manhattan Place, 630 First Avenue, at 36th Street; the Bromley, 225 West 83d Street; Le Chambord, 350 East 72d Street; the Promenade, 530 East 76th Street and the Horizon, 415 East 37th Street.
Whatever the merits of his layouts, Mr. Birnbaum's facades typically had few distinguishing features, reflecting developers' quest for economy. Plain in material and monotonous in composition, the effect could be particularly deadening since the towers tended to be so large.
There were some notable departures, like the swooping, boomerang-shaped Trump Plaza, on the west side of Third Avenue. When Mr. Birnbaum was commissioned by another developer to build a tower on the east side of the avenue, he saw an opportunity to create a monumental gateway and designed a near twin. But Mr. Trump sued and won a settlement in which the design of the Savoy was modified. In recent years, his health failing, Mr. Birnbaum curtailed his practice, although he continued to work as a consultant.
Besides his daughter, he is survived by a son, Dr. Robert J. Birnbaum, of Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: Administration Issues Its Proposal For Tightening of Air Standards

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today proposed tighter air quality standards for the nation, saying that children, asthmatics, people who work outdoors and the frail elderly needed more protection from choking smog and soot and that the health and economic benefits would vastly outweigh the costs of new pollution controls.
The proposal, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, had been widely anticipated and has already prompted vigorous debate. Industry groups criticized it today as unnecessary and very costly, while environmental and public health organizations were largely supportive but said it was too weak in some details. 
 The change sought by the environmental agency is certain to be among the most disputed in years. And in announcing it, Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, defended it as based squarely on health considerations and the best available science.
"The scientific evidence tells us that the current standards fail to provide adequate public health protection, especially for children," Ms. Browner said. "The question is not one of science. The question is one of judgment: Whom do we protect?"
The agency plans to decide next summer, after a period of public comment that began with its action today, whether to take its final step and adopt the new standards. Even that adoption would be subject to review, however, both in Congress and in the courts.
In effect, the environmental agency is seeking to change its definition of what counts as healthful air, as measured by the ozone and the tiny chemical particles that shroud many cities in haze. Those pollutants can exacerbate asthma, bronchitis and other lung ailments.
The new rules are intended in part to protect people who are exposed to lower levels of ozone than levels allowable under the current rules, and for more hours at a time. That change would better reflect the latest scientific understanding of the health risks posed by ozone, an irritant gas that is a main component of smog.
As for particulates -- complex mixtures of noxious chemicals suspended in the air -- the new rules would count particles far smaller than the size now being controlled. Again, the new focus is on controlling pollutants that present the worst health risks; smaller particles lodge deepest in the lungs.
One of the new standards calls for the air to contain no more than 80 parts of ozone per billion, measured over eight-hour periods. Cities would be permitted to exceed that limit several times over a three-year period without being found in violation, under a new enforcement formula intended to avoid haphazard instances of violations that occur in unusual circumstances, like weather conditions that occasionally trap smog in place.
The new standard for particulate matter is more complex, calling for particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter to be held below 50 micrograms per cubic meter as a daily average and 15 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual average. Here, too, the daily standard could be exceeded occasionally without violation.
As with other Federal clean-air mandates, the states would be responsible for writing plans to bring themselves into compliance, which they would achieve by imposing controls on various sources of pollution, largely factories and automobiles. Ultimately, then, the cost would be borne by industry.
Changing the definition of healthful air would throw hundreds of counties out of compliance with the Clean Air Act. And the E.P.A. estimated today that taking the additional steps needed to meet the goals would cost between $6.6 billion and $8.5 billion a year for at least a decade..
But the benefits, the agency estimated, would be even greater: between $51 billion and $112 billion a year, mostly in the form of reduced medical costs and lower absenteeism from school and work, but also because tens of thousands of premature deaths might be averted each year.
The agency said the new standard for fine particles would cut premature deaths linked to particulate air pollution by 50 percent, or approximately 20,000 deaths a year, and would reduce the number of asthma attacks aggravated by this kind of pollution by a quarter of a million episodes a year.
Chronic bronchitis would be reduced by 60,000 cases a year, the number of hospital admissions for breathing difficulties would drop by 9,000 a year, and haze and visibility problems in some areas, including national parks, would drop by more than three-fourths, the agency predicted.
The new ozone standard, meanwhile, would result in 1.5 million fewer cases of breathing problems in which lung function is reduced as much as 20 percent, the agency said. This in turn would mean fewer hospital admissions, visits to emergency rooms and missed days at school or work, and would cut down on the need for medication or other treatment for asthmatic children. The agency also estimated that the change would reduce by nearly $1 billion the losses of agricultural crops from damage caused by ozone.
Ms. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, estimated that 70 percent of the communities that would not now meet the new standards could do so in 10 years or so, using pollution control approaches either currently planned or already available. As an example, she cited new pollution control canisters that are planned for automobiles starting in 1998.
Under the Clean Air Act, air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter are supposed to be set solely on the basis of protecting health, without taking costs into account. How the standards can be attained, and at what expense, is considered later, when states draw up detailed plans to meet the goals.
But industry groups are already calling the new standards impossible to meet at any realistic price, and challenging the scientific basis for the rules.
"The E.P.A.'s proposal isn't based on sound scientific research," said Owen Drey, an environmental specialist at the National Association of Manufacturers, which is coordinating a broad assault by industry on the proposal. "The restrictions the new, more stringent standards will have on business expansion and start-up will have a chilling effect on economic growth in this country."
David Hawkins, an air pollution specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the proposal "an important step in improving public health protection."
Mr. Hawkins said the environmental group would ask the agency to alter some of the technical provisions, including those that allow repeated violations of some of the standards. "Seven strikes and you're out," he said, "seems like an excessive number of strikes."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "SORTING IT OUT: Understanding the Ozone and Particulate Pollution Standards"
 
OZONE -- A highly irritating, colorless gas that is the main component of smog. It is formed by reactions between nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Near the ground, ozone is a serious pollutant, not to be confused with the stratospheric ozone layer that protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation.
 EXISTING STANDARDS -- Ozone should not be allowed to exceed 120 parts per billion in the air for one hour.
 PROPOSED STANDARDS -- Would limit this kind of pollution to 80 parts per billion over an eight-hour period.
 
PARTICULATE MATTER -- These complex mixtures of particles and vapors can be emitted directly into the air or are formed in the atmosphere when chemicals like hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides combine.
 EXISTING STANDARDS -- Limited to 10 microns in diameter or less (a human hair is about 70 microns thick), to no more than 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air measured daily and an annual average of no more than 50 micrograms per cubic meter.
 PROPOSED STANDARDS -- Would limit smaller particles, of 2.5 microns or less, to concentrations of 50 micrograms per cubic meter daily and 15 micrograms per cubic meter annually.
 
HEALTH EFFECTS -- Ozone and fine particles can both damage lung tissues and aggravate existing respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis. Children, outdoor workers, and the frail elderly could be especially at risk from breathing polluted air.
 
WHERE IT COMES FROM -- Hydrocarbons like the volatile organic compounds that evaporate from petroleum products and nitrogen oxides that come from burning fossil fuels can form into both ozone and particulate matter. There are many other sources of particulate matter, and both types of pollution come generally from combustion of fuels by power plants, factories, and automobiles. (pg. B20)

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
A Meal With Family Alleviates the Burden For a Dying Man

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Sheila Dean will not say, not out loud, why Thanksgiving is so special this year. She will hint at the reason, whisper about it. For Anthony Dean, the man she lives with and plans to marry and whose name she has already taken, there will be no Thanksgiving next year, the doctors say.
Mr. Dean is dying of cancer. With luck, he will see Christmas, maybe his 57th birthday in January. Sitting in the half light of their downtown Brooklyn apartment, Sheila Dean silently mouthed the words, "I don't know if he is going to live." 
 Today is the last holiday he can count on, perhaps the last chance to gather his daughters and grandson around a table. His brother, Zachary, whom he has not seen in more than 30 years, promised to come from Kentucky.
But the Deans could not afford Thanksgiving dinner.
Together, they receive a little more than $1,000 a month in Social Security disability payments, but it is not enough. After rent for their apartment in the Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses and other bills, there is barely money for food. His health insurance is limited, and there is a $1,144.59 pharmacy bill they cannot pay.
Their apartment is cluttered with medicine bottles. Doctors' phone numbers are on stickers close to the phone. An unwinning lottery ticket lies on a night table. "We get the groceries, and when you get into the third or fourth week, things start running out," Ms. Dean said.
On Tuesday, with the help of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which begins its 85th annual appeal on Sunday, the Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens gave Ms. Dean $20 for a turkey. Catholic Charities, one of seven agencies supported by the fund, also gave a basketful of trimmings and help with the medical bills.
This year, the average Thanksgiving feast costs $3.17 a person, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, which surveys shoppers nationwide each year to track the cost of a meal that includes turkey, stuffing, cranberries, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas and pumpkin pie.
As meals go these days, $3.17 -- roughly $32 for a family of 10 -- does not sound like a lot. But it is beyond the means of thousands of New Yorkers. They are sick or homeless, elderly or orphaned, unemployed or just down on their luck. Like Mr. Dean, many are proud people, more accustomed to giving charity than seeking it.
"You can thank God that you have each other," Mr. Dean said the other day. "You shouldn't even ask for anything else. Sometimes, we have just one can of soup. We eat together and we have more fun with that one bowl than we'd have with a whole chicken. I'll say, 'Get out of my bowl, that's my noodle. Put my piece back.' We have so much fun."
Despite Mr. Dean's willingness to make the best of his lot, Ms. Dean, who is 42, knew the thought of not being able to provide the holiday dinner was bothering him. "He's from the old school," she said, calling him her soul mate. "He's a manly man. He has a sense of responsibility."
Her sense of urgency overtaking her pride, she called Cindy Blumenthal, a social worker at Brooklyn Hospital, who had offered help if they ever needed it. "I'm calling you on your word," Ms. Dean said. Ms. Blumenthal referred the Deans to Catholic Charities.
Today, in soup kitchens and homeless shelters, in community centers and private homes, thousands of needy New Yorkers will eat Thanksgiving dinners provided in an annual ritual of kindness that begins the most crucial weeks of the year for social service organizations relying on charitable donations. Statistics show that the holiday season is even more vital to charities than it is to retail businesses.
According to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, charities raise about 31 percent of their annual receipts between Oct. 1 and the year's end. In retail, 27 percent of the year's revenues come during that final quarter, according to the National Retail Federation.
Among those charities is The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which since 1912 has supported some of the city's largest social service agencies in offering a hand to New Yorkers who need one. The Times pays the fund's overhead, so all donations go to services.
Across New York, where despair is matched blow for blow by hope, the Deans are far from alone: At the Children's Aid Society's Dunlevy Milbank Community Center in Harlem, 700 people will eat more than 100 turkeys donated by many of the city's largest hotels and prepared under the supervision of Ron Roccasecca, the chef at the New York Sheraton Hotel and Towers.
About 500 meals are to be served at the El Greco Diner on Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. On Staten Island, five children at Geller House, a way station run by the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services for adolescents headed into foster care, will eat dinner together. Among them is a 15-year-old boy who thought he had been saved years ago when he was adopted by his foster mother in Queens, only to lose her to cancer and wind up back in the child welfare system, shuffling from home to home.
Some dinners were held early, like one last Thursday at the Waverly Day Care Center run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, where youngsters from Fort Greene and Clinton Hill were taught the holiday's lessons of charity and goodwill.
"The Pilgrims cook food for the Indians, then they have a big feast and they eat the food together and they share," explained Duvon Murph, 5. "The Indians help show the Pilgrims how to hunt and make clothes out of animal skin, and then they sell it on the ship and they sailed over the great blue sea."
More than 94 percent of households who give to human service charities reported doing so because they were asked, according to the Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy. There is no solicitation for the Neediest Cases Fund, meaning it relies solely on readers of articles in the newspaper.
The articles, chronicling the city's needy and their benefactors, appear throughout the appeal, which ends Feb. 28.
Like Anthony Dean, many people who are assisted by the fund had always relied on their own resources. Mr. Dean worked all his life at Tocci Brothers, a garbage hauler in Brooklyn. He rode the trucks and worked in the plant, doing trash separation and recycling, consistently winning promotions. He was a supervisor of 25 workers when he was forced to quit after heart surgery a year ago.
He still wears his blue work shirt, his nickname "Shorty" embroidered on it in white script, and he misses working more than he can say. He likes to boast that there wasn't a machine he couldn't fix.
"I think everybody should have a job," he said. "And see what it is to lose it."
Sheila Dean once dreamed of breeding dogs and raising horses and of becoming a veterinarian. She studied at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University and at Medgar Evers College, but congestive heart failure left her unable to work, unable to pursue her dream, she said.
Mr. Dean had hoped to return to work after his bypass operation. But last month, doctors at Brooklyn Hospital Center found a tumor between his ribs -- inoperable liver cancer, they said -- and gave him two or three months to live. Now, the pain in his side often makes him double over.
Sometimes, Ms. Dean tries to borrow money from friends, which makes Mr. Dean angry.
"That's why I want a part-time job," he shouted.
Mr. Dean is a short, slightly built man, bald with a wisp of a beard. His moods swing from anger and depression about his terminal illness to gratitude for his caretakers to worry and concern about "his baby," as he calls Ms. Dean. Often, it is not easy.
"You have to take the good with the bad, the sour with the sweet," Ms. Dean said.
"Hey," Mr. Dean interjected, "even if I take you to the movies and I can't buy you no popcorn, at least I still let you rub my head, don't I?"
They are planning to marry in January, sometime near Mr. Dean's birthday, Jan. 8.
"If God spares my life," he said.
At the Dean home tonight, the menu includes Ms. Dean's secret-recipe potato salad, yams and baked macaroni with extra cheese. Mr. Dean said he would bake corn bread, and he listed the desserts.
"Apple pie, ice cream, sodas, apple juice, you know, things kids like," he said. "And each other. If it's going to be my last Thanksgiving, I want it to be a nice one."

HEADLINE: A World Fed Up With Bribes;
Nations Begin Following U.S. Curbs on Corruption

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Almost 20 years after the United States became the only country to prohibit its corporations from bribing foreign officials to win contracts, the rest of the world may finally be ready to act against bribes and corruption in business deals.
In recent months, international development funds, economic alliances and the International Chamber of Commerce have all taken steps to curb corruption. 
 The World Bank has begun spot audits of its development loan programs, which last year disbursed $19 billion, and instituted procurement rules that empower it to investigate corruption complaints and to blacklist companies and governments guilty of large-scale graft.
The 28 democracies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have committed themselves to ending the practice of letting businesses deduct foreign bribes, often reported as commissions or fees, from income taxes.
And the International Monetary Fund has made "tackling corruption" an economic priority, authorizing its managing director, Michel Camdessus, to press for anti-corruption reforms in borrowing countries.
"The ministry of finance will no longer be able tell the I.M.F. this is none of your business," Mr. Camdessus said.
These actions, after decades of indifference to the issue by Japan, Europe and the international loan funds, are in part the result of pressure from the United States, whose corporations complain that restrictions in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 cost them billions of dollars in business every year.
American companies refuse to name contracts they have lost because they would not pay bribes, or the countries and governments involved, certain that doing so would bar them from any work there.
But many are sure they are losing business because of the ban. "We are highly vulnerable to bribery because of the size of the orders our members get" said Joel L. Johnson, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington-based organization representing manufacturers of civilian and military aircraft, radar and other airport equipment. "We've taken some considerable hits around the world."
International concern about corrupt practices is following a rising tide of scandal, and growing evidence in many countries of public disgust with corrupt officials and institutions. From South Korea to India, from Italy and France to Venezuela and Brazil, scandals have forced politicians from office and sent executives to jail.
"The tide is definitely turning," said Peter Eigen, the head of Transparency International, a group devoted to fighting business corruption, financed in part by American corporations. "We don't know whether corruption is getting worse, but we do know it is not being tolerated as it was."
Mr. Eigen, who left the World Bank to found his organization because of the corruption he saw in developing countries, called the bank's stand "revolutionary," saying, "In the past the bank shied away from the corruption issue because it looked like interference in a country's domestic affairs."
No one knows how much corruption there is in the business world, or to what extent it is increasing. Many experts say it is probably growing with the world economy and with the leap in foreign direct investment in emerging economies, to $167 billion last year from $44 billion in 1990.
Bribery and kickbacks have become common in former Communist countries as they embrace free enterprise. The spread of democracy can create new incentives for corruption as competing political parties seek campaign contributions. In the third world, some development projects may be more valuable for their graft opportunities than their direct benefits.
"My own commercial experience, spanning 30 years and 5 continents, convinces me it is a far more serious and damaging problem than it was even 10 years ago," the British businessman George Moody-Stuart wrote last year in his book "Grand Corruption in Third World Development."
At the same time, corporations have great incentive to go along with bribe solicitations: contracts worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for military supplies, aircraft, civil works and communications. In a 1995 report, Mickey Kanton, then the United States trade representative, said American companies lost $45 billion of overseas contracts the previous year because of the bribery ban.
That report did not disclose the names of corporations or countries, either. It is based on a study that used the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency and is classified.
The American law, however, resulted in part from a Senate investigation from 1975 to 1977 of the Lockheed Corporation, now Lockheed Martin, which was found to have paid $22 million in bribes to win aircraft orders. In 1995, the company pleaded guilty under the act to new charges, admitting that an executive paid an Egyptian official to assure the purchase of three C-130 cargo planes.
Other experts point to forces that are making the public less tolerant of corruption, ranging from its increased visibility to a better understanding of its cost.
The end of the cold war, for example, has freed democracies from having to tolerate graft-ridden regimes to keep them in the Western camp, argued Moses Naim, a former Venezuelan trade and industry minister who is now director of Latin American studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
The spread of free-market economics, he said, is making "government decisions more transparent, increasing the accountability of public officials and reducing the impunity that has often accompanied the corruption of those in high places."
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have their own motivation for acting: the perception that much development money ends up in Swiss bank accounts can make governments reluctant to vote aid. But as both agencies this year, for the first time, declared corruption the enemy of development, they also had new evidence. A 1995 study by an I.M.F. economist, Paul Mauro, forcefully concluded that corruption reduces growth.
"In country after country, it is the people who are demanding action on this issue," the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, said. "They know corruption diverts resources from the poor to the rich, increases the cost of running businesses, distorts public expenditures and deters foreign investors."
Corruption has become a government-toppling issue in many countries. In South Korea, where two former presidents, Chun Doo Hwan and Rho Tae Woo, were convicted this year for the coup with which they took power in 1979; they were also convicted of taking hundreds of millions in bribes from companies, including Samsung, Daewoo and Hyundai.
In Japan, payment scandals in the 1980's brought down both Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita and the chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. Then, in 1994, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned amid allegations of payments from a trucking company and N.T.T.
In Europe, corruption charges brought down Ireland's Prime Minister, Charles Haughey, in 1992 and Italy's Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in 1995. Italians now call Milan, their business capital, Tangentopoli: "kickback city."
Transparency International has created a Corruption Perception Index for 54 countries, based on a "poll of polls" of 10 surveys by organizations like DRI/McGraw Hill Global Risk Service and the Institute for Management Development, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, that ask executives how corrupt they perceived countries to be.
The 1996 index shows that New Zealand is perceived by the business community as being the least corrupt, scoring 9.43 on a scale of 10.00. Most corrupt is Nigeria, scoring only 0.69, followed by Pakistan, Kenya, Bangladesh and China.
The United States, where an Indonesian business family's influence in the White House became an issue during President Clinton's re-election campaign, is 15th on the index, with a score of 7.66, higher than Japan, France and Belgium, but lower than Israel, Britain, Germany and Singapore.
Many of the gains in attacking corruption, meanwhile, are due to the Clinton Administration finally making headway in its campaign to create a level playing field for American companies, which complain that the 1977 ban on bribery puts them at a disadvantage to foreign rivals who are free to buy contracts from corrupt ministers.
This year the United States became the 23d of the Organization of American States' 34 members to sign a convention that has been under negotiation since the Miami Summit of the Americas in May 1994, outlawing cross-border bribery and the "illicit enrichment" of officials in the hemisphere. It also helps in the investigation of bribery charges and speeds extradition procedures.
So far only Paraguay has ratified the convention as well as signed it. But only two countries need to ratify the agreement for it to become binding on all who have signed it.
Unlike the Bush Administration, which had shown little interest in the subject, the Clinton Administration set a high priority on securing international action against bribery and corruption as soon as it took office.
In May 1994, the United States prodded a reluctant Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development into setting up a working group to draft an anti-corruption proposal that would include criminalizing bribery and ending the tax deductibility of bribes.
After successfully tackling the deductibility issue, Mark Pieth, the working group's Swiss chairman, is now seeking an agreement to make the bribery of foreign officials a crime in time for next May's annual ministerial meeting. That meeting will also receive a report on compliance with this year's agreement to end the tax deductibility of bribes.
Some powerful private business groups are also throwing their weight behind the American campaign. Last March, the International Chamber of Commerce approved revised rules of conduct for its thousands of member companies and business associations that prohibit bribes and encourage them to press their governments to adopt the proposed O.E.C.D. anti-bribery convention.
But a new study of those negotiations by Mr. Naim of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in collaboration with Patrick Glynn of the American Enterprise Institute and Stephen J. Kobrin of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says many European countries remain only reluctant supporters of the American initiative. It concludes that "achieving the needed legal reforms in Europe -- and perhaps even more in Asia -- will mean a prolonged and hard fight."

HEADLINE: Trial Ends In Hung Jury In '81 Killing Of a Surgeon

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
A gunshot during a botched robbery ended the life of a young surgeon on a Manhattan street, and the city recoiled from the senseless waste. But public attention is fleeting, and interest in the shooting faded almost as quickly as the echoes of the shot that killed Dr. John Wood in 1981.
For years the case remained unsolved. But a detective, Gennaro Giorgio, kept pursuing it patiently. Finally, in 1994, he arrested a suspect. The man, an unemployed janitor named Patrick McDowell, was charged with the murder of Dr. Wood. The arrest, after the 13-year lapse, drew press interest across the country. 
 Mr. McDowell's trial ended yesterday. But the long and painful case is still not over. The jury was deadlocked and could not reach a verdict, and the District Attorney plans to try the case again.
In the last week, jurors in State Supreme Court in Manhattan were asked to peer back over 15 years to the crime. The difficulties were formidable. Witnesses have died or moved away. Evidence has been lost. Memories have shifted or faded. But the prosecution thought there was enough evidence to convict Mr. McDowell, a man who has spent 10 of the last 15 years in prison for killing a woman during a robbery.
But after two and a half days of deliberations, jurors could not reach a verdict on the charge of felony murder. The jury acquitted Mr. McDowell on the second charge against him, intentional murder. The difference in the charges lies in intent: felony murder involves killing another person in the course of a robbery or other felony, whether or not the killer intended to do so.
After jury members repeatedly said they could not reach a verdict, Justice Edwin Torres declared a mistrial. Besides saying that a retrial was planned, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau declined to comment further on the case.
Mr. McDowell, who has spent two years and four months in jail awaiting trial, was returned to prison to await the retrial, expected early next year. His lawyer, Francis Karam, said he would request that his client be freed on bail.
"I am disappointed it was a hung jury," Mr. Karam said. "I did not think there was enough evidence to convict."
The prosecution's case was based on statements that Mr. McDowell made to the police in several interviews in 1982 and 1994, as well as the testimony of two people who said that the defendant confessed to them. There was no physical evidence linking Mr. McDowell to the shooting. Eyewitness testimony, while inconclusive, seemed to give support to the defense's contention that someone else committed the murder.
Detective Giorgio, a 36-year veteran of the police force, testified that Mr. McDowell told him that another man had committed the murder. But he said that Mr. McDowell admitted obtaining a gun for the man before the robbery in which the doctor was killed. The man who supplied the gun, Glenn Richardson, testified that Mr. McDowell admitted that he shot Dr. Wood.
The prosecution's third witness, Angela Spenser, testified that Mr. McDowell admitted to the killing during a chance meeting several years later.
However, the defense made much of the fact that Mr. Richardson, a convicted drug dealer, was testifying in exchange for a lesser Federal prison sentence. Mr. Karam, the defense lawyer, also pointed out that Ms. Spenser, an admitted crack addict, told the police of her conversation with Mr. McDowell after she was picked up in a drug sweep. Ms. Spenser was not charged with any crime.
The defense presented an alibi that Mr. McDowell was home with his girlfriend, who later became his wife, the night of the robbery. Carmella McDowell, who is now an executive secretary, testified that Mr. McDowell was with her when the shooting occurred.
Mr. Karam said his client has not been offered a plea bargain by the District Attorney's office since the jury's decision. He said his client maintained his innocence.
"From the first day he has told me he was innocent, and he has never said anything different," Mr. Karam said.

Computer Stocks Rally, But Dow Declines 29.07
The Nasdaq market gained for the fourth consecutive session, lifted by a rally in computer issues that sent its index up 6.12 points, to 1,287.32.
The Dow Jones industrial average, in its first two-day losing streak in more than a month, slid 29.07 points, to 6,499.34, as Disney and oil shares fell with investors taking profits before the Thanksgiving holiday. [Page D7.]
 
The prices of Treasury securities rose in a shortened session, bolstered by a surge in the dollar against the Japanese yen. The 30-year bond gained 7/32, to 1011/32, pushing its yield down to 6.42 percent. [D13.]
 
Economic Growth Revised to 2%
The economy's growth was just slightly slower in the third quarter than initially estimated -- 2 percent versus 2.2 percent -- the Commerce Department said. Also, orders for durable goods rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October, suggesting that the nation is continuing to enjoy modest growth and low inflation. [D4.]
 
AT&T Upsets Japanese Competitors
AT&T upset Japanese competitors by offering to provide discount international calls to Japanese customers, using a technique known as call-back service to make calls technically originate in America, where rates are lower. Some countries prohibit the technique, and AT&T itself once condemned it as unfair. [D3.]
 
Cardinal Health to Buy Owen
Cardinal Health said it would buy Owen Healthcare for $27.25 a share, or $496 million, in stock. By combining Owen's pharmacy management services with its own drug distribution network, Cardinal intends to broaden the services it offers hospitals. [D2.]
 
In an Accord, Technology Before Art
Hollywood directors and cinematographers are conspicuously unhappy with this week's landmark agreement on digital television by the computer, broadcasting and consumer electronics industries. Despite aggressive lobbying by directors like Steven Spielberg, the film makers fear that their movie images will be cropped to fit TV screens. [D2.]
 
Environmental Rules Sought
The Clinton Administration proposed tighter air quality standards, saying that children, asthmatics, people who work outdoors and the frail elderly needed more protection from choking smog and soot. Industry groups criticized the proposals, which had been expected, as unnecessary and costly, while environmental groups were supportive. [A1.]
 
Economists find the E.P.A.'s new standards problematic in that they lump together the strong case for reducing particulates and the relatively weak case against tightening the air quality standards for ozone.

HEADLINE: Miami Looks to State for Fiscal Oversight

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Gov. Lawton Chiles is considering whether to establish state financial oversight of the City of Miami after being told by the Mayor that its fiscal problems were dire enough for such a step.
Reeling from a corruption scandal and a huge budget deficit attributed to mismanagement, Miami faces a state declaration of financial emergency that could result in Florida's first appointment of a state board to oversee a city's finances. 
 In a meeting with the Governor on Tuesday night, the Mayor, Joe Carollo, said the city had to deal with a larger budget deficit than the $68 million previously identified, although he gave no specific amount. Mr. Carollo said recurring deficits were now estimated at $50 million a year instead of $30 million.
The Mayor did not return calls to his office today. But state officials said they were reviewing the situation to determine whether they should invoke a state law that would give the state authority to impose a number of measures, including requiring the Governor's approval of the city budget, banning the city from issuing bonds and setting up a "financial emergencies" board to oversee city government.
Although the state has stepped in to help other fiscally troubled local governments in the past, Robert Bradley, Florida's Budget Director, said an oversight board had never been appointed but was contemplated for Miami because of the "size and complexity" of its problems.
A determination of a fiscal emergency could also be a step toward seeking Federal bankruptcy protection, but state and city officials said today that it was too early to tell whether such a move was feasible.
"Bankruptcy is an end of a process, Mr. Bradley said, "and we're right at the beginning."
Reaction to the news was swift and largely critical of the Mayor and the four other members of the City Commission, who are widely seen as trying to pass off responsibility for such decisions as raising fees for city services to help close the budget gap. The news also does not bode well for the re-election prospects next year for Mayor Carollo and two other commissioners. There is already a movement among angry residents to abolish the city and have its government taken over by Dade County.
One of the nation's bond rating services, Standard & Poor's, downgraded Miami's debt rating today for the second time since the fiscal crisis was first reported last September, this time giving it a noninvestment grade of single B. In a written statement, the service cited Miami's "limited progress to date in addressing its significant budgetary imbalance" and pointedly noted the recent postponement of a Commission vote on doubling garbage collection fees.
"You have a city in severe financial crisis, and the fact that they can't come together to implement a garbage fee is just unacceptable from a credit point of view," said Robin Prunty, a spokeswoman for Standard & Poor's in New York.
Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida International University said: "No one has the courage to do what is necessary, so the easy way out is to have someone impose it on them."
Yet in a letter to city officials last week, Governor Chiles warned that "solving your problem responsibly within the city government is a far better solution" than having the state take over.
A Miami Commissioner, Wilfredo Gort, agreed that the city had not done all it could and called Mayor Carollo's assessment "premature."
"I'm ready to bite the bullet," said Mr. Gort, one of two Commissioners who have said they would vote to increase fees. "We're elected to make decisions."
But a supporter of the Mayor, Commissioner Tomas Regalado, argued that other options, like layoffs and collecting garbage fees from those who do not pay them now, should be considered before "a step to burden poor people" like raising fees is taken.
The Miami Herald quoted Mayor Carollo today as saying that a state oversight board worked for New York City, which was at the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970's before the State Financial Control Board imposed fiscal austerity, "and look at New York -- it came back stronger than ever."
Miami's fiscal crisis came to light this past summer after the corruption scandal and subsequent resignations of several top city officials, including the city manager and the finance director. Dade County's tourism chief, who was brought in as an acting city manager to deal with the emergency, traced the budget deficit to loose financial controls and the comingling of funds. The official, Merrett R. Stierheim, presented a plan earlier this month on how the city could deal with the problem. In a report, Mr. Stierheim recommended such steps as raising fees, selling city properties and winning concessions from labor unions.
Mr. Stierheim, who has returned to his job promoting Miami and Dade County's 28 other cities as the president of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, declined to comment today on the latest developments, saying his report spoke for itself.
Explaining his hopes for the city, Mayor Carollo told The Associated Press, "We need to rebuild Miami top to bottom and change the third world system that has been running this city for so long."

HEADLINE: By Plane, Car and Boat, a Holiday Is On

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Air fares, gasoline and hotel rooms are more expensive this year than last, and even turkeys will cost almost 8 percent more. But none of that will dampen the holiday spirit for millions of Americans this Thanksgiving, including a record 31.8 million who are expected to travel 100 miles or more from home over the four-day weekend.
That is not only 3 percent more travelers than last Thanksgiving, but it is the most in the 12 years that the American Automobile Association has been reporting such statistics. The Air Transport Association is also predicting a record 13.5 million passengers this week, up from 11.6 million last year. 
 On Sunday, the busiest single day of the year, the average flight is expected to be 80 percent filled. That compares with a 70.3 "load factor" through October of this year -- well on its way to eclipsing last year's 67.3 percent, the highest load factor in at least 50 years.
Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least two hours early for domestic flights, and three hours early for international flights.
An improving economy is helping spur the projected record travel, as are memories of last winter's blizzards and incesssant snowstorms over much of the country that made travel difficult, if not impossible. Now, travel industry officials say, people are determined to get away when they can.
James and Nancy Moeller of Phoenix flew to Portland last Monday, to board the Queen of the West for a seven-day cruise along rivers in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. It is the first inland river trip for Mr. Moeller, a Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, and the first time in 35 years the Moellers will have been away on Thanksgiving. "But we won't be away from Thanksgiving dinner," Mrs. Moeller said, "because they're serving one on board."
Some 45 million turkeys will be consumed for Thanksgiving, said Stephanie Bergman of the National Turkey Federation -- even though the average price has increased to 84 cents a pound from 78 cents last year.
There are no comparable figures for pumpkin pies. But Marriott Management Services, which supplies corporate and college cafeterias with pies as well as other foods, discovered that in the past two years corporate employees and students were buying so many pumpkin and other holiday pies -- 105,000 last year -- that the company wound up with a surprise niche business.
For many employees, Thanksgiving is a four-day holiday, including the weekend, and that has greatly helped spur the record travel. According to the Bureau of National Affairs, a research and publishing company, 69 percent of employers are giving workers two days off for Thanksgiving, up 6 percent from last year. And with the trend in recent years to more and shorter vacations, four days are about all that many people need.
In recognition of that, and to fill planes at odd hours, a number of airlines offered special fares this year for Thanksgiving travelers who want to make a quick holiday trip. Delta Air Lines, for example, offered a variety of round trips from $96 (for example, between Memphis and Dallas/Fort Worth) to $196 (New York-Seattle), provided that return travel begins no later than tomorrow. American Airlines offered round trips from $88 (Chicago-Detroit) to $198 (Los Angeles-Miami), with return travel Thanksgiving Day or tomorrow. On average, though, the price of a domestic airline ticket has is almost 20 percent higher than it was last year.
Gasoline prices are 15.4 cents higher than they were a year ago, according to the automobile association, with self-serve regular unleaded at its highest price (averaging $1.28 a gallon) for a Thanksgiving holiday since 1990. And the nearly nine million travelers expected to stay in hotels this week (3 percent more than last year) will find room rates 6.6 percent higher, on average, at $71.48 a night.
Many Thanksgiving travelers are almost guaranteed to "waste time," at airports or on the open road. The automobile association has cited 10 of the worst major highway bottlenecks, places where motorists can expect big delays because of construction or obsolete roads.
These include Houston, where the single lane exiting U.S. 59 at the Interstate 610 Loop regularly causes stop-and-go conditions for up to six hours a day; I-5 in Los Angeles at the intersection with I-10, State Route 60 and State Route 101, where bottlenecks extend for miles, and the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, where "significant delays" between the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Belt Parkway occur for six or more hours on a typical day.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The National Pastime's True M.V.P.

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A new baseball labor agreement was so elusive that it defied the intervention of President Clinton. Then Randy Levine came along.
In just one year on the job as the owners' chief negotiator, the Brooklyn-born grandson of two men who were union leaders succeeded where the President, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, John Calhoun Wells of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the veteran mediator William J. Usery, Richard Ravitch, Bud Selig, John Harrington, Jerry McMorris and Charles O'Connor had failed. 
That is why Major League Baseball today is about to embark on an era of labor peace and, it expects, economic growth.
A few issues have to be cleared up before the union's executive board ratifies the new agreement next week. But it is highly unlikely that Levine would now encounter problems with Donald Fehr, the players' labor chief, after they made a breakthrough that, while not unprecedented, was unusual, and after the owners turned their repudiation of Levine into vindication.
"I don't look at it as I was repudiated or vindicated," Levine said yesterday before leaving with his wife, Mindy, for a holiday weekend in the country. "I look at it as the process was vindicated. Here is an agreement that will go on for the next five years that makes revolutionary changes."
The owners did not initially want to accept the changes, rejecting the agreement by an 18-12 vote. But three weeks later, at a meeting in Chicago on Tuesday, they embraced the agreement, 26-4, deciding that it was better to put their arms around something than to fill their heads and stomachs with more aches.
"I was very disappointed because I'm human," Levine said of the initial rejection. "Now I feel gratified to have been a part of solving this process and trying to restore baseball to where I think it belongs -- as the national pastime."
But why was Levine able to succeed where all of those others had failed? It was not a new experience for the 41-year-old lawyer, who likes to play golf, ride horses, stroll in the woods in Duchess County, where he and his wife spend weekends on their mini-farm. He also walks the streets of Manhattan when he takes his two Labradors out at 6 A.M. and midnight every day. After all, he came to his $600,000-a-year baseball job from his post as New York City's labor commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"In my experience as a negotiator," Levine said, "most of my assignments have been in extraordinarily tough situations where people thought things couldn't change and where often other people hadn't been able to get the job done through no fault of their own. I guess it's just a certain style I have. I try to view collective bargaining as problem solving, not as winning or losing, not about hurting the next guy. It's about industries where people have to work together. I always try to keep my word; if you can't, you don't have credibility. I guess I'm also a bit of a masochist."
Ron Shapiro, a prominent player agent, offered another reason.
"When Randy Levine came on the scene, he brought a combination of credibility and sensitivity to his office that never had existed there before," Shapiro said, speaking from 20 years of baseball experience. "That broke the dam of mistrust between the union and the player relations committee."
Lauren Rich, one of the primary negotiators through the long-running dispute, was one of the union people who came to appreciate Levine's skills.
"In order to get something like this done, given what we've gone through," she said, "you need two people who always will be searching for solutions and who are willing to bang heads among their constituencies. Randy was always searching for ways to accommodate interests on both sides and was willing, when he thought he got to that point, to bang heads. None of their other chief negotiators brought those things to the table with such a passion."
One person who was not surprised by Levine's achievement was the man he worked for before he stepped into baseball's field of land mines.
"Part of the problem the city used to have in labor relations was the unions didn't trust the city," Giuliani said. "They felt the city was hiding money. The core of Randy's ability is a relationship of trust and confidence, trying to figure out what's the objective we want to reach and how to get there so everyone has confidence we're not trying to hide anything."
Giuliani cited two examples of Levine's work for the city: the workfare program in which people on welfare work for the city in return for their benefits and a severance and redeployment program in which the city bought out 23,000 municipal employees and transferred workers from one agency to another to fill resulting gaps.
But, the Mayor said, "What he had to accomplish in baseball was more difficult."
Levine, a graduate of Hofstra Law School, first became involved in baseball in 1990 as outside counsel to George Steinbrenner and the Yankees when he was a partner with Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn. In that role, Levine attended the owners' first meeting on revenue sharing in Kohler, Wis., in 1993.
A lawyer with the Justice Department in Washington from 1985 to 1988, he worked in Giuliani's mayoral campaigns in 1989 and 1993, then joined the administration as labor commissioner, a post he held for about two years. Then baseball beckoned. "I took this job because I love baseball," Levine said. "I thought I could contribute to solving this nightmare. I never saw an industry where there was more mistrust -- on both sides. I think Don was skeptical at first, but as we took baby steps, then giant steps that weekend in August, I think we came to have a mutual respect."
That weekend, Aug. 9-11, was the turning point in the negotiations.
"I think the key was late Friday night," Levine said. "I told the union I was authorized to make a last and final offer and go to court if necessary. We both knew once we did that, it would be hard to make a deal. We had real serious discussions about what the issues were. After that, we started to break through on the tax threshold, the number of years on the luxury tax revenue sharing. We started to build momentum."
Despite his efforts, Levine found himself on the short end of the owners' Nov. 6 vote and prepared to resign. He may still leave the job sooner rather than later, but he said he has made no decision.
"I'm going to take a nice long respite after the agreement is signed," he said. "I'll take some time off, go upstate, smell the flowers a little bit and see where we go from there. We'll weigh all the opportunities, whether in baseball or outside, and see what happens."
Whether sooner or later, Levine will very likely return to the Giuliani administration, perhaps as deputy mayor. Asked yesterday about that possibility, Giuliani said, "You can be certain, one way or another, we'll be working together again."

HEADLINE: Lithuania Will Share Jewish Books, but How?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We are grateful for your front-page article Nov. 24 on the priceless treasure of thousands of rare Jewish books in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius that for decades had been hidden from the Nazis and later from the Soviets. 
 Lithuania greatly values its multicultural tradition and takes pride in the rich history of its Jewish community. We agree that these books should be made more accessible to scholars, and we regret that Lithuania is unable to provide proper facilities for this collection.
Unfortunately, as your article reports, the Lithuanian National Library is strapped for cash, with only a bare-bones budget for preserving and restoring rare books. Indeed, these valuable Yiddish and Hebrew-language volumes -- whose proper safeguarding would run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- are among many books (in various languages) faced with dire problems of preservation. This is part of the price Lithuania is paying during a difficult economic transition.
In 1997, the 200-year anniversary of the death of the Gaon of Vilnius, who wrote some of the books in the collection, will be commemorated by a conference in Vilnius. This meeting of scholars will be an excellent opportunity to discuss ways to cooperate in preserving this collection. One idea might be the construction of a separate library. We welcome all suggestions and support from Americans concerned with the fate of this great Lithuanian Jewish cultural heritage.

HEADLINE: How Not to Book Better Math and Science;
Children First

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When I heard the first news reports that our kids had done better than eighth graders in other countries (news article, Nov. 21), I thought America was doing better by its children -- until I read the fine print. We barely made it into the top half of nations in science, reaching 17 out of 41. 
 Perhaps it is time to admit there is a design flaw in the system itself. The best teacher gets no better treatment than the worst. Violence is a daily threat. Multiple choice, "dumbed down" textbooks, patronizing grade inflation and unearned self-esteem too often reign supreme. Bureaucracy is overwhelming and inefficient in district after district.
And no one gets fired. Not the uncaring teacher. Not the administrator who refuses to deal with discipline problems. And not the politician who sells his soul for re-election support from those who care more for power and patronage than for kids.
Some day educators will begin school by assessing the capacity of each individual child to learn. Some day parents will insist on results, not grades; on acquired ethics and morals, not unearned self-esteem. And some day business will have the integrity to announce that never again will it sponsor an advertisement that advocates, through its music or shows, violence against women, drug use or the killing of police officers.
That will be the day that America becomes the nation that puts its children first.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Texas Meeting Seeks a Rebirth of Populism" (news article, Nov. 25): It's encouraging to see that there are people willing to meet and address the problem of corporate dominance of the American economy. 
 For years, I have avoided heavily advertised products. In Portland, unleaded gas prices vary, from $1.39 a gallon for Chevron, say, to $1.13 for smaller, unadvertised brands.
With a little effort, we can support products whose prices are not inflated by expensive TV ads, which add nothing to an item except a feeling of being in the in crowd. If we behave like sheep, we will give a lot of power to the wolves.

HEADLINE: The Looming Clean Air Battle

 BODY:
The Clean Air Act of 1970 -- strengthened by President Carter in 1977 and by President Bush in 1990 -- has greatly improved the quality of America's air. Responding to tough Federal mandates, science and industry have produced cleaner cars, fuels and power plants. The Federal Government now says it will try to draw the regulatory noose even tighter to help hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from respiratory diseases.
The proposed regulations, announced Wednesday, have already stirred the biggest political ruckus in Carol Browner's four-year tenure as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. They will surely be costly, to industry and consumers. But in public health terms, her decision is the right one. Her task now will be to allow cities, states and industry enough time to adjust to the new regulations in a measured, cost-effective way. 
 The new rules would triple the number of counties nationwide where state and local officials would have to impose stricter rules to clean up the air. At least 100 million people live in those areas. Business groups and many governors have been lobbying hard against the proposals and can be expected to do so in the months ahead when the rules will be open for public comment before they are finally written into law. Critics question the science on which the rules are based and argue that the billions they will have to spend on pollution control will not produce comparable health benefits.
The proposed rules address two problems. The first is the health damage caused by "particulate matter." Broadly speaking, current regulations are designed to trap airborne microscopic particles as small as 10 microns in diameter (a human hair is 70 microns). But many scientists have concluded that particles smaller than 10 microns are the deadliest because they can evade the body's natural defenses and lodge in the most fragile sections of the lungs. The new rules would, therefore, lower the size of the regulated particles to 2.5 microns or less.
Some studies have suggested that tighter standards could save over 20,000 lives per year and prevent widespread hospitalization for many more people who suffer from asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory ills.
The E.P.A., which by law is required to update regulations every five years but missed a 1992 deadline, has been under court order to issue new particulate standards. But Wednesday's proposals also included tighter standards for ground-level ozone, which helps create smog. Those regulations are also out of date. Since particulates and ozone share some of the same sources, including coal-fired power plants, many of the same pollution-control strategies, like cleaner fuels, for example, can be applied to both.
The E.P.A. has conducted four years' worth of scientific studies, many of which industry challenges. But an equally hot issue involves costs and benefits. Under the Clean Air Act, Ms. Browner's sole obligation is to set standards that protect public health with an "adequate margin of safety." She, nevertheless, conducted various economic analyses, as required by an executive order asking Federal rule-making agencies to make available their best estimates. Such estimates are necessarily inexact. But the E.P.A.'s analysis suggests that the benefits of small-particle reduction outweigh the costs by a substantial margin -- an estimated $51 billion to $112 billion annually in reduced medical costs, fewer sick days and other benefits, against $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion in costs.
Many areas will be able to meet the new standards without taking extraordinary new steps, largely because many of the pollution-control strategies inspired by the 1990 amendments have not fully taken hold. Compliance will, however, be especially hard for congested areas like New York and Los Angeles, which are still struggling to meet the old air-quality standards.
For that reason, the E.P.A. proposes a generous time frame for compliance. New York, for example, may not have to reach full compliance for 15 years. In the meantime, the agency says it will try to assist places like New York that suffer from "imported" pollution by requiring tighter controls on out-of-state sources, like power plants in the Midwest.
The comment period will allow time for what is certain to be vigorous debate. The White House and Congress -- which can review the proposals and send them back to the E.P.A. if it does not like them -- will be under great pressure from both sides. But it seems clear that the hazards associated with dirty air are greater than originally supposed. A sensible response is clearly required.

HEADLINE: Questions About a Hospital Deal

 BODY:
A majority of the board of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation has sided with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in approving a long-term lease of Coney Island Hospital to a commercial company. The Giuliani administration is confident that the deal will save millions for the city, while preserving care for the poor. But before state officials give their required approval, there are important unanswered questions that need to be addressed.
Mr. Giuliani has long pushed to privatize or lease city hospitals in an effort to cut health costs and overhaul care for the poor. Coney Island was one of the first hospitals to be put on the auction block. Nestled in a neighborhood of elderly and poor people, it has 460 beds and a number of outpatient services. But surveys indicate that about two-thirds of nearby residents seek health care elsewhere. 
 In what would amount to a virtual sale, city officials propose to turn the hospital over to Primary Health Systems, a two-year-old Pennsylvania-based company, under a 99-year lease that could be renewed at the option of the company for another 99 years. Because of city and state restrictions on out-of-state control of public hospitals, the company has created a subsidiary, P.H.S.-N.Y., to operate the hospital.
Legal challenges by three dissenting members of the hospitals board, community groups in Coney Island and the City Council question the city's ability to strike such a deal and threaten to prolong proceedings. Even without the lawsuits the deal faces a protracted approval process through several state regulatory agencies, including the State Health Department. These agencies can properly raise questions about whether P.H.S.-N.Y. can pay for promised improvements and what will happen to indigent patients who carry no private or public insurance.
The agreement obligates the group to pay about $50 million to settle the hospital's existing capital debt. Beyond that, the group has agreed to spend $25 million for capital construction, which will include upgrading the elevators, operating rooms and plumbing, and an estimated $5 million each year on maintenance and repairs.
The lease agreement also stipulates that spending for indigent care will be raised 15 percent above current levels as adjusted annually for inflation, and kept there. But the language is vague about what kind of care will be provided and to how many patients. Critics also question whether P.H.S. has adequately anticipated the impact of harsh Federal and state changes in the welfare system. Those changes could result in increased numbers of indigent patients who seek health care. The group also has to negotiate with the labor unions, to bring about a promised 25 percent reduction in staff.
City officials insist that P.H.S. is well capitalized, but the company is also trying to purchase other hospitals and still needs to raise money to finance this and other deals. The city boasts that the deal will save taxpayers $100 million initially and $30 million each year, while still maintaining adequate care for the poor. If the deal can really deliver all this -- lower costs for the city, a renovated hospital and more care for the poor -- it is too good to pass up. But it is imperative for state officials to examine the fine print and determine whether this deal can live up to its promise.

HEADLINE: Political Infighting Halts Indiana City's Salute to a Native Son

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Nov. 28

 BODY:
It was supposed to have been the impetus to transform this gritty blue-collar city into the entertainment mecca of the Midwest. But political bickering and allegations of racism and conflict of interest have halted plans for the $2 billion entertainment complex.
Gary's most famous family is fed up, its lawyer said, and has withdrawn support for the complex because of the politics and fears of lawsuits. 
 Youngsters on the city's west side can direct visitors to the location of Michael Jackson's boyhood home, most likely including the address. "Everybody knows that around here," Malik Simmons, 11, said on his way home from school. "They even named the street after him."
The answer is partly correct. The Jackson family got its start in a modest single-story corner house on Jackson Street. But the street is named after the seventh President.
City leaders have proposed that the house be the centerpiece of a theme park near Interstates 65 and 94 that would include a Jackson family museum, an entertainment complex, hotels and stores. A Los Angeles lawyer who has been negotiating with officials for the Jackson family since last year, Brian Oxman, said the project had been stopped because of squabbling between Mayor Scott King and Mr. King's predecessor, Thomas V. Barnes.
Mr. Oxman said the family was concerned that the yearlong battle over control of the project had diminished confidence among potential investors. "It's not doable, given the current state of affairs," he said.
The dispute has highlighted the racial polarization between Mr. Barnes's old-line leadership and those who back Mr. King, the first white mayor in more than 20 years.
"It's become, unfortunately, a black and white issue," Mr. Oxman said. "Let's face it, the color of this project should be green, the color of money."
Mr. Oxman faults Mr. Barnes, the former Mayor, for the gridlock and for inserting race into the discussion. Mr. Barnes proposed the Jackson Theme Park in the second of his two terms. Late last year, his appointees to the Public Works Board voted to lease 200 acres that the city owns to a foundation formed by Mr. Barnes.
Shortly after he took office on Jan. 1, Mr. King said the lease was improper because Mr. Barnes was chairman of the foundation board, a post that he continues to occupy.
Mr. Barnes and the executive director of the foundation, Thomas Floyd, said Mr. King was seeking to freeze them out of the project to benefit the mostly white business sector. The two men said the complex should be managed by a mostly black steering group that would be more in tune with community needs.
"This is not just an important economic issue," Mr. Barnes said, "but equally important from a cultural and spiritual perspective. It's a way we can provide a cultural and moral underpinning to underprivileged African-Americans nationwide who have given up their hope of the American dream."
Mr. Floyd said Mr. King and others were convinced that "no black-led organization can pull off this type of development without a lot of direction from white people."
Mr. King denied that he was trying to squeeze anyone out of the project.
"My only position has been and continues to be that this was not a well-conceived nor well-executed idea," he said. "There has yet to be any type of site-suitability study completed, no preliminary planning -- just a lot of talk about money. All I want to do is what is right for the people of Gary, and, to that end, I've held open the door and tried to work with this group. Any talk that there is any type of racial agenda here is just a lot of hooey."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Beyond the Movie

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
And now maybe we should think a bit about Tibet -- the country, not the movie.
The Chinese Government tried to blackmail the Walt Disney people into scrapping an almost-finished movie about the Dalai Lama, occupied Tibet's spiritual and national leader, its one voice to the world. 
 Disney would have to kill the film or risk its dreams of expansion in China -- theme parks, and all that. Disney executives deserve credit for refusing to obey, and for being sensible enough to avoid the denunciation and boycotts that would have broken about them had they surrendered.
But all companies doing business in China or asking for more already know that they are subjecting themselves to Beijing's blackmail.
Sometimes that means accepting such items as governmental birth control -- the monitoring of menstrual cycles of women workers in plants built and directed by foreigners. And always it means shutting totally up about slave labor camps, torture or the occupation of Tibet.
For many years American Government and business have known that Beijing uses economic pressures against foreign enterprises to tighten its oppression of its subjects -- have known and submitted.
And for as many years, Washington and U.S. companies have refused to try to ease oppression, even by one thumb screw, by using America's far greater economic clout -- including the fact that Chinese sales to the U.S. dwarf America's sales to China by ever increasing billions.
So let's wipe the shocked look off our collective face because Mickey Mouse got his tail caught sniffing after Chinese cheese.
The Disney picture was never expected to be shown in China. But since obliteration of the reality of Tibet is a goal of the occupation, Beijing did not want the world even to think about Tibetan reality. Let's just do that.
The occupation of Tibet has now lasted a hideous half-century. The Chinese set about obliteration methodically, slicing off part of the country and incorporating it into China proper. They called what was left an "autonomous" region of China but allowed it no taste of autonomy.
Everywhere they sent Chinese in, moved Tibetans out. There were about six million Tibetans when China invaded and there are still about that many. But what with the partitioning, transfers and the colonizing Chinese, Beijing thinks it can get away with counting them less than two million. Still, in some districts that even Beijing deigns to call Tibetan, the Communists concede there are more Chinese than Tibetans.
Despite the deportations, murders, prison tortures and the relentless carnage of their monasteries and degradation of their religion, the unarmed Tibetans did not understand that they were supposed to be obliterated. They are not too naive to understand -- just too faithful to themselves and their country.
So in July 1994 Chinese leaders met in Beijing to update their strategy: even harsher steps against religion, punishment of Tibetan officials conceivably harboring dissident thoughts, and an all-out campaign against the political and religious influence of the Dalai Lama -- including a plan to "restructure" the Tibetan religion to eliminate his role.
More Chinese were dispatched to Tibet, more Tibetans deported and arrested. It has not worked. Tibetans remain a nation alive, worshiping and resisting, with a leader they have loved through the 40 years he has sought help for them abroad.
The Dalai Lama is a man of good heart. All over the world, men and women have listened to him and responded to him with their own good hearts. The nations have not, because they want to do more business with the occupiers.
In Hollywood, actors like Richard Gere and Harrison Ford and directors like Martin Scorcese have shown respect for him, and tenderness. To Tibetans they gave the gift of remembering their torments -- aloud. Their own American Government, meanwhile, has used its power not to help Tibetans but to betray them, lest an act of succor bring Chinese trade restrictions.
By "delinking" human rights and trade, Mr. Clinton broke his promises to Tibetans and to the Chinese victims of Beijing. That decision will be among the political monuments to his Presidencies. But how to depict it in marble I cannot imagine.

HEADLINE: Mother Held in Child Slaying Felt Severe Stress, Police Say

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Drawing a picture of a deeply disturbed young woman, police officials said yesterday that a 17-year-old Brooklyn mother charged with fatally stabbing her 2-year-old daughter admitted that she committed the crime because she was depressed and irritable over the strains of motherhood.
The suspect, Yvonne Rogers, originally told detectives that a young drug dealer had killed her daughter Wednesday afternoon while attempting to collect a $20 drug debt from the child's uncle. But police said her story unraveled during an interrogation in the detective squad room of the 75th Precinct station house. 
 The baby, Michaelik Hall, was stabbed in the hallway of Ms. Roger's home at 214 Warwick Street in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, and died in the emergency room of Jamaica Hospital.
Describing Ms. Roger's confession, a detective in the 75th Precinct said, "The stress was too much for her."
A senior Brooklyn police official, who like the detective spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "You have to crawl in the head of this disturbed person to understand this. You kill a child, stabbing her four times because you are stressed out?"
The official said detectives believed that Ms. Rogers stabbed the child once, then dressed her in pair of bluish-green pajamas and stabbed her three more times. He said she told them that she put the child in the hallway before stabbing her.
Ms. Rogers, who is unemployed and had no police record, has been charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. An official with the Administration for Children's Services said there was no record of any complaint to the agency of child abuse involving Ms. Rogers and her daughter.
Investigators said police officers with a search warrant found a knife under a bed in Ms. Rogers's apartment on Wednesday night and it appeared to be stained with blood. Laboratory technicians checked the knife for Ms. Rogers' fingerprints yesterday, and were investigating whether the blood matched the child's.
The investigators expressed surprise that Ms. Rogers did not seek help from her father before such a violent act. "This is just a kid who panicked," the senior police official said.

HEADLINE: Republicans Strike Deep In the Heart Of Texas

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 28

 BODY:
On election night earlier this month, Gov. George W. Bush declared victory in the Lone Star State. "I think the message to Texans is our state is Republican, and proudly so," Mr. Bush said at a victory rally. "It does look like an overwhelming night for Republicans statewide."
Mr. Bush was not up for re-election, but his party was, and the historic news in Texas was that Republicans had swept all 10 statewide races, and that for the first time since Reconstruction, the party was on the verge of gaining control of the State Senate. 
 While most populous states went for President Clinton, Bob Dole won Texas's 32 electoral votes handily, with 49 percent of the vote to Mr. Clinton's 44 percent, larger than President George Bush's victory here in 1992. In addition, Senator Phil Gramm easily defeated Victor Morales, the political novice who campaigned out of his pickup truck.
Even more important, the Republican Party racked up an impressive string of victories at nearly every level in this former Democratic stronghold, the home of Lyndon B. Johnson and Lloyd Bentsen.
"This is the first time in my memory when all 10 statewide races went Republican," said Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas who teaches a course on Texas politics. "We're drifting Republican. It's part of the enduring political culture, which is anti-statist and pro-economic growth."
While a majority of elected officials here continue to be Democrats, over the past 20 years the Republican Party has made steady gains, and now party members hold most of the top-tier positions in the state, including the governorship, both United States Senate seats and majorities on the State Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals, which are elected judgeships.
The gains have been notable. In 1990, Texas Republicans held only 8 seats in the Congressional delegation, 8 in the State Senate and 57 in the State House. But after this month's election, the Republicans are assured of at least 13 of 30 seats in Congress, 15 of 31 in the State Senate and 68 of 150 in the State House, with several runoffs pending.
"Texas is becoming a Republican state," said Tom Pauken, chairman of the state Republican Party. "To be able to show progress in a year that things didn't go well for Republicans on a national level is pretty good."
Yet some Republicans here admit that the party's advances were not as far reaching as many had predicted. For instance, of 8 open Congressional seats, the Democrats won 4 and the Republicans 4.
While a realignment of party politics in Texas appears under way, officials of both parties agree that Texas has evolved into a competitive two-party state.
"It was like a Tet offensive," Royal Masset, political director of the state Republican Party, said of the recent election. "It's good in the sense that we didn't go back, but there was no tidal wave. This was not an anti-Democratic year. They held us back."
Indeed, Bill White, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Republican gains this year were not as significant as they appeared, and that despite large advantages in fund raising, the Republicans had only inched forward against a revitalized state Democratic Party.
"Their growth has slowed in Congress and the State Legislature," Mr. White said. "And for the first time we've started taking seats from the Republicans. We stopped Republican gains, particularly at the local levels, and we have united the party and continue to be very strong in the largest eight counties in the state."
Mr. White said that while the Republican Party surged among white male voters and in rural areas, the Democrats were favored by minorities, particularly Hispanic voters, who turned out in record numbers this year.
More than 1.6 million Hispanic Texans, almost all of them Mexican-Americans, were registered to vote this year, and about 1.1 million cast a ballot, up from about 666,000 who voted in 1992, said Lydia Camarillo, executive director at the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project in San Antonio.
One surprise this year was the strength of incumbency. No incumbent of either party up for re-election in Congress was defeated, although two face runoffs. And in the State Legislature, incumbents lost in only 5 of about 58 contests.
"If there's any one message, it's that incumbency was very strong this year," said Mr. Masset of the Republican Party. "About 80 percent of our gains have been in election years. And so this was very similar to an off-year election."

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
A Putnam County project shows the revival of the New York market has extended far north.

BYLINE: By Rachelle Garbarine 

DATELINE: KENT, N.Y.

 BODY:
A TOWN HOUSE development of 116 residences is taking shape here, reflecting the recovery of the new-home market in semirural Putnam County.
The $13.5 million project, Sparrow Ridge, will have town houses spread over 27 acres off Hill and Dale Road in the eastern section of this township. Each town house building will have four to six residences with two bedrooms. 
 The start of a project 50 miles from New York City suggests that New York's housing market continues to improve, stoking builder interest in home construction in Putnam and Dutchess Counties.
"We see those counties as growth areas," said Lenard Thylan, president of Thylan Associates of Manhattan, which is developing Sparrow Ridge. It is the company's fifth project in the area; it has a total of 500 residences in its developments.
Demand is coming from people who work in Manhattan as well as from local residents, brokers in the area said. But many buyers may also be workers in the office buildings in White Plains and Somers in Westchester County.
The company also hopes to draw empty-nester couples. Such people may want to sell their current homes and buy in a development where someone else does the outdoor chores. Some of the homes will have master bedrooms on the first floor to appeal to such couples, many of whom no longer wish to negotiate stairs.
With a construction loan from the Poughkeepsie Savings Bank, the company will develop the project, designed by Zane Yost & Associates of Bridgeport, Conn., in phases over the next three years. Introductory prices for the 1,350-to-2,950-square-foot residences are $145,900 to $187,900.
The site was once part of a larger tract that had formerly been a golf and country club. Hill and Dale Associates of Mount Kisco, N.Y., bought it in the mid-1980's building surge with hopes of constructing 216 town houses on the 65-acre tract, divided by Hill and Dale Road. Just 100 homes west of the road were developed in a project known as the Fairways before the developer defaulted on its loan and the lender took back the site through foreclosure in 1990.
Before Thylan acquired the undeveloped 27 acres late in 1994, the seller, Congress Realty of Boston, had reached a settlement with existing owners that the old and new residences would be separate enclaves, each with its own homeowners' association.
But rather than develop the 116 residences according to the approved plan, the company enlarged the units by at least 200 square feet each, redesigned the exteriors with details that include porches and columns and added basements and one-car garages on most of the units "to broaden their appeal," Mr. Thylan said. Recreational amenities were also added.
Sparrow Ridge is welcomed by Kent because it provides an alternative type of housing that will help keep elderly and young residents in the community, Jeanne M. Ryan, secretary of the township's planning board, said. Ms. Ryan said more than 3,000 town houses were approved for construction in the 1980's in the eastern section of the township, most along Route 52. But, she said, most of the larger projects were stopped before they began because of the real estate recession.
There is interest among developers in reviving a few of those projects. But Ms. Ryan said large-scale development would become more difficult because of the tightening of regulations to protect watershed areas. Most of Kent lies within the region of the Croton Reservoir. Because Sparrow Ridge was begun in the 1980's as part of the Fairways project and will be served by a sewage treatment plant for the original 216-unit project it is not affected.
Single-family detached homes are the dominant style in Kent and in Putnam County. But Mr. Thylan said the project's site, just west of the intersection of Routes 84 and 684, with the Brewster Metro-North train station about 10 minutes away, would draw buyers.
The resale market for town houses and condominiums has rebounded as the lack of construction in the last few years pared the available inventory, Vincent J. Ficarra, president of the Putnam County Board of Realtors, said.
Of the first 28 residences at Sparrow Ridge, 11 are under way or completed. An outdoor pool has also been constructed, and other recreational amenities, including a clubhouse and a tennis court, are planned. The monthly maintenance fee is $180. Mr. Thylan said that since sales began six weeks ago, six homes have been sold or are under contract to be sold.

HEADLINE: Thanksgiving, for Odd Sort of Harvard Expatriate

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Americans in Europe like Americans in America took time out to celebrate Thanksgiving today.
But here, in an unassuming apartment in a concrete block on Karl-Marx-Allee in the former East Berlin, one American at least seemed to be giving thanks largely for the fact that America -- or at least American authorities -- never caught up with him. 
 The story of Victor Grossman, an American Army private who jumped into the Danube in 1952 and defected to the Eastern bloc, recounted over a lunch of liver and onion rather than turkey, is one of those tantalizing sub-texts that still come to light seven years after the Berlin wall fell.
It is a tale with a little Le Carre, a little John Reed, and, sometimes, as Mr. Grossman puts it: "a lot of nostalgia, and a twinge of homesickness, too."
Mr. Grossman, who was once Stephen Wechsler, born to a middle-class family in New York, decided to change his name after he fled the Army. His Soviet interrogators suggested Victor Grossman.
Throughout the decades of Europe's division, Mr. Grossman, now 68, lived in East Berlin, wanted by United States Army investigators on charges of perjury and desertion.
Only in 1994 did he reclaim his American passport and return for his Harvard Class of 1949 reunion.
Soon after he landed at Kennedy Airport, Mr. Grossman said, he was taken to the Army base at Fort Dix, where he finally received his discharge. According to Mr. Grossman, American officials told him that the case against him had been closed. They did not explain why.
The saga of his time beyond the Iron Curtain is the mirror-image of the way most Americans viewed the Communist East.
For Mr. Grossman, the risk of arrest or kidnapping by Americans was, he said in an interview today, far more of a threat than anything the Communist authorities or secret police could muster.
And seven years after the end of the cold war, he remains convinced that the system that crumbled with the Berlin wall in 1989 was by no means all wrong.
Mr. Grossman's trip behind the Iron Curtain had seemingly conventional beginnings. His father was an art dealer, his mother a social worker. He went to Harvard to major in economics and then, putting his left-wing convictions into practice, went to work in a factory in Buffalo, toting steel.
Throughout his youth, he said, he had been a member of Socialist or Communist organizations. When the draft came, he perjured himself by signing a declaration stating that he had not been and was not a member of any of those organizations.
Suddenly in 1952, the young soldier Stephen Wechsler, stationed in the American zone of occupation in Bavaria, was ordered to appear before a court-martial on perjury charges. He said he did not know how his deception had come to light. Perhaps someone informed on him. Perhaps it turned up in the routine check that followed his training as a radio operator. "I figured 10 years in Leavenworth breaking rocks, because this was a terrible time in the States," he said. So, rather than break rocks, he plunged into the Danube on a warm, August night and swam for freedom, as he saw it, in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria.
That's where the Le Carre part comes in.
By Mr. Grossman's account, his reception in Soviet-occupied Austria, shoeless and disheveled, was not hostile. But security officials there were, well, cautious about his protestations that he had arrived to join the revolution.
For two weeks he was held in a cell. There were moments of doubt.. "I did a lot of thinking in those two weeks," Mr. Grossman recalled, "and I wondered if some of the stories that we as leftists had dismissed as lies about labor camps in the Soviet Union were true."
The voyage continued -- a journey in a curtained vehicle across occupied eastern Europe, a safe-house in Potsdam, dispatch to the East German town of Bautzen to work in an auto factory with "30 or 40" other defecting foreigners, for whom he ended up organizing movies and bingo games, and his first enounter with the German woman who would become his wife and mother of his two sons.
After a four-year study course in journalism in Leipzig, Mr. Grossman made a name for himself in East Germany. Among other publications, he wrote a history of America and a book about American folk music. He broadcast, and wrote articles assailing the Vietnam War and the Reagan Administration. He undertook lecture tours. Mr. Grossman said he believed in socialism, but did not approve of the some of those who sought power, sometimes brutally, in its name.
A former United States State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Grossman was not seen as a serious player in the propaganda wars between East and West. The defector, this official said, "did not figure very highly in our concerns" at the time. Nonetheless, Mr. Grossman continued to worry about his future: it was not until a year after the fall of the Berlin wall that he ventured into West Berlin.
He is convinced that his skepticism about the capitalist system that is now in place in the unified Germany was well-founded.
In East Germany, he said, "there was no unemployment, there was no homelessness."
Mr. Grossman, who has made two trips to the United States since the end of the cold war, is now writing an autobiography to be published by the University of Massachussetts Press next year.
He and his wife, Renate, live in a modest, three-room apartment on the eighth floor of the 1960's block on Karl-Marx-Allee. He spoke in a sitting-room lined with books in English and German, furnished without frills, where Mrs. Grossman served lunch on a coffee table as he talked. Mr. Grossman lives these days on a German state pension of around $1,150 a month.
Whatever else happens, he said:
"I always felt I was an American. I couldn't be anything but American."
Mr. Grossman said he has kept up with American movies in versions dubbed in German and German translations of authors like John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut and Saul Bellow.
"I've thought about Thanksgiving as I've thought about the 4th of July," he said. "I have always felt myself to be an American and I've kept very close watch on American developments."

HEADLINE: Study Faults Home Insurers For Big Losses From Disasters

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
In the last few years, the companies that sell homeowners' insurance have lost billions of dollars.
They attribute the losses to hurricanes and earthquakes. 
 But researchers at Conning & Company, a Hartford-based insurance investment and research concern, say it is the industry itself that is largely responsible for creating its own natural disaster.
The fundamental problem, according to a study released by Conning this week, is that the basic homeowners' policy has gone haywire. While competing among themselves for more and more business, the researchers say, insurance companies have been expanding benefits and taking on additional risk without correspondingly increasing prices.
The huge disasters that laid waste to parts of Florida, Southern California and a few other places, the researchers say, merely accentuated a problem that has been developing for years. Indeed, the companies have not just suffered recently; they have lost money on their policies in all but one of the last 16 years.
All of this has become an issue of public policy since Hurricane Andrew hit south Florida in 1992 and a large earthquake struck Los Angeles in 1994. Several smaller insurance companies went bankrupt and the survivors began cutting back on coverage.
For many homeowners, policies were unavailable, forcing them to turn to state-run pools that charged high rates for minimal coverage.
The Conning research suggests that with different pricing and benefits, the companies might well have been able to withstand the disasters without such drastic reductions and without sharply increasing premiums and deductibles. State Farm, the largest homeowners' company in the country, has doubled its premium for many policyholders in south Florida and Allstate, the second largest, is now requiring homeowners in Florida to take a deductible of $5,000, up from either $250 or $500.
Industry officials say their biggest mistake was in miscalculating the destructiveness of Hurricane Andrew and the Los Angeles earthquake. Andrew cost the industry $15.5 billion -- $10 billion for homeowners' policies alone -- and the earthquake cost $12.5 billion.
"Trying to show the worst possible scenario, the scariest thing we could come up with before Andrew was $7 billion in losses," Sean Mooney, an economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade organization in New York, said.
Some insurance executives agree that prices have been out of balance. But rather than introducing more flexibility and carrying out relatively small rate increases spread across the entire population, as the researchers advocate, the industry has set a target on Florida and other coastal areas to bear most of the pain. Their solution is to further increase deductibles and premiums in those areas.
They also contend that government should create cash pools to keep companies solvent when disasters threaten to wipe them out.
"What's needed is a way to smooth out the huge hits," Gary Grant, a vice president and actuary at State Farm, said.
Legislation that would have provided Federal backing for the industry failed in Congress this year. It was bitterly opposed by consumer groups. "These guys screwed up," said Mary Griffin, an insurance specialist at Consumers Union in Washington, "and they want the Government to come and save them from themselves."
But some people argue that the industry is simply crying crocodile tears. Insurance companies can afford to spend more on claims than they take in from policies in part because they invest the billions that they collect in premiums. That is where the big profits are, industry executives acknowledge. And when investment earnings are added to those from premiums, industry financial records show a profit in 5 of the last 16 years.
But the biggest reason that insurers offer homeowners' policies at low cost, executives say, is in hopes that the same buyers will also sign up for auto insurance, which has been consistently profitable.
Perhaps the largest single factor in creating the financial problems, said Claude Fongemie, a vice president in charge of insurance research at Conning, has been a shift in the late 1970's from selling policies that simply covered the market value of homes and their contents to ones that provide for the full cost of replacing the home and everything in it.
Because of escalating costs for building supplies, he said, replacement can far exceed a home's market value. In addition, with a replacement policy, the wear and tear on a 10-year-old couch is disregarded, and the insurance company simply pays for a new one.
Since the mid-1980's, Mr. Fongemie estimates, the cost of replacing a home and its contents rather than paying for them at market value has added as much as 60 percent to insurance company costs. By contrast, premium prices have gone down. Mr. Fongemie calculated that in 1984 the cost of $100,000 worth of coverage was $350. Eleven years later the cost was $210, a drop of 40 percent.
The way to get back to the at least modest profits the industry was earning in the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Fongemie said, is to go back to writing coverage for homes and contents that pays what those things are worth when disaster strikes. Or raise prices across the board.
But neither consumer advocates nor the industry favor returning to the more limited coverage.
"Coverage at market value is often a crummy deal for people," Ms. Griffin of Consumers Union said. "The issue is: 'If my house burns down, will I be able to replace it with the insurance money?' And you won't if the coverage is market value."
Instead of reducing coverage Ms. Griffin says insurance companies should offer customers a choice of how much or how little coverage they want and charge accordingly.
"It's the insurance industry's responsibility to fairly and accurately set prices, based on risk," she said.
George E. Ruebenson, a vice president at Allstate, the second-largest seller of homeowners' insurance, said his company's profits had been better than those of the industry as a whole and that it did not foresee cutting back on policy benefits.
With almost every insurer offering full-replacement policies these days, Mr. Grant said, companies that chose to offer less "would find themselves at a pretty severe competitive disadvantage."

HEADLINE: Nigeria's Leader Presses Makeover of the Economy and His Image

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Nov. 28

 BODY:
In the face of widespread skepticism from Nigeria's domestic opposition, Nigeria's military leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, is pushing ahead with an effort to spur economic change and enhance his political image.
This week, the Nigerian Government announced formation of a 170-member committee set up to raise the living standards of Nigeria's 100 million people. The program, known as Vision 2010, was first announced at a conference in September in the capital, Abuja. 
 Opposition groups immediately criticized the makeup of the panel, which consists almost entirely of establishment figures. The chairman is Ernest Shonekan, head of the short-lived interim Government of 1993 that gave way to the current military rulers. Its members include prominent politicians, traditional rulers and business executives, all culled from among Nigeria's elite.
"We intend to capture the imagination of our people," General Abacha said this week.
Nigeria is among the world's top 10 oil-producing nations, pumping 2 million barrels a day, yet its roads and infrastructure are decaying. Poverty is widespread, with some public-sector employees earning as little as $450 a year. Infant mortality is estimated at 75 deaths per thousand births, nearly 10 times the rate in the United States.
While corruption has kept a rich elite comfortable, the middle classes and the poor have suffered a significant drop in living standards over the last decade. A recent study by Transparency International, a group devoted to fighting business corruption, rated Nigeria as the world's most corrupt country, followed by Pakistan, Kenya, Bangladesh and China.
Many ordinary Nigerians blame their country's economic troubles on years of rule by the military. Vision 2010, officials have said, is intended to convince Nigerians that General Abacha's Government is sensitive to the plight of common people.
But not every one is convinced. Some of the sharpest criticism has come from Nigeria's southern newspapers, many of which are critical of the current military Government, which for the last two years has imprisoned the presumed winner of the 1993 elections, Chief Mashood Abiola.
They have portrayed Vision 2010 as a carefully shaped campaign to burnish General Abacha's image, and say the date suggests the military intends to hold on to power at least until 2010.
"2010 Abacha's New Hand-Over Date?" read the front-page headline of the Tempo newspaper the week the program was begun. One opposition group, the Campaign for Democracy, asserted that Vision 2010 is intended to distract from Nigeria's real problems.
"While the trade-union movement, the intellectual and students' movements, the political and business communities in Nigeria today have been generally pummeled into frustration and general irrelevance, the regime is making claim to implement a vision for the next one and a half decades," said Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, one of the leaders of the Campaign for Democracy. "The Vision is for whom and with whom?"
In contrast to his predecessor, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, General Abacha is a retiring figure who is not often seen in public. A different tone was set in last month's Independence Day celebrations. Instead of the traditional military processions past the country's leader, hundreds of young children stood in rows, North Korean style, singing General Abacha's praises. The general stood facing a huge picture of his face in a stadium covered with slogans proclaiming themes of nationalism, patriotism and stability.

HEADLINE: Plan to Cut and Raise Taxes Is Contentious in Maryland

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 26

 BODY:
Gov. Parris N. Glendening needed to look no further than his own family for incentives to propose raising taxes on cigarettes in Maryland. Both of his parents were heavy smokers, and he said he constantly worries about the peer pressure to smoke facing his 16-year-old son.
"I'm passionate about this," Mr. Glendening said in an interview here, expressing his desire to discourage smoking by doubling, to 72 cents, the state's current tax of 36 cents on each pack of cigarettes. If the legislature passes the measure next year, as expected, Maryland's tax would be the highest by far among tobacco-growing states and the fourth highest over all, behind Washington (82 1/2 cents per pack), Massachusetts (76) and Michigan (75). 
 A first-term Democrat, Mr. Glendening proposed the increase as part of an overall economic development plan that includes reducing the state personal income tax for the first time in 30 years -- a 10 percent reduction over three years, starting in 1998, that will save taxpayers $485 million -- as a way to create jobs and attract new businesses into the state. The Governor estimates that the cigarette tax will help reduce smoking and, by generating $285 million over three years, will pay for almost 60 percent of the income tax cut.
But for all the health benefits that might flow from reducing cigarette consumption and economic benefits that might derive from lowering other taxes, the plan has not met with universal acceptance in the state. Critics contend that it comes at the wrong time and that Mr. Glendening is using it only to expand his political base for re-election in 1998 after a bruising campaign in 1994 when he won by fewer than 6,000 votes.
Since then, he has endured criticism on a variety of issues, including accusations that he and several aides profited from a pension plan they devised when he was the executive of Prince George's County in suburban Washington. He also irritated some people by changing his position on slot machines at horse tracks and by offering favorable terms from the state for construction of new football stadiums in Baltimore and Prince George's County.
By September, a group of top state Democrats had grown so alarmed with Mr. Glendening's leadership that they met to consider how they might challenge him in the 1998 primary. While no consensus emerged, Stewart Bainum Jr., a former state legislator and wealthy businessman from Montgomery County who played host to the meeting, said the group agreed to meet again.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bainum said, several prominent Democrats have indicated they might challenge Mr. Glendening, including Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Baltimore and Casper R. Taylor, Jr., Speaker of the state House of Delegates. Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the Republican who lost in 1994 after campaigning on the promise of a 24 percent cut in personal income taxes, is expected to try again.
Mr. Glendening brushed off suggestions that he might face a challenge from his own party. And he defended his economic plan, which also includes new tax credits for small-business owners who create jobs and for any business owner who hires a disabled person and a faster review for environmental permits.
"The Maryland economy is doing very, very well," he said, citing record sales tax revenues and a high employment. The one major drag, he added, is its sluggish job creation. Ranking 46th among the states, Maryland has been adding jobs at no more than 2 percent a year.
But even if Mr. Glendening's tax package wins him wider support among voters, critics say this is not the time for a state like Maryland, which has struggled to emerge from the 1991 recession, to offer a large tax cut. They say that even though Maryland has saved money by changing its welfare system long before Congress acted, and by moving Medicaid recipients into managed care, the state must be prepared for more costs the new Congress might shift to the states and for the possibility of a national economic downturn.
"I don't know how the state can afford it," said Thomas V. Miller, president of the State Senate, a Democrat who represents a tobacco-growing region of southern Maryland. "We're in good financial shape right now; we've balanced our budget. But we're one of those Middle Atlantic States that has been very slow to come out the last recession. I doubt very seriously we can afford such a proposal now."
Brian Roherty, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Directors, said that despite legislation in 19 other states to cut personal income taxes in the 1997 fiscal year -- most of them smaller cuts than the Maryland proposal -- fewer states were likely to pass such initiatives over the next few years.
Cutbacks by the Federal Government could create "structural problems for the states" at a time few of them are interested in raising taxes, Mr. Roherty said. "Over the next five years, it's going to be very tough for them to find trade-offs," he added. "For most states, this is not the time to cut taxes to make a negative adjustment on the revenue side."
Still, Mr. Glendening is trying to sell his economic package as the way to improve Maryland's business climate, save families hundreds of dollars a year through a tax cut and, of course, cut down smoking. "The tobacco tax is the essential component of the plan," he said. "Even if it didn't help offset an income tax, I believe it's the right thing to do."

HEADLINE: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts;
The Marriott Prospers as Three Separate Companies

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
If the experience of the Marriott hotel empire is any guide, the best way for a company to prosper may be to break itself apart.
Marriott has thrived ever since it split in two three years ago. But unlike most of the other Fortune 500 companies caught up in a recent tidal wave of corporate breakups and spinoffs, Marriott was not unloading a problem division or ridding itself of secondary activities that distracted it from its "core business." Instead, the hotel empire orchestrated the breakup as a way of bringing greater focus to its operations. 
 And so, while Westinghouse heaves a sigh of relief over shedding its industrial enterprises, and AT&T slices off a computer maker that bled it of billions of dollars, the new Marriott International property-management company and Host Marriott hotel chain, both independent entities of the now defunct Marriott Corporation, could not be chummier.
Despite a revolt by bondholders over the original breakup plan, the strategy has paid off, largely silencing its critics -- and perhaps exceeding its authors' wildest expectations.
Independence has bestowed a new nimbleness on the two Marriotts in pursuing their separate interests without diminishing their ability to pool resources in pursuing common goals. Indeed, these days questions about the companies -- which share a headquarters building, some staff members and the overarching guidance of the Marriott family -- center on whether their relationship is too cozy, and how they would behave if the interests of their shareholders did not coincide.
Having jettisoned most of its debt, which had been the old Marriott's stumbling block to expansion, Marriott International Inc. has roared ahead, buying 49 percent of the luxury Ritz-Carlton chain, franchising the Marriott name at home and abroad and signing many lucrative contracts to manage properties.
The Host Marriott Corporation, meanwhile, has sold off dozens of limited-service hotels and now owns 77 full-service hotels, most of them bought at bargain prices -- and most of them managed by Marriott International. Today, Host Marriott is one of the nation's biggest property owners, with assets of more than $4.4 billion.
"We think Host Marriott is the best vehicle available to investors looking to put their money into first-class and luxury hotels in major markets," said Mark Mutkoski, senior lodging analyst at BT Securities, "and that's the sector we think will remain insulated from significant new competition." He added that Host Marriott did "an incredible job buying high-quality assets at lower prices than its competition."
The breakup of Marriott worked so well that Host Marriott could not resist a repeat performance last year, spinning off the Host Marriott Services Corporation, which operates and supplies hundreds of food and gift shops at airports, travel plazas and stadiums.
Investors who have stayed the course have reaped a bonanza. Michael A. Stein, Marriott International's chief financial officer, estimates that stock in the old Marriott Corporation that sold for $8 to $9 in 1990 is now worth more than $70 in the form of shares in the three new companies. Similarly, the stock market capitalization of the three Marriotts now exceeds $10 billion -- with Marriott International accounting for more than $7 billion of the total -- compared with about $2 billion before the split-up.
"That performance is nothing short of extraordinary," said Bjorn Hanson, the chairman of hospitality services for Coopers & Lybrand. He added, though, that the success of the breakup resulted more from the recovery of real estate prices "than anything unique about the way it was restructured."
If anything, the prospects for the Marriotts are brightening. Joyce Minor, vice president for equity research at Lehman Brothers, recently raised her 1996 earnings estimate for Marriott International to $2.23 a share, from $1.87 in 1995. For Host Marriott, Ms. Minor predicted an increase in earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- an important measure for any company with a heavy debt load -- to $425 million from $311 million.
The biggest beneficiary of the stock surge has been the Marriott family, which controls the empire through its ownership of roughly one-fifth of the shares of the three companies, holdings worth about $2 billion and spread among more than two dozen descendants of the empire's founder, J. Willard Marriott. Power in the organizations is wielded by his two sons. J. Willard Jr., known as Bill, the first among equals, is the chairman of Marriott International and also serves on the boards of Host Marriott and Host Marriott Services; his younger brother, Richard, is the chairman of Host Marriott and also serves on the other two companies' boards.
The family connections and functional overlap assure a unity of purpose at Marriott that is largely absent in other corporate divorces.
Committees from Marriott International and Host Marriott discuss possible acquisitions at weekly meetings, and Marriott International manages most of the Host Marriott hotels.
The two companies have made joint investments in several big properties, including a 600-room Marriott hotel at the Mexico City airport and a 300-room Marriott hotel in downtown Mexico City. Also, Marriott International agreed to set up a $225 million line of credit to Host Marriott and to lend it $109 million for the purchase of the Philadelphia Marriott Hotel, which opened last year.
And after Marriott International bought the stake in the 31-hotel Ritz-Carlton chain last year (acquiring the rights to manage the properties and use the Ritz-Carlton name, but not any physical property), Host Marriott bought three Ritz-Carlton hotels.
In some ways, Marriott International and Host Marriott are more efficient as independent entities than they were when they were under the same management. Mr. Stein, the Marriott International financial officer, said the Marriott Corporation lacked the flexibility of its successor companies because its real estate side was often at cross-purposes with its hotel management side.
"The Marriott Corporation had always aspired to be the leader in managing and franchising, and its real estate ownership was incidental to that goal," he said. "When the real estate market collapsed, we ended up with great assets in a difficult market."
Moreover, he added, investors in real estate are not necessarily interested in investing in a management and franchising company, and vice versa. If the two sides are part of one company, he said, "it's a tougher sell when trying to raise capital."
For all their overlapping activities, officials of the two Marriott pillars have consistently stressed their independence. And analysts say the companies have been scrupulous in living up to their fiduciary responsibilities and in abiding by Federal conflict-of-interest statutes.
"They go right up to the limit, but they don't ever go over it," said one analyst, who insisted on anonymity. "The loans and terms of the deals between the two companies are very carefully constructed so no one can say they're unfair or unreasonable."
Nevertheless, analysts privately continue to raise "what if" questions. What if another management company appeared to be a better choice than Marriott International to run a future acquisition of Host Marriott? Which would Host Marriott choose? What if Host Marriott received an unusually generous offer for a hotel it would just as soon sell -- from a company that was likely to cancel or not renew Marriott International's management contract?
More broadly, what if other management companies approached Host Marriott with more favorable contract proposals than it received from its corporate partner? And what if Host Marriott decided to buy some of Marriott International's retirement communities, as it has indicated it might? Would it play hardball in negotiating for the lowest possible price?
"We have a strategic alliance with Marriott International, and from investors' point of view we've always represented ourselves as having that strategy," said Terrence C. Golden, the chief executive of Host Marriott. "Why would we go to another brand when there's a premium in occupancy and room rates being allied with Marriott International?"
Mr. Golden added that only two members of Host Marriott's seven-member board are in the Marriott family, that Host Marriott and Marriott International have "a separate set of shareholders almost entirely," and that the compensation of Host Marriott management is tied into the performance of the company.
"If it made more economic sense to go to another brand," he said, "we would be the first to do so."
 But that strategic alliance has, so far, benefited both companies. It seems especially to have energized Marriott International, which, unshackled from the old company's real estate concerns, has been expanding at a rapid pace.
Some rivals thought it was out of its league when it acquired 49 percent of the Ritz-Carlton hotels last year, because luxury properties require more personal attentiveness than even the Marriott full-service hotels and resorts.
But Marriott International formed a Ritz-Carlton company that operates separately from Marriott's other lodging brands, and its headquarters remain in Atlanta. Marriott has kept top Ritz-Carlton management in place, while combining the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton reservations systems, and leveraging on Ritz-Carlton's behalf Marriott's huge purchasing power (like buying $2.5 billion to $3 billion in food and related products a year for its own operations and those of its customers) and extensive food distribution system.
The result is that Ritz-Carlton's occupancy rate in the third quarter of this year is up 4.1 percent from the third quarter of 1995, to 76 percent, and revenue per available room (which the industry considers an important benchmark of performance) is up 15 percent, to $131, from $114 in the corresponding quarter of 1995.
Marriott International is also the largest operator of conference centers in the United States and is a major player in the time-share business, which sells part-time rights in vacation homes and apartments, and in retirement homes and resorts. With the number of Americans over the age of 75 projected to grow 29 percent in the 1990's, Marriott plans to add almost 100 more retirement properties over the next five years to its current stable of 68.
Overseas, Marriott International is adding hotels at a furious rate, with 24 opening this year and an additional 16 under development. Worldwide, Marriott manages more than 1,100 hotels, with a total of 221,500 rooms, and is well ahead of its goal of running 2,000 by the end of the century.
Marriott's founder started with an A & W root beer stand in Washington in 1927, and did not get into lodging until he built a motel in Arlington, Va., 30 years later. But that did not mean Mr. Marriott was uninterested in the trade, according to his son. "He just didn't like the debt that went with it," said Bill Jr., no fan of the stuff himself. "He lived through the Depression."

HEADLINE: Dismissal of Slovak Editor Called Setback for Press Freedom

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, Nov. 28

 BODY:
When Tatiana Repkova was dismissed as editor in chief and publisher of an independent daily newspaper this month, many here viewed it as just another chapter in the continuing efforts of the Government of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to control the Slovak media.
Mr. Meciar's continuing contretemps with Slovak newspapers, his attempts to use the courts to stifle expression and his replacement of the heads of the State Television, Radio and News Agency with his own political allies have been so notable they have drawn criticism from Washington and West Europe. 
 But Ms. Repkova's dismissal as editor of Narodna Obroda, a newspaper owned by Slovakia's biggest private company and largest export earner, was different from the previous incidents.
Ms. Repkova was trying to create something never attempted before in Slovakia: a truly independent daily newspaper tied neither to the Government nor to the opposition.
Ms. Repkova, 38, took over the failing Narodna Obroda, a general interest newspaper, last December and won an agreement from the owner, the VSZ steel mill, not to interfere in editorial content.
She had previously proven her skills as the founder and editor of Trend, an economic weekly that in three years became a must-read for Slovakia's growing number of entrepreneurs and business executives.
The steel mill officials seemed to believe that Ms. Repkova could deliver on her pledge to convert Narodna Obroda into a daily business paper that would appeal to executives and turn a profit. They appeared to respect her credentials, which included four journalism fellowships in the West, including the United States.
Last month advertising revenues at the paper were almost double those of October last year.
But then politics got in the way. The directors and major shareholders of VSZ are close to the Government, and include the Minister for Transportation, Alexander Rezes.
Earlier this month, while Ms. Repkova was in the United States, the newspaper ran a report on the front page from the state-run Slovak Press Agency. The report was taken from the Russian newspaper Izvestia and said Mr. Meciar was ill with a brain tumor and would be going abroad for treatment. Speculation about Mr. Meciar's health has been rife since he disappeared from public view for nine weeks this spring.
Ms. Repkova said she agreed with the chairman of the steel mill, Igor Grega, that a follow-up story was needed to question the validity of the Russian sources. After that story appeared, Mr. Grega also demanded that an apology to Mr. Meciar be printed in the newspaper. The apology appeared without Ms. Repkova's knowledge.
When Ms. Repkova returned to the newspaper, she asked for reassurance that there would be no further editorial interference. Ten days later she was dismissed as editor and publisher, although no reason was given, she said. Ten of the paper's 40 journalists, including all of the six new editors, have quit in protest.
One editor who is leaving, Lubos Jurina, said he believed that Prime Minister Meciar was in contact with the steel mill board over the newspaper's policies. "The fact is one of the owners is a minister, so there must be contact," he said.
Ms. Repkova said that for the time being she had given up on the possibility of a independent newspaper in Slovakia.
"I've tried twice and to do it again would need an independent owner, a patient owner and a talented team of journalists," she said. "None of these are available at the moment."

HEADLINE: Hundreds Block Spain's Embassy in Cuba to Protest 'Meddling'

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Nov. 28

 BODY:
A dispute between Cuba and Spain over Cuba's assertions that Madrid is meddling in its affairs grew more tense today as construction workers backed by the police blocked streets around Spain's Embassy here for a third day.
Only a few people on specific business were allowed through the cordon of hundreds of workers that ringed the colonial-style embassy. The police moved the crowd, which had been 500 yards from the embassy, to within 200 yards on Thursday so traffic could pass on nearby streets. 
 The confrontation followed Cuba's announcement that a new Spanish Ambassador was unwelcome because of Spain's criticism of Cuba's Government, and comes days before a Spanish resolution calling for political liberalization in Cuba is scheduled to go before the European Union.
Spain, which ruled the island until the turn of the century, was Cuba's closest friend in Europe under the former Socialist Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
But the rift between the two countries has been brewing since May when Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, a conservative, took office in Madrid. Mr. Aznar's references to Fidel Castro as a "dictator" and demands for political reforms on the island have infuriated Cuban officials. He has also cut Spanish aid to the island nation.
The President of Cuba's Parliament, Ricardo Alarcon, denounced the Spanish Government on Thursday, while the Communist Party newspaper Granma, Cuba's only daily, suggested Spain was damaging its economic interests on the island.
Spain has the largest share of foreign investments in Cuba, followed by Canada.
The domestic Cuban press agency quoted Mr. Alarcon as saying that Mr. Aznar's Government contained people "with a racist and colonialist mentality."
"It is unacceptable that at these levels there are politicians who want to treat Cuba as a slave nation," he was quoted as saying in the eastern city of Santiago on Thursday.
Granma contended that Spanish officials had contacts with anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami, and suggested the Government was harming Spanish interests to favor the exiles.
Granma noted that Spain has tried to play a leading role in economic and cultural relations with Cuba, but that now, with United States backing, it was trying to "again convert Cuba into a U.S. neo-colony."
Late on Monday, the Cubans announced that the new Spanish Ambassador was unwelcome, citing statements by Mr. Aznar and the Spanish Foreign Minister, Abel Matutes, and by the diplomat himself.
Even when Spain was under the dictator Francisco Franco, "relations were never as strained as they are now under Aznar," said John Kirk, a political specialist amd Cuba specialist at Dalhousie University in Canada.
The clash with Spain holds risks for Cuba, which built widespread sympathy in Europe against the United States economic embargo of the island.
The confrontation has at least briefly overshadowed European opposition to the Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to punish many foreign companies dealing with the island.
The Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman, Miguel Alfonso, tried to smooth over the dispute on Thursday, telling reporters that the two nations "are in the most total serenity" over their dispute.
Mr. Alfonso also said that the Government-organized workers ringing the Spanish Embassy were there to protect the mission, where asylum seekers tried to force their way in on Tuesday and Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Call for Weaker French Franc Helps Push the Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the French franc and the German mark yesterday after another French official called for a weaker franc.
Jean-Pierre Gerard, a council member of the French central bank, was the latest official to suggest that the franc might be too strong. In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on Thursday, he said devaluing the franc "may be necessary." 
 Mr. Gerard said the dollar was undervalued against the franc and that a correct rate for it would be 6 francs. The remarks helped push the dollar as high as 5.2320 francs. His remarks followed calls for a weaker franc earlier this week from another central bank council member and former president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
"The comments just reiterate that Europe is in need of a strong dollar to help its exports," said Paul Farrell, managing director of foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The dollar's strength against the franc also lifted the American currency against the mark and other European currencies.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5387 marks from 1.5268 marks on Wednesday -- the highest level since Oct. 18 -- and to 5.2240 French francs from 5.1690 francs. Financial markets in the United States were closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving, and trading yesterday was thin, exaggerating price movements, currency traders said.
Even with the recent calls from French officials, few analysts expect France to take any official action to weaken its currency. The governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet, said Mr. Gerard was speaking only for himself and that the Bank of France was "inflexibly committed" to franc stability. the Finance Minister, Jean Arthuis, also ruled out a devaluation.
With the French franc trading only 1 percent from its central parity rate of 3.3539 francs per mark in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, it is highly unlikely it will be devalued, traders said. Under rules for the grid, the franc can move 15 percent in either direction from its central rate.
"They're just trying to talk down the franc," not devalue it, Robert Katz, a currency trader at MTB Bank, said of French officials.
 Against the yen, the dollar continued to benefit from Wednesday's so- called Tankan report, which pointed to continued weakness in the Japanese economy and to continued low interest rates.
The dollar rose to 113.88 yen, from 113.33 yen on Wednesday.
"It will be a long time before they can do anything with interest rates," said Charles Spence, director of foreign exchange at Standard Chartered Bank.

HEADLINE: My Hospital, Dying a Slow Death

BYLINE: By Abraham Verghese; Abraham Verghese is the author of "My Own Country: A Doctor's Story of a Town and Its People in the Age of AIDS."

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
Every evening as I take the freeway home after a day of seeing patients and teaching medical students at El Paso's sole county hospital, I whiz by "Pill Hill," the area around Sierra Medical Center, where my colleagues in private practice work.
The locations of our hospitals epitomize our differences. My hospital, R. E. Thomason General, is down on the plain, just off the freeway, next to a cemetery, in the heart of a barrio of transmission shops, very-used-car lots, pawnshops and cheap motels. From the eighth floor of the hospital, a long tee shot would sail over the Rio Grande and into Juarez, Mexico. 
 Sierra, on the other hand, is north of the freeway, close to Scenic Drive, and has a magnificent view of the city below. Pill Hill is named for its concentration of doctors' offices, laboratories, radiology services and physical-therapy centers.
Until recently, the world of Pill Hill and the world of Thomason had not clashed. Both took care of two different populations. We tended the south-of-the freeway Medicaid and uninsured patients; it preferred the insured and private paying customers.
But that has changed. It is high noon in this frontier town, and our institutions are in a showdown. We are fighting over the Medicaid dollar. Managed care's success in pushing down medical costs has meant that for the first time the Medicaid patient pays as well as or even better than the patient who is insured through a health maintenance organization. For example, for a woman delivering a baby, Medicaid will pay an El Paso hospital approximately $1,800, which is close to what an H.M.O. will now pay for the same service.
Suddenly, Medicaid patients, who for decades were not so subtly turned away by other providers and sent to Thomason, are now desired by all.
It hardly seems like a fair fight. Sierra and the four other for-profit hospitals in town have all been taken over by either Columbia/HCA Healthcare or Tenet Healthcare, two national for-profit chains. These companies have deep pockets and no public accountability.
Thomason, on the other hand, is the only public hospital for a population of about 600,000. Like many other county hospitals across the country, it is overburdened with care of the poor. The 300 or so hospital beds at Thomason represent only 14 percent of the total hospital beds in the city. Yet by county mandate the hospital is required to provide medical care not only to Medicaid patients but to the 240,000 or so El Paso residents who have no medical insurance or Medicaid cards. These residents are medically indigent because they do not meet the income requirements to qualify for Medicaid or because they are illegal aliens or because there is simply not enough Medicaid financing for all who qualify.
Thomason manages to care for them, despite the unwieldy bureaucracy that oversees the hospital and in the face of the increasing resentment by homeowners over the rising property taxes that go to support it.
The price tag for indigent care is about $40 million annually. The property tax generates about $30 million. The difference is made up by Medicaid and Medicare patients, who constitute 40 percent of Thomason patients and who indirectly underwrite the care of the indigent by allowing the hospital to have certain services and specialists in place -- like neurosurgeons -- that would otherwise be unavailable.
It used to be that Thomason's childbirth unit, the hospital's only consistent moneymaker (most pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid), was so busy that the hallways routinely served as holding areas. But the number of deliveries is dwindling as pregnant women are courted away by the for-profit chains whose elaborate labor and delivery suites look like Scandinavian design showrooms.
If Thomason loses its Medicaid base but continues to serve the indigent, it cannot possibly survive. Predictably, the city commissioners have seriously discussed closing the hospital or selling it.
Of course, it is hard to begrudge Medicaid patients, once the pariah of the for-profits, their new-found popularity. But those without Medicaid will suffer. Their voices are not well heard, and those who speak for them are an old guard of community activists and do-gooders whose plaints sound numbingly familiar.
If Thomason is forced to close and if Medicaid dollars are cast across El Paso, the indigent will likely be passed down from one hospital to another.
There is a story by Thomas Carlyle about a poor Irish widow who goes with her three children from charitable institution to charitable institution. She appeals to them: "Behold I am sinking, bare of help, you must help me, I am your sister, bone of your bone, one God made us."
But those in the institutions reply, "Thou art no sister of ours." The woman ultimately collapses and dies of typhus, infecting 17 of her neighbors. At which point, the humane physician asks, "Would it not have been economy to help this poor widow? She took typhus fever and killed 17 of you."
The story is not about charity or lack of it; it is about vision. Let us remember that before the public hospitals were created, the care of the indigent depended on the largess of doctors and charitable institutions. In allowing county hospitals like mine to die a slow death, we could be returning to those days.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 22.36 in Light Day; Month Is Best in Five Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose in a shortened session yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average ended its best month in nearly five years.
Light trading and a gain in bond prices bolstered stocks. 
 The Dow rose 22.36 points, to 6,521.70, giving it a gain of 8.16 percent in November, the most since a 9.47 percent advance in December 1991.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.02 points, to 757.02, bringing its gain for the month to 7.33 percent, also the best since December 1991. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.29 points, to 1,292.61, and advanced 5.82 percent for the month.
Some 150 million shares changed hands as trading ended at 1 P.M., three hours early. Advancers outnumbered decliners, 1,305 to 934. Trading was well below the New York Stock Exchange's three-month daily average of 421 million shares, and slightly above the 125 million registered on the day after Thanksgiving a year ago.
Retail shares gained, buoyed by the prospect of increasing consumer spending. Americans spent more ahead of the year's busiest shopping season, even though their paychecks barely budged last month, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
J. C. Penney rose 5/8, to 53 3/4; Sears Roebuck & Company gained 3/4, to 49 3/4, and Federated Department Stores Inc. rose 1/4, to 34 1/8. The toy maker Exx Inc. was among the biggest percentage gainers in United States markets as its class A shares soared 3 1/2, or 76 percent, to 8 1/8.
Consumer spending increased five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, as consumers paid more for services such as household insurance and recreation. Personal incomes rose less than one-tenth of 1 percent.
Though personal income was nearly flat in October, a strong job market, near-record levels of consumer confidence and a stock market rally "are going to bolster holiday sales, and, more importantly, sales going into 1997," said Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities in New York. Unisys was the most actively traded stock in American markets. It rose 1, to 7 5/8, after Business Week reported it was a good buy and a possible buyout target in its Dec. 9 issue.
Among the day's gainers, Progress Software shares rose 3 7/8, to 20 1/8, after the CNBC television network reported that Microsoft might buy the company. Progress shares have lost 46 percent of their value this year.
Options to buy Progress at 20 in December tripled on the speculation. The option, known as a "call," rose 2 1/4, to 3, in trading of 923 contracts. On Wednesday, options to buy the stock at 17 1/2 in December doubled in trading of 212 contracts, five times the three-month daily average.
"With trading so light, wherever there is news the market tends to overreact," said James Miller, senior portfolio manager at Bartlett Capital Value Basic Fund, which oversees $2.4 billion. "We aren't seeing much today, but the bond market is helping."
Bonds gave the market a boost. Already at eight-month lows, yields slid further amid confidence that economic reports next week will bring more signs of slowing growth and tame inflation.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond's yield fell to 6.35 percent, from 6.42 percent on Thanksgiving eve.
Bank shares were helped by the falling yields. Banks are heavily leveraged, and moves in yields affect them more than other companies.
The Bank of Boston Corporation rose 1, to 70; the BankAmerica Corporation rose 3/4, to 102 3/4, and the Banc One Corporation rose 7/8, to 47 5/8.
Earlier yesterday, Japanese stocks retreated from early gains. The Nikkei index of 225 issues settled 15.18 points lower, at 21,020.36, a fall of 195.75 from last Friday's close.
In London, stocks ended higher, helped by continued strength in British Government bonds. The Financial Times Stock Exchange of 100 leading shares rose 7.8 points, or nearly two-tenths of 1 percent, to 4,058.0, up 39.3 points for the week.

HEADLINE: In a Quirky Market for Milk, Consumers and Farms Lose

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Consumers in much of the country are paying record prices for milk, cheese and many other dairy products. But that has not kept the milk prices paid to the nation's 150,000 dairy farmers from heading into a 25 percent free fall in recent weeks, even as retailers fatten their profit margins.
Such are the quirks in the patchwork of Government formulas and free market forces that these days drive milk prices. 
 The dairy markets have always been complex and, according to critics, prone to manipulation by the agribusinesses that stand between farmers and consumers. But life for farmers and consumers alike has now become more unpredictable, with Washington retreating from decades of policies designed to stabilize farm production and food prices.
"Farmers are about to get royally squeezed," said Robert Wellington, chief economist of Agrimark Inc., a large dairy cooperative based in Methuen, Mass. "The kind of price volatility we are seeing is the difference for many between profitability and losing the farm."
Such volatility is likely to become increasingly common in other farm sectors as well, according to many agricultural economists and farm state politicians.
"We sacrificed the ability of the government to moderate price swings on the altar of a free-market philosophy, and now we are seeing the consequences of that," said Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, in a letter early this month supporting protesters seeking changes in milk pricing.
Urban consumers paid 12.1 percent more for dairy products last month than a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- more than triple the general inflation rate. That is also a sharp departure from the comforting experience of the previous five years, during which the 2.7 percent climb in 1992 was the biggest movement consumers saw in dairy prices.
It could have been worse this year, but milk shortages in the spring and summer rapidly drove wholesale dairy prices to such heights that many retailers did not dare pass the entire burden on to consumers. "There have been very few markets where we have been able to recover all our raw milk cost increases this year," said John Hitchell, manager of raw milk procurement for the Kroger Company, a Cincinnati-based supermarket and convenience store chain.
To rebuild their profits, Kroger and others now are holding on to higher prices as long as possible, even as costs fall. Consumers in some cities may already be seeing major price cuts in butter, the dairy product with the most volatile price. But which products will follow it down -- and when -- will vary widely from city to city, retailers say.
"There's quite a bit of variation in our prices depending on competition," Mr. Hitchell said.
The longer grocers hold on to high prices, of course, the more likely that consumers will cut back on dairy purchases, thereby putting added pressure on raw milk prices. That could end up accelerating the decline in the number of dairy farms, a relentless trend that started in the 1950's.
The pressures are most visible in Wisconsin, which calls itself American's Dairyland on its license plates but saw the bragging rights for highest milk production levels shift to California two years ago. The combination of smaller farms, aging farmers and rising real estate prices in many prime agricultural areas near cities makes it inevitable that the Upper Midwest and other older dairy regions like upstate New York will lose thousands of farms annually in the coming years.
But this year's roller coaster has shaken farmers well beyond the traditional dairy heartland.
"How can you plan for this volatility?" asked Walter Kessler, a dairy farmer in Galt, Calif., who is a board member of the California Dairy Campaign, one of many farm groups advocating changes in milk pricing.
The problems began with strong markets at home and abroad for American grain and a poor harvest last year of hay and other forage crops. Reserves were cut to the bone and feed prices skyrocketed this spring as poor planting conditions ignited fears that this year's crops would fall far short of demand.
"It was a classic Economics 101 situation," said Peter Vitaliano, chief economist of the National Milk Producers Federation, a Washington-based trade group.
Dairy farmers were forced to cut back on the quality and quantity of feed they gave their herds. The cows reacted to the cheaper diets by producing less milk on average. At the same time, herds shrank as farmers sold cows to raise cash.
Farmers were not the only ones scrambling to adjust to the soaring feed markets. Giant cheese producers like Kraft and Borden, ice cream companies and other major milk consumers bid aggressively for dwindling milk supplies to make sure they could keep supermarket shelves filled with their products.
Until the 1990's, they could count on the Government to buy buffer stocks of cheese, butter, powdered milk and other products in the spring when milk supply normally outstrips demand. Now, the only insurance is to build their own inventories.
Another contributor to the pressure for higher prices was continual if slow growth in the demand for dairy products, including milk itself. National dairy groups have invested heavily in recent years in advertising campaigns, notably the one featuring sports and entertainment celebrities like Kate Moss, Spike Lee and Cal Ripken Jr. sporting white mustaches of milk.
The winds began shifting in the summer as the outlook for current crops improved, sending feed costs down, while milk prices continued to rise. Dairy farming suddenly became very profitable and production began to expand by this fall.
That, in turn, led to a crash in cheddar cheese prices at the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wis., an obscure trading outpost where giants like Kraft and brokers sell surplus trainloads of cheddar to dairy cooperatives and other manufacturers on Friday mornings.
Anticipating more plentiful and cheaper milk, cheese makers decided to cut their inventories, and prices on the exchange began falling on Oct. 18.
That would hardly seem like a signal event to anyone outside the industry; the exchange handles less than 2 percent of the cheese market. But the Department of Agriculture uses its prices as a key component in a formula that is the benchmark for milk prices in most of the country. Nothing else, officials explain, provides as current and public a snapshot of the demand for cheese, which is the biggest manufacturing market for milk.
"It's like the jury system," said Richard Gould, the 74-year-old lawyer who serves as the exchange's part-time president and repeatedly reminds critics that the exchange never sought its pivotal pricing role. "It may have flaws, but no one seems to be able to come up with anything better."
Longstanding suspicions that the Green Bay market can be easily manipulated were fanned this spring by a University of Wisconsin study suggesting that Kraft Inc., the Philip Morris subsidiary that is the nation's largest cheese maker, had periodically sold cheese on the exchange for less than it could have received in the private spot market from 1988 to 1993. The study's authors theorized that because milk and other cheese prices were based on the trading at the exchange, Kraft knew any losses it incurred on the exchange would be recouped many times over by reducing the price it paid for milk and raw cheese in the open market.
Kraft, which controls 15 percent of the cheese market, scathingly attacked the university research. Among other things, the company said that those on the other side of the market were also huge enterprises that could hardly be expected to let any such attempts at manipulation succeed.
Kraft's view is endorsed by Mid-America Dairymen, a cooperative based in Springfield, Mo., with 18,000 dairy farmers and $3.7 billion in annual revenues. Mid-America has occasionally bragged to its members that it has driven the Green Bay market price upward by aggressive buying on their behalf. But its executives deny that such statements should be read as support for the charges that the market can be manipulated.
"The exchange reflects supply and demand," said Lonnie Spurgeon, chief operating officer of Mid-America.
Kraft and others say such views have been vindicated by Congressional hearings last May and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last summer that there were no antitrust grounds for proceeding against Kraft or anyone else in the industry. But that did not stop farmers from picketing and demanding changes in pricing formulas this fall as prices plummeted. Both Wisconsin and the Department of Agriculture are reviewing possible changes.
Many members of the dairy industry say the best hope for managing volatility lies with the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's struggling initiative to create futures markets for milk, cheese and other dairy products. In theory, dairy futures trading would, at least, send public signals about where prices are headed and give both dairy farmers and customers better ways to limit their risks.
For now, though, eyes remain fixed on the National Cheese Exchange. The price for cheddar blocks stopped falling in mid-November, suggesting that farm milk prices could turn up as soon as January. But the only thing everyone is counting on is more volatility.
"People are still learning how to manage inventories when there are no Government buffer stocks available," said Paul Crist, vice president of dairy planning and analysis at Land O'Lakes, the big Minnesota-based dairy co-op.
