HEADLINE: Dow Slips 5.59 Points From Record

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices slipped a bit yesterday from Wednesday's record highs, with investors apparently worried about the pace of the nation's economic recovery and easing off as the Labor Day weekend neared.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 5.59 points, to close at 3,049.64. The Dow dropped 16 points in the first 90 minutes before moving upward around noon. But the rally lost steam during the remainder of trading. 
 The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading was up 0.10 point, to 526.39. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 0.17 of a point, to 396.47. The American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 0.33 of a point, to 370.95. And the New York Stock Exchange's index was down 0.5 point, to 217.12.
 
Volume Drops
 Advancers led decliners on the Big Board by a slim number, with 795 issues advancing, 787 declining and 532 unchanged. Volume was 154.1 million shares, compared with 172 million on Wednesday.
A big contributor to the Dow's decline was Disney, which was down 3/4, to 118 3/8. The stock has fallen in recent sessions since analysts cut their estimates of the company's earnings. Also, Eastman Kodak was down 7/8, to 43 3/8. The analysts said the stock had been affected by Kodak's announcement this month that it would cut 3,000 jobs and take a charge for the quarter. Exxon was off 5/8, to 58 7/8. The three stocks accounted for more than four-fifths of the Dow's decline.
The most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday was USX-Marathon, which was up 1 1/8, to 33, with 3.9 million shares traded. The stock rose after the company announced exploration success on a well in the North Sea.
I.B.M. was the second-most-active issue on the Big Board, with 2.2 million shares traded. I.B.M.'s Japanese operation said it would soon complete a contract with Komatsu, the world's largest maker of construction equipment, to deliver a version of NEC's supercomputer to Komatsu. The stock was up 1, to 95.
 
Heinz Rumors Continue
 A big gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Heinz, which was up 1 7/8, to 44 7/8. The stock has been gaining in recent weeks because of takeover rumors. The company, based in Pittsburgh, has denied that any merger talks are ongoing.
On the Amex, the most-active issue was Bolar Pharmaceutical, which closed unchanged at 8 1/4, on a volume of 740,800 shares. The stock has been active since Tuesday, when Bolar agreed to pay SmithKline Beecham $40 million to settle a lawsuit in which SmithKline charged that Bolar had wrongly obtained approval of a generic version of SmithKline's blood presure drug.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
The Day's Highlights

 BODY:

Shaping a New Union
In Transition: After three hours of anguished debate, the Soviet Parliament voted to suspend all activities of the Communist Party pending an investigation of its role in the coup. It was an action that confirmed the demise of the old even as the search quickened for new forms of association and order. And after hurriedly arranged negotiations, delegations of Ukrainians and Russians concluded an interim agreement to respect territory and deal with each other to fill the fast-spreading vacuum of political power. Page A1. 
 The Process Of Change: The Soviet Union, born in 1917, was pronounced dead in Moscow after a lingering illness. But even as the politicians delivered their funeral orations over a congential defect called Communism and over the decomposing superpower, a process of reincarnation was under way. News Analysis, page A1.
A Nuclear Rival?: Leonid M. Kravchuk, the leader of the Ukraine, has made a hurried decision to abandon his Communist career and fully join the republic's drive for independence. The incongruities of the current Soviet trauma are such that Mr. Kravchuk could lean back in his chair in the Parliament and confidently entertain questions about what it is like being the head of a theoretical nuclear superpower called the Ukraine. Page A1.
 
At Home and Abroad
A Commander's Plea: The commander of a unit of elite Soviet "black beret" troops, Maj. Vladislav Makutanovicz, who was active in the fight against Lithuanian independence, appealed to European countries to grant asylum to him and his 80 men. Page A13.
Helping Republics Directly: President Bush and Prime Minister John Major of Britain said some increased food aid to the Soviet Union would bypass the central authorities and go directly to the republics seeking autonomy. Page A14.
 
Questions of Law and Commerce
The Rule Of Law: Soviet lawyers taking part in a special program in the United States say it will take at least a generation to convince their countrymen that lawyers need not be thought of as lackeys for the state. At the Bar, page B20.
Aid To Soviets: As the Soviet Union struggles on the brink of economic collapse and political dissolution, the urgent question facing the West is what posture to take on foreign aid to the Soviet Union and its seceding republics. Economic Scene, page D2.
Making Trade Easier: In Washington, the Commerce Department shortened the list of products that can be exported only with the American Government's permission, reflecting a more permissive stance toward trade with the Soviets. Business Day, page D2.

HEADLINE: Shhh! Bed-and-Breakfasts Thriving in the Shadows

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Across Manhattan, hundreds of people have furtively turned their spare bedrooms and vacant apartments into bed-and-breakfast operations, creating a thriving cottage industry that offers tourists an informal, inexpensive alternative to hotels.
They have done so under the often discriminating eyes of landlords and co-op boards and around, if not always against, city and state laws. 
 "We all live underground," said one hot, who with her cousin has turned a plush three-bedroom rental apartment on Central Park West into a bed-and-breakfast filled with a steady stream of tourists from around the world. "We don't tell the I.R.S. We don't tell the management. We want to keep it that way."
These surreptitious operations are inspired by the more familiar version of quaint Victorian inns in the countrysides of New England or Europe, but they are driven by hard economic times, which have left renters, co-op shareholders and homeowners struggling to make ends meet.
The New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association estimates that there are at least 1,200 in New York City, almost all in Manhattan, and that more are opening all the time. The vast majority operate without permission from landlords or co-op boards, without applying for a business license and without paying state, city and Federal taxes.
 
More Scrutiny?
 Now, in the first round in a lawsuit over a bed-and-breakfast, a State Supreme Court judge has given hosts a firmer grasp on legality, ruling that a co-op could not prohibit a shareholder from operating one in his apartment. While the ruling has let the hosts sleep easier, it has also raised concerns that their little industry might now face more scrutiny.
Bed-and-breakfasts have proliferated in the city since the early 1980's.
"There are more bed-and-breakfasts in Manhattan than in any other city in the world," said Mary McAulay, who runs Urban Ventures, a very much above-ground agency that helps hosts find guests and vice versa. "But you'll never see a sign out front."
Ms. McAulay, who opened her reservation service in 1979, said only a handful existed then. Now, her agency alone lists almost 700 -- from artists' lofts in SoHo to luxury high-rises on the Upper East Side -- all screened by her staff.
 
Gray Legal Area
 Most cost anywhere from $50 to $100. The average hotel room is about $125. An unhosted, pied-a-terre apartment, which are also loosely included in listings, costs from $200 to $400.
These bed-and-breakfasts fall somewhere in a legal gray area -- unknown or unaddressed by any government agency, although the city and state departments of finance said they would appear to be obliged to pay the sales and hotel taxes, which are 8.25 percent and 19.25 percent, respectively.
"We try to keep this as much a low-key thing as possible, basically because it is treading in a gray area," said Leslie Goldberg, who five years ago started Bed & Breakfast of New York, an agency that, according to his brochure, reserves rooms "from funky to fabulous."
Hosts -- from retirees to struggling artists -- say that they are offering tourists an inexpensive and friendlier alternative to hotels and that, because they simply take on "boarders" a night at time, they do not need a commercial license.
A playwright who owns a two-bedroom co-op in the Theater District has run a bed-and-breakfast for four years, never making a profit but earning enough, he said, to pay $2,100 in monthly mortgage and fees. "Writing doesn't pay what it should." Like other hosts, he spoke on the condition that neither he nor his apartment would be identified.
"I decided I'd do a 'bed-and-breakfast' because it was a way to have roommates without having a roommate," he said. "The problem with roommates is they get involved in your personal life."
His guest yesterday morning, Warren B. Eugene from Toronto, said his host "is not your typical quaint little old lady hosting a 'B and B.' " His room, which included a mounted trophy of an Abyssinian Spanish ram and a bed topped with a purple canopy purported to be from Liberace's estate, reminded him of "some baronial palace" and offered something hotels could not.
"It gives me a sense of warmth," Mr. Eugene, a television producer visiting the city for business, said, sipping a cup of coffee.
In the case that has landed in court, Peter Hoffman has for four years run a bed-and-breakfast in his two-bedroom, 10th-floor apartment in the Diplomat, a co-op on East 73d Street.
Late last year, after noticing a stream of visitors lugging suitcases (including one who asked for a bellhop), the co-op's directors notified him that he was violating the proprietary lease. Mr. Hoffman sued, charging that the co-op was harassing his guests.
"Even given the evolution of the bed-and-breakfast phenomenon, this is not what co-operative living is envisioned to be," said Neal Stearns, the vice president of the co-op.
Mr. Stearns said Mr. Hoffman's was clearly a commercial enterprise. But last month, Judge Irma Vidal Santaella ruled in favor of Mr. Hoffman, granting a preliminary injunction that prohibits the co-op from interfering with the bed-and-breakfast until the case goes to trial. Judge Santaella ruled that a 1938 Court of Appeals ruling held that "the occasional sharing of a home with others does not, per se, constitute a business" and, thus, a violation of the co-op's proprietary lease.
The ruling has alarmed co-ops across the city. "The whole issue of bed-and-breakfasts may be a gray area with respect to government regulations," said Morton H. Rosen, the co-op's lawyer. "It is not a gray area with respect to the philosophy of a co-op."
Nonetheless, Mr. Hoffman's lawyer, Harry Kresky said, the bed-and-breakfast has "become a very interesting issue, both legally and socially." He added, "It's really just a new industry struggling for survival."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
SOVIETS ARE URGED TO PURSUE REFORM

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Senior officials of the world's leading industrial nations agreed today that the Soviet Union must urgently redouble its efforts to develop a comprehensive plan of economic reform in the wake of the failed coup in Moscow and subsequent political upheaval, diplomats here said.
In a meeting called to exchange views about ways the Group of Seven industrial democracies might further the pace of economic reform in the Soviet Union, officials gathered here said the failed challenge by Soviet hard-liners had accelerated the opportunities for closer economic cooperation between Moscow and the West. 
 But diplomats close to the meeting said the participants stood by the broad agenda outlined at the July meeting of the seven nations' leaders and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in London: that direct economic assistance from the West depends on fundamental change in Moscow.
 
Wide Agreement
 Characterizing the talks, United States officials in London said there was wide agreement that the new economic commission in the Soviet Union must move as soon as possible to develop an effective economic reform and adjustment plan, in cooperation with international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The meeting, which lasted six hours and was held behind closed doors at the British Foreign Office, was called last week by Prime Minister John Major. Mr. Major, who met today in the United States with President Bush, is to visit Moscow on Sunday before continuing to China.
Mr. Major is now chairman of the Group of Seven, which includes Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan as well as Britain and the United States.
The meeting here was attended by senior government officials -- widely referred to as sherpas -- whose role is to advise policy makers rather than to stake out actual policy positions.
 
Pressed by Europeans
 While European and American diplomats talked about a high degree of agreement inside the meeting, some Europeans did press their colleagues to begin considering concrete steps to take advantage of what one German source described as "the new situation" inside the Soviet Union.
"The West cannot just follow on in the same way" a German said after the meeting, though he did not call for direct, immediate financial aid to the Soviet Union. "The meeting today was not called to issue checks," he added.
In the past, the Germans and the French had pressed for immediate, large-scale economic assistance to strengthen the hand of reformers in the Soviet Union, while Washington, Britain and Japan have been opposed, favoring technical aid and increased trade.
At the London meeting, Western leaders agreed the Soviet Union needed to demonstrate a stronger commitment to real structural reform in their economic and political systems.
In addition, participants in the meeting said they would consider sending additional food and medical assistance to the Soviet Union, if the situation recquired it.

Apparatchik to Nationalist: Ukrainian's Fancy Footwork

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, U.S.S.R., Aug. 29

 BODY:
It was only last weekend that Leonid M. Kravchuk, the fleet-footed leader of the Ukraine, made a hurried decision to abandon his Communist Party career and fully join the republic's drive for independence, which was roaring forward as the Soviet Union's political integrity came apart.
The incongruities of the current Soviet trauma are such that this morning Mr. Kravchuk could lean back in his chair in the Parliament and confidently entertain questions about what it is like being the head of a theoretical nuclear superpower called the Ukraine. 
 "If any republics claim a willigness to have nuclear weapons on their territory, we'd never say no," the Ukrainian leader answered casually, commenting on President Boris N. Yeltsin's stated willingness to take the Ukrainian missiles into the Russian federated republic for safekeeping.
 
A Nuclear-Free Republic?
 This was as good a way as any of fulfilling the Parliament's wish to make the Ukraine a nuclear-free zone, Mr. Kravchuk said, before moving on to other questions involving the economy, the army and the other needs of an independent Ukraine -- a nation that, if independence were to come, would have the fifth largest population in Europe.
Mr. Kravchuk is clearly making the most of a confusing situation by eagerly bearing the Ukraine's independence banner. But he also exemplifies the contradictions of being a new ex-Communist trying to confidently imagine the time after the union.
All over the Soviet empire, politicians are scrambling to imagine a plausible aftermath for Communism that will keep them in office and stave off some sort of ultimate collapse of order.
None may be more artful at the moment than Mr. Kravchuk, clinging to the reins of this surging republic as it leaps to the fore in declaring independence and thereby threatening to seal the collapse of the current Soviet political system.
"The union as it used to be has ceased to exist," said the 57-year-old politician.
 
Break With Past
 The absence of any signs of regret at this thought was remarkable in a politician famous here for devoting three decades of his career to working for Communism day after day in the Central Committee building where he began.
More remarkable, as ideological director of the Ukrainian Party, he was, only two years ago, fervently leading the fight against the forces in the republic that he now claims to lead.
Such poignant anomalies only reaffirm what an unusual place is the Ukraine as it sits on the critical southwestern flank of the Soviet empire, adding an ominous wobble to the Bolshevik ship of state.
In finally announcing that it wants independence, the Ukraine is talking not in the purely moral terms of the Baltic republics' campaign for independence.
The Ukraine is on the move as a large, rich and muscular republic, a vital component of the Soviet empire.
 
Farms and Factories
 It is a land of radicalized pit miners, harvest-rich farmers and canny politicians, accounting for one third of the nation's industrial output and two-fifths of its agriculture.
Mr. Yeltsin knows better than anyone that this bread-and-steel republic is vital to Russia. Together the Ukraine and Russia have 70 percent of the union's population and comparable shares of its economic output.
It was not a total surprise, then, that Mr. Yeltsin sent a delegation here to repair Russian-Ukrainian relations, which had been damaged by his threat to look into controversial territorial claims against republics that rushed to assert their independence.
The power of the two republics in tandem is such that now they are proposing a program of economic cooperation and border respect as a means of seeing the republics create a transitional program -- "orderly collapse" of the Union is the way it has been put -- toward some post-union political system.
 
Russians Test Sentiment
 The proposal remains vague. But the value of the visit for the Russian delegation was undeniable in sensing the depth of the Ukraine's commitment to independence.
The unanimity the world now sees in the Ukrainian campaign masks coincidental, painful elements. The independence referendum that has been put on the ballot for a Dec. 1 vote boiled up from disparate yearning of those who both suffered and profited from Communism in a republic that saw tens of millions of lives lost across seven decades of Kremlin dictatorship.
Like most things Ukrainian, the independence euphoria here has a special twist to it. Down the street at the City Council, for example, the debate concerns not whether to remove the city's giant Lenin statue, but whether to raze it surgically or explode it as a catharsis for the public.
Ukrainian politics has numerous zigs and zags. The conservative, industrial-heavy regions of the east and south, where a strong Russian minority is focused, is a counterpoise to a western region of strong nationalist spirit and intellectualism.
Religious rivalries survive no less convolutedly from the time when Byzantine Christianity was imported here by a Kievan prince a millenium ago. The republic's Christians are now divided between adherents of the Catholic and Orthodox faiths.
The Parliament session that produced the independence resolution last week initially had as its focus charges that Mr. Kravchuk was silent during the first two uncertain days of the Kremlin coup d'etat.
As chairman of Parliament, Mr. Kravchuk used the Moscow events, including uncertainty about the union, to slip a step ahead to the independence issue that soon mesmerized the republic.
In the process, he quit his republic and union party post. By this week, he announced he had turned in his party card, insisting he actually made the decision as a protest during the coup but that the news had not emerged until now.
"Kravchuk is unique at doing this sort of thing," said Sergei Buryak, a political leader connected with the insurgent opposition to Mr. Kravchuk's majority in parliament, which has fast been shedding its Communist credentials.
"But this time he is dead," Mr. Buryak contended. "He has jumped the party too late to become our Yeltsin," he said of the early party apostasy of the Russian leader.
Other politicians have learned not to bet against Mr. Kravchuk. They point to the combination of his talents as an adaptive strategist and to the disarray among the opposition in the Ukraine.
From a previous election, the Ukraine Parliament has provided him with a safe Communist majority. As a Western Ukrainian, Mr. Kravchuk moved to identify more with the nationalist drive when the Communist machine started to weaken. He stopped speaking Russian in public.
He has particularly frustrated Rukh, the republic's anti-Communist popular movement. It was a major progenitor of the independence drive at a time when it risked a state condemnation. Thus Rukh is galled by Mr. Kravchuk's current celebrity as the most prominent leader of the Ukraine's independence drive.
Rukh's political strength is spread across more than a dozen opposition parties. These insurgents lack a parliamentary majority but they have controlled much of the agenda as nationalism gripped the republic.
But Mr. Kravchuk is busy here this week creating a whole new agenda. He talks authoritatively of nuclear weapon management, of building an army for the republic, and of going slow in seeking the departure some day of the 1.2 million Soviet troops in the republic.
 
Conference of Republics
 He is also proposing that today's Ukrainian-Russian communique on economic and border agreement be taken up at a summit meeting of the 15 republic leaders. He proposes to have it here without the participation of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
"We are two great republics which have spoken to offer our concept," said Mr. Kravchuk, enjoying the statesman's role. He hopes to anchor his power better by being elected President on Dec. 1 when independence will be on a ballot.
Mr. Kravchuk pronounces the union dead with certainty, but he also must implicitly count on its existence. For example, he summoned the union's generals for a meeting today on Ukrainian defense.
"There is no union, but still the Ministry of Defense exists," he conceded of the union bureaucracy.
White haired and ruddy faced, Mr. Kravchuk, son of a peasant, exudes a sense of control in these most confusing times. Moving through the parliament amid all the talks about independence, he leaves the impression that the only problem he has not solved lately is what to use as a political vehicle to run on in the presidential elections now that the Communist Party is banned.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Mrs. Taylor Says Scout Tried To Pressure Her Into Pact

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
The mother of Brien Taylor, who signed a record $1.55 million contract with the Yankees on Wednesday, says a scout from the Major League Scouting Bureau, representing himself as reporting directly to Commissioner Fay Vincent, attempted to pressure the family to accept an offer nearly $1 million lower than the final agreement.
Bettie Taylor, whose conviction about her son's value in the baseball marketplace was a decisive factor in the largest contract in the history of the amateur draft, said that Don Koonce, a scout from Fayetteville, N.C., refused to leave her home during an unsolicited visit on Aug. 13. 
 At the time, the Yankee's most recent offer was for a $600,000 signing bonus plus $50,000 for college expenses. "He said that after we talked to him, Brien would sign," Mrs. Taylor said of Koonce's visit. "That's what he said. So you can draw your implications from that."
Although the Major League Scouting Bureau is one of a number of organizations listed beneath the office of the commissioner in major league baseball's hierarchy, officials say its responsibilities are far removed from the commissioner's office.
 
Motivation for Visit Is Unclear
 At issue is whether the scout's description of his role, and his persistent approach, led him across a line of impropriety. It's also unclear what motivated Koonce to make the visit or whether anyone in organized baseball had prompted him to do it.
The visit to the Taylor home, a trailer on a dirt road in Beaufort, N.C., took place at a sensitive point in the negotiations. Mrs. Taylor had wondered publicly whether racial and economic considerations had entered into the stalled talks, and her meeting with Yankee General Manager Gene Michael, which ended that concern, had not yet taken place.
At the time, Mrs. Taylor was seeking a $1.2 million contract similar to the one the Oakland Athletics had given Todd Van Poppel the year before. Repeated attempts to reach Koonce at his home in Fayetteville, N.C., were unsuccessful. A daughter said that while her father was home, he was unable to come to the telephone.
Stephen Greenberg, the deputy commissioner of major league baseball, said he was not aware of the specifics involved and could not say whether Koonce did anything wrong.
"Don Koonce does not work for the commissioner," Greenberg said. "The commissioner and I have no contact with the scouting bureau. They serve a function for the industry, preparing scouting reports for 26 teams. As far as I know, that is the sole function. If the visit was authorized by anyone, it was authorized by the Yankees. It certainly was not authorized by us."
 
Michael: I Didn't Know of Visit
 Michael said he was not aware of Koonce's visit until after it happened, and that to his knowledge no one in the Yankee organization had asked the scout to become involved.
Scott Boras, the agent who negotiated the $1.55 million contract, said Mrs. Taylor called him while Koonce was in her home and that she then set the telephone down, allowing him to hear her conversation with Koonce.
Boras recalled hearing Koonce say: "I have something to say that you need to hear. You're making a big mistake. You're turning down more money than you've seen in your life." Then, Mrs. Taylor said, "Get off my property."
When reached earlier in the week by Baseball America for an article in an issue that will reach its subscribers on Monday, Koonce denied having misrepresented himself.
"I think I said, 'Well, if baseball loses its No. 1 player, everyone would be disappointed from Fay Vincent on down,' " Koonce told the publication. "That is the only time I mentioned his name. I work under the commissioner's office, and that is how I presented it."
 
Closing the Door
 Koonce did confirm to Baseball America Mrs. Taylor's statement that while talking to Brien, the scout suggested that he would be able to drive the same type of luxury car that Koonce possessed if he signed a Yankee contract.
"I made it perfectly clear to him that I did not want to talk with him," Mrs. Taylor said. "And he refused to leave. I told him, 'If you don't leave, I don't want to close the door in your face.' He said, 'That's what you'll have to do.' "
"When he first came, it was sort of like he was trying to help," Mrs. Taylor said. "He was pleasant. We had talked with him at school once before. He seemed to have Brien's interests at heart. And perhaps he did, too, that night. But things just got out of hand."

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Senate Race Kicks Off, Presaging '92 Presidential Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 29

 BODY:
The only United States Senate campaign in the nation was joined today, with Dick Thornburgh and Harris Wofford trying out ideas and themes that both parties hope will enable them to gain ground in the 1992 Presidential election year.
Mr. Thornburgh, the former two-term governor, resigned two weeks ago as United States Attorney General and officially began his campaign today before jubilant supporters in a downtown hotel. Demonstrators delayed the rally for more than 30 minutes, protesting positions by Mr. Thornburgh that they said limited access to abortions and discouraged AIDS research and treatment. . 
 The Republican candidate, in what some political strategists said was a test marketing of themes for President Bush's re-election campaign next year, emphasized the positive, promising to fight for jobs, economic growth, good government and stronger efforts to combat crime and violence in the streets. But in an interview and other appearances, he honed another familiar Republican tactic -- criticism of his opponent as a "60's liberal" and a "tax-and-spend Democrat."
 
Battle on Domestic Issues
 Mr. Wofford, named to the Pennsylvania Senate seat by Gov. Robert P. Casey after a midair plane crash killed Senator John Heinz in April, appears to revel in Mr. Thornburgh's call to compare the two men. A former adviser to President John F. Kennedy and former Pennsylvania State Secretary of Labor and Industry, Mr. Wofford is trying to forge a reputation as the candidate who is more moderate on abortion and better equipped to do battle on the domestic issues that matter to Pennsylvania voters: the creation of national health insurance, help to middle-class families sending their children to college, and more jobs.
Mr. Wofford, who has never held elective office, has sounded the charge of Democrat-as-crusading-outsider railing against more than a decade of Republican domination of the White House.
Borrowing from Thornburgh campaign rhetoric, Mr. Wofford said his opponent has, indeed, walked the corridors of power and knows Washington inside out. But Mr. Wofford said he prefers to "clean up the corridors of power and turn Washington upside down."
Yet, some political strategists said they believed Mr. Wofford, like any outsider, particularly one who is relatively unknown, was vulnerable to being defined by the more widely known opponent, particularly in the short time before the Nov. 5 election.
 
'A Big Problem'
 "He has a big problem if the Thornburgh campaign is successful in defining him as a liberal and precluding him from defining himself in another way," said Michael L. Young, a professor of politics at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Young said that he has been impressed with Mr. Wofford so far. Dr. Young said Mr. Wofford has tried to characterize himself not as a traditional liberal, but as a "practical politician, as a progressive Democrat."
Michael S. Dukakis, Dr. Young said, was not able to do this against the Republicans in 1988. He warned that Mr. Thornburgh's advisers would certainly try to "Dukakisize" Mr. Wofford in the weeks to come.
It will probably be the Democrats, said Dr. Young, who will use the Senate race to fashion new ideas and themes for the forthcoming general election next year. "That is the area the Democrats need the most work on right now," he said. "Wofford is calling himself a progressive Democrat," he said, adding that the candidate will need to define the phrase for voters.
"We'll find out what that is in this race and how it works to convey an understanding of working-class and middle-class values and concerns," Dr. Young said.
Both parties want control of Congress, and Pennsylvania may point the way to accomplish that. So the campaign that will be the state's shortest may also prove to be one of its most aggressive.
Mr. Thornburgh has hired the firm of Roger Ailes as his media adviser, and Mr. Wofford has turned to James Carville to head his campaign. The two strategists are known to hammer out tough campaigns.
Chris Bravacos, the political director for the state Republican committee in Harrisburg, sees the Democrats preparing to turn the campaign personal and negative.
Mr. Bravacos said he had already heard "personal things" about Mr. Thornburgh injected into the campaign. Mr. Thornburgh, in an interview this week, referred to Mr. Carville as someone who has shown himself to be a "pretty nasty guy over the years." Neither Mr. Bravacos nor Mr. Thornburgh elaborated on these statements.
Paul Begala, Mr. Wofford's campaign manager and a partner with Mr. Carville, said he understood Mr. Thornburgh's apprehension.
"There is a reason for the little beads of sweat on Thornburgh's brow," Mr. Begala said this week. "It is because of his record."
Earlier this week in Pittsburgh, Mr. Thornburgh, who is 59 years old, appeared relaxed.
Almost soft-spoken, he sat behind his desk in his law office, which overlooks downtown Pittsburgh, and explained how he viewed his campaign.
He said he believed that he would greatly benefit from his close association with President Bush. He indicated that he was hoping to increase his political profits in two scheduled campaign appearances with Mr. Bush next month and in early October.
 
Framed Photograph
 A framed photograph of Mr. Thornburgh and his family standing with Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush is displayed on a table behind his desk.
Moreover, Mr. Thornburgh and his campaign advisers have also been quick to start defining Mr. Wofford as a fiscal clone of Governor Casey, a "tax and spend" Democrat who has never held elected office. At the same time, Mr. Thornburgh has tried to remind voters of his record in the Governor's mansion, one in which he said he lowered taxes and attracted jobs to the state.
After referring to Mr. Wofford as someone whose political era has passed by, Mr. Thornburgh said that his opponent was badly out of touch with what state's voters want.
"The tax and spend policies that he appears to have supported in Gov. Casey's Administration don't resonate with Pennsylvanians," he said of Mr. Wofford. "I think that they much more find their comfort level with the kind of tax cutting and good management that I carried out when I was Governor."
But Mr. Wofford, at his news conference in his campaign office here, called the linkage to Governor Casey's tax policies silly. It is Republican policies in Washington, he said, that have increased the fiscal burdens on every state, county and city.
On the campaign trial, Mr. Thornburgh seldom mentions his opponent, who has, according to recent polls, less than a fourth of the Republican candidate's name recognition. He prefers to listen, wave, smile and shake hands on the stump.
"If you rest on your oars, you are dead in the water," he said after a morning tour of the construction site of a new airport complex in Pittsburgh. "You've got to keep the momentum going."
 
Raising Money
 Mr. Wofford has kept a conspicuously low profile for the last two weeks. His son and spokesman, David Wofford, said the Democratic candidate has been holding a series of private meetings and raising money for the campaign.
Mr. Begala said the Wofford campaign would follow a two-prong attack: "raise money and raise hell." The campaign is in the first stage, soon to turn to the latter, he explained.
Today, hours after Mr. Thornburgh issued his widely anticipated announcement speech here, Mr. Wofford held a news conference to respond to reporters questions about the race.
Noting that the Senate race is the only one in the nation, Mr. Wofford, who is 65, said "we have a chance to send a wake-up call to Washington, a message that we want change and that's the choice."
Standing before a single microphone in a neck tie and shirt sleeves, Mr. Wofford, who was a founder of the Peace Corps, a colleague of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and president of a public and private college, said he intended to "roll all his strength into one ball and throw it out in a way I think the country will respond to."
One of those ideas, he said, will be a middle-income tax cut.
"I'm the only candidate in this race who has never raised taxes," he said, adding that he has paid a lot of taxes.
Mr. Wofford, when told about the demonstration that delayed his opponent's rally, said he believed everyone should have an opportunity to speak. He said he wanted Mr. Thornburgh to be heard because he "has tested issues I want to contest."
The protest was staged by about 25 members of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, more widely known as ACT-Up, and the National Organization for Women.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Jobless Benefits End For a Monthly Record 300,000

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
More than 300,000 unemployed Americans exhausted their jobless benefits in July, the highest one-month total in at least 40 years, according to a study made public today by a group that advocates programs for the poor.
Based on figures from the Labor Department, the study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the number of people out of work, 318,000, was the highest monthly total since the Government began keeping track ofmonthly statistics in 1951. 
 At the current pace, the study said, the number of Americans who run out of unemployment benefits this year will exceed that for any year since the insurance was established in the 1930's.
"The problem is likely to remain acute in the months ahead, even if the economy continues to recover," said Isaac Shapiro, who conducted the study for the advocacy group in Washington.
In the first seven months of 1991, about 1.8 million jobless workers exhausted their unemployment benefits, according to the study.
Also today, the Labor Department said the number of people filing new claims for unemployment dropped by 9,000 in mid-August, falling to 421,000. The decrease in new unemployment claims for the week ended Aug. 17, though not large enough to offset the jump of 22,000 claims from the previous week, at least stemmed recent increases in the level of new claimants. Analysts have said the number needs to go below 400,000 and stay there to signal a pickup in the nation's hiring.
In early August, Congress passed a $5.2 billion package to extend unemployment benefits for up to 20 weeks beyond the 26-week standard.
But President Bush, noting that Congress offered no way to pay for the benefits, essentially killed the bill by signing it and not putting it into effect.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said Wednesday that when Congress returned from its summer recess on Sept. 10, lawmakers would send Mr. Bush new legislation to extend unemployment benefits. The new version will not give the President the option of using a provision in the budget law to avoid implementing the program, Mr. Gephardt said.

HEADLINE: The True Heroes of the Soviet Union

BYLINE: By James H. Billington; James H. Billington, a historian of Soviet culture, is Librarian of Congress. He was in Moscow during the aborted coup.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Communism died and Russia was reborn in Moscow in a 48-hour period from early morning on Aug. 19 to early morning on Aug. 21. But it was all both far more dangerous and far more liberating than we may have yet realized.
On the surface, things seemed surprisingly ordinary. Many Muscovites barely interrupted their schedules; international meetings continued, and television narrowed back to a single channel presenting diversionary ballet and sporting events. 
 It never seemed likely that the crew-cut kids in the tanks and their pony-tailed contemporaries on the barricades would ever fight. The everyday dramatis personae of the disintegrating Soviet economy milled indiscriminately around both groups: argumentative drunks, emotional old women and uncomprehending foreigners taking pictures of each other and offering everyone cigarettes.
Yet the coup was deadly serious and a near-catastrophe. Plans were well prepared to take the White House -- the Russian parliament building -- in 15 minutes and "neutralize" Boris Yeltsin's entire entourage. A hardened tank corps was to enter Moscow and start the storm rather than the more youthful tank crews already in the city.
But even this would have been only a diversion from the real assault that was to take place: from within the parliament building (where K.G.B. agents had infiltrated the crowd); from above (by helicopters bearing shock troops), and from below (where elite units were to rush into the building from 24 subterranean entry points whose existence had been unknown to Mr. Yeltsin's supporters).
There was far more complicity and passive acquiescence in the putsch than has yet been generally recognized -- much of it by people for whom many in the West had high regard. Those who spoke out strongly against the coup during the decisive hours seem to have included only one member of the Cabinet (Nikolai Vorontsov), only one Ambassador (Boris Pankin in Prague, who has since been named Foreign Minister), only a few scholarly leaders (Dmitri Likhachev in Leningrad and Vyacheslav Ivanov in Moscow), and only one top official of the Russian Orthodox Church (Patriarch Alexis himself).
After the coup had failed, the new reformist head of the K.G.B., Vadim Bakatin, told a small group of Yeltsinites that an immediate purge of all those involved would be impossible because "if we arrest all of our fascists, we would need even more camps than Stalin created."
How then could the outcome have been too good to be true, too soon to believe? Basically, because an alternative political legitimacy had already been created and because enough ordinary people were willing to risk death to defend it. Russia had elected in Boris Yeltsin a plain-speaking leader from the deep interior who had broken with the Leninist mode. He had allied himself with a new generation of democratic reformers who were held in contempt by the junta and largely ignored by the West.
The moral force, human variety and sheer numbers of the mobilization to defend Mr. Yeltsin's White House simply produced too many convert-defectors from within the army, K.G.B. and Communist apparatus to permit the bloody final assault that the core K.G.B. and military leaders were willing to launch until the very end. Two incidents from the crucial 48 hours illustrate the political sophistication and spiritual depth of the democratic movement.
Konstantin Lubenchenko is a liberal People's Deputy and chairman of the International Association of Parliamentarians, an extragovernmental organization of 190 reform-minded legislators from the republics. Mr. Lubenchenko was shocked to find himself unable to communicate with other members of his caucus once the coup was announced. And he faced a request from the treacherous Anatoly Lukyanov, the nominal head of the Supreme Soviet, to provide a document that could -- in effect -- help legally justify the coup.
Mr. Lubenchenko mobilized enough of his group to write a stinging, highly professional refutation of any legal basis for the junta before leaving to meet a K.G.B. defector who provided warning of the impending underground attack.
Father Aleksandr Borisov is an elected member of the liberal Moscow City Council and part of the bright group of Orthodox priests who had been close to the prophetic priest Aleksandr Men, whose murder last fall now appears to have been sanctioned at the K.G.B.'s highest level.
Father Borisov rapidly plunged into a nonstop mission to the White House that included prayers, baptisms, counseling -- and distribution of New Testaments to all in danger. He went first to the boys in the tanks, distributing 2,000 Bibles, with only one soldier refusing. He gave out an equal number to those on the barricades and then went off to participate in talks with the Patriarch that led to his moving prayer that anathematized fratricide -- amplified to the troops just a half-hour before the time the major attack was expected and the first bloodshed in fact occurred.
With even more people defending the White House on the second night, the troops and key members of the junta balked at the amount of blood they would have to shed. The putsch fell apart and the long fever of totalitarianism broke.
The purity and conciseness of the speeches that were made at the White House during those 48 hours represented a complete rhetorical break with the past and expressed a new Russian identity that seeks to move forward to a Western-type democracy and backward to the moral roots of their own religious and cultural tradition. The masses were not putting their lives on the line to establish a market economy (though most would like it) but to make an altogether fresh start by discarding their corrupted system of government and their morally compromised way of relating to one another.
The West must move rapidly to work in new ways with altogether new people in the Soviet Union, including the provincial leaders who were almost unanimous in rejecting the junta. The possibilities for good are very great, but they may not last another winter. The economy remains in shambles and immense pro-putsch forces remain in place with the desire to use social dislocation as an excuse for a fresh attempt at power.
Though the coup of August collapsed, its immediate goal was accomplished: it prevented the new Union treaty from being signed the following day. There will now be much greater difficulty in peacefully devolving central power and resolving nationality tensions.
But there is an entirely new cast of people and popular mood for change among the long-quiescent Russians. Unless there is some major new Western response, the assertive desire for change among the Russian people may lose its hopeful and democratic character and leave them vulnerable to chauvinist or even fascist demagoguery.
The U.S. has a key role to play as the only nation by which the struggling U.S.S.R. can measure itself as it tries to build a multicultural democracy on a continental scale. Far from being a burden, it should be seen as a privilege by Americans to work with people who have rediscovered the enduring beauty and practical value of the laws and freedoms that we have perhaps too long taken for granted -- and too little appreciated as being the only real guarantee of peace.

HEADLINE: What's Bush's Problem With Family Leave?

BYLINE: By Mary Wendy Roberts; Mary Wendy Roberts is Commissioner of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
It's 7 A.M. and you're ready for work when your child announces she's sick. Or you get the call at work that your dad is in the hospital -- he just had a stroke. Or your mom lets you know during your visit that she can't stand the convalescent home for another minute.
"Care-giving" and family used to be dismissed as "women's issues." But not anymore. Women account for the fastest-growing segment of a labor force whose shrinking number of skilled workers is worrying the nation's employers. 
 Reconciling the demands of work and family is now a work-force issue, a business issue, a national issue. In more than 85 percent of American households, either both parents work or a single parent supports the family. These working families are demanding the right to attend to family needs without risking their jobs. And some are winning it.
In Oregon, working families claimed a significant victory this month when Gov. Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, signed a bill providing for family medical leave.
Combined with existing laws on parental and pregnancy leaves, Oregon's family leave plan is one of the nation's most comprehensive. The new law entitles workers at companies with 50 or more employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave every two years to care for a seriously ill parent, spouse, child or parent-in-law.
To qualify, employees must work an average of 25 hours a week for at least 180 days. They may use accrued vacation time for their leave, and if it is part of their collective bargaining agreement or employer-employee agreement, they may use accumulated sick leave as well -- provisions intended to lessen the financial impact. Time off for personal illness is not included.
Nationally, the debate over family leave continues. Some of the views expressed are remarkably similar to the arguments we've heard in the past against the eight-hour day, child labor and minimum wage. Opponents say that it's hard to carry out, that it costs too much, and that employers will be forced to cut back other benefits as a result.
The success of parental leave legislation in Oregon has convinced us that these arguments are groundless. Since parental leave became law in 1988, there have been only 34 complaints by employees who were denied leave benefits, a sign that most state employers have no trouble complying.
A 1990 study of parental leave policies by the independent Work and Families Institute confirmed the program's success: only 12 percent of Oregon's employers thought the law was difficult to carry out; 88 percent reported that they didn't have to reduce worker benefits or increase their operations costs. Not surprisingly, 94 percent of the workers surveyed in Oregon also endorsed the law. If the states are laboratories for social policy, then family leave is an experiment that works.
The Republican Administrations of the last decade have been long on lip service to family values but short on delivery. In June, President Bush vetoed the Family Leave Act, which is similar to, though less sweeping than, the Oregon plan. Perhaps we should put national policy where our values are, or at least where we say they are.
The United States is the last holdout of the world's industrialized countries against making a formal, national commitment to families. Family leave is a reality in Germany and Japan, whose social policies -- far more generous than even the Oregon plan -- make our hesitant attempts at legislation look embarrassingly meager. Their experience proves, too, that accommodating the family needs of their work forces does not lead to national economic ruin.
Next month Congress will have another opportunity to vote on the Family Medical Leave Act. After the President's veto, Congressional leaders from both parties now say this legislation is one of their top priorities.
Family leave isn't utopian, it's realistic. What's now law in Oregon should be national policy as well.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Budget Only Grows Every Year

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the Aug. 6 article of your "Military-Industrial Upheaval" series, you state: "Nevertheless, it is a fact that about 12 percent has already been cut from the Pentagon budget in the last five years, and an additional 25 percent -- or more -- seems destined to go by the mid-1990's." 
 It is difficult to find the factual basis for this assertion. Assuming that it means the period 1986-91 for the last five years and 1996 for the "mid-1990's," these figures don't match the budget.
In 1986 the Department of Defense received budget authority of $281.4 billion. For 1991 the official estimate is $273 billion, a decrease of only 3 percent. The Pentagon budget request now before Congress shows $282.6 billion as the planned 1996 level, an increase of 3 percent.
Apparently, you have succumbed to Pentagon reasoning in which a 3 percent increase is called a 25 percent cut just because the increase does not keep up with inflation. If so, you accept the myth that defense is being cut when Congress is about to approve a $5 billion Pentagon increase in 1992 alone. By 1996 the Pentagon budget rises nearly $10 billion over 1991.
The Pentagon spends far more tax (and borrowed) dollars each year than any other Federal agency. If Americans are to consider the wisdom of that investment intelligently, they must have the facts. It is not a fact that the military budget is being cut -- it is, in fact, going up every year.

HEADLINE: Why Mayor Asked for Another Look at Quebec Hydropower

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report (news article, Aug. 5) that Mayor David N. Dinkins asked New York State to delay signing a contract for Canadian hydropower. 
 New York City's energy policy is to seek the least expensive, environmentally sound sources of power. The high cost of electricity in New York is a serious economic development concern. The Mayor's letter to Richard M. Flynn, Power Authority chairman, urged extending the withdrawal provision in its contract with Hydro-Quebec to assess the economics of the power, which may not be advantageous to the city. A recent state report indicates purchasing this power could at first result in higher charges for electricity for New Yorkers.
The energy marketplace is substantially different from when the 20-year Canadian contract was signed more than two years ago. The Mayor recommended assessing more fully these changes before entering into such a large, long-term contract. In response to the Mayor's letter, Mr. Flynn acknowledged the economic changes and the importance of weighing these factors in reviewing the contract.

HEADLINE: McCaw And Pactel In Accord

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In a deal that moves the nation closer to a national network of cellular telephone service, two of the largest owners of cellular-telephone franchises announced yesterday that they planned to cooperate in some of the biggest cities in the country, including San Francisco, Dallas and Kansas City. Their plan covers some 9.5 million potential customers.
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the nation's largest provider of cellular service, and the Pactel Corporation, a unit of the Pacific Telesis Group and the third-largest provider of cellular service, said they intended to form a 50-50 joint venture. McCaw would contribute some five million potential subscribers, and Pactel would add 4.5 million potential subscribers and pay McCaw $100 million in cash. 
 Wall Street had been watching how both companies would handle the critical San Francisco Bay Area market in particular, where they jointly own much of the access. Because of an unusual arrangement between the two companies, known as the "shotgun agreement," access to more than 4.8 million potential subscribers in San Francisco and nearby San Jose was to come up for sale to either party on Sept. 26.
 
Sale a Problem, Either Way
 But McCaw, already some $5.4 billion in debt from pricy acquisitions of other cellular operations, might have had to go a further $1 billion into debt to buy Pactel's stake. And Pactel, which is based in San Francisco, might have lost the 4.8 million potential customers in its own backyard. In addition, a Pactel purchase of McCaw's stake, for an estimated $500 million, might not have been as attractive an investment for regulatory reasons as other investments.
Yesterday's agreement did not eliminate the shotgun agreement but made it far less likely to be invoked.
Craig O. McCaw, chairman and chief executive of McCaw Cellular, based in Kirkland, Wash., gave an almost audible sigh of relief yesterday. "Now we can move forward in establishing a national network without needless bickering," he said in an interview. "Each company gave a little ground, and I think that's good for the industry."
C. Lee Cox, president and chief executive of Pactel, said in a telephone conference with securities analysts and reporters, "People had seen this as a win-lose situation, but now we've turned this into a win-win situation."
Wall Street appeared, however, to treat the agreement as an anticlimax. Prices for potential subscribers had been skyrocketing from a few dollars a head five years ago to $350 a head when McCaw bought Lin Broadcasting for $3.5 billion last year. Yesterday's agreement set a value of $325 a head, but that value is not effective until a number of conditions are met, including a lengthy arbitration process. Wall Street, therefore, felt the price was basically moot.
McCaw's share price closed unchanged yesterday, at $27.75, in over-the-counter trading, while the share price of Pacific Telesis fell 62.5 cents, to $43, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Advantage Seen for McCaw
 Edward M. Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said McCaw came out slightly ahead in the deal. "McCaw's getting a pretty decent deal," he said, adding that the potential subscribers it was contributing to the deal were "not as attractive as Pactel's."
Under the arrangement, both companies contribute nearly the same number of potential subscribers. But Pactel's come from affluent San Francisco and San Jose and from Dallas, which is nearly as affluent. McCaw's come from a wider and more economically diverse area of Northern California, as well as Kansas City and other Kansas and Missouri cities and towns.
Pactel, McCaw and the Associated Communications Corporation of Pittsburgh belong to a partnership called the Bay Area Cellular Telephone Company, which covers cellular licenses in the San Francisco region. Pactel owns 61 percent, McCaw 33 percent and Associated's subsidiary, California Celcom Communications, 6 percent.
The deal is subject to a 30-day-notice period for California Celcom. The full agreement is expected to close in mid-1992.
Cellular telephones, which can be carried in cars, briefcases or shirt pockets, are a network of mobile radio telephones that connect to local and long-distance service.
McCaw has about 100 million potential subscribers, and Pactel about 28 million.
Size of cellular companies is measured by potential subscribers, rather than actual subscribers, because the industry is still only a few years old and is still establishing itself. There are six million actual subscribers in the country. McCaw has about 1.2 million and Pactel about 750,000.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 7, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 30 about a joint venture by McCawCellular and Pactel misstated the number of potential and actual subscribers to Pactel's cellular telephone service. Pactel has 31 million potential subscribers (not 28 million) and 600,000 actual ones (not 750,000).

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 6.04 Points, to 3,043.60

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Stock prices dropped slightly yesterday in lackluster trading that analysts attributed to the approaching holiday weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 3,043.60, off 6.04 points for the day but up 3.35 for the week.
Computer-based program trading accounted for much of the Dow's decline yesterday. A 20-minute sell program had a lot to do with the Dow's declining more than 12 points around 11:30 A.M. The Dow began to rebound after noon but never rose above its opening level. 
 After "the euphoria that was created by events in the Soviet Union last week," said Edward P. Nicoski, chief market strategist for Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, "investors are starting to settle down and absorb more about what it all means."
 
'A Pre-Holiday Type of Day'
 Mr. Nicoski added that yesterday was "a pre-holiday type of day, with light volume because a lot of traders are away." He continued, "Still, the market should reflect the data that suggest the economy is showing some signs of firmness."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.04 points, to 395.43. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks was down 0.71 point, to 525.68. Meanwhile, the American Stock Exchange's composite index was up 1.18 points, to 372.13. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index was down 0.43 point, to 216.69.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues led declining ones, with 786 up, 753 down and 541 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board was 143.4 million shares, compared with 150.2 million in the previous session.
 
Advanced Micro Most Active
 The most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange was Advanced Micro Devices, a maker of electronic equipment based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The stock was up 1/8, to 12 1/4, with 10.2 million shares changing hands. Siemens, the big German electronics company, yesterday sold its 9.9 percent stake in the company through Goldman, Sachs.
Another active issue on the Big Board was Syntex, a pharmacuetical producer, which dropped 3, to 44 3/4, with 3.3 million shares changing hands. The company's lower quarterly earnings and a government challenge of two of its advertising campaigns, sent the stock downward. Syntex was the second-biggest declining stock on the Big Board yesterday.
The biggest was Oregon Steel, a minimill steel operation, which fell 4 1/4, to 29 1/4. Merrill Lynch trimmed its earnings estimates after the company's announcement that its third-quarter earnings would fall below expectations.
 
Three Stocks' Effect on Dow
 Three stocks accounted for 89 percent of the Dow's decline. Merck was down 1 3/4, to 126 1/8; McDonald's dropped 5/8, to 32 5/8, and Exxon fell 5/8, to 58 1/4.
On the Amex the most active issue was Echo Bay Mines, which fell 1/4, to 7 7/8.
The stock with the largest decline on the Amex was Mitchell Energy. The stock fell 7/8, to 19 5/8. On Thursday, the company said it was unlikely that its third and fourth quarters would match earnings levels of the comparable periods last year, when it benefited from the surge in oil and natural gas prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs in Response To Positive Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar headed higher yesterday in response to several positive economic reports, surprising some traders who had expected uneventful pre-holiday activity.
Gold was lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $348.10, down $2.80 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $348.00, down $3.20 from late Thursday. 
 The Commerce Department said orders to United States factories jumped 6.2 percent in July, which was better than expected and the largest increase since 1970. In addition, the department reported a 1.2 percent jump in the index of leading indicators in July, the sixth straight gain and the biggest advance in more than three years.
In addition, a survey of Chicago-area purchasing managers pointed to a stronger economic outlook.
The dollar gained against all major currencies except the Japanese yen. The reports seemed to indicate that the recovery was back on track, easing fears of a renewed recession.
"People were looking for a quiet day, but we saw the dollar come up fairly surprisingly," said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader for the Bank of Boston. Still, activity subsided by early afternoon as traders began leaving for the Labor Day weekend.
In London, the British pound was unchanged at $1.6805. In New York, it settled at $1.6810, less expensive than late Thursday's $1.6835.
In Tokyo the dollar rose 0.15 yen, to close at 136.88 yen, but later in New York it fell to 136.83 yen from late Thursday's 137.15 yen.
The dollar rose in New York to 1.7470 German marks, from 1.7440 on Thursday. Earlier in Europe, it climbed to 1.7480 marks, from 1.7455.
Other late New York dollar quotes, compared with Thursday's prices, included: 1.5264 Swiss francs, up from 1.5240; 5.9325 French francs, up from 5.9195; 1,302.75 Italian lire, up from 1,301.50, and 1.14175 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14045.
Other late rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5250; 5.9355 French francs, up from 5.9235; 1.9685 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9660; 1,304.00 Italian lire, up from 1,302.25; and 1.1418 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1400.
In the precious metals markets overseas, gold traded in London late yesterday at $347.75 an ounce, down from $351.75 bid late Thursday. And in Zurich, the bid price was $348.00, down from $351.60 late Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped $6.39, to close at $348.54.
Silver fell 1.5 cents an ounce, to $3.807 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. In London, silver was unchanged from Thursday at a bid price of $3.87.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Prices paid to United States farmers in August declined 2.7 percent from July levels, the Government said today.
The decrease comes after a drop of 3.2 percent in July and a rise of 1.1 percent in June. 
 Sharp decreases in cattle and hog prices led the way for August, along with drops in the price of potatoes, the Agriculture Department said in its monthly report on farm prices.
The drop was partly offset by higher prices farmers received for oranges, wheat and milk.
August cattle prices fell sharply to their lowest average level in three years. Hog prices also fell sharply.
Although milk prices rose from July, they continued well below the levels of a year ago, the department said.
Prices of all dairy products rose 2.5 percent from July, but were still 14 percent below a year ago.
Provisions of a dairy bill being discussed in Congress would shore up sagging milk prices paid to farmers and set production controls.
The Agriculture Department has objected to the provisions on the ground that they would force consumers to pay $3 billion more a year for milk.
Prices for lemons and apples joined the rise for oranges.
Vegetable prices slid 6 percent from last month. Lower prices for onions, tomatoes and celery were offset slightly by higher prices for lettuce and sweet corn.
The pace of food price inflation in the last half of 1991 is expected to slow from the first half of the year's 3.8 percent rate, the department said in a report released last week.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Fall in Wake Of New Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates moved higher yesterday, as credit market participants sold securities in the wake of a series of strong economic reports.
The new signs of economic strength reported yesterday followed by a day a series of reports that were almost universally weak and that had pushed up prices of fixed-income securities. 
 Analysts said that yesterday's data -- which included a sharp rise in factory orders and a jump in the Government's index of leading indicators for July -- should not have come as a surprise. Most of the strength shown in those two reports was clearly attributable to the huge rise in July orders for durable goods, an increase reported a week ago.
 
'Triple-Counting Durable Goods'
 "The durable-goods numbers were the big factor in the rise in leading indicators and factory orders," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "It's almost as if we are triple-counting durable goods."
While traders reacted negatively to the reports on factory orders and leading indicators, on the belief that economic strength could reignite inflation, the bulk of the price declines were recorded when the results of an August survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area was released later in the morning.
The report, viewed as a harbinger of the national purchasing managers' survey released on the first business day of each month, showed that manufacturing activity rose sharply in August. The survey's index rose to 56.6 percent, from 50.7 percent in July.
"The surprising strength in the Chicago purchasing managers' report adds credibility to the view that the economy is on track for recovery and that manufacturing continues to show improvement," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company based in Belmont, Calif., said in their daily market commentary.
Trading activity spurted early in the day but later slowed to a trickle as dealers began to leave for the long holiday weekend. The Public Securities Association, an industry group, had recommended that the government securities market close at 2 P.M.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 100 25/32, down 5/8 of a point, to yield 8.05 percent, compared with 8.00 percent late Thursday.
"For the third straight week, bonds hit their weekly high on Thursday only to be trashed on Friday," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income securities markets.
Even with the reverse, a yield of 8.05 percent on the benchmark 30-year bond is below the 8.12 percent level recorded late on the previous Friday, when the strong report on durable-goods orders led to a selloff.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 15/ 32, down 3/8, to yield 7.80 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes auctioned earlier in the week were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.34 percent, compared with 6.27 percent on Thursday.
Rates for short-term Treasury bills moved higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.32 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.35 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 5.39 percent, up 4 basis points.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very light yesterday. Traders in the corporate bond market said prices of most issues dipped by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point.
Prices of most widely quoted municipal bonds slipped by about one-eighth of a point.

HEADLINE: Newmark & Lewis Files for Chapter 11

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Newmark & Lewis Inc., one of the Northeast's most aggressive consumer electronics retailers, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, becoming another victim of the voracious competition among sellers of large appliances and home-entertainment systems.
In its filing, under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the company said it would close 29 stores and focus on the remaining 25, which are primarily in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Those are areas where Newmark has been most profitable in the past. It said it would also maintain stores in Hartsdale, N.Y., and Stamford, Conn. 
 Newmark & Lewis did not indicate how many of its 825 employees would lose their jobs in the closings. Telephone calls yesterday to the company's headquarters in Hicksville, L.I., were not returned, but the company's stores were open for business.
 
Projections Too Optimistic
 The company's filing indicated that the chain was badly hurt by overly optimistic sales projections for the 14 Brick Church electronics stores in New Jersey that it acquired last year for $7.8 million.
The Brick Church acquisition culminated what analysts said was an overly ambitious expansion by Newmark in the last decade. The company opened 33 stores between 1980 and 1990. Newmark's growth coincided with aggressive marketing strategies among consumer electronics chains that pared profit margins to minimal levels by slashing prices.
The company also blamed shrunken consumer spending and the severity of the recession in the Northeast for its problems. Newmark's 56 stores, all in the New York metropolitan region, made it one of the largest electronics retailers in the area. But it incurred large losses recently as sales of washing machines and stereo systems dropped.
Consumers have also sharply reduced their purchases of televisions, dishwashers, refrigerators and other household items in the last two years, deeply cutting into sales at all large electronics chains. Highland Superstores, one of the nation's largest such chains, recently closed 30 stores and eliminated six vice presidents' positions to reduce costs.
Circuit City, the industry leader, was experiencing the same problems until the first quarter of the year, when it reported profits of $8 million, compared with a loss of $43 million during the comparable 1990 period.
"The industry has become increasingly competitive over the last four or five years, as the leading chains have expanded into new geographic markets," said John J. Weiss, an analyst for Montgomery Securities.
But he added that with the collapse of chains like Crazy Eddie, the supernova of electronics retail stores that folded in 1989, fewer chains have stores in New York, so Newmark should have been less susceptible to such competitive pressure. Still, the chain faced stiff regional rivals in the Wiz, 47th Street Photo, P. C. Richards and Tops Appliance City stores.
In its bankruptcy filing, Newmark said sales in stores open at least a year declined by 21.2 percent in July and by 16.3 percent in June, compared with a year earlier.
The chain has been run since 1956 by Richard Lewis and Warren Hyman, who are co-chairmen and co-chief executives. Last year, the company hired Ron Fleisher as president and chief operating officer.
 
Stock Trading Halted
 The Lewis and Hyman families control most of the company's shares, which are traded on the American Stock Exchange. Trading was halted yesterday, but on Thursday, the stock was unchanged at 75 cents. To many, the chain is personified by Mr. Lewis, who is seen on its "Dick Lewis is watching" ads.
Newmark, founded 67 years ago, said that low sales at the Brick Church stores had made it more difficult to continue business. The company said in its filing that sales at the Brick Church stores were about $25 million below expectations.
On Sunday, Newmark incited speculation that it might seek bankruptcy when it closed all its stores for inventory, an unusual move for such a traditionally heavy shopping day and for this time of year.
Analysts, noting the permanent closing of most Newmark stores in New Jersey in July and August, began saying that Sunday's inventory taking was at the behest of Newmark's banks, with which it was trying to renegotiate its loans.

HEADLINE: Economy Index Up, But Some Key Areas Remain in a Slump

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
After a week of confusing signals about the American economy, a pattern appears to be emerging, one that shows strength in manufacturing but weakness in important service sectors like retailing, real estate and financial services.
The strength in manufacturing was clearly evident in yesterday's Commerce Department report that the Government's index of leading indicators had jumped 1.2 percent, the largest monthly increase in three years. 
 That sort of performance usually signals a recovery, but the improvement was almost entirely in components related to manufacturing. The index is intended to forecast turns in the economy but is heavily weighted toward manufacturing at a time when service industries play a bigger role in the nation's economic activity.
The weaknesses outside manufacturing that are evident in the most recent economic data raised the possibility that the incipient recovery from recession might falter.
"There is a chance of a relapse," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm. But he, like other analysts, said that would happen only if the rest of the world cut back on purchases of American goods. "That is where manufacturing's strength is coming from," he added.
Still, Mr. Wyss and others say that manufacturing alone -- even if it keeps its strength -- might not be enough to sustain a recovery, or at least not a strong one, because manufacturing accounts for less than 25 percent of the nation's economic activity. Other activities -- like construction, retailing, insurance, data processing and state and local government spending -- must also expand to sustain a recovery, as they have in previous recoveries.
 
Income and Expectations Stalled
 "Service-sector spending rises when income rises and consumer expectations about the future rise," said Victor Zarnowitz, a University of Chicago economist and forecaster. "Both are stalled today."
The strength in manufacturing, thanks largely to strong exports, particularly of commercial aircraft, and the weaknesses elsewhere were evident in other statistics released over the last 10 days, including yesterday's Commerce Department report that factory orders had risen 6.2 percent in July, the largest monthly increase since December 1970.
A survey of purchasing managers at manufacturing companies in the Chicago area, taken in August and released yesterday, also showed strength, as did last week's report that orders for durable goods had surged in July. That report covered relatively expensive manufactured items like machinery and appliances.
 
Decline in Personal Incomes
 But outside of manufacturing, the personal income of Americans fell in July, after several months of growth, the Government reported on Thursday -- a statistic that in part reflected stagnant job growth. Sales of new and existing homes fell in July, for the first time since spring. And a July poll measuring Americans' confidence in the future strength of the economy showed growing doubts. Consumer confidence and retail sales are often linked.
Finally, the Commerce Department revised -- downward -- an optimistic initial estimate of the gross national product in the second quarter. The Government had said that the G.N.P., which measures the value of all the goods and services created in a particular period, had grown at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent from April to June. But on Wednesday, this rate was changed to a slight contraction, of one-tenth of 1 percent, making three consecutive quarters of economic contraction.
"From the current confusion in numbers you can make a case for recovery or recession," said Michael Keran, the chief economist at the Prudential Insurance Company of America and one of those forecasting recovery. "Any time you are at a turning point in the economy, the data are full of contradictions."
 
Sixth Straight Rise
 The index of leading indicators rose for the sixth consecutive month, a performance that in the past has almost always signaled a recovery. The July rise, the largest since a 1.6 percent increase in June 1988, came on the strength of increases in 7 of the index's 11 components. Nevertheless, the index in July reached only 145.4, still nearly a point shy of its level early in the summer of 1990, when the recession began.
The components showing manufacturing strength included a rise in new factory orders for consumer goods, a rise in orders for plant and equipment, slower delivery times for manufactured goods and an increase in raw-material prices. The only negative manufacturing component was a decline in the average workweek for production workers.
There was also a drop in initial claims for unemployment insurance and a rise in an index of stock prices -- both indications of strength in manufacturing and service industries.
 
The Negative Side
 On the negative side, the index showed a drop in a major poll measuring consumer confidence and a drop in the nation's money supply. The money-supply figure indicated a reluctance on the part of banks to expand their lending, a stimulant for the economy. A small rise in newly issued building permits reflected the recent increase in home construction.
The service-sector weakness showed up clearly in a privately calculated leading index of service-sector activity compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research.
The index, which had risen in recent months, fell to 167.7 in July, from 169.9 in June, the center reported yesterday. The fall came mostly because of a plunge in the average workweek for service-sector employees, reflecting numerous layoffs this summer.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Soviets Estimate Oil Production Will Drop in '91

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's acting oil minister today lowered the estimate of his country's oil production for this year, feeding a growing nervousness among Western analysts that global oil supplies could be extremely tight this winter.
Nobody is predicting serious shortages; oil inventories are neither especially high, nor extremely low. But many analysts believe prices could jump about $2 from the current $22 for a barrel of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude. 
 And they say prices may go even higher if Soviet exports decline more or if Iraq does not go along with a United Nations plan to enable it to export $1.6 billion worth of oil.
 
Year Low Is Forecast
 Vagit Alekperov, the Soviet Union's acting Minister of the Oil and Gas Industry, told Tass, the Soviet news agency, that he expected his country, the world's largest oil producer, to produce an average of 10 million barrels a day this year, according to the Reuters news agency. That would be 200,000 to 500,000 barrels a day less than various Western analysts have been expecting and the lowest production in 16 years, 1.4 million barrels below 1990 output.
John C. Wellemeyer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company in London, said Soviet exports were expected to average about 2 million barrels a day this year, down from about 3 million last year. "If Soviet exports drop significantly below this level to, say, 1.5 million barrels, it will further tighten an already snug supply-demand equation," he said.
The Soviet Union's energy industry has been hampered by inefficiency, lack of equipment and waste. The analysts also say they find it alarming that despite the contraction in the Soviet economy, oil consumption there has not been falling as fast as production.
Morgan Stanley projects a global oil demand in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 1992 of 67.6 million barrels a day, with global production capacity of 68.5 million barrels. "We should be able to get through the winter, unless there is some serious disruption of exports from the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Wellemeyer said.
Analysts concerned about winter oil supplies have assumed that Kuwait, which recently resumed oil exports, will be shipping 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.
They also assume that Iraq will begin exporting oil in the fourth quarter with an average of 500,000 barrels a day for six months. But first, Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, will have to accept the tough conditions of the United Nations plan, which his regime has threatened it will not do.
The plan calls for 30 percent of the revenues to be set aside for war claims and an additional amount to reimburse the United Nations for monitoring, border surveying and other work in Iraq. Sales would be subject to approval by a United Nations committee, and the organization would collect the payments and use them to buy and distribute and food and medicine in Iraq.
 
Eyes on Economic Recovery
 The analysts say they are also assuming that the sluggish global economic recovery will not gather much steam this winter and that winter weather will not be severe.
"We're talking about a system having to work very hard to keep itself balanced," said Keith Hamm, the managing director of Petroleum Economics Ltd., a London-based consulting firm. "Prices could go $2 or so higher during the fourth quarter, but all the risks are on the higher side."
Analysts say members of the Organization of Pretroleum Exporting Countries are now producing about 23.6 million barrels of oil a day and could expand to 24 million barrels or more, excluding the possible Iraqi exports.
"The big question is how much spare capacity is in the system, and the answer is very little," said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.
But an analyst at a Western governmental organization who insisted that he not be identified said Saudi Arabia, the biggest OPEC producer, was producing more than 8.4 million barrels a day, much of it going into stocks. "Commercial stocks around the world are not low," he said.
He said total oil inventories, including strategic reserves, of the 24 developed countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development could supply 98 days of consumption, average for this time of year.

HEADLINE: Greyhound Wins Approval for Its Reorganization Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 30

 BODY:
A Federal judge today cleared the way for Greyhound Lines Inc. to emerge from bankruptcy and continue as the only intercity bus network linking the nation's small towns and major cities.
Under the reorganization plan approved by Judge Richard S. Schmidt of the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Greyhound would become a public company and would repay creditors about 37 cents on the dollar on $539 million of debt the bus company owed when it entered bankrutpcy proceedings in June 1990. 
 The bus company, which posted a slim profit this summer, was forced into bankruptcy during a bitter and violent labor strike led by the Amalgamated Transit Union. The union was seeking higher wages and improved working conditions for 6,000 bus drivers it represented.
 
$195 Million Loss in 1990
 The Greyhound network continued to operate at reduced levels after the strike began on March 2, 1990, with most union drivers replaced by non-union recruits. But because of lost ridership, soaring security costs and bankruptcy expenses, Greyhound Lines lost $195 million in 1990. That amount included a $89.1 million loss from operations and $57.1 million for bankruptcy expenses.
Under Fred G. Currey, the executive who acquired Greyhound in a leveraged buyout from what is now the Dial Corporation in 1987, the company gradually rebuilt the bus system and rehired 800 union drivers who crossed picket lines.
It now employs 3,500 drivers and has offered to fill new openings from the estimated 3,000 drivers who remain on strike. Union officials are holding out for $120 million in back pay from the company, as well as the reinstatement of all striking drivers.
Judge Schmidt, who restricted the union claim to $31.25 million, said Friday in Corpus Christi, Tex., that he thought the union and company would eventually settle the claim.
 
Union Seeks Back Pay
 The dispute over back pay is being heard by the National Labor Relations Board in a court in Milwaukee. Lawyers for Greyhound estimated that it would take 6 to 12 years to resolve.
Despite this threat, in which a large claim against the company could result in several years, 84 percent of the creditors endorsed the reorganization plan. The biggest debtors, which will become the largest shareholders, are Cede & Company, with a claim of $194 million; Security Pacific Leasing Inc., a unit of the Security Pacific Corportion, at $53 million, and Citicorp, at $31.5 million.
The debtors as a group will receive 95 percent of 10 million new shares of stock to be issued by Greyhound Lines before the end of October, with the remainder of the new stock set aside for Greyhound employees in an employee stock ownership trust. The company also plans to issue $165 million in new debt.
 
New Shares Seen at $4.
 The new shares probably will be priced near $4 each and will either be listed on the American Stock Exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market after they are issued, said Frank J. Schmieder, president and chief executive.
Mr. Schmieder replaced Mr. Currey as chief executive after Mr. Currey, who had taken a hard line against striking drivers, resigned in May. The company has not confirmed published reports that creditors paid Mr. Currey $1.2 million as part of his severance agreement. He and other investors in the 1987 buyout, which included Paine Webber Group Inc., lost all of their investment because of the bankruptcy.
The company projected in a revised reorganization plan filed on July 10 that its revenues would grow to $915.2 million in 1995 from an estimated $791.1 million in 1992. It estimated that the book value would increase to $20.30 a share in 1995 from $6.30 this year.
"We're better than break-even now" in operations, Mr. Schmieder said in an interview. He said the average trip length in July of 450 miles was the highest in the bus line's history. Greyhound buses, with maximum average seating of 43 people, carried an average of 29 people a trip, a comparatively high occupancy rate, Mr. Schmieder said.
"The economy has improved enough that people are giving us a chance, and our pricing has been very aggressive," he said.
The company offered a one-way pass for $68 to anywhere in the country this summer as airlines were raising discount fares.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
New Soviet Security Chiefs Pledge to Revamp Agencies And To End The Use Of Fear

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The new heads of the K.G.B. and the Soviet defense forces announced plans today to reform their organizations, but each insisted on the need to keep them from fragmenting.
Vadim V. Bakatin, the head of the K.G.B. said at a press conference that he would ban the use of secret informers, as part of a move to turn the once-fearsome watchdog of the Communist state into a traditional intelligence agency, operating within the strict limits of the law. 
 Nothing has aroused more fear in Soviet society than concern that one's actions were being reported by unknown informers to the secret police, which is known to have kept dossiers on millions of people.
 
'Uncontrolled by Anything'
 Mr. Bakatin described the old K.G.B., which is undergoing a purge after the failure of last week's coup, as "uncontrolled by anything and anyone" and said its accumulation of a monopoly on power led it to turn on the state.
And the newly named Defense Minister, Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, said in an interview published today in Krasnaya Zvezda, the Defense Ministry newspaper, that the Soviet Army would become a more professional organization when it is rid of the oversight role of Communist political commissars, abolished this week by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Marshal Shaposhnikov said he would try to move the army toward a voluntary structure, akin to that of the United States Army, depending on the world situation. Draftees' terms would be cut, he said, from 24 to 18 months.
 
Azerbaijan Breaks
 Mr. Bakatin said he was proposing to establish an agency shorn of all functions but intelligence, counter-intelligence and investigation of state crimes like terrorism, corruption and currency manipulation. He said the K.G.B., now rid of its Communist overseers, would no longer operate as a secret political force, with tentacles reaching into all corners of Soviet life.
"The services of secret informers will not be employed by us, and we will not use that term," said Mr. Bakatin, a former Minister of Internal Affairs who was approved in his new job yesterday by the Soviet Parliament.
On a day when changes in these conservative organs were being discussed, Azerbaijan, a Muslim republic on the Iranian border, became the latest candidate for independence.
And the republics of Russia and Kazakhstan, the two largest in area, announced an accord paralleling one reached between Russia and the Ukraine a day earlier, indicating that in the midst of the declarations of independence, steps were being taken to hold the union together.
Although both the K.G.B. and the armed forces will remain centrally controlled, both Mr. Bakatin and Marshal Shaposhnikov made allowances for a growing role by the republics.
The K.G.B., said Mr. Bakatin, would work "with the republics, not over them." The Defense Minister acknowledged a new role for the republics, in "implementing military policy, drawing up the defense budget, training reserves and organizing conscription." He said small national guards would exist alongside the central defense effort.
A blow was dealt today to an attempt by Mr. Gorbachev to put together a new team of advisers that reflect the resurgent powers of the republics and other democratic forces when three liberal political figures declined to sit on the revamped Security Council.
Aleksandr N. Yakovlev and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, two former allies of Mr. Gorbachev who were shoved aside by a conservative backlash, declined to take seats on the council, as did Moscow's Mayor, Gavriil K. Popov. Leningrad's Mayor, Anatoly A. Sobchak, said he would first have to consult with his electorate.
"I am first and foremost Mayor of St. Petersburg," said Mr. Sobchak, according to a report on Radio Russia. By refusing to take on the work of the Security Council, now redrawn to reflect the growing role of the republics, the liberal politicians seemed to signal that they were not ready to fully commit themselves to Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to save the union, despite his latest political transformation.
 
Makings of New Order
 Even as the old union came under new strains, the makings of a new order began to emerge as a special team delegated by the Russian republic made its way from the Ukraine to Kazakhstan, where it negotiated another joint communique outlining temporary arrangements "to ensure the lifeline systems for the population and the functioning of the economy."
The separate Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Kazakhstan agreements put off major questions about the future bonds that will tie these giant republics together. But to an anxious public, the documents at least suggested that politicians were trying to prevent the complete collapse of the country.
Nine of the 15 Soviet republics were due to have signed a new union treaty last week, but in the wake of last week's coup, all sides, including Mr. Gorbachev, agreed that a more radical formula for devolving power from the center must be found.
 
Cheers for Independence
 The epidemic of independence declarations has swept the Baltic republics, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia and now Azerbaijan, the eighth of the 15 republics to break away and the first that is predominantly Muslim.
Two other republics in the Caucasus, Armenia and Georgia, had already signaled their intention to leave the union, with Armenia due to vote on a referendum for independence next month.
The vote for independence today in the Azerbaijan Parliament was greeted with cheers at a huge public gathering in Freedom Square, formerly Lenin Square, in the capital, Baku. The parliamentary vote was unanimous, but at the same time, the members pledged to broaden and strengthen ties with other Soivet republics.
Independence has long been a goal of the Azerbaijan Popular Front, an opposition movement that holds 21 of the 200 seats in the republic's Parliament. But this week, the President of the Republic, Ayaz Mutalibov, who was also the republic's Communist Party leader, jumped on the bandwagon, jettisoning his top party posts as he threw his political weight behind independence.
Azerbaijan has been locked in a bitter conflict with Armenia over jurisdiction of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region with a majority Armenian population and lying inside Azerbaijan.
On the eve of the independence declaration in Baku, Mr. Mutalibov sent a message to Moscow that reflected some of the confusion in the republics. In an interview on Russian television, he warned against any moves to withdraw Soviet troops from Nagorno-Karabakh, saying it would lead to a "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre."
In Moscow, the drive for independence in Communist-dominated republics like Azerbaijan is seen largely as ruse by local leaders to protect their fiefs from liberal reforms, including the suspension of the Communist Party and the seizure of its vast holdings.
But at the same time, the coup d'etat last week and the subsequent rise in the influence of the Russian republic has also fueled nationalist desires to be free of Moscow, and its unpredictable, potentially dangerous ways.
In the republic of Kazakhstan, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, indicated today that he was now satisfied that the Russian republic was not looking to claim the territory of its neighbors.
Both Kazakhstan and the Ukraine had been alarmed by a statement by an aide to the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, that Russia would demand a review of its borders if neighboring republics withdrew from the union.
 
Yeltsin in Baltic States
 Mr. Yeltsin, who together with Mr. Gorbachev has emerged as a champion of a new union of Soviet republics, today flew to the Baltic states. But the exact purpose of his mission was unknown, and a spokeman said the Russian President would not make a public statement until he returned.
The Russian republic has already recognized the independence of two Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, and is lobbying for a loose union based largely on economic ties.
Today in Moscow, economic ministers from all 15 republics, including the six that had boycotted the earlier negotiations over a union treaty, met to discuss some form of economic union intended to keep their industries from being caught in the spiral of disintegration.
The meeting was attended by the Russian Prime Minister, Ivan S. Silayev, who is heading a committee charged with putting together a new Government for the Soviet Union and giving it a plan for economic reform.
In an interview with the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta published today, Mr. Silayev said the new economic union could come in any number of forms. But the need to maintain old links was emphasized today by a deputy energy minister who noted that all republics were too dependent on the country's energy grid to break away.
"The Omsk region, for example, gets its electricity from Kazakhstan, which in turn gets power from the Urals," he said. "The Urals gets it from the Volga. To tear apart the emergy links is impossible, it would be equivalent to catastrophe."
The changes in Moscow also swept out two Deputy Foreign Ministers today. The new Foreign Minister, Boris D. Pankin, dismissed the two men while pledging to pursue pragmatic policies initiated by his predecessor, Mr. Shevardnadze.
The Tass news agency said Mr. Pankin dismissed Yuli M. Kvitsinsky, a central player in efforts during the 1970's to reach an accord on medium-range nuclear arms, and later the Ambassador to West Germany. Vladimir Petrovsky replaced him. Mr. Kvitsinsky was perhaps best known in the West as one of the negotiators of the "walk in the woods" plan, which posited deep cuts in Soviet and American medium-range nuclear arms. At the same meeting, Mr. Pankin also dismissed Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Nikiforov.
He also said he would follow the goals of Soviet foreign policy under Mr. Shevardnadze. In a Soviet television interview, he said he planned to draw the Soviet Union closer to "the world of civilized states."

HEADLINE: New Issues Born From Communism's Death Knell

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
When Communism died its formal death in Moscow, it seemed as though there was a corresponding death knell in this country and in Western Europe.
Dead also, or, at least, considerably faded, was the question that has produced the fiercest arguments and the sharpest conflicts among intellectuals in more than 70 years, arguments about Marxism-Leninism and social revolution, about the nature of the Soviet Union and about the existence of Communism as a major ideological force in a bipolar world. 
 And so, the question is: if the debate about Communism is likely to lose its force and centrality, what issues will consume left and right, liberals and conservatives, in the future?
Interviews with scholars and political analysts indicate that the new splits will not be about such grand questions as the way to organize society. The debate between liberals and conservatives is already showing signs of focusing individually on smaller, more personal, domestic issues like poverty, crime, race, health care, abortion, multi-culturalism and the role of government in subsidizing the arts.
"What we're looking at now is the end of utopianism and the all encompassing model to explain human society," said R. Bruce McColm, the executive director of Freedom House, a human rights organization based in New York.
"You have a collapse of ideologies, so there is no rigid orthodoxy that one has to espouse, or risk being ejected from an entire subculture if one does not espouse it. So, I think the freeing up of the intellectual climate is going to be very beneficial."
 
The 'End of History'
 Joseph Nye, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, put it slightly differently. "We had a bipolar world, and we had a bipolar intellectual debate," he said. "The fact that there was a clear and present danger from an ideological enemy with enormous power had the effect of polarizing the domestic debate."
Some might feel that the "end of history" heralded by the writer Francis Fukuyama a couple of years ago, when he was a policy planner in the State Department, has actually arrived. With the triumph of the Western liberal idea, Mr. Fukuyama said, there will be no room for any meaningful evolution of the human spirit.
Professor Nye disagreed. "Even though there's now no equivalent to American power and no real alternative to liberal democratic ideology, there's going to be a diffusion of power and ideas," he said. "In this sense, it's not the end of history but a return of history."
 
A Change in Focus
 Without the focus on the bipolar world, he said, there is going to be more attention to the relationships among hundreds of nations and ethnic groups.
"That's going to raise a whole new set of questions," Professor Nye said, "questions about identity, multi-culturalism, what we mean by nationality and the national interest. A whole complex of issues regarding how we think about ourselves, which was locked up in the world of bipolar competition, is going to become unstuck."
Communism remains entrenched in China, the world's most populous country, as well as in Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam. But it is virtually inevitable that the disgrace and formal suspension of the Soviet Communist Party -- even as the party remains legal in the United States -- will transform the nature of future debates, since the Soviet party has been the font from which all other Communist movements drew their original inspiration.
 
A New View of World
 "For people of my generation, who grew up in the shadow of the cold war, it's very difficult to conceive of a world that is not divided into two blocs," said Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University whose specialty is the American left.
"It's true that one bloc has been disappearing for several years now, but how to conceptualize a world in which the Soviet Union does not exist as a superpower is very difficult for me. And think of students who will be entering school in a few years. For them, this division of the world will seem like ancient history."
The most obvious power exercised by the Soviet Union over the Western mind was its extraordinary power of attraction, its capacity to instill idealistic visions of a new world in which exploitation would be swept away by a tide of revolution.
During the 1930's in particular, the intelligentsia was split into hostile camps, one treasuring the hope that Stalinism represented a path to genuine social justice, the other furious over what it saw as blindness to Stalin's crimes.
 
Other Brands of Communism
 In later decades, particularly in the 1950's and 1960's, the appeal of the Soviet Union itself sharply faded as it became more and more apparent that Stalin and his successors were not flawed idealists but brutal totalitarians.
Still, the debate took on new forms. There was the anti-Communist scare of the late 1940's and early 1950's, particularly the brief ascendancy of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. There were the celebrated espionage trials of Alger Hiss and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
From the 1960's to the 1980's, an argument raged, less about the nature of the Soviet Union itself, and more about some of the inheritors of the Marxist-Leninist tradition, particularly in countries like China, Ethiopia, Cuba and Nicaragua, which seemed to many on the left to embody the revolutionary virtues admittedly tarnished in the Soviet Union itself.
In the early 1970's, for example, there was a bitter debate in this country over whether China under Mao Zedong was creating new forms of democratic participation or was merely a new face of Communist totalitarianism.
In the United Nations for many years, the debate was often framed in terms of a contest between the believers in individual rights, which were espoused by the Western, free-market democracies, or what were called "social rights," or "group rights," a code for socialist approaches in Africa and Latin America.
"It has to be remembered that until recently there was a strong feeling that there was an alternative out there to Western liberal democracy," said Carl Gershman, the president of the National Endowment for Democracy, a group in Washington, partly financed by Congress, that fosters democratic movements abroad. "There was a belief in a higher form of democracy, one that emphasized results, equality, that could really achieve things.
"That debate was waged in the United Nations between those who believed in political rights and those who believed in what were called social rights. It took all of one's energies to make the case for why freedom was important."
Not everybody believes that this debate will disappear forever, or that the tension between individual rights and the collective welfare will disappear altogether.
 
Question for Future
 "One aspect of the old debate is the tension between political democracy and social democracy," said Victor Navasky, the editor of The Nation, a weekly magazine of generally leftist opinion. "The fact that the Soviet style, totalitarianism, whatever you want to call it, was the apparent disaster that it was does not mean that there is no value to economic democracy. It's going to remain a question for the future."
More generally, however, the absence of global ideological conflict could have the effect of freeing up various tendencies in American life to pursue what might have been more natural directions.
Professor Foner argues, for example, that American political discourse was in many ways distorted by the very existence of the Soviet Union. American radicals and liberals, those who wanted the state to insure economic justice, tended to see the Soviet system as a model that had to be defended, even when they were uncomfortable with its oppressiveness. Conservatives, seeking to put the greatest distance between themselves and the Soviets, became almost religious believers in the power of the unhindered free market.
What seems possible now is that some of the rigidity of the debate might disappear. Broadly speaking, the left, as Professor Foner put it, "could think about American society without having to bear the burden of some far away model that does not hold the key to our society."
Similarly on the right, Professor Foner said, "It may be that without the need to attack Communism, other forms of conservatism may appear, which are not so fully married to the alleged virtues of the free marketplace."

HEADLINE: About New York

BYLINE: By Felicia R. Lee

 BODY:
Many of the bad things that can happen in the underground adventure known as the New York City subway system have happened to Roy Lee, a lawyer who commutes everyday on the No. 2 or No. 3 train from his Upper West Side home to his office in lower Manhattan.
Mr. Lee has been viciously squeezed in doors, lost his glasses on the tracks, and waited for trains for what seemed hours as the public-address system cackled an incomprehensible message. He has dodged subterranean thugs. During power failures he has sat in darkened cars with people who do things like commune with spirits from other planets. 
 Now, like many other commuters, Mr. Lee says the accident on the Lexington Avenue IRT line that killed five people and injured more than 200 has heightened a basic fear for his safety. And, like many others in a city stung by the recession and reeling from a host of other problems, Mr. Lee feels that worrying about his safety adds another uniquely New York burden.
"I think about it every time I get on the train," Mr. Lee said of the accident as he descended the steps at the Park Place station near City Hall. "I think that it can happen any time. It could be the system, not any particular motorman. A lot of these trains are defective."
"You've got to look the motorman in the eye, make sure he's O.K.," offered Jocelyn Ancrum, a homemaker who often takes the Lexington Avenue line with her two toddlers.
"Don't sit in the front cars and don't sit in the back cars," chimed in her companion, Anita Steadman. "If you smell smoke, leave. If the train goes too fast, get off. And don't stand in the middle of the car -- that other accident, the cars got cut in half."
During a recent afternoon visit to the Park Place station where the 1, 2, and 3 trains stop and the Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall station where signs announced that the 4, 5, and 6 Lexington Avenue trains are temporarily silent, people shared subway advice and tales like old soldiers swap war stories.
People spoke of the fear of the darkened tunnels at night and of tucking their jewelry out of sight. They talked about the tokens that do not work, the crowding, the noise, the smells, the beggars and the unexpected schedule changes that send them whizzing past their stops. They said the accident just adds another layer of concern.
"I'm afraid of the same thing happening again," said Christina Gonzalez, a college student. "Most accidents occur because there is something wrong with the system. It seems like there is always something happening on the trains and we're all just stuck with it. You can't change companies, like you do for the telephone."
Most disconcerting, said Ms. Gonzalez, is when the train stops without explanation or when, like the other day, you are waiting for an N or an R train and an E shows up.
"I think people are more jumpy," Ms. Gonzalez said. "All the trains seem to be going too fast or too slow."
Perhaps more than any other institution in the city, the trains are the great democratizer, where the maid and stockbroker sit side by side, sharing in the advertisements for relief for hemorrhoids and the tales of woe spun by bedraggled panhandlers. Many people said yesterday that unpredictable and chaotic, but awesome in their speed and varied routes, the trains symbolize the best and the worst of New York -- a city that sometimes seems to be falling apart.
"If something doesn't happen, I'm surprised," said Carol Wilkin, who takes the No. 1 train each day from the Bronx to her job in Manhattan as a service representative for a health-care group. "I don't think about it. It's part of what's going on, as part of the decay of the infrastructure."
"I'm like, should I get on the train or take the bus?" said Darrell Washington, a Tilden High School student. Mr. Washington, who lives in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and takes the train to points all over the city, said it is the fastest and cheapest way to get around.
He spoke in the sweltering Park Place station as a man cursed a subway worker and two teen-agers blithely sneaked under a turnstile.
"I try to go to the back cars ever since that accident," Mr. Washington said.
Commuters shared various coping mechanisms. One woman said she never got on a car on which there were no women. Some people said they always carried a book so they would not be pestered. Others rode only in the front or back cars.
"I'm always afraid to ride the subway," said Christine Duncan, who travels from the Bronx to Pace University in lower Manhattan, where she studies accounting. "Nowadays I'm thinking maybe you're safer if you sit close to an exit or close to the conductor."
At the telephone booth near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge station, a woman called friends to tell them that the IRT line was not running yet.
"That's life," she said. "Nothing in New York works these days."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev: Larger Than Life

 BODY:
In the impassioned debate over preserving some form of Soviet union, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev may not carry the day. But that will not be for want of personal courage, eloquence and leadership.
Betrayed by faithless comrades, he now calls for justice and unity rather than vengeance. Belittled by democratic opponents, the Soviet President has by force of character put himself at the center of the struggle to prevent the violent disintegration of a far-flung empire. 
 This may be Mr. Gorbachev's final battle. But he has already been counted out twice, first by the coup plotters and their passive accomplices, then by the ebullient supporters of his rival, Boris Yeltsin. This epic drama is far from over.
Whatever his faults and past equivocations, Mr. Gorbachev has, through these turbulent days, acquitted himself with courage and sense. He has been humiliated but not broken by three tests.
The first was the shock of betrayal on Aug. 19, when he confronted his captors without yielding to their demands. Then after his return, still half-dazed, he seemed oddly determined to uphold a bankrupt party.
The next day he confronted a jeering Russian parliament as Mr. Yeltsin jabbed his finger, demanding that he read out the list of Judases who approved the coup. It was a scene of intense drama. To the watching world, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to turn into an exultant bully, bent on abasing his former patron.
Mr. Gorbachev survived, even as he embraced the unthinkable the next day by resigning as party chief. By Tuesday, as though he had had his first decent night's sleep, he came roaring back. His urgent words focused directly on the need for order and union. Gone was the vacillation that had made him appear too radical for the old guard, too cautious for impatient democrats.
He is now resiliently using his last shred of power, his threat to quit as President of a dissolving Soviet Union. He has become a tower of strength in the struggle to avert bloodshed, witch hunts and an economic tailspin.
For Americans, no less than for Mr. Gorbachev, this has been a chastening fortnight. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan says of him, "Our problem is that we couldn't believe him. We had built up institutions whose existence was predicated on his nonexistence -- on the very impossibility of someone like him coming along." That a Communist could open windows into a hermetic police state seemed impossible.
At first, many Westerners believed his reforms were a trick; when it became obvious this was not so, he was faulted for his concessions to hard-liners. And then when he seemed to fall, some quickly insisted that the cold war was back. Not for the first time, the experts were confounded.
In his first six years, Mr. Gorbachev implanted the ideas of freedom in authoritarian soil. In the last two weeks he has fought to preserve them. Whatever the shape of the new union that emerges, with or without Mr. Gorbachev and whether or not it incorporates the Ukraine or Central Asian republics, his role has been heroic.

HEADLINE: A Japanese Glass Ceiling for U.S. Managers?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The timing of hearings in a House subcommittee concerning alleged discrimination in hiring and promotion practices at the managerial level in Japanese-owned companies in the United States seemed unfortunate, coming upon the 46th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
 I hope the subcommittee's chairman, Representative Tom Lantos, is not suggesting Japanese companies are the sole culprits in this practice. The alleged victims -- white males -- may be not accustomed to their new status of not always being in charge.
For years it has been known that discrimination in corporate management is one of America's dirty little secrets, used against members of minority groups and women. The glass ceiling they bump up against when promotions are in the offing was conveniently discovered by Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin as the 1992 election looms. Maybe Ms. Martin ought to remind her boss, President Bush, about it before he vetoes the civil rights bill for the third time.
Congress is in no moral position to level charges against Japanese companies as long as this shameful situation exists in American-owned companies. Antidiscrimination laws and practices ought to be applied to all enterprises operating within our borders, not merely to the Japanese.
It is ironic and hypocritical for some Americans to criticize Japanese companies for having the temerity to bring their own nationals to manage their enterprises here while those same Americans receive their money, expertise and products.
Third world countries have long made similar complaints against the managerial training practices of American-owned multinational corporations. They were lectured on the merits of private investment and on the need for economic interdependence in a global economy or ignored or, worse, dismissed as anti-American ingrates. Now that the tables are turned, might not this advice still be valid? Is this not the reality of the global economy in the new world order?

Ex-Chief Returning To Janitorial Concern

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
At the age of 76, Sydney J. Rosenberg is stepping back into the chief executive's position at American Building Maintenance Industries, after a somewhat mysterious change of leadership.
The company, one of the nation's largest providers of janitorial services, with annual revenues of about $700 million, said earlier this week that its board had decided not to renew the contract of R. David Anacker, 56 years old, who had been the chief executive since 1984. Mr. Rosenberg, a principal shareholder and chairman, will step in on Oct. 31. 
 No reason was given for the change at the San Francisco-based company, and Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Anacker were unavailable for interviews.
"It's an absolute mindblower because David has been with the company for 32 years," said Lewis H. Alton, the managing partner of L. H. Alton & Company, a San Francisco investment banking company. "It's sort of been like a paternal relationship."
Mr. Alton said he spoke with both men after the announcement but could not find the reason for the change. He said that American Building, whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has been doing well, continuing to grow despite the recession. Its stock finished unchanged yesterday at $33.50.
American Building Maintenance was founded in 1909 by Mr. Rosenberg's father, Morris, a window washer. It now operates nationwide, cleaning such buildings as the BankAmerica headquarters and the TransAmerica pyramid in San Francisco.
Sydney Rosenberg and his 82-year-old brother, Theodore, took over after their father died in 1935, and together own 30 percent of the stock. Even during Mr. Anacker's tenure as chief executive, the brothers were actively involved, with Sydney as chairman and Theodore as chairman of the board's executive committee.
Mr. Rosenberg is expected to have no trouble physically adjusting to the demands of the chief executive's post. A golf and tennis player, he has never stopped putting in full days at the office.
William W. Steele, who has also been with the company for 32 years, will become president and chief operating officer. He has been the executive vice president and chief operating officer, with responsibility for the company's nonjanitorial operations, which include operating parking lots and providing heating, ventilation and other services for buildings.

Porsche Cuts Staff In U.S. by 23%

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Porsche Cars North America Inc., a marketing operation of the German maker of luxury sports cars, laid off 23 percent of its staff, citing a depressed auto market. The layoffs affect 77 of the operation's 339 workers.
 "This is a clear indication of how hurtful the luxury tax has been, on top of the effects of the recession, in our key markets," the company's president, Brian Bowler, said. Through the first seven months of this year, 2,844 Porsche 
cars have been sold, 51.6 percent fewer than last year. Sales by other makers of luxury cars, especially European ones, have lagged substantially behind last year, including a 52.3 percent decline for Jaguar, a 44.5 percent drop for Audi and a 22.1 percent decrease for Mercedes-Benz. Earlier this year, Peugeot of France and Sterling Motor Cars of England withdrew from the United States market.
