HEADLINE: Coney Island on the Edge;
A Region's Venerable Magic Is Buffeted by Modern Times

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF 

 BODY:
It is historical fact that nearly every inch of Coney Island has burned to the ground at one time or another. The amusement rides, rows of shops on the avenues, a few of the antique hotels and long stretches of the Boardwalk have disappeared. And then they have risen again, reassuring old-timers that Coney Island's magic is somehow invincible, yet making them wistful for the way things once were.
It has always been this way on the tiny peninsula: danger mixed with a cool breeze off the ocean, hurly-burly mingled with the gentle sands, an odd, teetering feeling that leaves many just the slightest bit on edge. 
 A new season is upon Coney Island. This means that the Cyclone has taken on a fresh coat of white paint, the beach has received its first rush of sun worshipers and the streets have regained the expectant feeling of summertime bustle.
 
Images of Pleasure and Pain
 "I love this place," said Milton Grapper, a Manhattan real-estate investor who jumped out of his BMW last week to grab a quick hot dog with relish at Nathan's. "But I know it's a lot in my head."
The illusion of Coney Island works both ways. The carnival atmosphere and the beachfront dreaminess can hide the real problems of drug dealing, gunplay and the assorted violence found on the blocks north of the ocean. But when a notorious crime attracts attention to the community, as the rape of a jogger on April 7 did, it also masks the strides Coney Island seems to have made in recent years.
For the first time since the early 1970's, when public housing projects brought a severe dose of inner-city misery to Coney Island, residents can point to signs of improvement in their neighborhood. Just a decade ago Coney Island was viewed as a neighborhood in inexorable decline, but today neat rows of two-story single-family homes are a sign that the middle class is being replenished, this time by an influx of immigrants.
And despite the news media's attention to the Boardwalk rape, statistics show that in many categories crime is declining in Coney Island. For instance, robberies have dropped from a peak of 1,379 in 1985 to 1,082 last year, in part because of increased summer patrols of the Boardwalk area. And burglaries have fallen from a high of 1,975 in 1980 to 1,203 in 1992 to 975 last year.
 
Businesses, Old and New
 In addition, there is a feeling of renewal on the commercial strips of Mermaid and Neptune Avenues, areas that not long ago had been stagnant. New business spaces are being planned, and longtime merchants are involved in a project to restore their storefronts. The old businesses -- the Gerace & Sons bread shop and Gargiulo's Italian restaurant -- keep the old Coney Island flavor alive. And the Army Corps of Engineers is involved in a long-term, $26.8 million project to rebuild the area's prime asset: the Coney Island beachfront.
Still, the contrasts persist. On a clear, blue afternoon a man with a paint brush stood midway on a rung of one of the Cyclone roller coaster's giant curves, quietly applying a finishing touch to the spindly frame. The carousel spun with a few of the first young faces of a new season, and a couple of eager swimmers emerged shriveled but exhilarated from the Atlantic. It could have been 1930 or 1940 or any year.
But at Faber's Arcade on Surf Avenue, the din of video machines added a decidedly modern intrusion. Nearby, two officers leaped out of a squad car and commanded two youths in baggy jeans to raise their hands. The officers suspected that the teen-agers were concealing guns in their waistbands. They were not.
 
'They're Killing This Place'
 But as soon as the officers drove off, the two youths began screaming and shouting at three young women. Then they began shouting at one another, nose to nose, drawing the officers back to the scene. This time the officers did not leap out of the car.
"I grew up around here," said one officer, with the bitter tone of someone who had seen his old neighborhood transformed over the years by young troublemakers. "They're killing this place, so let them kill each other."
Perhaps because traces of the old Coney Island still exist, and its shoreline vistas still retain their beauty, there is a poignancy to the neighborhood's problems that probably cannot be found anywhere else in New York. Residents complain that City Hall looks at Coney Island and sees just the surface allure, and not a community with a gamut of needs like any other neighborhood.
 
Small but Diverse Area
 "We just don't get as much attention," said Judi Orlando, executive director of the Astella Development Corporation, which has helped to finance and build more than 700 single-family homes in Coney Island in the last 13 years and is building 148 more. The construction has partly transformed an area that runs between West 15th and West 37th Street, between Mermaid Avenue and Neptune Avenue.
Ms. Orlando said Coney Island's small size -- about a mile and a quarter long and a few city blocks wide -- tended to isolate it. It is too often overlooked when it comes time to receive city money, she said. In addition, while Coney Island's mixed population of black, Hispanic, Russian, Italian, Chinese and Middle Eastern residents creates an ethnic charm, the diversity can also deprive Coney Island of any concerted political clout, Ms. Orlando said.
The result, perhaps, is that while there are enough restaurants and auto repair shops and other businesses, there are few outlets to keep many of the teen-agers from idleness or worse, turning to violence and drugs.
Still, hope has seeped in of late. Diane Bowman lives in the Ocean Towers on West 24th Street and is the mother of three children, including two teen-agers. She said she had to be constantly vigilant to shield them from the perils just downstairs, in the courtyards of the housing development and in the streets.
But Ms. Bowman said she was committing herself and her family to the community, in part through her work with Coney Island United Services. The program, which has counseling sessions for youths, AIDS workshops, leadership projects and volunteer work programs, is something of a recent phenomenon in an area that for years had no such programs. Ms. Bowman said she was in the process of buying one of the new homes through the Astella company.
"Sometimes I forget, too," she said. "The water, the air. It's hard not to love Coney Island."
Dick D. Zigun, the closest thing to Coney Island's curator, is also optimistic. He is the artistic director of Coney Island U.S.A., a small production company that presents off-Boardwalk theater and circus sideshows. He also owns a refreshment stand on the Boardwalk and a large room filled with relics from Coney Island's golden age: a rolling chair for two, bathhouse signs and wooden bottles enshrined in a glass case, looking as unshakable as ever.
After watching all the rides west of Stillwell Avenue disappear over time, he has seen new amusements open in the last few years. And he said the old Steeplechase Park, which closed in 1964, may yet be reborn.
Mr. Zigun issued what amounted to a kind of battle cry, saying Coney Island always seems to be able to survive in the face of disaster. When a great fire swept through Coney Island in 1903, he said, people kept dancing at the Steeplechase ballroom.
In Coney Island, though, there is always a bittersweet counterpoint. Only a few blocks from where Mr. Zigun spoke on the Boardwalk, Raymond Leary stood on Surf Avenue and braced himself against a persistent wind off the ocean.
 
'Looking for Trouble'
 Mr. Leary is 22 years old, unemployed, and said he spends a good deal of his time doing exactly what he was doing at that moment, "just looking around."
"Everywhere you look, there are guys looking for trouble," he said. "Sometimes they rob. Sometimes they're selling drugs. Sometimes, like me, we do nothing."
But the mere mention of a new season, he said, had him excited, and instantly gave him the wistful, narrow-eyed look of a true Coney Island veteran.
"The Coney Island when I was a kid -- that was some kind of Coney Island," Mr. Leary said.

HEADLINE: In a Pinch, Philanthropic Spirit Stays Afloat

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
Philanthropic giving in the nation rose 3.5 percent, to $126.2 billion, last year, as donors stepped up their contributions to an increasing number of charities, officials said.
In the New York region, gains were more modest, but on a per capita level among employees in 152 major corporations, the increase was 4 percent. 
 But nationally, charities found these modest gains were eroded by higher operating costs for things like salaries and benefits, according to "Giving USA, 1994," the yearbook of the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, which released the annual figures.
"Given the sluggish economy and given the persistent, relatively high unemployment rate in 1993, the generosity of Americans continues to be encouraging," said Martin Grenzebach, chairman of the trust.
In 1992, charitable giving rose by 4 percent over the previous year, and officials held out hope that contributions would continue to increase at a similar pace.
"We're very optimistic for next year's performance," Mr. Grenzebach said.
The United Way of Tri-State, which conducts fund-raising campaigns for corporations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, also reported slightly higher giving.
The 32 local United Ways secured pledges of $108.4 million in the most recent drive, an increase of $250,000. The year before, donations for the Tri-State drive actually declined, as giving was adversely affected by the recession and the questions about the salary and spending of William A. Aramony, who was ousted as president of United Way of America in February 1992.
The Tri-State campaigns reported successes last year despite substantial job cutbacks at companies like International Business Machines, American Express and Nynex.
 
Some Major Factors
 "Giving in the New York region showed a 4 percent increase in per capita contributions, suggesting those who had jobs wanted to give more," said Betty Beene, president of Tri-State. At least 62 percent of the contributions to Tri-State drives came from employees' voluntary payroll deductions, she said.
"That smaller workforces would raise more money succeeded against all odds," she said.
Mr. Grenzebach predicted that charitable contributions could grow markedly in coming years based on a number of factors. First, the coming two decades will likely see a transfer of trillions in wealth from parents' estates to their children, creating more millionaires; secondly, the so-called baby-boomers will be moving into the 34-to-65 age group, when people typically have more discretionary money to give.
Furthermore, charities are getting more sophisticated in their fund-raising techniques, and more institutions are seeking out donors. In the affluent Chicago suburb of Winnetka, for instance, the school district is developing a privately financed foundation to raise money to enhance education in four local public schools, modeled in part on one in Bronxville, N.Y.
The new Giving USA yearbook shows that individual living donors, historically the major provider of philanthropy, gave $102.5 billion; another $8.5 billion was from bequests. Giving by foundations rose to $9.2 billion, reflecting improvement in their investment returns, while corporate giving accounted for $5.9 billion, showing no gain.
As always, the largest share of giving went to religious organizations, which received $57.1 billion, while education received $15 billion, human services $12.4 billion and health $10.8 billion, with smaller shares going to arts and environmental and other organizations.

HEADLINE: Go-Ahead on Altered Crops Is Met by a 'Go Slow'

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST LANSING, Mich., May 18

 BODY:
A genetically altered tomato and a genetically engineered cow hormone are on the market, each winning Federal approval after years of scrutiny.
But other new products are likely to have a much easier journey to the grocery store. The Clinton Administration is planning to give the agricultural biotechnology industry broad authority to market most other genetically engineered crops without intensive Government review. 
 To the delight of biotechnology executives, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are enthusiastic about the technology. They consider it largely harmless and see huge economic potential. Some scientists, however, including a number here at Michigan State University, one of the nation's leading centers of agricultural research, dissent from that view.
Two Michigan State scientists have called aspects of the Government's work on regulating the crops of the 21st century scientifically inadequate. Dr. Gus A. de Zoeten, the chairman of the botany and plant pathology department, and Dr. Richard Allison, a plant virologist, say that a broad class of the gene-altered crops -- those engineered to resist viral diseases -- may be more risky than the Government believes and should not be exempted from Federal oversight, as the Clinton plan proposes.
 
Opinion Versus Science
 The Michigan State scientists also say that the Government has not supported enough research to assess the risks of genetically engineered plants, and that in the absence of clear scientific data Federal agencies are relying too heavily on the opinions of experts.
"Everybody has a stake in this area of plant research," said Dr. de Zoeten. "The companies have billions of dollars invested in new crop varieties. Scientists at the agricultural universities are working closely with these companies, and they have an interest in seeing that the technology is successful. My stake is to have scientists lead the way in doing the research on safety and not just to base their opinions on what they think will happen."
Many consumers, too, are uneasy about the new techniques. In February, a genetically engineered dairy hormone intended to increase milk production in cows went on sale to farmers, prompting protests in New York, Atlanta, Seattle and other cities about the safety of milk.
The significance of the protests was not lost on Calgene Inc., the biotechnology company that won the Food and Drug Administration's approval to sell a tomato engineered to stay on the vine longer for better taste. Calgene voluntarily sought Government review to quell public worries about the safety of the tomato and to smooth its path to the market this summer.
 
Following Established Policy
 The Clinton Administration's proposal for overseeing the new crops essentially follows the hands-off approach to plant biotechnology of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, but with two important differences. Since 1987, depending on the plants being tested, the Department of Agriculture has required companies either to submit applications for field trials involving genetically engineered crops or, more recently, to simply notify the Government. Roughly 2,000 field trials have been conducted without incident in 42 states and Puerto Rico on vegetables, fruits, and grains containing genes from species as diverse as chickens, fish, bacteria and viruses.
Where the Clinton plan differs is that after the field-testing stage, the Administration proposes to exempt most of the new crops from Federal oversight when they are sold to the public. Virtually the only altered crops the Administration wants to watch more closely are those containing bacterial genes that produce a natural defense against insects.
Under the plan, the marketing of such pesticidal plants will be regulated for the first time by the E.P.A. under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the nation's pesticide control law. The Administration is proposing safety tests for such plants, though precisely what sort of tests has not been decided.
The Administration proposal would take effect through the adoption of Federal regulations, requiring their being printed, giving the public time for comment, possibly being revised and then assuming the force of law.
Some scientists who support crop-engineering have criticized the proposed rules as unnecessary. They note that classical plant breeding, which produces the bounty that most Americans take for granted, never came under Government regulation. They argue that producing new crop varieties through genetic engineering is just as safe as classical breeding and that any regulation at all of plant genetic engineering could squelch innovation.
 
Overregulation Feared
 "Genetic engineering has provided agriculture with the most important set of tools for making plants resistant to diseases and insects ever discovered," said Dr. Susanne Huttner, a molecular neurobiologist and director of the University of California Systemwide Biotechnology Program. "If the E.P.A. had been around to regulate crop development 50 years ago, we would not have the remarkable variety and quality of fruits, vegetables and grain we enjoy today."
Dr. de Zoeten and Dr. Allison of Michigan State disagree with that view. They say the Administration's regulatory program is not strict enough, especially for the class of new plants engineered to resist viruses. Dr. Allison and a colleague, Ann E. Greene, drove the point home in March, when results of their research were published in the journal Science.
The idea of such alterations -- first performed in 1986 -- was to vaccinate plants by inserting into them pieces of genes from plant viruses. Most scientists considered this safe. They also believed it would enable farmers to reduce the use of pesticides to kill insects that carried the viruses.
Dr. Allison's research, which was jointly sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and the Monsanto Company, showed that the inserted genes can recombine with natural plant viruses and produce wholly new viruses at a rate higher than had been theorized by experts at the E.P.A. and the Department of Agriculture. The implication of the research, said Dr. Allison, was that engineering plants to be resistant to viruses might lead to entirely new types of viruses that could cause widespread damage to American crops.
 
Old Assumptions Questioned
 "Before this, everybody assumed there were no or very low risk factors with genetically engineered plants," said Dr. Robert G. Gast, a soil chemist and director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Michigan State. Dr. de Zoeten, he said, "has had concerns that this assumption was not necessarily true." Dr. Allison's work, he said, "showed specifically it wasn't true."
Dr. Allison's paper was disputed in the same issue of Science by a team of California researchers, who said he was overestimating the risks. Nevertheless, his conclusions caused a small commotion in the scientific community not only because of the thoroughness of the research but also because of where it occurred. Michigan State University has played a central role in developing the machines and farm chemicals that have driven modern agriculture for half a century; rarely has it been a center of criticism of farm technology or the Government.
Dr. Walter R. Fehr, a plant breeder and director of the Biotechnology Program at Iowa State University in Ames is one of a number of top scientists around the country who have expressed support for Michigan State's new spirit of criticism. "What Michigan State did was a piece of research which allowed them to ask a question that's legitimate," he said. "We are shirking our duty to the public if we do not examine those questions with the best science we have."
But west of here, in Kalamazoo, Mich., where the Asgrow Seed Company is engineering cucumbers, squash and melons to be viral-resistant, executives worry that the Michigan State paper will prompt the Government to reconsider its view and impose stricter controls on testing and marketing such crops.
"The important question always when you are talking about Government regulation is: What is the danger and what are the consequences of the event if something goes wrong?" said Dr. Hector D. Quemada, a molecular biologist and associate director of vegetable biotechnology at Asgrow, a subsidiary of the Upjohn Company.
In Washington, Terry L. Medley, an administrator at the Department of Agriculture, and one of the Administration's biotechnology policy leaders, said Dr. Quemada need not worry. Mr. Medley said that one-fifth of the field tests of genetically engineered crops have involved viral resistance, and that all occurred without any problem. "As far as we can tell, the Government is asking the correct questions to determine safety," Mr. Medley said.

HEADLINE: Panel Clears Fed Nominee

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee today approved President Clinton's nomination of Alan S. Blinder as Federal Reserve Board vice chairman by a vote of 15 to 0, with Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat, voting "present."
Mr. Blinder is expected to win confirmation by the full Senate with ease. He will join the Fed at a time when the central bank has been raising short-term interest rates to head off a possible increase in inflation. 
 A member of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Blinder will replace the former Fed vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., who departed for Wall Street in February.
The Senate committee will later consider Mr. Clinton's other nominee to a vacancy on the Fed board, Janet L. Yellen, an economist with the University of California at Berkeley.
She would replace Wayne D. Angell, who left the Fed on Feb. 10 to become an economist with Bear, Stearns & Company.

HEADLINE: Sar A. Levitan, 79, Economist And Social Policy Scholar, Dies

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Sar A. Levitan, an economist widely known for his analysis of social policy and influence on government programs as diverse as employment training and rural development, died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 79.
Friends said he had died of cancer. 
 Dr. Levitan came to the United States from Lithuania as a teen-ager. Garth Mangum, a longtime colleague, said, "He was expected to follow his father as the fifth-generation rabbi in his family." Instead, he attended the City College of New York, where he developed a fascination with public policy.
After a four-year stint in the Army in World War II, in which he rose to the rank of captain, he completed a doctorate in labor economics at Columbia University in 1949.
After teaching briefly at the Plattsburgh campus of the State University of New York, Dr. Levitan moved to Washington and was an aide on the Wage Stabilization Board during the Korean War. He then became a researcher for the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress.
 
Helping the Rural Poor
 Working with Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, a liberal Democrat who served in the Senate from 1949 to 1966, Dr. Levitan helped to formulate the Area Redevelopment Act, one of the Federal Government's initial efforts to break the cycle of poverty in rural communities.
The project inspired his first book, "Federal Aid to Depressed Areas" (1964), and began an association with the Ford Foundation that lasted until his death.
Dr. Levitan served on the faculty of George Washington University since 1967, directing what is now called the Center for Social Policy Studies. He wrote dozens of books, including "Big Brother's Indian Programs -- With Reservations" (1970) and "The Promise of Greatness" (1976), a call on liberals to keep the faith.
Dr. Levitan's influence extended far beyond what might be expected from a prolific researcher and skilled polemicist. John T. Dunlop, who was Secretary of Labor under President Gerald R. Ford, attributes Dr. Levitan's influence to "a rare combination of dedication to the truth and a passion to fit the facts to the new realities" of society and politics.
 
Link to the New Deal
 Gordon Berlin, a senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, called Dr. Levitan "one of the last New Deal liberals, with great faith in the capacities of individuals as well as government."
Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist, said Dr. Levitan had "an encyclopedia of knowledge on labor and education -- on what works and what doesn't."
His fingerprints can be found on a number of policy initiatives, including welfare reform and child care. And work that Dr. Levitan completed decades ago is still leaving marks.
Mr. Katz said suggestions made in the 1970's by the Levitan Commission on Employment and Unemployment Statistics were just now finding their way into the method the Government uses to track discouraged workers.
Dr. Levitan is survived by his wife of 47 years, Brita Ann Buchard, and, as Mr. Berlin put it, "a whole generation of social policy scholars."

HEADLINE: Ukrainian Accuses Yeltsin of Making Threats

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 24

 BODY:
As negotiations continued in Moscow and Kiev over Crimea and control of the formerly Soviet Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian President criticized President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today, accusing him of issuing threats to another sovereign state.
Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, is already under considerable political pressure at home with a presidential election scheduled for next month. He promised that Crimea would remain Ukrainian and that Kiev would not use force. 
 In Moscow, the acting Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yefim Zvyagilsky, took part in a second day of negotiations with the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, in an effort to resolve their dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, which is based in Crimea. There are disagreements over how to divide up the fleet, where it will be based and who will own the shore-based installations. Those talks will continue on Wednesday.
Crimea, which is 70 percent ethnic Russian, was handed over to Ukrainian administrative control by Khrushchev in 1954. Russian officials have acknowledged Ukrainian sovereignty over the peninsula, a position also repeated in recent days by the United States and British Governments.
Crimea already has a kind of federal status within Ukraine. But driven by the poor state of the Ukrainian economy, the Crimean Parliament and its new President, Yuri Meshkov, elected in January, have pushed for closer ties to Russia and last week voted to approve a new constitution for Crimea that verges on secession from Ukraine.
Ukraine gave the Crimeans 10 days to bring their new constitution in line with Ukrainian law, and negotiators from the two parliaments agreed today to set up a working group on the issue.
But the problems between Ukraine and Russia run deeper than Crimea. Eastern Ukraine is also dominated by ethnic Russians seeking closer economic and political ties to Moscow, leading to fears that newly sovereign and economically unreformed Ukraine may fall apart.
Speaking to a group of war veterans today, Mr. Kravchuk criticized the Russian leadership and accused the Russians of aggravating tensions between the two former neighboring Soviet republics.
"A president can only issue warnings to his own government bodies and ministers and not to the president of other countries," Mr. Kravchuk said, without referring to Mr. Yeltsin by name. "This is at variance with accepted norms and undemocratic."

HEADLINE: Hungary Schools Seeking Past Glory

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
When cigarette smoking among the students at a local high school spun out of control, in much the way it often does in the United States, the school administration called a referendum, inviting students and parents to vote.
Should 18-year-olds be allowed to smoke? Should those over 16 be allowed to smoke with parental consent? The vote was yes to the 18-year-olds and no to the younger students. Such a vote would not have been unusual in many American schools. But for Hungary, it was revolutionary. 
 In Eastern Europe for the past 40 years, education has meant authoritarian rule and confined curriculums intended to mold obedient citizens. In contrast, Hungary's Alternative High School for Economics is a trailblazer for the notion of liberal education. Here students sprawl on the carpeted halls during study periods, and the dress code allows ponytails -- for boys -- and T-shirts emblazoned with graffiti more suited to a rock club than a traditional classroom.
 
Fresh Start at New School
 Hungarian schools, renowned before World War II for the quality of their education, include among their graduates John von Neumann, the mathematician, and Edward Teller, the physicist. Now they are trying to recapture glory lost during the Communist era. The Budapest Evangelical Gymnasium, which produced Dr. von Neumann as well as George Lukacs, the Marxist theoretician, reopened five years ago as a high school after decades of academic decline.
About the same time the Gymnasium was reborn, a bearded young educator named George Horn came to believe that the public -- despairing over the lamentable state of education -- would welcome an experimental school. He had already tried to modernize the program at an existing school but realized that reform of the old was impossible, as with many things in Eastern Europe, and that only a fresh start would work.
After his lengthy negotiations with the fading Communist Government, the Alternative School opened its doors in 1990 in a handsome turn-of-the-century gabled brick building. Nearly 6,000 students applied for 80 places.
"At first this was the only school program that offered something different," said Mr. Horn, who is now the principal but who dresses in jeans and a work shirt and prefers a more egalitarian title, roughly translated as coordinator. "For example, students study what language they want for as long as they want. Ninety percent of the students will learn a language fluently, 90 percent will get a driver's license and I hope 75 percent will get into one of the universities."
 
Essentially a Private School
 The school has grown to 400 students. It offers a distinctive policy of self-discipline, and several other aspects make it novel.
While Mr. Horn does not like to call the school private, it essentially is. The Government contributes an annual subsidy but students must still pay an annual fee, the equivalent of $370, or a little more than the average Hungarian monthly salary.
To attract the best teachers and allow the school to pay them double the standard salary, Mr. Horn persuaded banks and insurance companies to contribute. Each entering class of 90 students includes 30 students whose fees are subsidized by these businesses.
But the most startling difference is in the classroom.
Take Orsolya Gosztony's advanced English. This is small class size to perfection: nine students. Her aim is to make her students talk. "I'll do anything to get them to open their mouths," said the exuberant 26-year-old teacher.
 
Hitchcock Movie and Scrabble
 She divided the students into small groups and assigned them roles -- one pair, for example, was to play an elderly father and his teen-age son.
Miss Gosztony tries other nonconventional methods, like a recent screening of Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca" on the classroom video. Or she sets up Scrabble.
"They realize they can't do anything without languages," said Miss Gosztony, whose English is almost flawless. "No one in the world speaks Hungarian except Hungarians and the students know it."
English is compulsory in the first year, with 10 hours of instruction a week. After that students can keep up the pace or reduce to five hours. A handful of business-oriented students are taking Russian voluntarily after years when it was compulsory and unpopular.
Since attending the school requires not only brains but some money, most of the students come from Budapest's affluent families. Many have traveled abroad and some drive to school in the second or third family car from homes in the Buda Hills.
But wealth aside, the interests of the students reflect changing Hungary. School has suddenly become more crucial in a competitive society that no longer guarantees a job.
Economics, the underlying theme of the school, has replaced engineering as the course most likely to insure a successful career.
Andras Danko, 18, said he planned to be a "businessman," a word used across Eastern Europe to convey a focus on making money. Asked what he meant, Mr. Danko replied, "I would like to work with an international company and then own my own company." To accomplish this, Mr. Danko is taking advanced English -- he is fluent -- five hours of economics a week and nine hours of mathematics.
 
Adjustment Problems
 Since most of the students are academically talented, what seems to impress them most is the atmosphere. "It's like university -- you come to class when you feel like it," said Andrew Bognan, 17.
In a society in transit from the conformist standards of the Communists to the more freewheeling style of the West, some of the students may find it hard to adjust after graduation. "The students are more open and independent than the average and at the same time they have less tolerance for the formal life outside the school," said Mr. Horn.
"So they may have more conflicts outside the school. But one thing is certain: they love to come here."

HEADLINE: California Schools Vying for New Students Under a State Plan for Open Enrollments

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The television ad for the high school promotes the computer labs, the caring teachers and the ethnic mix of students.
The school is not a private academy; it is Lincoln High School in downtown Los Angeles. And the advertisement is the most immediate response to California's new open-enrollment policy in its public schools. 
"The parents are out there shopping, and I didn't want to take any chances," said Lupe Lopez-Sonnie, the principal of Lincoln, which has lost about 400 students -- and $4,600 per pupil in state aid -- in the last few years. "I wanted to market our school as best as I could."
So the school produced a 30-second ad that appears on the district's public-access channel. It ends with the words on the screen, "Lincoln High is the place to be."
 
Voter Complaints
 At least 22 California schools have employed some form of advertising. In the San Fernando Valley, teachers at Grant High School in Van Nuys raised $400 to buy a newspaper ad to lure up to 300 new students to replace those whose families were driven out of the area by the recession or who had gone to private schools. The ad shows a Grant High cheerleader beside the message, "Why pay $12,000, when you can get the same, plus much more, for FREE?"
The Legislature passed the open-enrollment law last year in response to voter complaints about the declining state of public education and to the momentum, at the time, for a voucher system that would have given parents $2,600 per child to send their children to the school of their choice -- public or private. The referendum on vouchers was defeated in November, four months after the Legislature passed the open-enrollment law that will take effect this fall.
The law allows parents to send their children to any public school within their school district, space permitting. The new program, the most sweeping choice plan in the country, affecting 5.7 million children, is being watched by school districts nationwide as parents clamor for more control over where their children attend school, the operation of the schools and the quality of the education that their children receive.
In Long Beach, Maria Palma, a Nicaraguan immigrant who cleans houses for a living, said that she would now be able to send her son, Alex, to first grade at the school that her sister's children attend in another part of town. "It seems to do a better job than the school he is attending now, and for my part I think it is good that we as parents are given a choice," she said as she helped Alex with his kindergarten homework.
School officials say the policy will allow the best schools to toot their own horns and, they hope, prod mediocre or poor schools to improve.
"In the past, we have had a regular clientele, if you will," said Larry Higgins, principal of Canoga Park High School. "Now we have to get out in the forefront, let the public know what we can do."
In many California school districts, some form of open enrollment already exists -- often through magnet schools or busing for desegregation.
But because of the scale of this plan, which could affect every public-school student in the city, Los Angeles school officials say they do not know what to expect. "Some, all, a few or none of the students in our district will take advantage of this," said Dale Braun of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest district, after New York, with 640,000 students.
The district has been saddled with problems of overcrowding, violence and poor test scores that have led to battles over how best to improve student achievement.
Last week , the district began taking applications for the 22,000 open spaces in 366 of its 650 schools. If a school gets more applications than it has spaces after all neighborhood students are served, officials must hold a random drawing to determine which new applicants to admit. There are no academic criteria.
Some critics say open enrollment alone will do little to change the composition of schools -- let alone the quality of education -- especially since the law does not provide for transportation costs for students to attend a distant school.
"It may offer hope to some inner-city kid that he can go to school somewhere else to get a better education, but most people won't be able to afford to do that," said John Perez, a vice president of the United Teachers of Los Angeles. He predicted most people would continue sending their children to schools near home.
Proponents of choice have long theorized that competition for students -- and the fear of losing enrollment and money -- would force schools to improve. But as the enrollment period begins, some school officials say they feel little pressure to change.
 
Too Poor to Be Affected
 Alphonse Edwards, principal of 112th Street Elementary School in the Watts section of Los Angeles, said he had made little effort to let parents know that he has about 19 open seats. He said he thought his area was too poor to be affected by competition for students. This is more likely in richer areas, like parts of the San Fernando area northwest of downtown Los Angeles, where public schools are losing students to private schools.
"I doubt that this will help anyone but a small percentage of parents who can afford the transportation," Mr. Edwards said.
Open enrollment could also make a difference at schools in which enrollment has been eroded by a combination of factors, from natural disasters to the state's sluggish economy.
At Taft High School in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, enrollment is at 2,400, from a high of 3,000 a few years ago. The earthquake in January, which was centered nearby, drove out many families or made transportation difficult for students who were driving from far away under the district's transfer plan to relieve overcrowding. The school had already lost some students whose parents worked for the depressed aerospace industry and had to move.
The principal, Ron Berz, said word of mouth about the school's accomplishments, including its high test scores and two victories in the National Academic Decathalon, had attracted 200 applicants.
Mike Roos, a former state assemblyman and the leader of a reform movement for the Los Angeles schools called Learn, said the usefulness of open enrollment would not be seen for several years.
"The more that we get into the analysis of the movement of children within the district," he said, "the more we'll find out which schools are doing well and why, and which are doing poorly and need fundamental reorganization."
Open enrollment, he said, will do nothing absent other improvements. "If anyone believes all you have to do is institute choice and you've made great educational advancements," he said, "they're dead wrong."

HEADLINE: Rise in Key Futures Index Fuels Inflation Debate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
With the financial world attuned as perhaps never before to any sign of faster inflation, the commodity futures index popularly known as the C.R.B. suddenly took center stage this week by posting its biggest rise in nearly a year.
The index, formally known as the Knight-Ridder Commodity Research Bureau's Futures Price Index, follows 21 commodities, such as cocoa, orange juice, lumber and pork bellies, and is updated every 15 seconds on computer screens. 
 A surge on Monday, which lifted the index to its highest point since October 1990, spooked the securities markets, driving interest rates up and stock prices down.
 
Dominated by Grains
 But like the Dow Jones industrial average for stocks, the C.R.B., the most widely followed commodity index, is probably not the best gauge of overall price trends, at least not of the course of future inflation, according to market analysts.
"It's very much dominated by the grains," said Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "That makes it very misleading."
Agricultural items are highly dependent on the vagaries of weather, which means not only that they tend to be highly erratic, but that they are largely beyond the influence of the Federal Reserve and other policymakers.
Indeed, the gauge fell back today as soybeans and cocoa reversed direction.
Nor is Robert W. Hafer, the Chicago-based bureau's director of research, yet concerned about the recent behavior of the C.R.B., which he noted was up only about 3 percent so far this year and 20 percent above its lows of early 1993.
"We don't see any real bells or whistles going off here," Mr. Hafer said. In fact, he added, "It's still very possible the index is in a down trend, as it has been since 1980."
Yet while there is no reason to panic, many analysts said, the rise in the C.R.B. -- though not uncommon at a time of year when crops are just starting to take root -- should not be dismissed.
Mr. Hafer and others point not only to what they say is its solid history as a predictor of inflation but also to the fact that other commodity indexes are pointing generally in the same direction.
"We expect inflation to start going up late this year," said Anirvan Banerji, research economist at the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. He predicted that consumer prices would rise 3 to 4 percent in 1995; they have risen only 2.4 percent for the 12 months ending in April.
"It's the unanimity that is compelling," Mr. Banerji said, referring to the fact that the C.R.B. and other indexes are showing increases not only of significant magnitude but of duration and scope as well.
This includes the 18-item industrial price index compiled by The Journal of Commerce, which is also owned by Knight-Ridder. The calculations for this index are done by the Columbia center.
The Journal's index, which has no food components, has risen every month since December and reached a new high this week.
Many economists, in fact, favor this barometer for predicting inflation even though it measures spot prices, not the price of items for delivery in the future, as does the C.R.B.
The dominance of the C.R.B. owes much to the fact that since 1986 it has been the subject of a futures contract itself -- traded in New York -- and because it is available on computer screens throughout the financial community.
The Journal of Commerce index, by contrast, is calculated only once a day and is not available until the following morning's newspaper.
The two indexes typically move in tandem, their followers note, though the C.R.B. sounded what many regard as a false alarm last summer when its farm components were driven higher by flooding in the Midwest and drought in the Southeast.
"Both of them are reasonable indicators of inflation" trends, Mr. Banerji said. "The broad cyclical moves are similar."
But he and others contend that the Journal of Commerce index, though confined to spot conditions, is a superior predictor to the C.R.B. futures index since its prices, including those used in manufacturing and construction, are more likely to be passed along the production chain than are prices of, say, soybean meal or wheat. Indeed, wages and other costs of labor are far more important to the inflation rate than any commodity price, economists said.
 
'An Accurate Representation'
 There is also no reason to assume that people who trade futures have better information than those who trade spot commodities, analysts said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Hafer said, the C.R.B. has an impressive record.
"The index is an accurate representation of the overall price trend," he said, adding that a 10 percent rise, which is what has occurred since last summer, typically implies a one point advance in the Consumer Price Index about one year later.
Mr. Platt, however, has just concluded some research that he said casts doubt on any such link. He said he could find no relationship, when food and energy are excluded, between prices of raw materials and those charged by producers for finished goods, much less with retail prices.
"Wages are much more significant," he said.
For those who care to look for an alternative, the Columbia researchers have created their own predictive index of inflation, which includes the Journal of Commerce index as one of its seven elements. The others are import prices, debt, the employment-population ratio, the proportion of businesses expecting higher selling prices and what purchasing managers say about delivery times and prices.
Mr. Banerji said he expected inflation "to start going up late this year."
Mr. Hafer, whose index appears to be causing the most market distress, is perhaps as hopeful as any that the expected rise in inflation will not be serious.
"This still could be just another minor blip," he declared.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Widely as U.S. And Japan Agree to Talks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen and most other major currencies yesterday after the United States and Japan agreed to resume formal trade negotiations.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said negotiators would begin talks today under guidelines aimed at increasing Japanese imports of American products and services. The breakthrough came after four days of meetings in Washington. 
 With progress on trade, the Clinton Administration is considered less likely to call for a strong yen to curb Japan's trade surplus with the United States, a strategy, whether real or imagined, that has caused the dollar to fall sharply against the yen.
"There's less risk that the dollar will go lower" now that trade talks are under way, said Chris Widness, international economist at Chemical Bank. "We're very close to a bottom."
 
Market Assimilated News
 The dollar was quoted at 104.72 yen, up from 104.40 on Monday. It failed to rise further in part because press leaks Monday said negotiators would agree to restart talks, bracing traders for yesterday's announcement.
Gains in the stock and bond markets helped the dollar strengthen against the mark. It rose to 1.6552 marks from 1.6435.
Speculation that the White House would resume calls for a strong yen is one of many reasons traders cite for the dollar's 6.5 percent decline against the yen and 5 percent slump against the mark so far this year. A flight from American assets and concern about President Clinton's leadership also weighed on the American currency.
The dollar tumbled more than 5 percent against the yen on Feb. 14 alone after trade talks with Japan collapsed unexpectedly. The dollar has a far better chance to rebound now that talks are back on track, traders say.
"This is a good first step," said Peter Gloyne, manager of institutional foreign-exchange trading at First National Bank of Chicago. "They still have a lot of work to do."
Traders say the dollar will not make big gains against the yen until Japan shrinks its trade surplus with the United States.
Elsewhere, the British pound was last quoted at $1.5058, down from $1.5075 in New York on Monday. The dollar rose to 5.6630 French francs from 5.6245 francs. It rose to 1.4145 Swiss francs from 1.4045 francs. The dollar rose to 1,598 Italian lire from 1,589 lire. The Canadian dollar fell to 72.53 United States cents, from 72.69 cents on Monday.

Treasury Prices Rise, Ending a 2-Day Slide

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, ending a two-day skid, following the first decline in commodity prices in five days. A steady dollar also helped to support bonds as the United States and Japan agreed to resume trade talks.
The closely watched 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 8613/32 , for a yield of 7.39 percent, down from 7.43 percent on Monday. In today's trading, the bond recouped less than a quarter of its losses from the previous two days. 
 Peter Hirsch, managing director and head of the government trading desk for Salomon Brothers, said that soybean and grain prices fell as the Midwest received rain, with more rainfall predicted next week. Other commodity prices fell along with the grains, helping to push the Commodity Research Bureau index down 3.67, to 234.69. "As a result, buying interest in Treasuries picked up as investor fears of inflation were dampened," Mr. Hirsch said.
 
 
 
Highest Yield Since '91
 Traders were cautious ahead of yesterday's $17 billion Treasury auction of two-year notes, which produced a high yield of 5.94 percent -- the highest yield since October 1991, when it was 6.01 percent. Economists had expected the auction to produce good results because the Federal Reserve is not expected to increase short-term interest rates again soon after raising rates four times in four months. This stable environment makes the two-year note an attractive investment.
While the yield awarded was slightly higher than expected, some traders, like Peter Hirsch, said it was a good auction. Others would say only that it was not terrible. Mr. Hirsch said "some market expectations were incredibly unrealistic" as to where the two-year notes should trade.
In response to higher yields, noncompetitive bids, a gauge of small investors' interest, were quite strong. The $1.42 billion of these bids that were made yesterday eclipsed the $1.39 billion of the previous month's auction.
The Treasury will auction $11 billion of five-year notes today. In when-issued trading yesterday, the five-year maturity was being offered at a price to yield 6.75 percent, a slight improvement from the previous day.
With no important economic data released yesterday, bonds were susceptible to anything that might hint at inflation, with commodity prices and the dollar providing the direction.
The dollar ended slightly higher against the Japanese yen on news that the United States and Japan would resume trade talks, helping to keep bond prices on the positive side. Bond traders fear a weak dollar because it causes import prices to rise, possibly spurring inflation. The dollar also moved up a bit against the German mark.
 
 
 
Chicago Skyway Bonds

 
 Among the new municipal paper issued yesterday, the City of Chicago sold $102.4 million of Skyway toll bridge refunding revenue bonds through underwriters led by Paine Webber Inc.
The issue was initially priced to yield a maximum 7.15 percent for a bond due in 2017. The city is also offering a yield of 7 percent for a bond due in 2010 and 7.05 percent for a bond due in 2014. The bonds are rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service, BBB- by Standard & Poor's and BBB by Fitch.
Among corporate issuers, Money Store Inc., a consumer and commercial loan company, priced $350 million of triple-A-rated certificates backed by home equity loans through a group of underwriters led by Prudential Securities.
The sale included $96.1 million of certificates with an average life of one year, which were priced to yield 6.06 percent. Another $88.9 million of certificates with a two-year average were priced to yield 6.67 percent. For $70 million of certificates with a three-year average life, the yield is 7.035 percent, and for $50.3 million with an average life of 5.9 years it is 7.637 percent. Finally, $44.3 million of certificates with a 10-year avergae life were priced to yield 8.025 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's two-year Treasury note auction:

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Industry Is Learning to Love Agility

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LANSDALE, Pa.

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's electronic components plant here is a complicated place, producing 124,000 engine controllers, anti-lock brake sensors and speed-control units a day. Since each product has 400 to 500 parts, managers have to keep track of more than five million individual pieces daily.
Nevertheless, Dudley C. Wass, the plant's manager, says that when an order to change a product is received, the altered units usually can be shipped within 24 hours. 
 The reason is that the two-year-old plant has been designed with a high level of flexible automation, extensive computer controls and lean inventories in an effort to emphasize fast response time.
"We are more of a software business than hardware," Richard A. Chow-Wah, an engineer at the plant, said. "When we get changes, the software allows us to accommodate it."
Mr. Wass and his associates say they are trying to become "agile" manufacturers -- able to switch quickly and economically from one product to another with very little disruption. They are also working to establish closer relationships with suppliers and customers in an effort to react more quickly to shifts in markets.
It is a philosophy that is being acted upon throughout Ford, which intends to rely heavily on its international computer networks to combine its North American and European automotive operations into a single organization by the end of this year.
Such an approach, being adopted by a growing number of corporations, is a change from the old mass production model that sought to reduce costs by carefully tuning a process and then churning out products in large numbers. That time-honored technique -- elevated to an industrial art form by Ford Motor's founder, Henry Ford -- reduced the amount of fixed cost in each copy of the product. But it also tied up a lot of resources in inventory and partly finished products and made it less likely that defects would be found before a large volume of production was affected.
Making extensive use of bar-code technology to label and track virtually every circuit board, and relying heavily on computerized equipment that can be reprogrammed on the fly, factory managers like Mr. Wass are able to pare inventories, reduce turnaround times and respond more quickly to customer demands.
"Our model is the cheetah," Mr. Wass said. "We want to be able to stop on a dime, direct all our energy toward a goal, turn quickly and accelerate rapidly."
The approach is meeting with favor in the higher ranks at Ford. "The plant is on the leading edge; it's one of our best," said Charles W. Szuluk, the company's vice president for process leadership. He said the Lansdale plant's ability to respond quickly to customers allowed it to bid for added business and its ability to manufacture different products on the same assembly line reduced investment requirements.
The concept of agile manufacturing has been taking shape in industrial America as companies struggle to compete with foreign producers, particularly in areas like electronics. Although there are no statistics on how many companies are adopting agile ways, the approach has the enthusiastic backing of the Government. The Defense Department recently sought bids for $30 million in projects incorporating agile manufacturing.
Unlike traditional manufacturers, with their hierarchical management and emphasis on sheer output, agile companies stress sharing of information and power across the organization, alliances with suppliers and customers, and fast responses to changing market conditions. Engineers at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., can put design changes into a computer system, then send the information electronically to production plants like the one here in Lansdale.
Some researchers of industrial organizations say that this new agility may lead to "virtual" enterprises, in which several companies come together to make a specific product for a certain length of time, and then dissolve as the participants go on to other projects. The central concept is that each organization would do what it does best, with one company designing the product, another manufacturing it and others handling marketing and sales.
An early version of this approach, researchers say, is the new Boeing airliner, the 777. Boeing designs, assembles and markets the aircraft, but for the most part does not manufacture it. Instead, an international network of suppliers actually makes most of the components, including some of the plane's basic structure.
Although the Boeing confederation is intended to be a temporary alliance, it will probably last longer than many formal mergers since the airplane is likely to remain in production for 30 years.
The key to agility, researchers say, is the ability to quickly respond to changing customer tastes, without regard to the number of products to be made. "We are going from the era of mass production to the era of mass customization," said Roger N. Nagel, operations director of the Iacocca Institute, a research center at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa.
The institute, named after Lee A. Iacocca, the former chairman of the Chrysler Corporation who helped raise the money to establish it, is also home of the Agile Manufacturing Enterprise Forum. The forum, which seeks to spread information about agile techniques, was organized with the support of the Defense Department, which was concerned that a deterioration of the domestic manufacturing base would leave the nation incapable of meeting military needs.
Indeed, with the cold war over, many of the institutions that helped fight it are turning their attention to competitiveness in manufacturing.
"The fact is that a real war, a global economic war, continues, and our national security is still at risk," said Albert Narath, the president of the federally financed Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M. With demand for its principal product -- nuclear bombs -- waning, leaders at Sandia and at other Government laboratories are trying to redefine their mission as helping American manufacturers become more agile and competitive.
Just about everyone connected with agility says that information -- especially the rapid collection, processing and transfer of it -- is central to the concept. Mr. Nagel observed that supermarket scanners were developed to speed up the checkout line. But the real value, he said, has been the ability of supermarket managers to monitor sales patterns and automate the reordering of products as they are sold.
 
A Different Application
 At the Ford factory in Lansdale, such technology enables Mr. Wass and his colleagues to apply supermarket efficiencies to the making of electronic car parts. Each circuit board in the plant is given its own serial number on a bar-code label. Since the boards are the heart of the engine controllers and other control devices, the data from the labels give managers information on each product as it moves through the plant.
If a product defect is discovered in the field, there is an electronic audit trail to help trace the flaw back to the precise spot in the production process where the error exists.
Computer screens are plentiful on the floor of the sprawling one-story Lansdale plant so that the 2,300 workers can keep track of product changes and production problems. "Too often, information is aimed solely at managers," Mr. Wass said. "Now, we're aiming it at operators so they will have it at their fingertips."
This approach to information also helps close the communications gaps that can develop in a plant with round-the-clock shifts. "If an operator solves a problem and enters the information, then the next shift knows what was done," Mr. Wass said.
In contrast to the hierarchical approach of mass production, the workers here are put in teams of 8 to 10 people, each responsible for an area of the plant. In one area, the amount of partly completed product was reduced 73 percent and scrap was cut 90 percent within three months, Mr. Chow-Wah said.
 
Working With Suppliers
 Lean inventories and quick changeovers require dependable supplies. Once again, information is being used as a tool to manage relationships with the plant's suppliers. "We issue a monthly report card to suppliers listing quality rejects, conformance with schedule and overshipments," Mr. Wass said. "It puts our relationship with them on an objective basis."
Mr. Wass said the plant's various agility techniques had wrought measurable improvements. In January 1991 an average of 7.8 days elapsed between receipt of an order and the shipment of the finished product. By last December that average had been cut to 1.2 days.
This year's goal, Mr. Wass said, is to cut that response time to a single day. Each improvement, he said, translates into much smaller inventories and much more responsiveness to customers. "If you have eight days of stuff," Mr. Wass said, "that means it is going to take eight days to make a change."

HEADLINE: Stocks Post Slight Gains; Dow Up 2.76

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders, taking their cue from a brighter bond market and a better outlook for commodities prices, bid stock prices upward yesterday in below-normal trading.
But the rise in the stock market was anemic, a fact that could be traced to the fluky performance recently of an index that tracks commodities prices and is looked to as an indicator of inflation. 
 The index, known as the Commodities Research Bureau futures price index, shot up Monday and the Dow Jones industrial average and other stock indexes fell. But yesterday the index broke its five-day climb to a three-and-a-half-year high, declining 3.67 points, to 234.69.
"You see, nothing fundamental has changed in the value of commodities," said David D. Holt, vice president-research and strategy of Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. The bureau index, he said, is rising and falling because of short-term strategies by commodities traders, not because it is signaling higher inflation.
Blue chips like Merck and I.B.M., conglomerates like General Electric and banks like Norwest, as well as technology stocks like Microsoft and Intel all contributed to the market rise
Moreover, at a cable-television industry convention, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Reed E. Hundt, seemed to indicate that the agency would consider softening Government cutbacks in cable rates that the industry has blamed for hurting profits and slowing growth.
 
Cable Rate-Cut Hopes
 Even a hint of a softened cable rate cut lifted the prices of cable operators. Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, rose 1 1/2, to 20 1/2, and was the second-most-active stock yesterday at 6.8 million shares. Time Warner, the No.2 cable company, rose 1 3/8, to 39 1/4.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.76 points, to 3,745.17, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.61 points, to 454.81. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 6.52 points, to 731.47.
One reason behind yesterday's fall in the Commodity Research Bureau index may be as random as the weather. Futures prices for soybeans and soybean oil, major components in the recent bureau rise, declined as rain began to fall in the Midwest and more rain was forecast for next week, possibly indicating a plentiful crop. The bureau index had largely risen because of the prospect of scarce soybeans and other agricultural commodities, like coffee and cocoa.
Another reason may be commodities traders' intense speculation in the movement of the 21 commodities of the index, especially soybeans. If commodities prices rise, then traders who had bet on prices falling by selling short are forced to buy shares to repay loans, prompting artificial spikes in price. That is probably what has happened recently to contribute to the jump in the index, said Mr. Holt of Wedbush Morgan.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 280.2 million shares changing hands, about 7 percent below this year's average of 301 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.62 point, to 251.40, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,243 to 908. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.54 points, to 439.18.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 18 rose, led by I.B.M., which rose 1 3/8, to 63 1/8, following traders' expectations of more I.B.M. personal-computer sales.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 256 rose, led by General Electric, which rose 1/2, to 47 1/2, on no discernible news. (Stock prices sometimes move for reasons related to individual portfolio managers' priorities rather than external news events.)
The most active stock, at 7.8 million shares, was Merck , which rose 5/8, to 30 7/8. The rise followed news that Martin Wygod, who merged his Medco Containment Services into Merck in a huge merger earlier this year, was leaving the company. Analysts said his resignation might simplify choosing a successor to Roy Vagelos, chairman, this week.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
New Enzyme By Genzyme Is Approved

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Genzyme Corporation said yesterday that it had won Food and Drug Administration approval to start marketing a genetically engineered enzyme to treat Gaucher's disease, a debilitating and sometimes fatal genetic disorder that afflicts about 5,000 people in the world at any given time.
To be sold under the trade name Cerezyme, the drug was developed to overcome supply constraints of Genzyme's Ceredase, a natural form of the enzyme extracted from human placentas, which had been the only effective treatment for Gaucher's disease. Genzyme has found that at current dosages, it can make only enough Ceredase to supply about 1,200 patients. 
 People with Gaucher's disease lack an enzyme that removes certain fatty substances from the body. Symptoms include easy bleeding and bruising, spleen and liver enlargement and deterioration of bones, leading to frequent fractures. If the disease is detected early enough, treatment with Ceredase or Cerezyme appears to eliminate the symptoms, with no significant side effects.
Genzyme, which derives nearly all its earnings from Ceredase, received the approval after the market closed. Its shares rose 50 cents, to $29.50, in Nasdaq trading. Analysts said that the approval had been anticipated and that Genzyme's stock would probably rise today.
"The company has been giving us guidance of earnings in the $1.45-to-$1.50 range for this year, and they needed this approval to make those numbers," said Carol Werther, an analyst with Cowen & Company.
 
Limited Production at First
 Although production will at first be limited to a small pilot plant, Cerezyme could ultimately have worldwide sales of $300 million, analysts said.
"It's not going to have a huge effect immediately because the commercial plant is not on line yet and won't be until mid-1995," said Edmund Debler, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly. "But they probably will be able to manufacture a decent amount in the pilot plant, which could add $15 million to $20 million to 1994 sales" in addition to the $130 million in Ceredase sales.
At an average cost of $150,000 for a year's supply, Ceredase is the most expensive drug sold in the United States; the price reflects the complex process needed to extract the enzyme from human placentas. About 96 percent of Gaucher's patients are covered by insurance, which pays for the drug; Genzyme supplies Ceredase free for the remaining 4 percent. Initially, the cost of Cerezyme will be the same, because the manufacturing cost at the pilot plant remains high.
"Once we have the new plant running and approved, we will start to see some economies of scale," the chairman, president and chief executive of Genzyme, Henri Termeer, said in a telephone interview. Then, he said, "we can start to pass on some of these economies to the marketplace while at the same time improving the financial results of the company."
Dr. Termeer said that he expected Cerezyme to replace Ceredase in the market but that the transition would not be immediate. The company needs approvals to market Cerezyme in Europe and Japan, where it now sells Ceredase.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Dell Computer's Earnings Climb Strongly in Quarter

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation reported quarterly earnings yesterday that were surprisingly strong, nearly doubling despite a $26.3 million charge for losses on bad financial investments.
Investors focused on the improvement in operating profits, which were well above analysts' estimates, and were relieved that its losses on financial derivatives and other investments were not higher. Last month, Dell said that it would lose money on its investments, but did not estimate how much the loss might be. 
 The Austin, Tex., personal computer company's stock price rose $3 yesterday to close at $29 a share.
Dell's sales for its first fiscal quarter, ended May 1, increased 14 percent, to $766.6 million, from the earlier quarter. Its operating income -- before taxes, interest and the special charges -- jumped to $60 million, from $14.1 million the year before.
The company's net income, because of the charges, rose much less, to $19 million, or 42 cents a share. In the quarter a year earlier, the company reported net profits of $10.2 million, or 25 cents a share.
Analysts closely watch small movements in the gross profit margins for companies in the personal computer industry, which can be particularly significant in this high-volume, low-margin business. In its first quarter, Dell's gross profit margins as a percentage of sales rose to 22.2 percent, up 3.6 percent from the fourth quarter.
"That is substantially higher than we expected," Thomas Meredith, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview.
Mr. Meredith attributed the better-than-expected profit margins to three factors: higher sales of powerful new machines that use the Intel Corporation's Pentium microchip, a more tailored marketing program, and a more efficient system of buying components from suppliers.
For example, as part of a cost-cutting effort, Dell has trimmed its list of component suppliers from 130 to 80. As a result, Mr. Meredith explained, the company tends to buy more from each supplier, giving it more clout to bargain for better prices.
Like several other companies, Dell placed bets in the financial markets earlier this year that interest rates would hold steady or decline. And Dell, like others, guessed wrong, losing substantially when interest rates rose.
Dell reported that it took a $15.6 million charge in the quarter on its interest-rate derivative instruments. Derivatives are investments whose value is derived from an underlying security such as stocks, bonds or currency. The company also took a $10.7 million charge for losses on other investments .
"In retrospect, we made a mistake," Mr. Meredith said. As a matter of policy, he added that Dell would no longer invest in derivatives, except to hedge interest-rate risk on its own debt.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 24

 BODY:
The European Union's annualized inflation rate was 3.2 percent in April, unchanged from March and down slightly from 3.4 percent a year earlier, the statistical office Eurostat said today. Figures showed that inflation last month was lower than in April 1993 in all countries except Denmark, Britain, the Netherlands and Spain. The European rate compares with 2.4 percent in the United States and with seven-tenths of 1 percent in Japan.

HEADLINE: Rome Has a Show Of Stolen Artworks To Highlight a Fight

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
High up in the dank interior of Castel Sant'Angelo, just below the parapet from which Tosca leaped to her death, a curiously eclectic art exhibition is on view until June 15. Called "Treasures From the Darkness," it consists of stolen artworks that were recovered by the Italian police.
No certified masterpieces are on display. About the closest the exhibition comes to a well-known artist's name is an 18th-century scene of the Piazza San Marco in Venice "attributed to the school of Canaletto." 
 But that doesn't mean what's on view is negligible. There is Classical statuary, pottery and coins; religious sculptures in wood, bronze and marble, and paintings from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. Each work comes with an attribution and helpful information on when and where it was stolen and on its recovery.
This exhibition and others like it, such as one presented recently at the Ministry of Culture in Paris, call attention to the problem of art theft worldwide and especially in Italy, which is so rich in its archeological and artistic patrimony. They also call attention to the increasingly refined technologies used by Interpol and specialized art-recovery police divisions in some countries.
The Rome exhibition calls particular attention to the carabinieri division for the recovery of stolen art, which helped organize it and which early in May held a two-day conference of officials from 16 countries to discuss progress in the continuing battle.
 
Mafia Enters the Market
 The conference was in the stately halls of the Carabinieri Officers' School here, full of earnest cadets and officers dressed in their ornately festooned black uniforms. If the uniforms looked to non-Italian eyes like costumes for a comic operetta, the agenda was deadly serious.
Italian police experts discussed the gravity of the art-theft situation, especially in Italy. One, Giuseppe Amato, suggested that the Mafia had become involved in the traffic, using stolen art as a safe investment, as payment for drugs or to launder money. Mr. Amato said the Mafia could either buy stolen art or organize the thefts itself.
Mark Fionda, who is in the United States Customs fraud division in Manhattan, and other foreign representatives reported on their art-recovery operations. In Eastern Europe, where an anarchic economy has made art theft particularly virulent, the police are especially hampered by legal and bureaucratic muddles. Alberto Soldani from Poland said that his unit was frustrated by the refusal of regional officials to cede authority in such cases to his national agency in Warsaw.
Col. Roberto Conforti, who has headed the Italian art-recovery division for three years, initially organized the conference to discuss problems posed by the opening of the European Community's internal borders last year. "We must counteract this problem with higher technical responses," he said in an interview. He added that he hoped the conference would be held annually.
 
The New Approaches
 His main plea was for more cooperation between national police agencies both in the European Community and outside it. He said this could come in part from increased compliance with European Community laws and Unesco conventions on stemming the flow of stolen art. But it could also involve increased use of computer technology.
Already his Italian division has a growing data bank of descriptions and photographs of stolen artworks. Other countries are following suit, and the eventual goal is to create a Europe-wide or even fully international data bank beyond those already maintained by Interpol and such private agencies as the Art Loss Register in London.
One new device, flashily presented at the conference with diagrams and films by Bull, a computer company, is a hand-held camera that can photograph a suspect artwork (on sale in a gallery, for instance) and transmit the image by cellular telephone to a data bank for nearly instant identification. Colonel Conforti said Italian law permitted the immediate seizure of any stolen artwork so identified.
To combat such technologies, thieves have grown increasingly aggressive in altering stolen art. Their painted overlays can often be removed, Colonel Conforti said. "The worst is when they cut things up to make more items to sell," he added.
 
The Size of the Problem
 Given the loopholes in the laws, the porousness of borders and the incentives to steal, fighting this kind of crime might seem nearly impossible. The conference was told that 29,000 artworks were stolen in Italy in 1993 and only 5,500 were found. Famous pictures are still stolen from leading museums, as witness the February theft of "The Scream," by Edvard Munch, from the National Art Museum in Oslo and its recovery on May 7. Annually, some $10 billion worth of fine art is stolen worldwide, not including looted archeological sites. Only 10 to 15 percent is recovered.
The situation in Italy is unsettled at the moment. Alberto Ronchey, who has been widely credited with the increased effectiveness of Italian measures against art theft while he was the Minister of Cultural Artifacts and the Environment, has been replaced by Domenico Fisichella, a member of the neo-Fascist National Alliance. Indeed, Mr. Ronchey's closing address at the carabinieri conference, in which he warned of the need to enlist "the big markets to the north" in the fight against international art smuggling, was one of his final official acts.
Colonel Conforti said after the conference that the recession had a mixed impact on art theft in Italy. The rise in unemployment encouraged such relatively petty theft as the stripping of provincial churches. But the collapse of the big-time art market, which he gloomily called "just temporary," may have led to a decline in highly visible thefts from major museums.
To the extent that there has been such a decline, however, Colonel Conforti was unwilling to credit mere economic factors.
"Better security and police work have affected this kind of theft as well," he said proudly.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
DEERE & CO. (DE,N)

 BODY:
Shares of Deere & Company jumped by $2 in early trading yesterday after it reported earnings for its second quarter ending April 30 that were well above Wall Street's projections. The stock then slumped to end the day down $2.375, to $71.625, as investors worried about the company's cautious projections for growth.
Deere's reported earnings of $2.20 a share were substantially above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $1.95, and the company projected that worldwide production in 1994 would exceed last year's level by 16 percent -- up from the 13 percent it had previously announced. But Deere, a farm, lawn and garden and construction equipment maker based in Moline, Ill., also noted that production during the second half of this year would be down 3 percent from the first half because of normal vacations and the introduction of a new tractor line. 
 In a conference call with analysts, Deere suggested that margins and sales might not grow as fast in 1995 as some had projected. With investors already worried that rising interest rates could hurt cyclical companies like Deere, the warnings were enough to cause several analysts to adjust their projections down and initiate a selloff.

HEADLINE: Commissioner Under Fire Over Job Cuts

 BODY:
In a contentious budget hearing at City Hall, Marva L. Hammons, the commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, was berated by City Council members yesterday for being unable to specify what effects the city's proposed budget cuts would have on social services.
Under the plans of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Ms. Hammons's department will lose 4,305 of its 23,343 workers. Although administration officials have pledged that the cuts would not affect caseworkers, they have not said specifically which jobs would be eliminated. 
 And yesterday, two weeks after Mr. Giuliani released his budget, Ms. Hammons was unable to delineate the positions the agency was prepared to lose.
"This is what you're supposed to know," said Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the council's committee on general welfare, who was cheered by agency employees in the chamber's gallery.
Ms. Hammons insisted that while the personnel cuts might have a short-term impact on the $7 billion agency's ability to deliver services, streamlining the bureaucracy that includes public assistance, foster care, child development and home care would eventually allow the agency to be more economically efficient and more responsive to clients.
But Mr. DiBrienza insisted that loading extra work onto the shoulders of fewer workers "flies in the face of any sense of understanding."
"You're going to end up doing less with less," he said.

HEADLINE: Trade, the Real Engine of Democracy

BYLINE: By Bill Bradley; Bill Bradley, a Democrat, is senior Senator from New Jersey.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The mandatory linkage between trade privileges and human rights is obsolete. President Clinton and Congress need to replace this cold war relic with a new approach that broadly engages China on human rights while promoting our strategic and economic interests.
U.S.-China relations are shackled by the linkage, which embodies two aspects of old-think that should join the era that spawned them on the dust heap of history. 
 First, the yearly "most favored nation" requirement -- for waivers from high U.S. tariffs on imports from Communist countries -- dates from the bygone era of U.S.-Soviet competition. Under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, China may retain lower tariffs only if the President certifies that such benefits facilitate emigration. (China's current trade benefits expire July 3 unless Mr. Clinton announces by June 3 that he intends to extend them.)
Second, the new conditions for an extension that Mr. Clinton set last year -- such as adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and protection of Tibet's cultural heritage -- originated in Congressional opposition to George Bush's precipitous re-engagement with Beijing after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. These and the other demands are legitimate, but they can't be achieved by the linkage policy.
Even partial revocation of trade benefits, which the Administration is said to be considering, would not work. For example, targeting goods produced by military-owned factories would invite retaliation against our exports and antagonize a key actor in China's succession struggle without advancing human rights.
Our task is to foster the emergence of a responsible, outward-looking China as a force for stability in Asia. We cannot do so if we hold the U.S.-China relationship hostage to an annual "most favored nation" review.
America's interests require a multifaceted engagement with China. With its nuclear arsenal, growing military strength, unresolved border issues and permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, China must be reckoned with. America's strategic agenda in Asia (such as controlling North Korean nuclear proliferation) requires cooperation with China.
With a large economy that is growing by more than 10 percent a year, China is an engine for global growth. Our exports to China rose more than 18 percent last year and have tripled in the last decade. America companies have committed billions of dollars in investment.
Obviously, we have a strong interest in improving the lives of China's 1.2 billion people. Today's linkage between trade benefits and human rights is simply too narrow to do the job. To be truly effective, our human rights policy must go hand in hand with the forces of economic growth that are remaking China: information, investment and goods, which are flowing in and out of China in an unprecedented volume.
Beijing's centralized control over the provinces has loosened. The rigor of law is slowly replacing the whim of the Communist Party in many economic sectors. Individuals now have personal freedom that, while inadequate, is unparalleled in modern Chinese history.
The first element of an effective human rights policy lies in further increasing China's exposure to the outside world. Beijing has agreed to discuss the jamming of our radio broadcasts; we must use those discussions to insist upon meaningful expansion of unjammed Voice of America and Radio Free Asia programs. We should also increase the number of educational and cultural exchanges that expose young Chinese to our multi-ethnic democracy.
The second element is an expansion of trade, which is is the motive for China's opening outward. I support China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which will be the successor of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Membership would require adherence to legal standards. For example, Beijing would have to accept dispute-resolution procedures and disclose rules governing state enterprises.
Growth alone will not democratize China. But it does create a fluid political and social environment and the emergence of a class of prosperous Chinese -- all of which fuel democratization and improved human rights practices. Evidence from South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere shows that prosperity breaks down old controls and generates demands for improved political and social conditions.
A third feature of a beneficial human rights policy is genuine dialogue on human rights. All too often, the U.S.-China "dialogue" consists of American officials' presenting their Chinese counterparts with a list of demands. China responds that Western human rights standards are not applicable in Asia. The result: an empty exchange of monologues.
The alternative is a genuine exchange of views. While we will not agree that human rights are relative, we can listen to the Chinese with the aim of finding common ground on which to build. For example, helping the Government strengthen the rule of law will advance human rights by reducing arbitrary interference with people's lives, while also improving Beijing's ability to govern a vast and diverse country.
Fourth, as we wait for Mao Zedong's Long March generation to leave the scene, we must continue our efforts to protect individual dissidents by raising their cases at every opportunity. Once we are talking effectively with the Chinese, appeals on behalf of such dissidents will have a greater impact.
There are many ways to institutionalize this dialogue -- for example, by creating a binational human rights commission or exchanging parliamentary delegations to investigate human rights practices, as China now does with Australia. (Yes, the Chinese would be free to come to the U.S. for this purpose.) Once the Chinese stop viewing human rights as a weapon deployed against them, they will be willing to have a systematic dialogue.
 Fifth, China's craving for international legitimacy gives us additional leverage. We must make it clear thatso long as China does not uphold basic human rights standards, we will continue to work to deny China such symbols of legitimacy as playing host to the Olympics and international meetings.
Sixth, we must ask business to help by supporting voluntary ethical investor principles as part of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum investment code. I have in mind adherence to such principles as safe working conditions and a prohibition against the export of goods produced by forced labor.
To revoke or place conditions on China's trade status would be a historic blunder. Unlike 1949, when America could ignore Red China, in the Asia of 1994 we would isolate ourselves from the world's most dynamic region. The cold war is over. Let us delink most-favored-nation status from human rights and begin to realize the full potential of the U.S.-China relationship.

HEADLINE: Must Phone Rates Block Information Highway?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Twist, Consumer Group and F.C.C. Back Cable TV" (Business Day, May 12) reports that cable television companies argue that "phone companies are trying to finance their ventures at the expense of ordinary phone customers, who may end up with higher bills and services they may not want." This argument constitutes a serious challenge to those of us calling for a long-range goal of expanded universal service. 
 Cable companies and others would have us believe that the Administration's interim goal for the information highway -- advanced telecommunication services to public institutions such as schools, clinics and libraries -- is sufficient, while for the home this same goal would be utopian. What this argument ignores:
* Until citizens are aware of the potential of the new technology to improve their daily lives, they will assume that these technologies are only useful for someone else.
* People are already paying more than we acknowledge. Many critics use today's telephone rates only as the basis for affordability. However, the new technologies will replace the television and videocassette recorder, as well as the telephone. They may even substitute for the radio, newspapers or magazines, providing services very different from anything we can now imagine.
Therefore, the real basis of comparison should not be just a household's telephone bill but its entire information budget -- nearly $80 for many, including low-income families.
Ironically, those most unaware of the potential benefits are often those who stand to gain most from their widespead introduction. As to their not needing these services, ask the rural diabetic whose life was saved by a doctor 60 miles away through telemedicine, or ask the young woman from West Virginia who was accepted to a college based on classes she took by television from a teacher more than 200 miles away.
The information highway derives much of its value from ubiquity. Connecting everyone enriches all our lives. We should not allow concern for keeping telephone service rates low to deflect us from the important goal of insuring that all Americans have access to a new form of universal service -- one that provides benefits to individuals and to society that will be much greater than the costs.
We must adopt a goal that insures every citizen the benefits of the information highway, including two-way video communication to the home. Otherwise, we will condemn our country to a double standard: those who have full access to the economic and social life of the nation, and those who can only have access when public facilities are open. Can we bear this cost?

HEADLINE: CLINTON REJECTS PENALIZING CHINA

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to extend China's trade privileges even though the country has not made as much progress on human rights as the United States had hoped for, senior Administration officials said today.
They said Mr. Clinton, who will announce the decision as early as Thursday, will not impose sweeping tariffs on goods made by China's military. Such a move had been recommended by a number of influential Democratic lawmakers. 
 Rather, Mr. Clinton will either extend the trade benefits with no strings attached or impose only minimal, largely symbolic duties, perhaps on such items as Chinese-made weapons and ammunition, they said.
Mr. Clinton told aides today that he had not made a final decision about whether to impose any penalties on China, the largest emerging market in the world. He was said to be debating in his own mind whether it is wiser to make a clean break with the strategy that rewards China's progress on human rights with the same low tariffs on Chinese exports that most other countries enjoy.
Given Mr. Clinton's tendency for last-minute hesitation, aides said there was a possibility that the announcement could be delayed. Under his 1993 executive order that links human rights and trade benefits, he could wait until June 3 to announce his decision.
There is no joy at the White House about the impending announcement. Officials know that commentators and human-rights organizations are poised to point out the yawning gap between Mr. Clinton's campaign language on China, in which he excoriated the Bush Administration for "coddling" dictators in Beijing, and his decision to abandon his own strategy to push China to do more.
Last year, when Mr. Clinton announced his executive order, it was widely praised by lawmakers, China experts and even human-rights advocates as a brilliant compromise that acknowledged the concerns of Congress on human rights but deferred any punishment of China for a year.
 
Shift in Congress
 But the mood of Congress has shifted dramatically in favor of "delinking" human rights and low tariffs, and the substance of Mr. Clinton's emerging policy now seems very close to that of the Bush Administration: a determination that human-rights concerns should not be the arbiter of United States-China relations and a recognition that the United States has much broader security interests with China.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has made that point in a series of meetings with Mr. Clinton this week, including private conversations on Tuesday and today.
Mr. Clinton is also poised to announce a series of steps that he now believes would provide better tools for influencing China on human-rights issues.
To that end, he is expected to announce the creation of an advisory committee that will try to find ways to improve China's human rights record, senior officials said. The committee will be composed of Administration officials, business and labor leaders and human rights advocates.
The Administration abandoned the idea of creating a joint human rights commission with the Chinese Government. During the Bush Administration, the Chinese flatly rejected a similar proposal, and senior Administration experts on China and on human rights were concerned that China would either reject the idea again or agree to a commission and then simply refuse to cooperate.
Mr. Clinton framed the basis for his decision after a meeting at the White House on Monday, in which Mr. Christopher stated that China had met the two mandatory conditions for renewing its "most favored nation" status. Those are cooperation on ending the export of prison-made goods to the United States and allowing close family members of certain dissidents to leave the country.
At a meeting of Mr. Clinton's senior national security and economic advisers on Tuesday, Mr. Christopher suggested that there might be some symbolic punishment of China, senior Administration officials said. He listed two options: placing high tariffs on weapons and ammunition exported to the United States or on some of the goods that could clearly be defined as military-made.
Senior Administration officials have told diplomats and lawmakers that Mr. Christopher will in effect tailor his recommendation on a course of action to Mr. Clinton's wishes, and that "there will be no daylight" between the recommendation and Mr. Clinton's final decision.
The Administration rejected the imposition of high tariffs on all goods made by the Chinese military for both technical and strategic reasons.
The Customs Service, among other agencies, argued that the military makes a number of consumer items -- from clothing to toys -- that are also made by private businesses in China and that such sanctions would inevitably punish the wrong people.
More important, China specialists in the State Department, Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency argued that it would be counterproductive to single out China's military for punishment.
 
Help on Korean Situation
 These officials argued that the military must be wooed, not alienated, particularly during the crucial time in which the future of China's leadership is unknown and in which the United States needs China's help in preventing a crisis with North Korea over its nuclear program.
In his discussions with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Christopher also laid out the progress and the slippage in five other human rights areas covered by the executive order where the Administration wanted the Chinese to make "overall, significant progress."
He said that China had released some important political prisoners, but that others remained behind bars; that the International Committee of the Red Cross had begun discussions with China on visiting Chinese prisons, but that the visits had not yet begun; that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had made a statement expressing the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that China was still violating it; that China had opened talks with the United States on the jamming of the Voice of America, but that it had not stopped the interference.
Finally, Mr. Christopher indicated that China was continuing to improve the economy of Tibet and was restoring an important monastery, but had taken no concrete steps to open discussions with the Dalai Lama.

HEADLINE: Republicans and Conservatives Solidify Efforts Against Cuomo

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
New York Republicans cemented a potentially vital alliance with the Conservative Party yesterday to rally behind one candidate, George E. Pataki, to challenge the three-term Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, this fall.
In a muscular display of old-fashioned ticket-balancing, the Republicans completed their three-day convention in Manhattan by endorsing for comptroller a Conservative favorite, Herbert London, the New York University economics professor. The convention had resoundingly rejected Mr. London two days earlier for governor when it instead chose Mr. Pataki, a 48-year-old State Senator. 
 Mr. London had vowed to press ahead as a candidate for governor, a strategy that would have split the votes of conservative New Yorkers and aided Mr. Cuomo's campaign.
Earlier this week Mr. London had derided Mr. Pataki as "the last choice of Al D'Amato," the Republican Senator from New York, and said, "The simple truth is George Pataki has not earned his place in this campaign." But Mr. London was persuaded yesterday to withdraw from the gubernatorial race for another spot on the Republican ticket, and Assemblyman John J. Faso, the front-runner for comptroller, was prevailed upon to step aside for Mr. London.
"If I ran on the Conservative line and it generated even half a million votes, it would have insured Mario Cuomo's re-election, and that I could not countenance," Mr. London said yesterday. He said that in deciding to run on a ticket with Mr. Pataki, he had "put my ego aside to do what's best for the party."
Running four years ago as a Conservative, Mr. London almost outpolled the Republican nominee for governor, Pierre Rinfret. Mr. Cuomo was re-elected in 1990 with 2.2 million votes on the Democratic and Liberal lines, to 865,000 for Mr. Rinfret and 827,000 for Mr. London.
At a breakfast yesterday, even before Mr. London was endorsed, Mr. Pataki said, "The Conservatives should be very happy with the ticket they got." He quoted Michael Long, the Conservative Party state chairman, as saying the party's goal last year in fielding a candidate against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani "was to make a philosophical statement -- this year it's to defeat Cuomo."
The compromise endorsement of Mr. London also averted a showdown with Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who had all but threatened to boycott the ticket if his party sacrificed Assemblyman Faso and instead designated George J. Marlin of Queens, who was Mr. Giuliani's Conservative rival in last year's mayoral race.
Fashioning a ticket that Republicans and Conservatives could embrace represented a political and personal triumph for the Republican state chairman, William D. Powers, and his mentor, Senator D'Amato.
"This makes the parties come together," said Mr. Long, whose Conservative Party convenes next week to, in effect, ratify most or all of the Republican ticket.
But Senator Pataki still faces the prospect of a primary challenge from Richard M. Rosenbaum, the former state Republican chairman from Rochester, who served under the last Republican Governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. It would be the party's first gubernatorial primary contest in 12 years.
Mr. Rosenbaum said last night that a Republican-Conservative alliance in a state where Democrats have the edge in enrollment is "a recipe for losing" and said of Mr. Pataki, "I don't see him as a moderate at all."
Two candidates who were swamped by Mr. Pataki when the convention voted on Monday, Bill Green, a former Congressman from Manhattan, and Evan G. Galbraith, a former Ambassador to France, have not ruled out primary campaigns, too.
 
A 'Stature Gap'
 Should he win the Sept. 13 primary, Mr. Pataki would have to surmount what Dr. Lee M. Miringoff of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion characterized yesterday as a "stature gap" with Mr. Cuomo. "I don't think people are angry with Cuomo," he said. "I think they're fatigued."
The official party ticket, still subject to challenge by other candidates who choose the petition route to the primary ballot, also includes Elizabeth P. McCaughey (pronounced Muh-COY), a 45-year-old Manhattan academician, for lieutenant governor; Bernadette Castro of Lloyd Harbor, L.I., the 49-year-old businesswoman whose name has been linked since childhood with her family's convertible furniture, for United States Senator, and Dennis C. Vacco, a 41-year-old former Federal prosecutor from Buffalo, for attorney general.
Mr. Vacco said yesterday that while he, like Mr. London, was personally opposed to abortion -- government financing for it, in particular -- he would as attorney general enforce the law. As United States Attorney in Buffalo, he had been criticized by a Federal judge for his handling of the criminal-contempt case against anti-abortion protesters from Operation Rescue.
Asked whether he would withhold Medicaid funds for abortions by invoking his authority to sign state checks, Mr. London said, "I don't believe that's within my authority."
Mr. Pataki describes himself as an unequivocal supporter of a woman's right to abortion, but critics recall his opposition to Medicaid-financed abortion and his support for requirements that teen-agers notify their parents before having an abortion.
The Democrats, who will convene next week, are certain to endorse Mr. Cuomo and his Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine; United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Comptroller H. Carl McCall. A three-way primary looms for attorney general among the interim incumbent, G. Oliver Koppell; Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and Karen Burstein, who resigned as a Family Court judge to run.
 
Breakdown of Ticket
 The Republican ticket completed yesterday includes only one upstater (Mr. Vacco) and two women (Ms. McCaughey and Ms. Castro) -- all of whom are neophytes in electoral politics -- but is heavily weighted toward farmers and their offspring (Mr. Pataki, Ms. Castro and Mr. Vacco). Mr. Pataki, Ms. Castro and Mr. Vacco are Roman Catholics; Ms. McCaughey is Episcopalian; Mr. London is Jewish.
Earlier yesterday, party leaders assured a unanimous endorsement for attorney general when they nudged out Joseph Holland, a Harlem businessman, who had impressed many Republicans as a promising candidate or political appointee. Mr. Vacco was designated as the party's official candidate by acclamation.
But after hours of closed-door persuasion, a motion to endorse Mr. London by acclamation was greeted with a chorus of nays nearly as loud as the ayes. Mr. Powers proclaimed Mr. London endorsed by acclamation anyway and he was joined on the stage of the Sheraton New York by Mr. Faso -- who had been campaigning for nearly a year and had come to the convention with a majority of state committee votes committed.
"He has the heart of this convention," Frances Werner, the Queens Republican chairwoman, said earlier of Mr. Faso as Mr. Powers conferred with Faso supporters in a third-floor conference room at the hotel. "They're taking leaders in to twist their arms."
 
'A Single Purpose'
 And they were successful. Flanked by his family, Mr. Faso announced that he had been persuaded by Mr. Pataki to withdraw because "there is a single purpose that must unite us: for the good of the people of this state, we must defeat Mario Cuomo."
Mr. Faso made clear that he, like Mr. Giuliani, had balked at the prospect that the convention would endorse Mr. Marlin in his place to appease the Conservatives. But he said the goal of defeating Mr. Cuomo, coupled with Conservative Party commitments to ratify the Republican ticket pieced together yesterday, were "more important than the fate of one Assemblyman."
At City Hall Mr. Giuliani warned, "If they consider Marlin, what the Republican Party is saying is that it is no longer a Republican Party, that you can run against the party, you can try to destroy the chance to have a Republican mayor, that you can run a largely negative, nasty campaign and then the party is going to reward you by either giving you a nomination or a part of a nomination."

HEADLINE: Clinton Agrees to Welfare Financing

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
After months of struggling over how to finance his welfare proposal, President Clinton has decided to spend about $9.3 billion over five years, with about $7 billion of that coming from cuts in other social programs, Administration officials said today.
Most of the remaining money would come from the corporate environmental income tax, which is currently devoted to the Superfund program. Officials called the move an accounting measure that would not reduce the amount actually spent on environmental clean-up, because the program is accruing more than it is allowed to spend. But environmental groups criticized the action, saying the tax money should be used to expand environmental programs. 
 Mr. Clinton's decisions all but conclude months of debate among his aides over how to fulfill one of his central campaign pledges. Mr. Clinton repeatedly promised in 1992 to "end welfare as we know it" by expanding the training available to parents on welfare but making those still unemployed after two years join a work program.
The drafting of the plan, however, has been complicated by political balancing acts concerning its timing and financing. Mr. Clinton put welfare on a slow track to keep it from conflicting with health care, which must travel through the same Congressional committees.
 
A Deadline Looms
 And, the White House found itself torn between the desire to put forth a expansive plan and the political price of raising taxes or cutting other programs to pay for it. The Administration considered dozens of possible tax increases or program cuts, but rejected them, sometimes after lobbying onslaughts from well-heeled interest groups.
The gambling lobby fought off a possible excise tax, for instance, and the insurance lobby staved off a measure that would have limited the amount of money affluent people placed in tax-deferred anuities. In the end, the President decided that most of the money would be raised by reducing existing programs for low-income people.
Administration officials had known that about $1.9 billion in paper savings were available from the Superfund program, but some had argued for using them to finance the proposed new accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. By allocating the money for welfare, the Administration must now find a new source of trade money.
The decision to seek a $9.3 billion package was a disappointment for some Government officials and advocates, who had hoped for a plan that would have spent as much as $16 billion over five years. Much of the additional money would have been spent on child care for low-income workers to reward them for staying off welfare.
Mr. Clinton's decisions came during a meeting on Tuesday where he also agreed to let states deny additional money to welfare recipients who give birth to additional children while on the rolls.
Supporters, including some Democrats, argue it will force parents to take responsibility for their behavior.
But the option was vigorously opposed by many church and advocacy groups. Some of Mr. Clinton's own aides warned him last week in a confidential memorandum that there was "little evidence" the move would deter births and that it might be seen as "penalizing children for the transgressions of the parents."
The memorandum did not advocate a position but summarized the arguments for and against. Aides said Mr. Clinton largely based his own decision on his belief in giving the states flexibility. He would allow, but not require, states to withhold additional payments. Several states, including New Jersey, already do so under experimental programs.
Mr. Clinton also discussed, but did not resolve, a second issue: what happens to families who spend several years in the work program, but still cannot find private jobs?
Can they re-enroll indefinitely, as long as they are willing to work? Or can states end assistance, leaving families with neither welfare nor the work program's minimum-wage pay?
Those who oppose limits on the work program argue that some families may never find private jobs, no matter how hard they try.
Leaving those families with neither welfare nor the work program could force them into homelessness, they say. But the supporters of limits fear the President will be accused of a costly guarantee of lifetime employment.
The memorandum to Mr. Clinton warned of the political stakes. Even modest limits on the work program could "drive some Democrats away," it said. But it also noted that, to other Democrats, "the rhetoric of 'ending welfare' requires some sort of ultimate end."
Mr. Clinton has already decided what would happen to families who after two years of training refuse to join the work program. They would receive no further money.
Mr. Clinton's plan would raise about $3.5 billion by cutting payments to elderly immigrants under the Supplemental Security Income program.
Current law makes immigrants wait five years before applying for the program, unless their sponsoring family is indigent. The move would make immigrants wait 10 years. The plan would also raise about $1.5 billion by cutting disability payments to people collecting them because of drug or alcohol addictions. It would put a limit of three years on the payments. It would raise about $1.8 billion by capping the emergency assitance program, which helps families in distress, and about $500 million by cutting food subsidies to day care programs run by private families.
Bill Roberts, legislative director of the Environmental Defense Fund, acknowledged the Superfund move would not reduce the $1.5 billion a year the program now spends, but said, "the money ought to be used to expand environmental programs."

HEADLINE: Clinton Stokes Party Fires For His Health Care Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Conducting pep rallies with Democrats and taking the pulse of Senate Republicans, President Clinton promised Congress today that he would keep pushing this year for passage of health care legislation that would provide insurance for every American.
The tone in the closed door meetings switched back and forth, said those who took part. To the Republican senators, he stressed his readiness for compromise, so long as his basic goal of universal coverage was met. 
 Then, to the House Democrats, one lawmaker said, the President declared, "We can do it, but we have to fight."
And he and Vice President Al Gore said success on health care would be very important to the Democrats in the elections this fall.
Mr. Clinton sought repeatedly to dispel any idea that his enthusiasm for health care legislation was flagging. Even though all five Congressional committees with important roles on the bill will miss their self-imposed Memorial Day deadline for action, the President said he was pleased with the progress so far.
 
Republicans Voice Concerns
 In the meeting with three Democratic senators and six Republicans, Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, told Mr. Clinton that the Republicans would not support requiring employers to buy their workers' insurance. He said Democrats would have to decide whether they wanted to fight an election over the issue or to drop that demand to get legislation. Mr. Clinton did not respond. He did not answer most Republicans as they went around the room stating their concerns and hopes.
Nor did Mr. Clinton ever become involved with specific legislative detail, like how small an employer could be to avoid the obligation of buying insurance for workers.
But he told the Democratic leaders, "We are going to keep open, keep flexible, reach out to Republicans, do it this year and cover everybody."
And Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, the senior Republican on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said that when she asked Mr. Clinton to restate his principles, he told her, "First security -- that Americans will feel secure that they have health benefits, though everyone can differ on the size of it."
Then, she said later, he cited the importance of a system that would contain soaring costs and offer economies of scale to small business. And she said he had also cited the importance of reforming insurance law to eliminate the anomalies that now characterize health insurance practices.
The meeting with House Democrats was not dominated by talk of health care. The President and Mr. Gore cited a list of achievements and said Democrats could speak proudly of this Congress's record. But Mr. Gore warned much of that would be forgotten if health care failed.
"He gave a really fine pep talk," said Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, who is likely to become acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee if Representative Dan Rostenkowski is forced to step down because of the charges against him of misusing his office expense accounts. Earlier, among the leaders, Mr. Rostenkowski had assured Mr. Clinton that he would find the votes among Democrats to get a bill out of his committee.
Representative David Skaggs of Colorado called the session a "terrific pep talk" and said it was important because two recent special election losses had discouraged some Democrats.
 
No Sign of Despair
 Meeting with leaders, the President was cheered on by several lawmakers who said it was important for him to keep pressing for action and to show no sign of despair. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that it was now both "High Noon" and "D-Day" for health care and that the President's leadership was vital.
Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, said it was "obvious, at least to me, that there is a growing desire to get something done, to reach a bipartisan agreement and to pass a bill." But, he noted, "the number of different views far exceeds the number of senators."
Earlier today the President's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said the Administration could accept some compromise under which big companies are required to buy insurance for their employees, while companies with fewer than workers would not have to. "It would depend upon the level of subsidy we were willing to provide to low-wage workers," she said. "It is certainly conceivable it could be done in a fair and cost-effective way."
While Mr. Clinton's proposal would require all employers to contribute to their workers' insurance costs, with subsidies for small companies, various proposals on Capitol Hill have gone further, especially those of Mr. Kennedy and Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
In her speech before the International Women's Media Foundation today, Mrs. Clinton also denounced the news media for its reporting on health care, saying it was focused on political conflict over the bill.
She said the coverage "reminds me of a very unsatisfying argument in a schoolyard: 'Yes, you did.' 'No, I didn't.' 'Yes, you did.' 'No, I didn't,' " she said, mimicking childish voices. "And at the end of it, who knows who did or didn't."
 
Money for Research
 As for the Senate Labor Committee, which Mr. Kennedy heads, it continues to plow through his plan to modify President Clinton's proposal. Today, it adopted without change provisions that would provide more money than President Clinton had recommended for teaching hospitals and academic health centers and would allow Federal authorities to set limits on how many medical residencies could be in special fields as against primary care.
Mr. Kennedy's bill was hailed by Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, who said that without extra help academic health centers "could be red-lined out of health care plans." Because of the extra costs of having the most up-to-date equipment and of training medical personnel, the rates at teaching hospitals have historically been higher than those of other hospitals. Insurance companies are increasingly unwilling to pay those higher charges and consequently send patients elsewhere.
Mr. Clinton's plan provided $40.2 billion over five years for these hospitals from special Medicare payments -- $6.3 billion more than they get now. Mr. Kennedy raised that by another $24.8 billion. The Kennedy bill also provided another $8 billion, beyond the President's proposal, for biomedical research grants through the National Institutes of Health, much of which goes to academic health centers.
On the other side of the Capitol, a subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee voted out an even more expansive modification of the Clinton bill, a generous measure intended to provide bargaining leverage against efforts in Congress to trim the plan.

HEADLINE: Russian Aide Says Gangsters Try to Steal Nuclear Material

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
A senior Russian law enforcement official said today that organized crime in Russia was trying to infiltrate military installations to steal nuclear material and sell it on the black market.
"These crime groups in recent years are demonstrating more and more interest toward the defense facilities of the former Soviet Union," Mikhail Yegorov, head of the organized crime control department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, said in an appearance before a Congressional committee. 
 Mr. Yegorov insisted that Russia's military bases were well guarded, but he acknowledged that 47 criminal investigations had been opened into attempts to steal radioactive materials.
But Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, provided a less reassuring picture.
Mr. Freeh told the Senate Government Affairs Committee that while the F.B.I. did not have any evidence to confirm reports that Russian criminals have stolen nuclear warheads or bomb-grade materials, Interpol, the international police agency, had reported the disappearance of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of highly enriched uranium from an institution near St. Petersberg.
Mr. Freeh indicated that the report was being taken seriously and was under investigation. Six to 10 kilograms of highly enriched uranium are needed to make a small nuclear bomb.
More broadly, American officials are worried that the growth of organized crime in Russia and the fact that the Russian mafia has targeted military installations have greatly increased the risk of nuclear theft.
"We are gravely concerned Russian organized crime members may have already attained or will attain the capacity to steal nuclear weapons," Mr. Freeh said.
The Russian mafia's interest in nuclear materials is just one result of a crime wave that has occurred in Russia since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Mr. Yegorov told the Senate panel that crime was endangering economic reforms in Russia and added that Russian criminals were beginning to make inroads in Europe and the United States.
"At the present time, organized crime is a real threat to the stability of the country's economic and social life," Mr. Yegorov said. "Up to 50 percent, in some cases, of the profits that these criminal organizations get they use to bribe official persons."
Russians officials say that organized crime existed under Soviet rule, mostly in black markets, but that it has flourished in recent years with the growth of a private economy.
Mr. Yegorov said that there were nearly 5,700 criminal groups in Russia with about 100,000 members, and that 101 Russian criminal organizations operate abroad, in 29 countries.
He said 183 Russian police officers were killed and over 800 wounded fighting in gun battles with organized crime last year.
Mr. Yegorov said that the Russian criminal organizations were involved in drug dealing, money laundering and other activities in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and New York.
And Mr. Freeh said Russian organized crime was linked to a $1 billion health care fraud case in Los Angeles. To work with Russia, the F.B.I. is setting up an office in Moscow.
He added that there were 47 Russian groups in Germany involved in extortion, fraud and economic crimes, and that more than 60 such groups operated in Italy.
Trying to defend Russian handling of the nuclear issue, Mr. Yegorov insisted that military installations had good security. He also detailed some of the attempted 47 thefts, saying the vast majority of them involved attempts to steal very small quantities of nuclear material or low-enriched uranium that were thwarted by the Russian authorities.
But he said nine of the cases involved allegations of attempted thefts of highly enriched uranium. He said one of those nine cases was linked to organized crime.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy to Haiti Sees Glaring Gap in Embargo

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 25

 BODY:
Surveying the border with the Dominican Republic this morning, the United States Ambassador to Haiti declared what has seemed obvious for many weeks to the reporters accompanying him.
"It looks like a staging area for some of the contraband coming across," the Ambassador, William L. Swing, said, lowering his binoculars. While the traffic in gasoline had stopped momentarily because of his visit, all around stood the clutter of a makeshift smugglers' city. 
 Even as Mr. Swing spoke, Haitian peasants who have been thwarting the international embargo against Haiti readied their containers -- everything from empty bleach bottles to large oil drums -- for a resumption of the trade once the diplomatic entourage moved on from the border observation point near the town of Malpasse.
For many Haitians frustrated with the failure of measures taken to force the military to relinquish power, the scene captured the problems the United States and the United Nations face in seeking to return the exiled Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power by shutting down the most impoverished economy in the Western Hemisphere.
 
Ship Runs the Blockade
 Even while an embargo on oil supplies was being broadened by the United Nations over the weekend, a seagoing tug chugged by American ships, ignoring their warning shots, hugging the coastline from the Dominican Republic and finally docking at Jacmel, a small Haitian port.
Whether by sea or by land, the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has shown little inclination to help enforce the sanctions against Haiti.
Now, with the Dominican Republic also plunged in a political crisis because of allegations of fraud in recent national elections, many diplomats in both countries say there is little prospect of getting Haiti's neighbor to enforce an embargo across a snaking 270-mile land border and a coastline pocked with small coves and makeshift ports.
With President Clinton's special adviser for the Haitian crisis, William Gray, visiting the Dominican Republic today to urge President Joaquin Balaguer, a longtime enemy of Father Aristide, to stop the contraband, Mr. Swing expressed new confidence that things would change.
"He gave every indication that he wants to be cooperative," the American Ambassador said, referring to Mr. Balaguer, who narrowly won re-election in the contested Dominican vote.
But in recent days Haitian businessmen whose factories have been shut down by the new international ban on all exports from this country say they have received feelers from their Dominican counterparts indicating that far from cracking down on the violations, many in the Dominican Republic are seeking new ways to exploit what has become a highly lucrative situation.
"You have investors over there calling people here telling them that if they want to relocate their factories just across the border, they will allow our workers to come in every day and return home in the evening," declared a Haitian businessman here who said he had recently received such an offer.
In recent days, Dominican political leaders, including close advisers to the main opposition figure, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, have said that the unbridled violation of international sanctions prohibiting oil supplies, in place since last October, has resulted in the creation of an entrenched smuggler class in the Dominican Republic that includes many members of the military.
Although Mr. Pena Gomez has said publicly that his country should try to enforce the sanctions, his advisers are privately criticizing them as too little too late, and say that enforcement now by the Dominican Republic is a practical impossibility.
Haiti's military leaders appear confident they can withstand any measures short of a foreign intervention here. Haitian analysts and foreign diplomats say that the army has stockpiled large amounts of fuel in case its supplies are ever completely shut off.
After a Bahamian vessel ran the embargo, cruising past the warning shots of an American ship early on Saturday, a businessman here said he had received a telephone call from a Haitian military officer bragging of the exploit.
"You see how serious this embargo is," the officer said, chuckling as he concluded the conversation.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. to Freeze Assets
 WASHINGTON, May 25 (Reuters) -- The United States intends to freeze the assets of Haitian businessmen identified as backers of the military leaders, the State Department said today.
"We continue to work with the Treasury Department to define criteria for putting business executives who fall into the category of supporting the regime onto the assets freeze list," the department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said.
"The number of people now targeted on that list exceeds 600, and the names could include members of the business community as information on their activities accumulates," he said.
So far the freezing of assets is being applied only to Haiti's senior officer corps and their civilian allies in government.
Under an executive order issued by President Clinton on May 8, three categories of Haitians were made the targets of sanctions, including having their foreign bank assets frozen. The three groups are officers of the Haitian military and police and their families; people who played a major role in the 1991 military coup in Haiti and their families; and people employed by or acting on behalf of the Haitian military and their immediate families.
Mr. McCurry said that it was relatively easy to establish the identities of those in the first two groups, but that solid evidence was needed against individuals for them to be included in the third category.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Mark As Rates Increase in Europe

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday as traders sold dollars after a disappointing United States economic report and a rise in European interest rates.
Gold prices fell 50 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where the June contract, the most active, settled at $386.80 an ounce. 
 A Commerce Department report on factory orders for big-ticket goods prompted an early selloff in the dollar. The report showed that durable goods orders edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in April, below most expectations. The selloff accelerated when interest rates rose in Europe, traders said. Stock prices also dropped sharply on many European exchanges.
 
'A Bond Market Meltdown'
 "There has been a bond market meltdown in Europe today, and the mark has become an attractive alternative," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
In periods of market turmoil, investors typically shift assets into what they see as a safe-haven currency. The dollar often benefits from such uncertainty, but yesterday the mark was the prime beneficiary.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6455 marks, down from 1.6560 on Tuesday. Earlier in London, it rose to 1.6465 marks, from 1.6530 on Tuesday.
Much of the rise in European interest rates was attributed to a growing perception that the German central bank would slow the pace of interest-rate reductions. That view was encouraged yesterday by a reduction of just 3 basis points in the German repurchase rate, to 5.20 percent. And a member of the Bundesbank's rate-setting council cautioned that the bank would have to move cautiously in making future rate reductions.
"I think the market is getting too worried about the short end and there are more cuts to come, but it's going to be at a slower pace," said Brian Hilliard, senior economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London.
 
U.S.-Japan Trade Talks
 The dollar's decline against the yen was less pronounced, and some attributed it to optimism over the revival of trade negotiations between the United States and Japan.
"I think the trade talks are going to play an important role," said Stefan Carlsson, chief dealer at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. "Hopefully, we should see some progress."
On Tuesday, American and Japanese officials said they would end a three-month-long stalemate in trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's growing trade surplus.
The dollar fell to 104.40 yen, from 104.72 yen on Tuesday.
The British pound rose to $1.5085 in New York, from $1.5055 on Tuesday. In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4025 Swiss francs, down from 1.4145 on Tuesday; 5.6275 French francs, down from 5.6550; $1.3835 (Canadian), up from $1.3778, and 1,595 Italian lire, unchanged.

HEADLINE: Breaking With Tradition, Smithsonian Chooses Lawyer as Head

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
After a behind-the-scenes struggle involving Vice President Al Gore, the Smithsonian Institution has gone outside the scholarly world for its 10th leader, choosing a lawyer in the Clinton Administration.
The new secretary is I. Michael Heyman, a legal adviser to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and former chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley. He was chosen by the Smithsonian's Board of Regents over Mr. Gore's candidate, Thomas Lovejoy, an environmental biologist who is the Smithsonian's assistant secretary for environmental and external affairs. 
 Mr. Heyman, 63, will be the first nonscientist to lead the institution in its 148-year history. He will succeed Robert McC. Adams, 67, who is retiring in September.
"Clearly there are a lot of daunting challenges with this wonderful place, not the least of them that we've got a resource problem that is significant," Mr. Heyman said today at a news conference, adding that he would try to balance the problems of raising money from the private sector "without giving away one's soul."
The Smithsonian's 17-member board had been expected to name Mr. Heyman on May 9, after a search committee had recommended him, but it postponed the announcement at the request of Mr. Gore, a board member by virtue of his office. The Vice President, in South Africa at the time, asked for the delay so he could continue to argue the case for Dr. Lovejoy, said officials familiar with the selection process who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
Meeting in the Amazon
 Mr. Gore and Dr. Lovejoy became acquainted in January 1989, when Dr. Lovejoy led a Congressional delegation that included Mr. Gore to inspect reforestation in the Amazon region.
Despite his advocacy, Mr. Gore joined his fellow regents yesterday in endorsing Mr. Heyman.
Mr. Heyman will take over an institution that has expanded enormously in recent years. It operates 16 museums, the National Zoological Park and 11 research institutions on a budget of $445 million and has about 6,700 employees.
The deficit he must confront is a result of lower Federal contributions, decreased corporate donations and greater expenses. It is the first deficit in the Smithsonian's history and threatens to force layoffs.
The financial pressure prompted intense debate in the search committee about whether the new secretary should be a scholar or an administrator. Maxine Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and head of the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian, had urged the committee to choose the former.
"The institution should be in the hands of someone with a vision," Ms. Singer said she told the committee. "You can always find a manager to run the day-to-day operation."
 
Criteria in Mind
 But Barber B. Conable Jr, a former World Bank president who led the search committee, disagreed. "We need someone who can run a very complex institution," said Mr. Conable, a former Republican Congressman from upstate New York. "There was some feeling in the committee that having a scientific background was not the most important qualification. Some felt it was more important for the person chosen to be able to relate to Congress and to deal with an institution of this size."
Mr. Heyman earned a bachelor's degree at Dartmouth College in 1951 and a law degree from Yale Law School in 1956. He was chief law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1958 to 1959 and later taught law at Yale and Stanford Universities. He was Berkeley's vice chancellor in 1974-80 and chancellor in 1980-90.
Others on the search committee were William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; Jeannine S. Clark, a Washington civic leader; Hanna H. Gray, a former president of the University of Chicago; and Wesley S. Williams Jr., a Washington lawyer.

HEADLINE: Stray Gunfire Kills Man in Bronx

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
A young Bronx man who was killed on a basketball court yesterday was the third victim of stray gunfire in New York City in a week, the police said. But despite the cluster of such shootings -- and the constant fear in some neighborhoods that an innocent stroll can lead a bystander into a deadly crossfire -- police statistics indicate that such random shootings have actually declined significantly in the last few years.
In a densely populated city where easy access to guns has reached down to schoolchildren, bystanders have been killed or wounded by bullets intended for others, or by shots fired randomly for target practice or fun. And the risk of such shootings rises as the weather turns warm and sends large groups of people milling in the streets, the experts say. 
 The most recent victim, David Echevarria, was part of a group of young men who played basketball around midnight in the University Heights section of the Bronx. Last night, hours after celebrating his 29th birthday, he waited inside a playground for the game to start when three men nearby started shooting at one another. A stray bullet struck Mr. Echevarria in the head, the police said, killing him on the spot.
But while random shootings became increasingly common in the 1980's, the number of bystanders shot in New York has fallen since 1991, when a spate of random shootings of children moved the Police Department to keep track of bystander shootings. The number of such shootings dropped from 535 in 1991 to 335 last year, the police say.
 
Rise in Semiautomatics
 The police and outside experts attribute the decline in part to a crackdown on drug dealers and the addition of about 6,000 police officers to the department since 1990.
Experts say the shooting of bystanders began climbing in the mid-1980's with the rise in popularity of semiautomatic handguns, which can hold many rounds of ammunition and fire rapidly. The crack epidemic fueled the explosion of semiautomatics as drug dealers became richer and began buying even more powerful weapons. Drug dealers began spraying gunfire into crowds, aiming at someone in particular but often hitting bystanders. Dealers called bystanders "mushrooms" that popped up and got in the way of a bullet.
During this period semiautomatic pistols became fashionable among teen-agers, as arrests of juveniles for homicide doubled between 1985 and 1989, said Lawrence Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. As a result, more guns were in the hands of inexperienced people who often shot bystanders accidentally or fired in the air to practice their aim.
"Since you have such a proliferation of weapons, you get people just target shooting to build proficiency," said Joseph E. Lovelock, deputy inspector of the Police Department's Office of Management Analysis and Planning. "So you have young men going on the roofs of projects shooting. They just let the shots go up in the air. Unfortunately, the bullets have to land somewhere, so you get innocent people getting shot."
Many bystanders are shot during holidays, like the Fourth of July and New Year's, Inspector Lovelock said, when people fire guns to celebrate. Also, the number of such incidents rises sharply during the summer when teen-agers are out of school and large groups of people gather on neigborhood streets, late in the night.
On Sunday, a young man firing shots in the air to celebrate the Knicks' playoff victory killed a woman who had gone to look outside the window of her third-floor apartment in Crown Heights. And on Tuesday, a 15-year-old girl, steps away from the entrance to Springfield Garden High School in Queens, was shot in the right temple by a 16-year-old youth who told the police he had been testing a new gun by firing it into the air. The girl was expected to lose the vision in her right eye.
 
High-Crime Areas
 In New York, bystander shootings are centered in high-crime areas like East New York or Bedford-Stuvesant where guns are plentiful, as well as in housing projects, said Inspector Lovelock.
The shooting of bystanders reached a peak in 1990 when a number of random shootings of children prompted Mayor David N. Dinkins to announce the "Safe Streets, Safe City" program, including a record expansion of the police force.
At the playground on 183d Street and Ryer Avenue in the Bronx where Mr. Echevarria's blood still stained the asphalt yesterday, Amparo Ramirez said: "There's no safe parks. They shoot every single night. By my house on Tiebout Avenue, they're always shooting."
Harvey Dudley, a 31-year-old unemployed construction worker who lives a few blocks from the site of the shooting, said frequent gunfire had made him afraid to go outside. "It's real scary," he said, "and a stray bullet don't know no name."

HEADLINE: A Region Without Oil Is Redefining Venezuela

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BARQUISIMETO, Venezuela

 BODY:
In the oil boom of the 1980's, the Venezuelan state of Lara was a slighted stepsister. Lara had no oil wells, no refineries, not even a petrochemical plant.
Without oil, workaday Lara trudged along -- growing potatoes, picking coffee, bottling beer, forging steel, exporting onions and assembling vacuum cleaners. 
 But today, Venezuela's oil income, compared with population, has dwindled to the lowest level since the 1950's. Though the country sits on the largest known sea of oil in the Americas, prices have fallen almost 40 percent in the last five years.
Business is instead looking to Lara's thriving, diversified economy as a model for a Venezuela after the oil era.
"We are getting a reverse flow -- professionals and laborers are now moving here from Caracas," said Rafael Marcial Garmendia, a local rancher who is president of Proinlara, a private-investment promotion service. "We don't depend on oil. We don't depend on the state. Over the last 20 years, we have had the fastest rate of industrial growth."
Growth has meant a new baseball stadium and modern buildings sprouting along spacious boulevards. A state capital with a suburban atmosphere, Barquisimeto frequently ranks in polls as Venezuelans' second-most-desired place to live -- after Puerto La Cruz, a Caribbean resort. Last year, Barquisimeto, a metropolitan area of more than 800,000, won a status symbol coveted by every Venezuelan city -- daily flights to Miami.
Barquisimeto has a higher income than the national average. With increasing frequency, this crossroads of agriculture and industry is being called "Venezuela's Chicago."
For the rest of the country, it remains hard to kick a decades-long dependency on oil. Venezuela, the largest supplier of oil to the United States after Saudi Arabia, was once described as a nation glued to an oil industry. The state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., is Latin America's largest company.
 
Broadened Tax Base
 As recently as five years ago, exports by Petroleos de Venezuela accounted for 82 percent of the national budget. This year, the Government expects oil to contribute 47 percent.
Partly because of this slipping revenue, the Venezuelan bolivar has lost about half its value in a month.
"For my generation, it will be the first time that we have seen oil fall below half of the national budget," Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the 70-year-old Treasury Minister, said in an interview in Caracas. "The most foolish thing of the last 20 years was to not diversify the economy."
Selling more oil for less money, Venezuela is seeing its other exports gradually rise -- from 20 percent of total exports in 1990 to an anticipated 30 percent this year. In 1992, for the first time in memory, other economic activity surpassed oil.
In a country where newspapers publish the previous day's oil prices on their front pages, a diversified economy is slowly taking shape.
"We have to abandon the oil-royalty model," said Adolfo R. Taylhardat, executive director of Conapri, a group that lobbies for improved investment conditions. "Previously, the only sector that had a policy was oil, and oil dragged along Venezuela."
Gold mining in the Venezuelan Amazon is attracting $1 billion in investments, largely from Canadian, South African and Venezuelan companies. By the end of the decade, the nation's annual gold exports are projected to increase tenfold, to $2 billion.
"Mining is going to be the next oil of Venezuela," predicted Gustavo Cisneros, president of a local group that is joining with South Africans to invest $100 million in a gold mine.
 
Other Industries
 Pulp and paper are attracting $1 billion in investment projects, largely from Colombian and United States companies. In telecommunications, a consortium led by GTE is investing $6 billion to modernize Venezuela's telephone company, Cantv.
Investment in tourism is expected to rise, too, with the Government planning to privatize eight hotels, three race tracks and an airline in the next year. Construction and repair of 14 highways is to be opened to bidding by foreign and domestic contractors.
Much of the new economic activity is centered in this vital region. Eighty percent of Venezuela's population is within four hours by truck from Lara, a farm state that has become a breadbasket for a country that once had to import eggs from Florida.
"A lot of Caracas companies are moving out here," said William T. Smith, general manager of Nabisco's Venezuelan subsidiary. In a three-year, $20 million program, Nabisco concentrated its 10 production lines in Barquisimeto, doubling capacity.
Easing the highs and lows in Venezuela's economy, industries are increasingly exporting to Colombia. Since the neighboring countries created a free-trade customs union in 1991, trade has quadrupled in this combined market of nearly 55 million people. By contrast, Venezuela has minimal commerce, and no air connections, with Guyana to the east.
"Companies are expanding here all the time," said Allan J. Robinson, a Briton, who is general manager of the Barquisimeto Hilton. "People may take a salary cut after Caracas, but they get a better quality of life -- less traffic, less crime."

HEADLINE: One Standard For Courses Is Presented

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines yesterday tried to bring order to what gets taught in New York City's 1,100 public schools, issuing a new 200-page curriculum guide that suggests minimum standards for what every student in each grade should learn.
The new document represents the first attempt to impose instructional standards across the city's public schools since William H. Maxwell, the first schools superintendent, ordered a similar curriculum guide for lower schools in 1903, Board of Education officials said. 
Mr. Cortines ordered the preparation of the curriculum guide last October, after he visited a series of schools in his first weeks as Chancellor and found that course offerings often varied radically among the city's 32 community school districts. Mr. Cortines asked the principals to "field test" the instructional outline in their schools next year.
The standards will become mandatory in fall 1995, Mr. Cortines said. But he acknowledged there was little he could do to force its use.
"This book will not be worth the paper it's printed on unless you make it your Bible," Mr. Cortines told the principals gathered in an auditorium at Manhattan's Fiorello La Guardia High School.
All of the city's nearly 1,100 principals were invited to yesterday's gathering. But only about 300 attended, pointing to the difficulty of coordinating any systemwide initiative.
In recent years, the only citywide curriculums that have been a focus of widespread debate have been two course guides, written at board headquarters in Brooklyn, both touching on sexuality: a multicultural guide, distributed in 1992, that in a few passages urged the teaching of tolerance for homosexuals, and an AIDS curriculum that some parents felt introduced sexual topics too early. The ensuing storm over the guides led to the ouster of Mr. Cortines's predecessor, Joseph A. Fernandez. Mr. Cortines's framework does not include the word AIDS until the sixth-grade health class outline. It does not discuss homosexuality.
The frameworks, distributed to principals yesterday in three-ring binders, were written by 300 teachers, parents, administrators, academics and businessmen, organized into seven working groups by Mr. Cortines. The curriculum guide draws from several sources, including voluntary standards written by national educational organizations under the Federal Goals 2000 legislation for improving schools and State Education Department curriculums.
The guide offers a page of guidelines for each grade level for nine courses: social studies, mathematics, science, English, languages other than English, health-physical education-home economics, performing arts, visual arts and occupational and technical studies.
The framework for ninth-grade social studies, for instance, says students will focus on Africa, South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. It says students will "interpret geography-related data to hypothesize, predict, and draw conclusions about the impact of geography on the development" of those countries and will "demonstrate an understanding of the diverse economic systems and decision-making processes as they relate to the development of individual national economies."
 
Specific Guidelines
 The science framework offers similarly specific guidelines. Third-grade science students will, among other pursuits, "observe, describe and classify plants by their physical characteristics; conduct simple experiments to explore the properties of electrical energy; investigate the characteristics of vertebrates and invertebrates, and investigate and explain seasonal changes in different regions of the world."
The document is not as specific on other subjects. The mathematics framework, for instance, does not even state explicitly when students are to learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide. Since the English framework does not require study of any individual works of literature, it mostly offers vague recommendations, as for 10th-grade classes: "Students will independently read and enjoy complex texts in all genres on a wide range of subjects," it says.
Milton Fein, principal of Public School 7 in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx who was one of the 800 school leaders who did not respond to Mr. Cortines's invitation yesterday, sounded less than enthusiastic about the new document.
"I've been a principal for 24 years and we've seen curricula introduced from time to time," Mr. Fein said. "The best that you usually get is an outline of vague expections."
But several principals who traveled to La Guardia High School to hear Mr. Cortines, however, said they would begin using the guides to refocus their instructional programs. "This is a guide, a road map for education," said Carl Sanfilippo, principal at Intermediate School 259 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. "For many years, we haven't had this kind of direction."
In fact, the city has not provided this kind of detail for all its schools since 1903, five years after the system's 1898 consolidation, when the Board of Education approved a 40-page document entitled "The Course of Study for the Elementary Schools of the City of New York," said Dr. Stephan F. Brumberg, an adviser to Mr. Cortines.
In the decades since, the State Education Department has provided a series of general curriculum guidelines, usually little more than a sentence or two of course description for all subjects and grades. Local districts have had the responsibility to build curriculums based on those descriptions.

Derivatives Get a Key Supporter

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Strongly disagreeing with a new Congressional study, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, said today there was "negligible" risk that the rapidly growing market for financial derivatives might someday require a taxpayer bailout.
In testimony before a House subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan and other senior financial regulators said there was no need for new legislation to supervise derivatives. 
 Derivatives are highly profitable products offered by banks and brokerage firms to corporations and investors. They are contracts with cash values that are tied to, or "derived" from, the price of financial assets like stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies.
 
Variety of Uses
 Most often, derivatives are used by companies as a form of financial insurance; they can, for example, help protect against a decline in the dollar's value that would raise the cost of a company's imports. Derivatives can also be used by investors as a substitute for owning securities.
Several large companies recently reported losses from unusual derivative transactions that combined normal hedging of risks with speculative bets on interest rates.
Last week, the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, released a study that called for vastly expanded regulation of the dealers and users of derivatives. In particular, the G.A.O. called for much closer supervision of the derivatives activities of brokerage firms and insurance companies, which are not regulated as tightly as federally insured banks.
 
Fears of a Bailout
 The G.A.O. said that because derivatives activity was concentrated in a few big banks and brokerage firms, there was an increased possibility of a market crisis leading to a taxpayer-financed bailout that might have to be extended even to uninsured brokerage firms.
Mr. Greenspan challenged the G.A.O.'s assertion that the Government could be at financial risk. He noted that brokerage firms can borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window in case of emergency but he emphasized that such loans are backed by collateral and, in his view, pose virtually no risk to the Government.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan played down the risk of derivatives to commercial banks. "There is no presumption that the major thrust of derivatives activities is any riskier, indeed it may very well be less risky, than commercial lending," he said.
Mr. Greenspan argued repeatedly that additional Government regulation was not necessary because of "private regulation" by investors, credit rating agencies and others that insist on financial soundness in those with whom they do business.
 
Safeguards Are Seen
 "The G.A.O. report's concern that there are gaps in derivatives regulation is true only in the narrow sense that Government regulations or regulators are not in all cases involved," Mr. Greenspan said. "In a more important sense, today's markets and firms, especially those firms that deal in derivatives, are heavily regulated by private counterparties who, for self-protection, insist that dealers maintain adequate capital and liquidity."
Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the agency did not need additional powers to oversee the derivatives activities of affiliates of the brokerage firms it regulated. Still, under intense questioning from Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee, Mr. Levitt said the S.E.C. did not have the legal authority to compel these derivative dealers to submit to examination by regulators.
"If they wish to deny us information, they could do so," he said, although he noted that the agency had found no evidence of unsafe derivatives activities at brokerage firms.
Mr. Markey said he was worried that the S.E.C. was dependent on voluntary cooperation by the brokers. "Securities and insurance regulators have to rely on the kindness of strangers, like Blanche DuBois," he said, referring to the character in "A Streetcar Named Desire."
The regulators also rejected Mr. Markey's assertion that derivatives regulations should be made consistent for banks and brokerage firms.
 
Variations Are Noted
 "The markets are different," Mr. Levitt said. "The banking industry is protected by an insurance fund that guarantees its safety and soundness." Brokerage firms, by contrast, are regulated to prevent fraud and theft of securities from customer accounts, but they are regularly allowed to fail, he said.
Mr. Markey said he hoped to introduce and have passed in this Congressional session legislation that would expand regulation of derivatives. That goal may be made more difficult by the actions of Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Dingell today released letters that he had sent to Mr. Levitt and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen asking for formal comments on the G.A.O.'s recommendations.
Because Mr. Dingell gave the regulators 45 days for their reports, financial industry lobbyists suggested that the move would delay consideration of a derivatives bill until next year.
Mr. Markey said he would hold more hearings on derivatives, perhaps with testimony from some of the companies that have lost money using them.
 
Learning Lessons
 In today's hearing, Mr. Greenspan also argued that legislation was less needed now because in the last few years regulators had learned more about derivatives and how to press dealers to manage their risks better. "As far as the Federal Reserve Board is concerned, we feel we are ahead of the curve on this issue," he said.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency and the regulator of national banks, said that the 8 to 10 banks with the biggest derivatives activity were complying with new Government standards on risk management of derivatives. Still, there are 362 national banks involved with derivatives, and Mr. Ludwig said examiners had found defects in the procedures of some of the smaller ones.

HEADLINE: Party Chairman Attacks 4 Democrats Who Failed

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Stung by the loss of a House seat in Kentucky that had been held by Democrats for 129 years, the Democratic Party chairman today turned against his party's candidate as well as three others who have lost high-profile elections since 1992.
In a highly unusual breach of party decorum, David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, leveled a harsh attack against the candidate in Kentucky, Joe Prather, saying that he waged "a lackadaisical campaign," was "caught flat-footed" and "explicitly refused Democratic Party help." 
 Though he had been so confident of victory that he had gone house hunting in Washington, Mr. Prather lost to Ron Lewis, a fundamentalist Christian minister, by 55 percent to 45 percent on Tuesday. The special election was to fill the seat held by Democrats since 1865, the last 41 of those years by Representative William H. Natcher, who died two months ago.
Seeking to follow in the tradition of Mr. Natcher, something of a political legend who spent virtually no money on his campaigns, Mr. Prather greatly limited donations and took no money from political action committees. Mr. Wilhelm said that Mr. Prather refused his "repeated offers of assistance." National Democratic organizations, he said, could have given more than $60,000 to help Mr. Prather.
 
Heavy Republican Spending
 The Republicans, by contrast, pumped thousands of dollars into the race, paying for television commercials that depicted Mr. Prather as a tax-and-spend clone of the President.
A parade of Republican leaders today hailed the victory -- the latest in a Republican winning streak -- as evidence that President Clinton, who campaigned as a moderate Southern Democrat, had become so unpopular in the region that he could spell defeat for dozens of candidates in November.
"The tidal wave of Republican victories continues," declared Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. "This election sends a powerful message to the White House. On issue after issue, the American people aren't swallowing this Administration's big Government medicine."
Since Mr. Clinton's election, Republicans have picked up eight formerly Democratic seats in important contests, including one special election earlier this month to fill the seat of Representative Glenn English of Oklahoma. The Democrats have not won any major elections for seats that were held by Republicans.
 
Feeding Party's Fears
 The Kentucky results only add to the fears of Democrats that they will lose many seats, particularly those of several conservative Democrats in the South who are retiring this year. That could damage the prospects of Mr. Clinton's programs in Congress.
In conceding the race, Mr. Prather, a former state Senator and state party chairman, said that the President had been a drag on his campaign. But Mr. Lewis went further in a telephone interview, attributing his victory to Mr. Clinton.
"Everyone that I talked to felt that the programs that Mr. Clinton was pushing -- the tobacco farmers with the tobacco tax and the gun control situation -- they just felt that Government was getting too involved in their personal lives," Mr. Lewis said. "We said in an ad, 'If you like Bill Clinton, you'll love Joe Prather.' "
Even before Election Day, Democratic Party officials, fearing a loss in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, distanced themselves from Mr. Prather in public comments. But today, Mr. Wilhelm, a usually amiable political professional who was Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, went further. He insisted that even though the Western Kentucky district had favored the Republican candidate in the last four Presidential races, Mr. Prather's "fatal mistake" was not running with the Democratic Party.
 
Arrows for Others
 In a news conference at party headquarters, Mr. Wilhelm also singled out three other defeated Democrats -- Bob Krueger, who lost a Senate race in Texas; Mary Sue Terry, who lost her race for Governor of Virginia, and Dan Webber, who lost the special election in Oklahoma for Mr. English's House seat two weeks ago. He said all three had failed largely because they did not embrace President Clinton or his agenda.
"As best I can tell, Joe Prather got into a defensive crouch and stayed there," Mr. Wilhelm said. "This crouch strategy, which might be called the Bob Krueger/Mary Sue Terry/Joe Prather strategy, is a dead-bang loser."
Senator Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, took issue with Mr. Wilhelm's characterization of Mr. Krueger. "Bob Krueger had defined himself," Senator Graham said. "He had been in the Congress for a number of years. He was not a person who was waiting around for somebody else to draw in the dots and the colors to give him texture."
While several analysts agreed that Mr. Prather had run a poor race, they also said it would not have helped him to align himself more closely with Mr. Clinton. The President is not popular in this largely rural district, where voters are nervous about the costs of his health care proposal and about his proposed cigarette tax, which could hurt the local economy.
 
Low Turnout Noted
 "I don't think tying himself to Clinton and Clinton's programs would have helped him all that much, because Bill Clinton's just not all that popular in the district," said Carl P. Chelf, a professor of government at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green. "But he could have been more aggressive in establishing what his own agenda was."
He also noted that Mr. Prather had suffered from a low turnout in what was otherwise a primary election and the Republicans' successful mobilization of the religious right.
Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats close to Mr. Clinton, disputed that the Kentucky outcome was the latest demonstration that the President was viewed as too liberal in districts that have been long held by conservative Democrats.
But a gleeful Representative Bill Paxon of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, accused Mr. Wilhelm of "throwing his own candidates to the wolves."

Idaho and Arkansas Elections
 The Associated Press
 Idaho Democrats have nominated an American Indian as their candidate for Governor, while Arkansas Republicans chose a longtime foe of President Clinton as their gubernatorial nominee.
In the Arkansas primary on Tuesday, James B. McDougal, the former owner of a failed savings and loan and a business partner of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater Development Company, came in last in a three-way race for the Democratic nomination for the 4th Congressional District.
In the race for the Republican nomination for governor, Sheffield Nelson, a Clinton critic who provided tips on Whitewater to reporters, won the right to challenge Jim Guy Tucker, the Democrat who became Governor of Arkansas when Mr. Clinton was elected President in 1992.
Mr. Nelson, who lost a bitter gubernatorial race to Mr. Clinton in 1990, barely avoided a runoff, with 51 percent of the vote to defeat State Senator Steve Luelf, who won 44 percent in the three-way race.
In Idaho, where Gov. Cecil Andrus, a Democrat, is retiring after an unprecedented fourth term, Attorney General Larry EchoHawk defeated two other Democrats for his party's nomination. Mr. EchoHawk, a Pawnee and former tribal lawyer, got 74 percent of the vote. If Mr. EchoHawk wins, he would become the first American Indian in the nation to be elected governor.
On the Republican side, former Lieut. Gov. Phil Batt easily won nomination with 48 percent of the vote in a four-way race. A victory in the general election for Mr. Batt would end 24 years of Democratic control of the governor's office.

HEADLINE: Sculpture Garden Rises in a New Patch of Green;
The Latest Addition to New York City's Park System, Named for a Philosopher

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
One man's dream to clean up a garbage dump and build a park -- a sculpture garden beside the East River with the jagged skyline of Manhattan a distant backdrop -- officially became a reality yesterday.
Since Mark di Suvero first wondered a decade ago whether there was a better way to make use of the littered lot beside his Queens studio, hundreds of his neighbors have worked tirelessly to help him create Socrates Sculpture Park, already a powerful draw for art aficionados from the city and beyond. Yesterday, it was formally dedicated as a city park, the first major addition to the park system in more than a decade. 
 With the pull of a cord and the falling away of a blue drape, the Parks and Recreation Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, declared that the 4.5-acre former wasteland had been reclaimed as part of the city's green space.
 
The Trunk of a Cedar
 Under the drape stood the trunk of the old blue Atlas cedar, a tree donated by the Emperor of Japan to the 1964 World's Fair that had been dealt a lethal blow when it was improperly uprooted during its transplanting in Flushing Meadow Park in March. An artist, Ron Ressler, had carved the dead tree into a 13-foot-high sculpture titled, "On Fertile Ground."
"It's such a wonderful confluence: a sculpture park dedicated and the blue Atlas cedar reborn as a work of art," he said.
Socrates Sculpture Park, named for the philosopher, was conceived by Mr. di Suvero after he set up his studio in an old brick factory amid the warehouses and transmission shops along Vernon Boulevard. The site, facing the northern tip of Roosevelt Island and just south of Hell Gate, the treacherous juncture of the Harlem and East Rivers, had once been a marine terminal. The slip was filled in about 20 years ago, but some of the concrete moorings remained; ideal pedestals for sculpture, in Mr. di Suvero's mind's eye.
"This is where they used to do illegal garbage dumping," Mr. di Suvero said. "There was no fence. There were huge puddles: broken steel, old cars. It took us about a year to clear this place."
Mr. di Suvero set up a nonprofit organization and began hiring unemployed people from the neighborhood who, along with volunteers and donations from local businesses, began the gradual task of creating the park.
The property belonged to what was then the city's Department of Ports and Terminals, now called the Department of Business Services. "The city wanted to develop it," Mr. di Suvero said. "I wouldn't say we fought the city, but it was nip and tuck to save it."
Mr. di Suvero credited a former Parks Commissioner, Gordon Davis, and a former Deputy Mayor, Barbara Fife, with sharing his vision for what might be. Yesterday's ceremony celebrated the culmination of the campaign, the assigning of management of the site from the Business Services Department to the Parks Department in a lease that was actually signed last October.
The park, Mr. Stern said, "means that there will be a place for monumental sculpture to be exhibited year round on the east bank of the East River."
"New artists will be discovered here," he said.
"And they did it," Mr. Stern said of the community, "That's the great part. The city cooperated but the people did it."
Before its incarnation as a city park, Mr. di Suvero had leased the land from the city and raised money from private donors to hold sculpture exhibitions in the park. Since then, it has become a vital part of Long Island City, a place for lectures and tours and several youth programs.
More than 20 sculptures now grace the swath of green beside the river. Most are abstract sculptures, like a 50-foot-high complex of jutting steel girders.
Among the works is a grouping of larger-than-life figures: a basketball player with his foot propped on a large portable radio; a man and his pit bull, and a young girl roller skating. By the boulders of the shoreline, a giant wind-chime-like sculpture turned in the breeze, converting its energy into the delicate tinkling of little bells.
Lovers rested beneath a nearby tree. As the dedication ceremony neared its end, Claudia Glover's class of toddlers from the N.A.A.C.P. Day Care Center in Long Island City thumped on the metal drums of a nearby work of art. "We come here all the time," Ms. Glover said. "They get to play and sing around these sculptures."
At that moment, Mr. di Suvero told the 200 or so guests at the dedication: "Here in Socrates Park we have made a unity with joy. So on this glorious day I ask you to join me and give the Great Spirit, the Earth Mother and the flowing river three yippees."
And the crowd did.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise Modestly, With Dow Up 10.13

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday again followed the wobbly path of the bond market, which sank then rallied after demand for the Government's debt issues proved brisk.
Other factors also lifted stocks. The outlook for commodities prices improved for a second day and yet another economic report, for durable-goods orders, showed the economy was growing only moderately, good news for bonds. 
 But despite these factors in favor of a rally, which have led to robust sessions in the past, stock prices rose only modestly in below-average volume.
Some analysts say that the market will not only remain sluggish but may temporarily decline in earnest in the next few weeks. That will be in advance of a summer rally, which analysts say is more and more likely because pessimistic investor sentiment is so lopsided. Often, when bearish opinion is extreme, markets can quickly turn bullish, analysts say.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.13 points, to 3,755.30, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.53 points, to 456.34. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.60 point, to 732.07.
 
A Sluggish Performance
 Part of the reason behind yesterday's sluggish performance may be a statistical fluke. Philip Morris, a major component in the Dow, did not open for trading in advance of a board meeting that ultimately took no action on a proposal to split the food and tobacco businesses.
Philip Morris was listed as unchanged at 53 3/4 yesterday. When the stock opens this morning, its price is likely to drop sharply, perhaps below $50 a share.
Nonetheless, blue chips like Walt Disney and Aluminum Company of America, as well as health care companies like Abbott Laboratories and electric utilities like the Entergy Corporation rose yesterday. Over-the-counter stocks like Microsoft and MCI Communications also rose.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief market strategist for the First Albany Corporation, says traders are beginning to wonder whether the economy, which they once feared was overheating, may now be slowing down too much. "Investors are starting to wonder about the trade-off between higher bond prices and a softer economy and lower earnings," he said.
Philip J. Roth, chief technical market analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, also said the markets continued to be confused by two major and conflicting trends. "One is that secular disinflation is alive and well," he said. "But the other is that the economy is strengthening and that means that commodities prices are going up."
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, a proxy for bond traders' inflation outlook, rose 16/32 , to 8629/32 . Its yield fell to 7.34 percent, down 5 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Five-Year Notes Auction
 Bond prices improved after the 1 P.M. auction of $11 billion of five-year notes showed brisker demand than expected. An auction of two-year notes the day before showed lackluster demand.
But the brisk demand for the five-year paper, analysts say, may simply reflect an arcane trading theory that medium-term notes are intrinsically less risky than short- or long-term notes.
The Commodity Research Bureau index, a proxy for commodities traders' inflation outlook, improved for the second day. It fell 3.10 points, to 231.59, on a fall in prices for futures contracts for soybean oil, coffee and pork bellies.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.66 point, to 252.06, on below-average volume of 254.4 million shares. Advancing stocks barely outnumbered declining stocks by 1,111 to 1,029. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.07 point, to 439.25.
The most active stock, at 7 million shares on the American Stock Exchange, was Exploration Company of Louisiana, which rose 7/16 , to 1 3/4, on little discernible news.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Cattle Prices at 6-Year Low; Other Commodities Also Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Cattle futures prices plummeted to a nearly six-year low yesterday amid concerns about burdensome supplies. Most other commodity prices also fell for the second consecutive day, reducing inflation fears.
The widely watched index of 21 commodities tracked by the Commodity Research Bureau fell 3.1 points, to 231.59. Among the other losers were hogs, pork bellies, soybeans, corn, coffee, precious metals and crude oil. 
 Live cattle for June delivery plunged 1.50 cents on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the permitted daily limit, to 62.47 cents a pound, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since June 23, 1988. August feeder cattle also fell the 1.50-cent limit, to 71.60 cents a pound; June live hogs sank 1.17 cents, to 47.05 cents a pound; July frozen pork bellies dropped 1.78 cents, to 41.62 cents a pound.
 
Results Called a 'Debacle'
 "My word for the day is debacle," said Dennis Smith, research director for Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago. "This thing is really getting extreme."
Live cattle futures have tumbled 14.15 cents, or more than 18 percent, since April 1 as larger numbers of heavier cattle have appeared on the market.
An Agriculture Department report on Friday showed the largest number of May 1 feedlot cattle -- animals being fattened for slaughter -- in 11 years, implying no letup in supplies. Cattle weights, which last month averaged 5 percent above a year earlier, are rising as well.
Hog and pork-belly futures were under pressure as a result of larger supplies of hogs coming to market than analysts had expected based on Agriculture Department reports.
Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain and rain forecasts in the Midwest continued to wash away drought fears.
Coffee futures continued to retreat from the five-year high of $1.4550 a pound posted early in Tuesday's session. Analysts said speculative buying had pushed prices to inflated levels. Unroasted coffee beans for July delivery fell 5.35 cents on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to $1.2775 a pound.
Most energy futures headed lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange because of declining demand. Natural gas hit a 15-month low.
Light sweet crude oil for July delivery fell 22 cents, to $17.70 a barrel; June heating oil rose 0.03 cent, to 47.63 cents a pound; June unleaded gasoline fell 0.09 cent, to 51.67 cents a gallon; July natural gas dropped 4.8 cents, to $1.836 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Up Just 0.1% As Home Resales Rise 1.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Orders for long-lived factory goods languished in April, more evidence of slowing business expansion, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Durable goods orders, which lead to activity in coming months, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, below most expectations, and would have been solidly in negative territory without a presumably temporary surge for military aircraft. 
 Separately, home resales rose by 1.2 percent last month, to a 4.12 million annual pace, as higher interest rates continued to induce buyers to act before rates moved still higher. But sales were down in the Northeast and South, the National Association of Realtors found.
The report on durable goods, a category ranging from aircraft carriers to clothes dryers, was regarded by many analysts as a sign of slackening economic growth and thus would diminish pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again.
"The economy has shifted into lower gear since the beginning of the new year," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
"Today's report adds to earlier evidence that the economy was already slowing down on its own" before the Fed began raising rates in early February, he added.
In St. Louis, Laurence H. Meyer, a consultant, said he saw "waning" economic momentum and cited three consecutive months of declines in orders for nonmilitary capital goods.
But others had less pessimistic interpretations of the report on orders, pointing to the hefty rise in March that was at least sustained in April and to a jump of 8.6 percent last month in orders for electronic and other electrical equipment.
"Durable goods manufacturing continues to be expanding meaningfully," said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official and now chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Mark P. Vitner, economist at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., largely agreed. "There is not much of a letup in sight in the manufacturing sector," he said. "There's plenty of fuel in the pipeline."
And Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price Associates, an investment firm in Baltimore, said, "We're not worried yet."
Still, orders fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent when the Pentagon's orders are not counted, and overall orders -- 13.5 percent higher than in April 1993 -- have now fallen at an annual rate of 4 percent over the last three months.
Primary metals posted the biggest decline last month, skidding by 6.6 percent after two solid gains. Transportation equipment, where declines for railroad equipment and motor vehicles more than offset an advance for aircraft, fell by 1.6 percent, the smallest of three consecutive declines. Industrial machinery rose by three-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Total New Orders Up 2 Percent
 In capital goods, total new orders climbed by 2 percent as the relatively small military sector jumped by 23.3 percent, while the civilian sector fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent -- seven-tenths of 1 percent when aircraft are excluded.
Shipments of durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department figures also showed. It was the second decline in four months.
Unfilled orders, or backlogs, inched up by one-tenth of 1 percent, to $423.8 billion, the first rise since January.
The report on home resales listed increases of 5.4 percent in the West and 3 percent in the Middle West, partly offset by a second consecutive decline of 1.7 percent in the Northeast and a decline of 1.3 percent in the South.
"With the start of the spring home-buying season, many consumers decided to lock in before volatile investment markets pushed the possibility of buying a home out of their financial reach," said Debbie Johnson, economist at C. J. Lawrence in New York, referring to a rush by home buyers to act before interest rates rose again.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Economists see an intellectual ally in Supreme Court nominee.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHO is Judge Stephen Breyer, and where does he stand? While groups at war over social issues ranging from abortion rights to discrimination have yet to take the measure of the President's Supreme Court nominee, both economists and lawyers well versed in economics are dancing in the aisles.
"Breyer is better educated in economics than any justice in the Court's history," said William Landes, an economist at the University of Chicago's law school. 
 "He knows more about regulatory law and policy than any justice since Brandeis," echoed Robert Pitovsky, a former member of the Federal Trade Commission now teaching at the Georgetown University Law School.
This still leaves open the question of whether Mr. Breyer can change a court in which he will have just one of nine votes. But his many admirers (and few detractors) have some ideas.
The current Supreme Court is widely viewed as conservative. However, few of the economic questions faced by the courts have much to do with ideology. Is it liberal or conservative, for example, to give Government regulators the benefit of the doubt on rulings that are challenged as arbitrary and capricious? Is it liberal or conservative to broaden the reach of copyright law to include computer software?
"They pick a shred here and a shred there" to justify their economic logic, concludes F. M. Scherer, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. And as a result, the Court's opinions on antitrust issues have been, at best, unpredictable, and, at worst, inconsistent.
In the Brook case in 1993, for example, the Court smiled on the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company in what had seemed to be an open-and-shut case of predatory pricing against it. The Court held that there had to be proof that there was a conspiracy to drive a competitor out of business. Yet just a year earlier, in a decision that reminded observers of the activist acrobatics of the Warren Court, the Justices ruled that Eastman Kodak could be sued for trying to corner the servicing of its own brand of photocopiers -- in spite of the fact that Kodak was a minor force in the photocopier market.
"The Brook decision, in light of Kodak, came as a big surprise," dryly noted Howard Kitt, an economist with National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm in White Plains.
Judge Breyer, it is generally agreed, will drive the court toward consistency on economic cases. And he may even drive the Court's other legal intellectual, Antonin Scalia, to recast his always clever and usually esoteric opinions in terms of workaday economic substance.
Among the economic issues Judge Breyer is likely to influence are these:
Property rights. Property used to mean what it sounded like -- this chunk of land or that machine. Today, the courts face a bewildering set of property issues ranging from "takings" questions in which the Government's right to limit land use without compensation is challenged, to intellectual property cases involving the exclusive use of ideas.
Mr. Landes expects that Judge Breyer will view these newfangled property issues through an economist's prism, focusing less on equity and more on efficiency. Thus instead of asking who is entitled, he is more apt to wonder whether a ruling will raise or lower productivity. In software cases, for example, he is likely to look at the impact on the pace of innovation or the potential waste in building legal walls to protect new ideas.
Antitrust. This is a precedent-bound corner of the law, but one in which Congress has given the Supreme Court broad discretion to make policy as well as to interpret it.
Like most people trained in modern economics, Judge Breyer has been strongly influenced by the Chicago School view that the ultimate test of antitrust policy is the pragmatic test -- whether it encourages the efficient use of scarce resources. His pragmatism is reflected in a case on predatory pricing in which he argued that intent is irrelevant as long as producers sell above cost, as well as one in which he ruled that attempts by Blue Cross to bludgeon down physicians' fees were legal.
One antitrust area in which Judge Breyer's cool logic may have the most impact is "vertical restraint" cases, where economists have been far more receptive than the courts to arguments as to why producers should be allowed to dictate the behavior of wholesalers and retailers.
Health and safety regulation. Judge Breyer's latest book, "Breaking the Vicious Circle" (Harvard Press), is an eloquent meditation on how to regulate perilous activities in a world that cannot afford to reduce risk to zero. And while much of the book is a sympathetic look at the difficulty of regulating in a political context, it is safe to say that he will be unsympathetic to policies that ignore economic trade-offs.
"Justice Breyer will worry about the costs of regulation as well as the benefits," predicts Lawrence White, an economist at the Sloan School of Business of New York University.

HEADLINE: Ambiguity Saves Trade Talks

 BODY:
The trade agreement announced this week by President Clinton and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata does not obligate Japan to stimulate its economy so that it will absorb more imports or open up markets or settle any other dispute. But it does get trade talks back on track -- a welcome reversal after the breakdown in February. Talks should relieve the friction that has focused undue attention on a secondary issue -- the $50 billion bilateral trade imbalance -- that drives these allies apart rather than on Mr. Hata's stalled agenda of political and economic reforms that can pull them together.
Though Japan's overall trade surplus results from its high savings rate, the imbalance with the U.S. is in part because of barriers that shut out U.S. exports and investment. Most economists agree that the harm to the U.S. economy is small. But Japan's practices undermine confidence in trade rules and, most important for Mr. Clinton and Congress, hurt powerful constituents -- like Motorola in the cellular phone market. 
 Though the actual wording has not been released, U.S. officials say Japan has pledged to negotiate higher foreign penetration in five specific sectors and use quantitative criteria to measure success. Japan won a pledge that the U.S. would not seek numerical targets.
Exactly what these pledges mean is unclear. "Numerical targets," for example, is not defined. The U.S. uses the term to refer only to targets that would set market shares for foreign goods; that leaves the U.S. free to demand other types of numerical benchmarks, such as the number of Japanese automobile dealers that sell foreign cars.
The danger is that this type of ambiguity, as so often in the past, will trigger mutual animosity as each country accuses the other of failing to live by its promises. But both leaders need resolution: Mr. Clinton wants to reassure anxious currency traders that he can settle trade disputes with Japan without driving the dollar to lower levels; Mr. Hata needs to prove at home that his fragile coalition can govern. They have good reason to hammer out a series of accords that will give exporters a fair shot at Japanese consumers and thereby end spats over the bilateral trade deficit.

HEADLINE: Reagan Forced South Africa Sanctions Issue;
Yes, They Worked

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former senior South African Government official assigned the task in the 1960's and 70's of countering sanctions, and having recently completed a doctoral dissertation on the political and economic effect of United States sanctions against South Africa, I find myself on middle ground between Anthony Lewis ("Help From Outside," column, May 6) and Herman Nickel ("South Africa Sanctions Didn't Undo Apartheid," letter, May 15). 
 Mr. Lewis has ample reason to state that sanctions played a significant role in the demise of apartheid.
 He singles out, with sufficient justification, George Houser's American Committee on Africa as having played a significant role in making sanctions stick. As early as the mid-50's the committee had recruited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other luminaries to the anti-apartheid pro-sanctions cause in a campaign that eventually culminated in the adoption of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act by Congress in 1986.
Mr. Nickel, former United States Ambassador to South Africa, is equally justified in arguing that the "sanctions of the markets" may have had a more debilitating effect than officially imposed sanctions. But United States banks and other businesses pulled out of South Africa not out of their own free will, but under severe pressures from the American Committee on Africa and other anti-apartheid groups -- and, ultimately, the growing threat to their domestic business as Federal, city and state sanctions were adopted.
President F. W. de Klerk, in his historic February 1990 speech, which brought the bastion of apartheid crumbling down, offered all kinds of reasons for his change of heart and direction -- except sanctions. At the same time he moved at breakneck speed to fulfill to the letter all the conditions for the lifting of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act.
It was only two years later, after the repeal of this act, that Pik Botha, South Africa's Foreign Minister, would publicly admit the role that these sanctions played in Mr. de Klerk's dramatic transformation from apostle of apartheid to majority-rule reformer.
Pik Botha simply confirmed in public what South African officialdom had repeatedly and freely admitted to me privately in interviews for my study, scheduled to be published next fall as "In Sight of Surrender." While determining in exact measure the role sanctions played in the ultimate demise of apartheid proved to be an impossible task, I found beyond any doubt that United States and other punitive measures significantly dictated the form, substance, timing and pace of change in South Africa In this sense -- notwithstanding strenuous arguments to the contrary -- sanctions did work.

HEADLINE: Why Economic Systems Need Overhaul

 BODY:
To the Editor:
No political-economic system or theory is applicable at all times to all situations. That maxim might have leavened "Life's Hard? Blame the Market" (The Week in Review, May 8), on the confused economic scene. 
 The cold war obscured the fact that free market theories, used in defense of "capitalism," are ideologies as dogmatic as Marxism and only slightly more representative of reality. The constant need to "refine" theory and the astounding policy gyrations from Keynesianism to supply-side econom-
ics to monetarism to Keynesianism once again to remedy the failures of forecasts and policies that are based on these theories tell us that we are far from using a reliable analytical tool of social change.
However, you make an observation that points in the right direction: "In the 1950's and 1960's prosperity marched in lockstep with diminishing inequality." This happy state of affairs was largely due to a growing economy supplemented and guided by New Deal policies dedicated to equalization of social reward. The abandonment of these policies in favor of winner-take-all economics coincides with the start of social problems rooted in increasing inequality.
Due to changing goals, tastes and institutions, no social system will automatically serve equally well forever. Like a complex organism it will accumulate malfunctions that eventually destroy it. The Soviet Union's collapse is but the latest example, a system that failed out of rigid adherence to a theory divorced from reality. Free market capitalism will be no exception if it is observed as rigidly.
Government is charged with adapting a system to changing circumstance. Prudence dictates that such adapting be done with care, but done it must be. The health-care debate shows we must again abandon economic ideology to achieve the balance between social justice and efficiency that we once had.

HEADLINE: Big-Time Tourism Courts Vietnam

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Da Nang is now a stop for cruise ships. Cam Ranh Bay may get Club Med as a neighbor. And the Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the Hanoi Hilton by Americans held there during the Vietnam War, is really becoming a hotel.
The travel industry, which has been slowly discovering Vietnam as a tourist destination over the last few years, is scrambling to cut more deals there since President Clinton lifted the American trade embargo in February, making it easier for Americans to invest and travel. 
 Cruise lines are adding Vietnam's ports to their itineraries. Avis, National and Hertz are negotiating to rent cars there. Club Med wants to open a multimillion-dollar resort 30 miles north of Cam Ranh Bay, which, like Da Nang, was the site of an American military base.
And several hotel chains, including Radisson, Marriott and Choice, are talking to developers about opening hotels in Vietnam.
"It's estimated Vietnam needs as much as $40 billion to upgrade its infrastructure," said Jim Olson, senior vice president for Hawaii and Asia-Pacific development of Minneapolis-based Radisson. "With that kind of demand you'll have lots of businessmen, technicians and support personnel needing roofs over their head, in addition to the growing number of tourists."
To prevent "our competitors winding up serving our guests," as Mr. Olson put it, Radisson and potential partners from Thailand and Malaysia anticipate putting up hotels in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (the former Saigon), and Da Nang.
Avis is also moving aggressively. "We've had a lot of interest from investors who want franchises in Hanoi and Saigon," said Michael Collins, an international vice president, "and because we see good growth opportunities there, we're moving as quickly as we can to stay ahead of the pack."
Travel companies view Vietnam as an important link in an expected surge in travel to and within Asia.
Tourist receipts in the Asia-Pacific region will account for 30.6 percent of $527 billion in worldwide tourist revenue in the year 2,000, up from 15.1 percent in 1990, according to the World Tourism Organization. Air travel in the region is expected to grow 7.5 percent a year -- nearly twice the world average.
"All the statistics show that Vietnam tourism is on a faster growth track than any country in Asia, maybe even more than the rest of the world," said Chuck Y. Gee, dean of the School of Travel Industry Management at the University of Hawaii.
 
Competition Intensifying
 Some travel experts warn against over-optimism and note that Vietnam is far from ready to play host to visitors on a large scale. Still, the tourist companies elbowing to the front of the line envision a market that can average 10 percent annual growth in the number of visitors throughout the decade and generate much more than the $230 million that the Vietnamese Tourism Department said the country earned from 670,000 foreign visitors last year.
Nguyen Thi Hong, a press officer with the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations, said the country expected a million tourists this year and 1.6 million by the end of the century. While that is a far cry from Hong Kong's 8.9 million annual visitors, or Singapore's 6.4 million, it would be a vast leap from the 20,000 who visited Vietnam in 1986.
"We want to develop tourism, so we welcome everyone," Mrs. Hong said. Americans, she said, would receive a warm welcome.
Expatriate Vietnamese and American veterans of the Vietnam War are expected to account for much of the first wave of American visitors. Americans, no longer forced to obtain Vietnamese visas in Thailand and Hong Kong, can get them in three to five weeks by applying to the Vietnamese Mission in New York.
 
Credit Cards in the Future
 Lifting the embargo also ended the Treasury Department's $200 daily limit on expenditures by Americans in Vietnam. When the regulatory agencies work out details, prohibitions are also expected to be lifted on the use of credit cards issued by American banks.
Because only a quarter of Vietnam's estimated 22,000 hotel rooms are up to international standards, dozens of hotels are under construction, most as joint ventures between the Government and European and Asian hotel companies. A Singapore group, for example, is teaming up with Vietnam in a $33 million project to turn the Hoa Lo Prison into a 22-story hotel and office tower in Hanoi.
About $200 million is being invested in five golf courses. A few months ago, the Da Lat Golf Club opened the country's first 18-hole course. Memberships in the club, a $40 million joint venture with Hong Kong investors, range from $15,000 to $60,000.
Several United States airlines are awaiting permission to fly to Vietnam. Which carriers are awarded the routes will ultimately depend on Washington and Hanoi, but United, Continental and Northwest have already staked claims to routes. And Delta Air Lines, with few Pacific routes, recently agreed with Vietnam Airlines to coordinate flight schedules to an intermediate city in Asia that has not yet been designated.
Many cruise lines are considering offering Vietnam visits this year, while Royal Cruise, Holland America, Royal Viking, Orient Lines and Seven Seas Cruise Line may add more Vietnamese ports to cruises, some of which have been stopping at Vietnamese ports for several years.
Seabourn Cruise Line was so pleased with two sold-out cruises that called at Vietnam that it is adding two more next year. The Club Med 2, Seabourn's sailing ship, will have five weeklong Vietnam cruises. And starting Nov. 21, Pearl Cruises is offering a 17-day Vietnam trip that will include a 30-hour on-board seminar with Vietnamese officials and foreign investors in Vietnam.
Book publishers are getting into the act, too. Houghton Mifflin, Lonely Planet and Passport Books recently published new or revised guidebooks on the country.
While some experts say that the number of American tourists, drawn by the allure of a destination that has been off-limits for so long, will increase substantially after normalization of diplomatic relations -- something the travel industry hopes for no later than next year -- they also warn that some assertions about Vietnam's tourist potential are overblown.
 
Skepticism From Rambo
 "Some investors will strike it rich," said Dr. A. Terry Rambo, a specialist on Indochina at the East-West Center in Honolulu. "But everybody and his brother seems to want into Vietnam, for reasons not entirely economically rational."
"Vietnam only has a few good hotels and not much other infrastructure necessary to handle a big increase in visitors," said Dan Sullivan Jr., head of Collette Travel Service in Pawtucket, R.I., a major tour operator. "Our customers are not talking about visiting Vietnam."
Passport Books warns in its guidebook that the Vietnam tourism industry "is still unable, because of bureaucratic obstacles, to offer many of the different services that are readily available in the rest of Asia."
A group of French bankers recently discovered as much when they spent the night searching for a hotel in Hanoi because the Orient Hotel forgot that the group had made reservations. And the Vietnamese Investment Review, a journal published in Hanoi, recently reported that some Vietnam tour agencies sell package tours without having hotel rooms or rental cars available.
Charles Man, the owner of Sino-American Tours in New York's Chinatown, said it is hard to sell Vietnam as a single destination. "Because of the distance and cost," he said, "Vietnam visits have to be combined with other destinations," often Hong Kong and Bangkok.
Sino-American, Absolute Asia, South Sea Tour and Travel, All Adventure Travel, Myths and Mountains and Creative Travel are among the growing handful of companies offering tours that include Vietnam. Depending on length and stopovers, most tours from the United States run $1,800 to $5,000 a person, plus air fare. Visitors from Asian countries tend to spend less.
 
Trade First
 Tourism experts acknowledge that trade, rather than educational or leisure travel, will initially be more profitable, although they expect each to complement the other.
"Our best estimate is that there's likely to be $2 billion to $4 billion in trade between the two countries in the next couple of years," said Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington. About 90 percent of that is expected to come in the sale of American goods, she said, especially consumer products.
But for tourism to develop into a big business, the Vietnamese must have repeat customers.
"So unless Vietnam improves its inadequate infrastructure," Professor Rambo said, "all those rosy tourism projections are likely to prove disappointing."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A victim of I.B.M.'s big account shift, a small fledging agency believes in life after Big Blue.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE executives of the smallest, and newest, agency that I.B.M. will dismiss in the biggest account shift ever are gamely trying to pick themselves up, dust themselves off and start, well, not all over again, but somewhere that takes advantage of their brief, tempestuous tenure as an I.B.M. agency.
"It's just a fascinating piece of business to work on," Jane Newman, the executive vice president and director of strategic planning at the agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, said yesterday. 
 "I wouldn't have had it any other way," she added, agreeing that at least in this instance it was better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Merkley Newman was among the more than 40 agency casualties on Tuesday, when the International Business Machines Corporation rocked Madison Avenue by announcing that it would combine a myriad of accounts, with annual ad spending of $400 million to $500 million, at a single global shop, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide.
Merkley Newman was perhaps the most prominent of the victims because the agency was a mere fledgling -- only six months old, with billings of $40 million -- when I.B.M. unexpectedly selected it in October to share the estimated $100 million account of the IBM PC Company with the Paris office of a sibling agency, DDB Needham Worldwide. Merkley Newman, which survived a lengthy, competitive review to land the personal computer assignment, opened in April 1993 as a creatively focused spinoff of Doremus & Company, an Omnicom Group shop specializing in financial advertising.
The IBM PC Company account catapulted Merkley Newman into a prominence that was amplified by the paucity of success stories in the recession-racked advertising industry. It seemed like the quintessential Cinderella tale until the client abruptly rewrote the ending, taking back the glass slipper and giving a veritable shoe store's worth of footwear to Ogilvy.
"Of course, it's not good news," said Bruce Crawford, president and chief executive of Omnicom in New York. "On the other hand, it's not the end of the world. We didn't put them in business with the idea they work for I.B.M. They just go back to where we were before they hit this home run."
Mr. Crawford disputed reports in trade publications that Merkley Newman's ties to I.B.M. executives had been fraying even before the decision to hire Ogilvy.
"All I know is that I.B.M. told me they were totally happy," he said. "Merkley Newman was the innocent bystander when I.B.M. decided they were going to make agency changes and then, in the end, decided to consolidate with one agency."
And Ms. Newman disputed a report yesterday by Bloomberg Business News that the loss of the IBM PC Company account had placed the agency's survival in question.
"It's going to be fine," she said.
In the best industry tradition of making lemonade from lemons, Mr. Crawford echoed a suggestion of Ms. Newman's that Merkley Newman could exploit its experience with I.B.M. in seeking other clients.
"The whole process, if anything, has raised their profile and benefited them," Mr. Crawford said. "The fact is, a major corporation thought well enough of them to give them its business."
Ms. Newman said that because of the needs and demands of I.B.M., the agency had to "turn down a lot of opportunities in the technology area since Christmas."
"I love new business," she added, "and we haven't been doing enough of it."
Actually, Merkley Newman is a likely contender for two computer accounts, with billings estimated at $75 million, that require new agencies because Ogilvy must resign them to avoid conflicts as it begins work for I.B.M. One is product advertising for the Microsoft Corporation, handled by Ogilvy's Los Angeles office, and the other is the European account of the Compaq Computer Corporation, which uses Ammirati & Puris in New York as its American agency. Ogilvy will also withdraw from a review that Microsoft is conducting to name its first agency for a worldwide image-advertising account, with billings estimated at an additional $40 million.
Indeed, Ms. Newman said Merkley Newman had no plans to lay off any of its 80 employees, about half of whom were hired after the agency was awarded $50 million in IBM PC Company billings.
Apart from any other computer accounts the agency wins, a significant amount of the I.B.M. work remains to be done through the summer, including the production of a television campaign to accompany a series of print advertisements that Merkley Newman introduced only last week. Parry Merkley, the agency's president and creative director, flew to Los Angeles yesterday to oversee work on the commercials.
In addition, Merkley Newman retains billings that Ms. Newman estimated at $65 million for clients including Bankers Trust ; Casio, for watches and electronics products; Forbes magazine, for trade advertising; the International Wool Secretariat, for the American portion of its Woolmark branding account; Great Brands of Europe, to create the initial American campaign for Volvic, a still water imported from France; Harman International Industries, for its American stereo components account, handling brands like Harman Kardon and JBL, and Wordperfect, for corporate advertising.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says 17 Ran Murder Gang That Ruled Heroin Sales in Bronx

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
Seventeen people identified as gang members were indicted yesterday on murder and racketeering charges in what Federal prosecutors called a sophisticated operation that forced dealers to pay rent in order to sell drugs on street corners in the South Bronx.
For seven years in Mott Haven, prosecutors said, the gang, called C & C, controlled drug trafficking in the area by strictly enforcing where and during what hours it could occur. Those who did not cooperate, the authorities charged, were killed or tortured. 
 C & C, named for its founders, George Calderon and Angel (Cuson) Padilla, grossed more than $100,000 a week through an intricate extortion system, the authorities said. While other drug gangs made profits selling heroin and cocaine, they said, this one profited primarily through the intimidation and control of a seven-block area.
Mr. Calderon, investigators said, mixed brute force with careful gestures intended to gain the acceptance of the community. For example, they said, he set up a rule that forbade dealers to sell when children were on the way to school, and imposed limits on the number of customers congregating on a corner at any one time.
The arrests of C & C members have already led to upheaval among the area's drug sellers, investigators said. But they said it was not clear whether the arrests would lead to new violence as newcomers vied for position, or whether a disruption of the tribute reportedly exacted by the gang would alter the economics of the neighborhood's drug trade.
In Mott Haven yesterday, residents said that neither the price of heroin nor the torrid pace of sales had changed.
"You have leaders and you have followers," said a young man with close-cropped hair who lives on East 139th Street. "The followers have been trained to step up when the time comes. They know what to do."
The United States Attorney, Mary Jo White, said the indictment was only part of a larger plan to prosecute C & C, which she called one of the five largest gangs operating in Manhattan and the Bronx. A continuing investigation, she said, may lead to more charges against C & C members.
"We hope to obliterate them entirely, but that has not happened yet," Ms. White said.
Ms. White said prosecutors had evidence that since 1986, gang members killed 14 people who in some way obstructed their business, including Juan Cruz, a professional boxer who was murdered in 1992 after inquiring about the death of his brother Luis. An investigator added that the gang was suspected of committing dozens of other murders that would be harder to prove.
All 17 defendants were charged with murder, including Anna Rodriguez, 63, the mother of Mr. Calderon.
 
Sold Their Own Brand
 Those indicted yesterday were arrested over a period of many months, investigators said. Some, including Mr. Padilla, have been in jail for almost a year. Others were arrested in recent weeks. Ms. Rodriguez was the last to be taken into custody, arrested at her home at 647 East 138th Street in the Bronx at 5 P.M. Wednesday.
The gang was formed about 1987 by Mr. Calderon and Mr. Padilla, who were first cousins, according to the indictment. They sold their own brand of heroin, "D.O.A.," and groomed a cadre of 20 to 30 loyal lieutenants.
Investigators said that as the leaders of C & C devised a system of collecting protection money for street-corner drug sales in the area of Brook Avenue and East 139th Street, they found that extortion carried a far better risk-to-reward ratio than drug dealing. Although they and their gang members did not abandon heroin trafficking entirely, extortion became their main source of income, investigators said.
"If you wanted to deal in their area, you had to pay rent and abide by their rules," said a Federal agent involved in the case, who was reluctant to discuss many specific aspects of C & C's operations because the investigation is continuing.
 
Flat Weekly Rate
 "They would actually designate spots," said the agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It wasn't like you started selling and then paid them protection money. They would actually assign you the location."
Some drug suppliers paid C & C on a commission, increasing their rent as their income grew. But most paid a flat weekly rate. The price and arrangement varied from site to site, but a typical fee was a few thousand dollars a week, the agent said.
C & C's downfall, prosecutors said, can be traced to a feud that erupted in early 1992 between factions of the gang headed by its founders, Mr. Calderon, then 36, and Mr. Padilla, then 45.
At a meeting in early May, the Federal complaint says, Mr. Padilla told Ivan Rodriguez that Mr. Calderon was "bringing too much heat to C & C" and needed to be killed.
 
Sister Murdered in Car
 Mr. Calderon was shot to death as he emerged from a meeting with his parole officer on East 161st Street near Yankee Stadium on May 21, 1992. Mr. Rodriguez was accused of the murder today, and the Federal complaint charges Mr. Padilla with ordering it.
Two months later, Mr. Calderon's sister, Lourdes Cintron, was murdered as she sat inside a car parked on East 146th Street. Citing a confidential witness, prosecutors charge that Gregory Cherry, an ally of Mr. Padilla, shot Ms. Cintron and then ran down the street, jumped on a bicycle and rode away.
When a large wall mural was painted near East 138th Street later that year, it commemorated Mr. Calderon and his sister, with their names in large block letters, a law-enforcement official said.
Another law-enforcement official who helped investigate the gang said that it regularly used a room in a basement of a building near 139th Street to torture victims. "It was a torture chamber," the official said.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS TO MAINTAIN TRADE PRIVILEGES FOR CHINA'S GOODS;
Clinton Votes For Business

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to renew China's trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between America's global economic interests and Washington's self-image as the leading advocate of human rights. In the end, economic interests won the day. It wasn't really even close.
Faced with a choice between disrupting the vast American economic relationship with China or eating a little crow on his human rights promises, Mr. Clinton chose crow.
Many foreign policy experts feel that President Clinton made exactly the right decision. 
But look how he got there. During the campaign he denounced President Bush for his claim that engaging China rather than threatening it with trade sanctions was the best way to promote human rights and protect Washington's interests in Asia.
Once in office, Mr. Clinton followed up his campaign speeches with a concrete threat last May to withdraw China's "most favored nation" trade benefits if Beijing did not meet his human rights conditions by this June.
China fell short. But the President, instead of imposing sanctions, junked his threat and today gave what was surely the most eloquent defense of the Bush Administration's China policy ever uttered at the White House, including by President Bush.
In an almost surreal moment at his news conference today, Mr. Clinton seemed to be quoting Mr. Bush.
Mr. Clinton said: "To those who argue that in view of China's human rights abuses we should revoke M.F.N. status, let me ask you the same question that I have asked myself: Will we do more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated, or if our nations are engaged in a growing web of political and economic cooperation and contacts?"
In adopting this approach, Mr. Clinton was only acknowledging the underlying shift evident in all the industrial democracies: economic concerns have taken center stage in foreign affairs. This is the age of the Finance Minister.
It was the Treasury Department and the Chamber of Commerce whose institutional instincts dominated this decision, not the State Department and Human Rights Watch. And this is hardly unique. Economics dominate Japan policy, Asia policy and Latin American policy as well. The game of nations is now geo-Monopoly, and it is first and foremost about profits, not principles.
 
Putting Tiananmen Aside
 By making the decision he did today, President Clinton also closed a chapter in American foreign policy. It was called "Tiananmen Square."
Ever since the June 1989 shootings of democracy campaigners, watched live and in color by millions of Americans on CNN, Chinese-American relations have not been normal. Liberal Democrats, led by the Senate's majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, have demanded some punishment of China's leaders for the cruelty they showed toward dissidents who chose the Statue of Liberty as their symbol.
Hard-boiled strategists, led by Mr. Bush, argued that while the violence in Tiananmen Square was terrible, United States interests in China went beyond human rights -- to economics, security matters, nonproliferation of weapons and environmental cooperation -- and that it was this panoply of interests that had to guide the relationship, not a single-minded and probably futile drive to turn China into a democracy.
In renewing China's trade benefits despite its spotty record on human rights, President Clinton has effectively declared that foreign policy toward China will no longer be guided by those four days in June 1989 known as Tiananmen Square. It is over.
 
The Site of McDonald's
 Remember that famous Tiananmen intersection where that lone Chinese dissident stopped a tank in June 1989? It is now overseen by Ronald McDonald, who sits on a bench there outside the world's biggest McDonald's, bearing silent testimony to this new age of mercantile diplomacy. Like it or not, the nightmare of Tiananmen has given way to the daydream of an Asian gold rush.
From now on, human rights will be one among several interests shaping the American-Chinese relationship.
In many ways Mr. Clinton got steamrolled into this decision by his own vision.
From his first day in office, the President emphasized the importance of economic interests in post-cold-war foreign policy. He called on the nation to shift its gaze from across the Atlantic to the new economic frontiers of China, Japan and Latin America. He used the Oval Office to announce the sale of $6 billion in aircraft to Saudi Arabia.
Having so elevated economics, it became impossible for him to turn around suddenly and say he was going to abort Washington's relationship with the most lucrative, most expansive foreign market of them all by punishing China for not meeting his human rights demands.
Even if he had wanted to, Congress probably would not have let him.
For many lawmakers had been listening to what the President had to say. So had the American Chamber of Commerce. So had the U.S.-China Business Council, Boeing, AT&T, Wal-Mart and millions of Americans who invested money in mutual funds that were buying up stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong by the billions.
 
Yielding to Forest Fire
 Together this had produced a quiet sea change in the Congress and the public over the last two years on the question of China. Mr. Clinton was only yielding today to the forest fire he helped ignite.
Lawmakers came to understand the economic stakes their constituents had developed in the United States-China economic relationship -- whether it was consumers who gobbled up inexpensive Chinese sweaters at Kmart or exporters who gobbled up billion-dollar contracts from Beijing.
Three numbers told the story: $31 billion in Chinese exports to the United States and $9 billion in American exports to China, which are worth about 150,000 American jobs.
Why didn't Mr. Clinton recognize all this when he threatened to withdraw China's benefits last May? Because the President was acting both on his campaign promises, which none of his advisers had yet told him were unrealistic, and to satisfy liberal Democrats in Congress who were telling him that if he did not do something about China on his own, they would do it through legislation.
The President's basic mistake was overestimating the power of the Congressional lobby on human rights in China; they were not nearly as strong in Congress as they claimed to be, and were growing weaker with every business day.
 
Business Is Business
 In the end, the Chinese understood this political change better than anyone. They could see exactly what was going on in this country. They could read it on the editorial pages, they could hear it in the debates and they played on it deftly.
Consider today's perfectly timed story on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, which stated that Boeing is within weeks of cutting a deal to sell China more than 50 commercial airliners valued at $5 billion.
For an authoritarian regime, the Chinese understood a lot more about how to play American politics than the Clinton Administration understood about China's politics.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS TO MAINTAIN TRADE PRIVILEGES FOR CHINA'S GOODS;
A Policy Reversal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
President Clinton renewed China's favorable trade status today with virtually no conditions, and said he would abandon his effort to use trade as a lever to force Beijing to make progress on human rights.
While Mr. Clinton said there had been some improvement in human rights, he acknowledged that China's actions had fallen far short of the steps he set forth a year ago as conditions for renewing the trade privileges. But he said that as punishment he would do little more than prohibit imports of Chinese guns and ammunition. 
 Sounding anguished and defensive, the President said at a White House news conference that China's economic and strategic importance had grown so great that it would be unwise to impose the broad sanctions he had threatened.
"We have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy," Mr. Clinton said, "and it is time to take a new path toward the achievement of our common objectives." [Excerpts, page A8.]
Many American corporations and consumers welcomed his decision. [Business Day, page D1.]
But Mr. Clinton's announcement came after weeks of agonizing at the highest levels of the Administration, where officials had to contend with shifting signals from the Chinese Government and a last-minute campaign from rights advocates. While his decision had been expected, Mr. Clinton had not been expected to offer so frank an argument that his own approach had been misguided.
Congress could still seek to impose sanctions on China, as it sought unsuccessfully to do during the Bush Administration. But Mr. Clinton's remarks amounted to a call for an end to a rite that since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 has caused annual battles linking China's trade status to its human rights conduct.
Thus Mr. Clinton cast aside the executive order issued last year, when he became the first President to tie China's trade benefits to progress in the treatment of dissidents and political prisoners. He also cast aside his 1992 campaign language, when he accused President Bush of "coddling" Chinese dictators by blocking legislation that would have punished China for its human rights record.
While saying that China continues to commit "very serious human rights abuses," Mr. Clinton noted that Beijing had made some progress toward meeting his demands.
But he made clear his belief that broad trade sanctions had become too heavy a club to wave at a time when commerce between the two countries has grown to billions of dollars and accounts for tens of thousands of American jobs.
As a single punitive act, Mr. Clinton ordered a ban on imports of Chinese guns and ammunition, which amount to $200 million a year. He also said he would maintain the few Bush Administration sanctions that remain in effect, including prohibitions on shipments of United States weapons and other goods to the Chinese military.
But those measures will affect only a tiny fraction of the $31 billion in goods that China sold to the United States last year. Thus Mr. Clinton has sided with those in Congress and his Administration who warned against jeopardizing relations with Beijing.
Members of Congress who had called for firmer action expressed anger and disappointment. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said he planned to introduce legislation on trade sanctions that would "be more likely to encourage the Chinese Government to improve its practices on trade and human rights."
Human Rights Watch, which led the battle to block renewal of the trade benefits, voiced even greater disdain, accusing Mr. Clinton of "effectively removing all pressure on China to improve its human rights practices."
 
Business Groups Pleased
 But the decision was applauded by business groups, including the United States Chamber of Congress, which likened the policy of tying human rights to trade to "using a blunt instrument for brain surgery."
The decision by Mr. Clinton leaves intact the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of two decades ago that ties trade benefits for Communist countries to their immigration policies. But since it first won the privilege in 1980, that barrier has never prevented China from winning renewal of its "most favored nation" trade status, which allows it to send its exports to the United States at the lowest applicable tariffs.
Instead, Mr. Clinton's approach becomes roughly comparable to Washington's strategy toward other nations -- using diplomatic pressure but not holding trade hostage in efforts to make progress on rights.
Today, Mr. Clinton mentioned China's importance in putting pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program as one of the reasons he believed it wise to tread softly. He also cited China's role as the most populous country, with 1.2 billion people, and the third-largest economy.
 
The Vanity of Pressure
 But the fundamental reason he offered for the shift amounted to a repudiation of a year's worth of American pressure tactics. He said there would be "inevitably a reluctance" for China to act on rights issues "if it looks like every step that is taken, is taken under the pressure of the United States, some outside power making them do it."
Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, nevertheless suggested that the President's strong stance during the 1992 campaign and last year had "allowed us to achieve the progress that has been achieved this year" in focusing Beijing's attention on human rights.
Among the areas Mr. Clinton singled out as examples of progress were China's resolution of all emigration cases involving dissidents and its agreement to a plan to prevent goods produced with prison labor from being shipped to the United States.
But he used strong language to criticize China for its "arrest and detention of those who peacefully voice their opinions" and for its continued repression of religious and cultural traditions in Tibet.
 
A Round of Consultations
 Before making his announcement, just after 5 P.M., Mr. Clinton spent much of the day on the phone with Congressional leaders and foreign policy experts to gauge their reactions to the steps he might take. He also met for 30 minutes with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who urged the President to impose at least symbolic sanctions, Administration officials said.
Among those who welcomed Mr. Clinton's decision was Rep. Gary Ackerman, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. Ackerman said the separation of trade policy from China's human rights record "will promote American prosperity while enhancing our ability to advance American values and interests throughout the world."
But the minimal penalties Mr. Clinton imposed for what he described as China's "very serious human rights abuses" left labor leaders, human rights advocates and some Democratic lawmakers voicing scorn.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called the step "a disappointing setback to those who are risking their lives and liberty in China for the values and principles that America was created to advance."
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who joined Senator Mitchell in efforts to persuade Mr. Clinton to hew to a hard line, described her reaction as one of "great disappointment." She said she would join in efforts to overrule Mr. Clinton with legislation in the belief "that sanctions on China are in order."

HEADLINE: FLORIDA PREPARES NEW BASIS TO SUE TOBACCO INDUSTRY

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 26

 BODY:
The State of Florida is preparing the ground for a new attack on the tobacco industry that is intended to make it easier to hold cigarette manufacturers responsible for diseases associated with smoking.
Gov. Lawton Chiles today signed legislation that would allow the state to file a suit on behalf of all its Medicaid patients who smoke. Such class-action suits make it more difficult for cigarette companies to defend themselves by using the two main arguments they have successfully employed in cases brought by individual smokers. 
 In beating back every individual suit that has been brought against them, the companies have maintained that anyone who takes up smoking knowingly assumes all the risks associated with smoking and that those who sue did not conclusively prove that smoking caused their illnesses.
Such arguments are generally less successful when people sue as a class or group and show through broad-based demographic and health statistics that they were harmed by a product or activity. Class action suits have been brought successfully in recent years to recover damages in cases of exposure to asbestos and the use of breast implants.
Other states are likely to follow Florida's lead and the tobacco industry is concerned that Florida's action could make it vulnerable to new efforts to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.
The industry suffered a new public relations setback today when the chairman of the Council for Tobacco Research, which identifies itself as an independent research organization run by a board of distinguished scientists, told a Congressional subcommittee that the council had carried out research suggested by lawyers for tobacco companies. [Page A16.]
At a news conference this morning in Tallahassee, the state capital, Mr. Chiles made it clear that Florida planned to move promptly to seek reimbursement from tobacco companies for the costs of treating Medicaid patients with smoking-related health problems. "We're going to take the Marlboro Man to court," Mr. Chiles, who is running for a second term in office, promised today after signing the bill.
A report just released by the state of Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration concluded that smoking-related illnesses, including lung cancer and emphysema, have cost Florida taxpayers at least $1.2 billion in Medicaid payments since 1989. The state agency also estimates that tobacco products are responsible for the deaths of about 28,000 people in Florida each year, many of them elderly people who have recently retired to the state after living most of their lives elsewhere.
Under the new law, which the Florida Legislature approved last month without public discussion as an obscure amendment to a Medicaid fraud bill, the state is authorized to sue tobacco companies on behalf of its Medicaid patients who suffer from smoking-related illnesses. The law also allows the state to introduce new types of statistical evidence, while prohibiting cigarette manufacturers from using the assumption-of-risk defense, with which they have fended off legal challenges in the past.
The threat of the new legislation to tobacco companies lies not only in Florida's ability to act on behalf of the entire class of smokers on Medicaid but also in the state's more privileged legal position as a sovereign entity. "The state can change the legal criteria for a suit and that is what we have done," said Harold D. Lewis, general counsel of the state health care agency. "Once we are past the threshold of showing that a cigarette is a harmful product, we can use statistics rather than bring in all 650,000 Medicaid patients."
 
Suit by Mississippi
 Earlier this week, Mississippi filed suit against 13 tobacco companies seeking to hold them legally responsible for the health consequences of smoking.
"Mississippi filed its suit under existing common law, whereas Florida has changed the law to make it easier to bring this sort of case," said Jennifer Lew, managing lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project, an anti-smoking group based in Boston. "It basically tilts the playing field in favor of the state and streamlines the process of getting money from the tobacco companies."
Governor Chiles predicted during a telephone interview that the law, which goes into effect on July 1, will be the tobacco companies' undoing. "I think this will go through all kinds of legal tests, but at the end, I don't think the tobacco companies are going to be able to brag any longer that they have never paid out a dollar in a law suit," he said.
The law enables the state's Attorney General to use a formula based on each tobacco company's market share in collecting damages from cigarette manufacturers whenever they are found guilty of damaging the health of smokers. And it permits the state to sue for any additional harm to Florida residents stemming from fraudulent activity or other criminal violations by tobacco companies.
 
Power Granted Only to State
 The new law, the Medicaid Third Party Recovery Act, applies only when the state of Florida sues on behalf of its Medicaid patients. It would not change the standard of proof required when individual smokers or their families sue tobacco companies for damages. The law covers only economic damages incurred by the state and does not allow it to seek damages for the pain and suffering of patients.
Tobacco companies likely to be affected by the new law declined to comment on the measure. But the Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group based in Washington, attacked Florida's action as inherently unfair. "It is a travesty and poor public policy when legitimate businesses operating legally in the state of Florida are forced to the courthouse steps defenseless and guilty long before the first trial gavel is struck," the organization said in a statement today.
But anti-smoking advocates hailed Florida's action as an important blow against the tobacco industry and a model for the nation. Richard A. Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, said the new law was "the most important legislation ever adopted anywhere in the United States" on the issue of "holding cigarette manufacturers financially responsible for the health care costs their products and conduct produce."
The National Association of Attorney Generals said it had no information on how many other states are considering similar legislation. But Ms. Lew of the Tobacco Products Liability Project predicted that many other states would follow Florida's lead as news of the measure spreads.
Lawyers for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration described the state as an innocent third party.
Governor Chiles said: "Our authority comes from the same place as the authority to sue in breast implant, asbestos and a whole line of other cases. The state does not buy that package of tobacco, so we don't read the warning on the side. We just pay for the carnage."
The law was strongly opposed by Associated Industries of Florida, one of the state's principal business organizations. In a letter to Mr. Chiles last month, Jon L. Shebel, president of the state business group, complained that the legislation "is tailor-made to foster a cottage litigation industry" that would affect all businesses in the form of higher insurance premiums.
In an interview today, Mr. Shebel said he was also concerned that the legal principles contained in the law could easily be extended to other industries, like dairy, beef, sugar, pharmaceuticals and automobiles. He said the language of the statute is so broad that the state could conceivably hold sugar manufacturers responsible for tooth decay and obesity.
Mr. Chiles has already said he was willing to modify the language of the new statute so that it applied only to cigarette manufacturers. But Mr. Shebel said such a change would not be acceptable to Florida businesses and vowed to work for quick repeal.
"It is against the principles of American justice to take all the defenses away from somebody because you don't like them or their product, so that when they arrive at the courthouse steps they are are already guilty by innuendo," he said. "This law makes conviction automatic. There is just no way to defend yourself under this law and that is wrong."
But Mr. Chiles was not sympathetic to the complaints of the tobacco companies. "These are the most arrogant people who have ever lived," he said. "They cover up material they've had for 30 years saying how addictive cigarette smoking is and hide research that could have made smoking less harmful, and then they have the gall to put on this face and say they don't know if they have caused any harm."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
In a Dissonant White House, The Economics Team Hums

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Normally, conflict is what makes news. But what makes the way economic policy is developed in the Clinton Administration newsworthy is the remarkable absence of conflict among prominent officials with strong ambitions, personalities and opinions.
President Clinton's health and welfare policies are being put together in an atmosphere of continual bickering within the Administration, the unhappiness underlined by a spate of unauthorized disclosures by disappointed officials hoping to change preliminary decisions. Foreign policy seems so cacophonous at times that it is often unclear who stands where and what the President thinks. 
 The selection process for top appointments, like Supreme Court Justices, could hardly be more unruly.
But on economic policy, when sharp edges have arisen in internal discussions, they have generally been sanded down before anyone's feelings have been hurt and before they have become public. This has happened on some of the most politically explosive issues faced by the Administration: deficit reduction, environmental regulations, trade with Japan and China, and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The design of economic policy has gone smoothly in part because the Cabinet members involved have been willing to work as a team and because Mr. Clinton's chief assistant on economic matters, Robert E. Rubin, has been careful not to steal the thunder from the Cabinet secretaries. It is also a result of the President's own deep engagement in economic issues.
Two recent examples illustrate how potential snags have been overcome without bitterness.
In early March, top economic policy makers could not agree on whether President Clinton should invoke a tough trade law provision, called Super 301, that would allow him to impose trade sanctions quickly against Japan if it failed to open its markets.
Mr. Rubin, whose job is to coordinate the team, arranged for a session with the President. With all the top economic officials assembled, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, was given 10 minutes to present the case for Super 301, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, was allotted 10 minutes to argue against it.
Mr. Clinton came down on the side of Mr. Kantor, but no one's nose got out of joint. "When you're all around the room and the President hears all sides fairly presented and then makes a call, people don't go away grumpy," said Alan S. Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
 
No Undercutting Allowed
 The other example involves the drafting of the budget for the next fiscal year. Normally, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown would have been central players, since their influence over economic policy ranges far beyond matters directly before the departments they head.
But Mr. Rubin worried that other Cabinet secretaries might feel that those at the budget table would have an unfair advantage in getting money for their own departments. So at Mr. Rubin's suggestion, Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Reich and Mr. Brown stepped aside, except when budget items in their own departments were debated.
"We are all careful not to undercut each other," Mr. Reich said. "We understand that if one of us does, that is an open invitation for others to."
They coordinate their public relations as well as their policies. Early last week, anticipating correctly that the Federal Reserve Board would raise short-term interest rates, an action over which they have no control, the officials who deal with economic matters decided not to criticize the Fed.
Mr. Rubin said the system was successful "because everybody has come to see that it is in their self-interest to work together and not to go running off on their own to the President or the press every time there is a disagreement."
 
Working as a Team
 Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush basically delegated the making of economic policy, and it was usually to one person: David A. Stockman in Mr. Reagan's first term; James A. Baker 3d in his second term, and Richard G. Darman during the Bush Presidency.
Other senior officials, feeling frozen out, regularly sought back channels to the President to undermine the dominant figures and frequently bad-mouthed colleagues and their policies behind their backs.
Mr. Clinton criticized this process during his Presidential campaign and said he was determined to have his economic policy developed by a team. The first appointments he announced after the election were in the economics area: Mr. Bentsen; Leon E. Panetta, budget director; Ms. Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Mr. Rubin, head of a new coordinating structure called the National Economic Council.
"The success of our economic action agenda will depend not only on the talents of these people," Mr. Clinton said as he announced the appointments, "but also on their capacity to work together."
 
A Model From Truman Era
 Mr. Clinton said he was modeling the National Economic Council on the National Security Council, a White House agency dating from the Truman Administration that is charged with coordinating the Government's foreign and military policy. And, expressing his admiration for the foreign policy process of the Bush Administration, he said he wanted Mr. Rubin to function as Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, did: working more or less behind the scenes to collect the views of other officials in the Government and then offer them to the President in a coherent fashion.
By all accounts, that is what Mr. Rubin has done. Most economic issues are simply decided within one department or another. The Treasury, for example, has sole jurisdiction over the question of the value of the dollar, and, despite his years of experience on Wall Street, Mr. Rubin has not intervened. But he serves as a filter for the big issues that involve more than one department or agency. The National Economic Council is less a structure than a process of funneling big decisions through him.
He is clearly the most influential member of the President's economic team. But he has been so careful to stay in the background that not one American in a thousand would recognize him.
Mr. Rubin proved his mettle early on. Just before Christmas in 1992, the main economic advisers went to Little Rock, Ark., for their first long meeting with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Rubin organized the trip and decided who would make presentations to the President-elect on what. But he stayed in the shadows and made no presentation himself.
"Bob is not a high-profile fellow," observed Mr. Bentsen, who said he would never have joined the Clinton Administration if anyone else had been given the job Mr. Rubin took. The two have known each other for years. Mr. Rubin, who was co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, was the administrator of Mr. Bentsen's blind trust when Mr. Bentsen was a Senator from Texas.
 
Clinton's Grasp of Issues
 Mr. Rubin, who hardly ever makes public statements or goes on television, said he understood that it was important for Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Panetta and others to be the public spokesmen. "If I were in competition with them for the limelight," he said, "this thing wouldn't work."
Mr. Rubin's task of encouraging teamwork was eased somewhat because Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta, veterans of Congress, were used to working in a group. "The National Economic Council is the equivalent of caucusing with a group of members on your committee who represent different viewpoints," said Mr. Panetta, who, as a Congressman from California, was chairman of the House Budget Committee.
But what really drives the process, Mr. Rubin and others agreed, is Mr. Clinton's grasp of economic issues. The President himself makes the big decisions on economics.
On the most important economic and political question of the year last year -- how much deficit reduction to seek -- the advisers disagreed. Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta, among others, sought much deeper cuts in the budget than did Mr. Reich, Mr. Brown or Ms. Tyson. Mr. Rubin presented both sides without taking a position himself. The President decided in favor of the bigger cuts.
"He understands this; he really does," Mr. Rubin said. "I don't mean he just read a paper on some topic or other. He has a feel for these economic issues."
 
Making It Look Easy
 That helps explain why economic policy seems to run more smoothly than foreign policy in this Administration and why the reverse was true under Mr. Bush.
"It's clear," said Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, "that there's a mirror image in their interests and in their allocation of time."
Mr. Boskin said that while he objected to much of the Clinton economic program, he admired the way it was developed. But he said he was not sure that the Clinton process could be transferred to another Administration with different personalities.
Walter Williams, a professor of public affairs at the University of Washington in Seattle and an expert on the organization of the White House, agreed. The process can only work, he said, when the President's style is to hear different points of view. On economic policy, he said, Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush wanted the staff to present them with a finished product.
And Labor Secretary Reich offered another reason that the Clinton system might not work in other circumstances. "It's easy for trust to develop and to avoid leaks and finger-pointing and back-stabbing when the economy is going well," he said. "The real test will come when things are not going well."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Call: Avoid Isolating China

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's remarks by President Clinton on the renewal of China's status as a favored trade partner:
Our relationship with China is important to all Americans. We have significant interests in what happens there and what happens between us. 
 China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and a veto in the U.N. Security Council. It is a major factor in Asian and global security. We share important interests, such as in a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and in sustaining the global environment.
China is also the world's fastest-growing economy. Over $8 billion of United States exports to China last year supported over 150,000 American jobs.
I have received Secretary Christopher's letter recommending, as required by last year's executive order -- reporting to me on the conditions in that executive order. He has reached a conclusion with which I agree, that the Chinese did not achieve overall significant progress in all the areas outlined in the executive order relating to human rights, even though clearly there was progress made in important areas, including the resolution of all emigration cases, the establishment of a memorandum of understanding with regard to how prison labor issues would be resolved, the adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and other issues.
Nevertheless, serious human rights abuses continue in China, including the arrest and detention of those who peacefully voice their opinions and the repression of Tibet's religious and cultural traditions.
The question for us now is, given the fact that there has been some progress but that not all the requirements of the executive order were met, how can we best advance the cause of human rights and the other profound interests the United States has in our relationship with China?
I have decided that the United States should renew Most Favored Nation trading status toward China. This decision, I believe, offers us the best opportunity to lay the basis for long-term sustainable progress in human rights and for the advancement of our other interests with China.
Extending M.F.N. will avoid isolating China and instead will permit us to engage the Chinese with not only economic contacts but with cultural, educational and other contacts, and with a continuing aggressive effort in human rights -- an approach that I believe will make it more likely that China will play a responsible role, both at home and abroad.
I am moving, therefore, to delink human rights from the annual extension of Most Favored Nation trading status for China. That linkage has been constructive during the past year, but I believe, based on our aggressive contacts with the Chinese in the past several months, that we have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy, and it is time to take a new path toward the achievement of our constant objectives. We need to place our relationship into a larger and more productive framework.
In view of the continuing human rights abuses, I am extending the sanctions imposed by the United States as a result of the events in Tiananmen Square. And I am also banning the import of munitions, principally guns and ammunition, from China.
I am also pursuing a new and vigorous American program to support those in China working to advance the cause of human rights and democracy. This program will include increased broadcasts for Radio-Free Asia and the Voice of America, increased support for nongovernmental organizations working on human rights in China, and the development, with American business leaders, of a voluntary set of principles for business activity in China.
I don't want to be misunderstood about this. China continues to commit very serious human rights abuses. Even as we engage the Chinese on military, political and economic issues, we intend to stay engaged with those in China who suffer from human rights abuses.
The United States must remain a champion of their liberties.
I believe the question, therefore, is not whether we continue to support human rights in China but how we can best support human rights in China and advance our other very significant issues and interests. I believe we can do it by engaging the Chinese.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The actions I have taken today to advance our security, to advance our prosperity, to advance our ideals, I believe are the important and appropriate ones. I believe, in other words, this is in the strategic economic and political interests of both the United States and China, and I am confident that over the long run this decision will prove to be the correct one.

HEADLINE: Proposal Gains to Impose Antitrust Rules on Insurers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Efforts to modify the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts insurance companies from antitrust rules, advanced yesterday when Representative Jack Brooks, a Democrat of Texas, said he would introduce such a bill when Congress returned from the Memorial Day holiday.
Mr. Brooks, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a longtime critic of the insurance industry, has already gained the support of many insurance companies, consumer groups and the Justice Department. Supporters say the bill will produce more diversity in the prices and types of insurance policies. 
 Some insurers, including small- and medium-sized companies represented by the National Association of Independent Insurers, remain opposed to the proposal.
 Mr. Brooks said the bill he planned to introduce would revoke the insurance industry's 49-year-old exemption from antitrust laws except for activities where cooperation among companies is thought to help make insurance more widely available.
For example, insurers could continue to use similar policy forms and band together to insure large risks like nuclear reactors. States could continue to require companies to join pools to insure customers who might be shunned by individual companies.
An important part of Mr. Brooks's proposal would change the way insurance companies analyze data about claims and costs to set their prices. Companies could continue to share information about losses, but they would have to stop using industry-owned organizations to make estimates about inflation, interest rates, overhead costs and legal trends. Rather than use industry-run organizations, insurers would be required to make estimates themselves or buy them from independent companies.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop Again

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits declined by 1,000 last week, less than expected but enough to drop the claims level to the lowest in a month, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said a seasonally adjusted 366,000 people filed initial claims in the week that ended last Saturday, down from 367,000 the previous week. It was the second consecutive decline and the lowest number of claims since April 30. 
 A somewhat larger decline was predicted by most economists as warmer weather creates demand for additional workers in some seasonal industries. Analysts say the nation's job picture is steadily improving.
The four-week moving average of initial claims was up to its highest level in more than three months. The Labor Department said the average rose 7,500, to 366,750, from the previous week's revised figure of 359,250. That was the highest level since Feb. 19, 1994, when frigid winter weather forced workers off jobs across the Northeast and Midwest.
The four-week average was higher because two weeks of declines followed two weeks of bigger increases.

HEADLINE: Solzhenitsyn Flies Home, Vowing Moral Involvement 88

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, May 26

 BODY:
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn flew away today from the nation that was his home in exile for nearly two decades. In an hourlong exchange with reporters at the airport, he paid tribute to Vermont, where he was granted the privacy to write, and promised to "take an active part in the social life" of his native Russia.
"We were very friendly with the Vermonters, and the people and the environment -- all of that put together -- created for me 18 years of so intense creative work that really I could never have dreamed that this would be possible," he said. "This was the most creative period of my life, the most productive period of my life, and of course I leave with much emotion." 
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn, his 20-year-old son Stephan, and his wife, Natalia, left Anchorage International Airport aboard a regularly scheduled Alaska Airlines flight to Magadan and Vladivostock shortly before 1 P.M. Magadan, a city in Russia's Far East, served as an administrative center for the Russian prison system that the author has painstakingly documented.
[Mr. Solzhenitsyn arrived Friday in Magadan, Russia. He stooped and touched the ground with both hands after emerging from the Alaska Airlines plane, The Associated Press reported.
["I come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried," he said. "Today, in this period with so much political change, people easily forget these millions of victims."]
 He planned a slow journey across Siberia by train to his new home in Moscow, 4,200 miles to the west.
Mr. Solzhenitsyn, 75, said he wanted to make a moral and spiritual difference in Russia. Speaking in Russian, with his son interpreting, he said he did not intend to take any position in government.
 
A New View of the Gulag
 "But, I will take an active part in the social life of Russia," he said. "And in so much as my voice will be heard, I would like to have some influence on the recovery of Russia's health from the most grave situation in which Russia finds itself today."
Asked why he chose to travel to Moscow through Alaska and Siberia, he referred to his life in internal exile. "Siberia I only saw from the window of a prison convoy car, with the exception of one short moment," he said.
Russia's current problems were also on his mind. "On a basic level, the first thing in my opinion as a writer, the most important thing," he said, is that the former atmosphere be cleared -- be aired out.
"For example, in Germany there was a long period of de-Nazification, not just in a legal or judicial sense, but in a spiritual and in a moral way. But in the U.S.S.R.," he went on, "none of this happened at all.
"The atmosphere remains heavy, stained with Communism. And upon all of that came the onslaught, really th epidemic, of incredibly fast, quick, rampant capitalism, in which some people grew incredibly rich very soon; an enrichment of a few, not by production, but rather really by stealing from others.
"But before we can get to economic problems, of which there are mountains and mountains, and talk about government, we must first clear the spiritual atmosphere, without doing which we would simply suffocate."
 
Thanks to Vermont
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn was a victim of the prison camps himself, serving eight years as a political prisoner after criticizing Stalin in letters to a friend.
His experiences led to his novel "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich." He was labeled a traitor for exposing Stalin's repressive rule in "The Gulag Archipelago" and was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, spending two years in Europe and the last 18 in Cavendish, Vt.
Mr. Solzhenitsyn thanked the people of the United States, particularly his neighbors in Vermont, for providing him with a home.
"All of the 20 years that I lived in the West I was stateless," Mr. Solzhenitsyn said at the news conference. "I would not take the citizenship of any other country. Now, as I return to Russia, I have a passport."
The author withdrew a red passport from his khaki jacket and, smiling broadly, said: "Unfortunately, it still says Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But this is a Russian passport."

HEADLINE: Back to Business on China Trade

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Now that President Clinton has decided to keep China in the family of America's most favored trading nations, despite that country's human rights violations, sighs of relief are coming from much of Corporate America and from many individuals -- certainly those who think about China as a source of inexpensive consumer goods.
China is booming. And that means big business for American companies like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which together sold $2 billion in aircraft to China last year, and AT&T, which describes China -- not the United States -- as its fastest-growing market. These companies were loud voices in the lobbying effort for an extension of China's trade privileges.
 
 
China Is 'Critical for Us'
 "If 'most favored nation' had not been extended, we would have been impacted greatly; it is critical for us to be successful in China," said Susan Berman, a spokeswoman for AT&T, which expects to collect $3 billion in revenues from its China operations by the year 2000, up from $500 million last year and $250 million in 1992. 
 Alongside the multinationals, there is the ordinary American. Without realizing it, he or she may have obtained a few more dollars in selling the family car because of the China market. This is because Chinese families who are affluent enough to buy cars are putting upward pressure on American car prices. The Chinese spent $600 million last year to purchase American-made passenger vehicles, many of them used cars, the Commerce Department reported.
 But American exporters are not the primary winners. The China boom has opened up a market for American products, but it is not a big one yet. Exports rose to a modest $8.7 billion in 1993 from $3.9 billion in 1985. Most of that was the commercial aircraft and the telecommunications equipment that AT&T is shipping to China to build a modern telephone network there, one in which AT&T already has an ownership stake.
 
 
A $150 Million Investment
 "Over the next 24 months, we will invest $150 million in projects that we know of now," said Andrew Myers, an AT&T spokesman, "and we have a Chinese work force of 800, and that will triple over the next two or three years."
The much bigger business, for the moment, is imports. While China shipped only $3.8 billion worth of products to the United States in 1985 -- roughly equivalent to what it bought from this country -- by last year Chinese shipments had jumped to $31.5 billion, or 3.5 times the level of exports. There was some Chinese machinery and raw materials in the mix, but for the most part, Americans purchased Chinese toys, bicycles, shoes, kitchenware and, especially, fabric and clothing.
"If you look at the imbalance of imports over exports, there is more imbalance with China than with any other country," said Thea Lee, a trade expert at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "Even our trade imbalance with Japan is less."
Nearly 15 percent of all textiles and apparel shipped to the United States now comes from China, said Jay Meltzer, a textile analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. That does not please some American textile manufacturers, and they were not among the lobbyists pushing for the extension of trade benefits for China.
But American retailers were. They buy from China about 6 percent of all the clothing sold in stores across the country, especially inexpensive clothing. A few companies, among them Levi Strauss, are cutting back imports from China out of concern for human rights. But they are far outnumbered by companies like the Gap, J. C. Penney, Sears, Roebuck and Kmart, which applauded Mr. Clinton's action yesterday.
The President did, however, cut back the amount of clothing and fabrics that China can export to the United States, even as a favored nation. If the President had not extended China's status as a "most favored nation," tariffs would have shot up for virtually all Chinese imports.
 
 
 
View Held by Retailers
 And if that had happened, would these retailers have turned back to American manufacturers for the same goods?
If the President had canceled China's trading privileges, would the higher tariffs have made American manufacturers competitive with the Chinese?
Probably not, Mr. Meltzer at Goldman, Sachs said, reflecting the view held by most retailers.
"The fact is that there are so many other low-wage countries poised to ship to us, that the goods now coming from China would come from another country," he said.
"Let's say the China price is 100 and now it will go up to 125. American manufacturers would still have to compete at 100. If American retailers did not get cheap dresses from China, they would get them from Mexico, or, hey, Vietnam."

HEADLINE: Assessing the Odds for Carter Hawley's Overhaul

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
There are two schools of thought on Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.: One is that the West Coast department store operator is destined to crawl back into bankruptcy protection and the other is that it will be one of the decade's most remarkable corporate turnarounds.
The dubious, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service among them, point to the duct tape holding together the carpeting in many of the company's 83 stores. And that is only the most obvious sign that the retailer, whose three chains, the Broadway, Emporium and Weinstock's, which operate mostly in the West and Southwest, is overdue for a stem-to-stern overhaul that will require hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 They note that it shoulders more than $1 billion in debt, that its cash flow is really more of a trickle, and that its lenders have waived or amended the requirements of its credit agreements at least six times in the last 12 months.
 
'All the Tools They Need'
 Even David M. Schulte, a general partner in the Zell/Chilmark Fund, the $1 billion investment fund that brought Carter Hawley out of bankruptcy in 1992, concedes that that the future of the $2 billion-a-year retailer, based in Los Angeles, is less than clear-cut. "Right now, they have all the tools they need for the foreseeable future," he said. "If they make their plan, the company should be self-financing. Of course, I have no idea if they will make their plan."
Nevertheless, he and the other optimists have stubbornly pinned their hopes on David L. Dworkin, the soft-spoken, enigmatic merchant who has weathered a little more than a year at the company's helm, and his team of executives. "I think he's an absolute genius," said Daniel D. Barry, a retail analyst at Merrill Lynch whose doubts about Carter Hawley evaporated after a long conversation with Mr. Dworkin. "You haven't seen it in the numbers yet, and you haven't really seen it in the stores yet. But you're going to."
Analysts expect that sales of the company, which is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings today, will be flat compared with the corresponding period last year, largely because of four stores that are still closed as a result of earthquake damage. Cash flow is also expected to match last year's, although the net loss may increase.
Other news this week was no more comforting. Carter Hawley said two senior merchants would depart as part of a move toward greater "lateralization," the term Mr. Dworkin uses to describe efforts to flatten a previously rigid hierarchy. But they leave the company with only one merchant, Mr. Dworkin, in its senior ranks.
The high hopes for Carter Hawley take root in Mr. Dworkin's track record at a British retail chain called BHS that many had written off as moribund before he arrived in late 1989. Six months later, sales had jumped about 20 percent because of a few simple if unorthodox changes the upstart Yank imposed.
His fans are betting he can pull off the same sort of miracle at Carter Hawley. In fact, many of the strategies he has put into effect were first tested at BHS, where he shook up a hidebound corporate culture and slaughtered several sacred cows. "We've been blowing up the place," Mr. Dworkin is fond of saying about the changes at Carter Hawley.
Or as his right-hand woman, Elayne M. Garofolo, executive vice president of sales promotion and marketing, says, "The best thing about this job is that the only rule we have is not to do anything the way it was done before."
The experiment that Mr. Dworkin's team is most proud of is the Home Dome, an enormous tent set up in the Northridge area of Los Angeles, on the site of a Broadway store that collapsed during the earthquake. The store was one of the company's most productive, and Home Dome, built to supply customers replacing goods damaged in the quake, has been an unexpected home run for Carter Hawley.
But Carter Hawley's problems are more extensive than those of BHS. While BHS needed a clearly defined merchandising strategy, its stores did not require the immense investment in physical refurbishing that Carter Hawley's stores do. The 83 Carter Hawley stores have worn carpeting, chipped cosmetics cases and whole departments that are so off the beaten path that customers need a road map to find them. They will need between $500 million and $600 million to refurbish.
 
Facing Big Competitors
 Nor did BHS have to confront the level of feisty competition that Carter Hawley faces in the California market, where Robinsons-May, Macy's, Bullock's and Nordstrom are all clamoring for a pool of customers that shrank during the recession.
Moreover, while retailers consolidate to achieve greater efficiencies and buying power, Carter Hawley will have difficulty matching the advantages of competitors with six or seven times its revenues. In fact, its potential as an acquisition target has helped support its shares at an unusually high multiple despite its many challenges and a disappointing performance last year.
Mr. Dworkin believes Carter Hawley's critics are shortsighted. "There's a surprising naivete about our situation here," he said. "In England, everyone understood that a turnaround wasn't going to happen overnight -- that things might get worse before they got better."
He predicts that Carter Hawley will begin to show signs of a turnaround by late 1995 or early 1996, once new strategies have taken hold and about 30 or so stores have been remodeled.
The company is making extensive use of demographic research to find niches that the Robinsons-Mays of the world may overlook. Ms. Garofolo has mined the data base linked to Carter Hawley's proprietary credit cards and spent almost $2 million to understand who the company's customers are.
Mr. Dworkin estimated that as much as 70 percent of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- Ebitda, a measure of cash flow used to gauge the performance of highly leveraged companies -- reflect "quick wins," quick, low-cost improvements in displays and the location of merchandise. These changes are intended to punch up a store's business until the company starts a full remodeling project.
 
Away With Furniture
 Carter Hawley has pared whole categories of merchandise like furniture and consumer electronics, which took up floor space but never were blockbusters. The five least-profitable categories occupied roughly a third of total space but generated only 11 percent of profits. "What I wish people would look at is that we've managed not to lose sales, even though we've just wiped out several categories," Mr. Dworkin said.
Mr. Dworkin has also jettisoned almost half of the company's traditional suppliers in hopes of making Carter Hawley a more significant customer for the remaining vendors. A new cast of characters populates the company's executive offices, some of whom worked with Mr. Dworkin when he was at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bonwit Teller.
Carter Hawley will need sales of at least $150 per square foot before it can finance capital expenditures without going to the market for additional help. Last year, its sales per square foot were $138, markedly lower than at competitors.
Both Mr. Dworkin and Mr. Schulte of Zell/Chilmark said the nearly $300 million in new financing raised last year, combined with improved cash flow, would cover capital needs through 1996 -- if the company can also meet projections in its business plan.
That's a big if, considering that Carter Hawley projected in late 1992 that it would produce $96 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year and instead served up a little more than $22 million.
But Mr. Schulte said the forecasts in the disclosure statement Carter Hawley filed when it emerged from bankruptcy had been radically revised. He argued that the original projections, drawn up by the company's old management team, were based on "faulty premises and a business plan with no intellectual status."
The company is amending its credit line, supplied by the GE Capital Corporation, to reflect more realistic targets, Mr. Schulte said.
"David & Company are responsible for the business, and we're responsible for giving them what they need to do it," he said. "It's our job to make sure the resources are there, and we're in this for the long pull."

HEADLINE: Group Urges Tough Limits on Logging in Southeast

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 26

 BODY:
As the Forest Service reassesses policies on logging on public lands, a report released here contends that recreation and tourism in the forests bring in far more money than timber harvests.
The report by the Wilderness Society recommends that the Forest Service strictly limit logging in the 3.8 million acres in six national forests that it manages in five states in the Southeast. 
 The study said the average annual gross timber sales in the area totaled $32 million compared with $379 million in gross economic benefits associated with recreation and tourism.
"It is clear that current management, which continues to emphasize timber production and associated programs at the expense of biodiversity and recreation, is out of step with economic realities in the area," said Peter Morton, a forest economist who conducted the environmental group's study.
 
Logging on Private Land
 The public land in the region amounts to only 10 percent of the region's timber producing property. A vast majority of the forest land is privately owned and is subject to few if any restrictions on logging. But Robert Slocum, the executive vice president of the North Carolina Foresters Association, said the industry was concerned about the conservation group's study and recommendations. Many in the industry fear that any restrictions on public land are eventually imposed on private land.
At Sparks Lumber Mill, a family-owned operation in Ellijay, Ga., 120 miles north of here, Sandy Sparks, the general manager and co-owner of the mill which employs 31 people and has contracts with 120 loggers, said, "We would be devastated if they cut back more and so would the local poultry industry, which buys everything from wooden pallets to building lumber to sawdust for the floors of their chicken coops from us."
Robert Lentz, the deputy regional forester for the Southeast, said the agency welcomed the group's study. He said the group's study dovetailed with the agency's new mandate from the Clinton Administration to reassess regulations, viewing the entire region, its wildlife and biodiversity as an ecosystem rather than a timber production resource.
 
Drawbacks of Tourism
 He said the agency was hearing more and more about eco-tourism, which he said was a valid part of the economies of communities in the region. But, like the industry officials, Mr. Lentz also contended that the region needed a diversified economy rather than one that depends on a single sector. He also pointed out that tourism and recreation could also cause environmental damage in forests as troublesome as that caused by logging operations.
The Wilderness Society report, called "Charting a New Course: National Forests in the Southern Appalachians," also comes at a time of rising demand for timber from the Southeast because of new restrictions on logging in the vast public lands in the West and Northwest. There, efforts to save endangered species have severely limited the private and public acres available for logging, said Thomas J. Straka, a forest economist at Clemson University.
"Can the South and Southeast make up for the shortfall in supply from the West?" Mr. Straka asked. "No, it can't. But the price of lumber is up and they are going to harvest timber more and more on private land if they can't do it on public land here to try to meet the demand for lumber."

HEADLINE: Alzheimer's To Be Focus Of New Effort

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
A major private center for research into Alzheimer's disease will be established at Rockefeller University in Manhattan to refocus the nation's efforts against the debilitating condition, scientists and philanthropists said today.
Zachary Fisher, a prominent figure in the real estate and construction industries, and David Rockefeller, the executive committee chairman of Rockefeller University's board of trustees, said they would together donate $5 million to establish a major center that would combine basic research with clinical treatment of Alzheimer's. 
 The effort would also involve the bringing together of many of the world's leading experts on Alzheimer's disease to help develop a longterm, national research strategy. Up to now, the research has been scattered among many institutions, including 28 comprehensive Alzheimer's research and treatment centers sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.
The initiative's sponsors said they hoped that this public-private initiative would make it possible within a decade to delay the onset of the disease and slow its progress.
 
Progress in 5 Years
 Dr. Paul Coleman of the University of Rochester Medical Center, an Alzheimer's researcher who attended the meeting at which the announcement was made today, said that scientists believed that they would first be able to slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease before they discovered a way to stop or reverse it.
"In five years, we want to be able to delay onset of the disease by five years, and in 10 years we want to delay the onset by 10 years," Dr. Coleman said. "This is a goal we believe is technically feasible."
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who attended the luncheon meeting, said, "This is an example of what we need -- the ability of the Government and private citizens to bring together the best minds on a problem." It costs between $30,000 and $50,000 a year to care for one Alzheimer's patient, she said, an amount that can bankrupt many families.
In a pitch for changing the health insurance system, Mrs. Clinton said that much existing insurance coverage for Alzheimer's was inadequate because many necessary services were not covered, the cost of longterm care was often excluded and many policies had lifetime limits on benefits that could leave people uncovered. "We have an economic imperative to solve the problem of Alzheimer's disease," she said.
Alzheimer's is a lethal, progressive, incurable brain disease that slowly destroys the mind. Its cause is unknown and there is no effective therapy for most patients. About 4 million Americans have Alzheimer's, which kills more than 100,000 each year and costs the nation up to $80 billion annually for care and lost wages, experts said.
 
'Never Enough Money'
 The Federal Government will spend $310 million this year on Alzheimer's research, up from $47 million five years ago.
"For a disease like this, there is never enough money," Mr. Fisher said. "It's time for a determined and national assault on the scourge of Alzheimer's disease." To sponsor the new center, Mr. Fisher agreed to give $2.5 million, to be matched with money from a fund provided to the university by Mr. Rockefeller.
The announcement by Rockefeller University, on the Upper East Side, followed the first of three symposiums to be held this year to draft a national research policy on Alzheimer's. These meetings of leading scientists, sponsored by the Mr. Fisher's Fisher Medical Foundation and the Federal aging institute, are intended to produce a national blueprint for Alzheimer's, as called for by Congress, participants said. This strategy will help guide national plans for research, for developing and testing treatments, and for dealing with patient care.

HEADLINE: Ex-Leaders of '89 Uprising Send a Petition to Beijing

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 26

 BODY:
A group of former student leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising petitioned the Communist Party leadership today to begin healing the national wounds from the lethal confrontation.
In defiance of the current clampdown on dissent in China, the seven young dissidents called upon the country's leaders to lift the harsh indictment that branded the pro-democracy students as guilty of "riot and counter-revolutionary rebellion." 
 "The movement was a nationwide, popular, patriotic movement with young students as its main body," the petition said. "Within the movement, we consistently adhered to the principles of peace, reason and nonviolence."
They termed the criminal verdict "unjust" and said it "should be reassessed as soon as possible."
"Untying this knot in the people's heart will help heal up the social contradictions," the signers said in the document that was distributed to news agencies in Beijing. "We sincerely wish that the Government can courageously take this sensible step for the sake of the people's interests and the nation's future."
 
Deng Bars the Issue
 The reversal of the Tiananmen verdict is a delicate issue that the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, whose health is in serious decline, has decreed should never be revisited. Mr. Deng has acknowledged his part in ordering the military crackdown, and many Chinese intellectuals see a reversal of the verdict against the students as a test of whether political reform will return to China with the decline of Mr. Deng's power.
Though the petition did not mention the decision by President Clinton to formally renew China's low-tariff trading access to the American market under the "most favored nation" rules, it underscored the reality that political repression is still the rule in China five years after the Communist Party forcibly put down the largest rebellion in its history.
Most of the former students who signed the petition were released from prison with the help of American pressure exerted during the annual renewals of China's trading status.
In their three-point petition, the young democracy campaigners, all of whom served time in prison for their actions, called upon the National People's Congress, the ceremonial Parliament under the Communist Party, to provide "generous compensation" to the families of those who were killed when tanks and machine guns smashed the student and worker barricades in the center of Beijing.
 
Aide May Be Sympathetic
 The petition is addressed to the Parliament's standing committee, which is headed by Qiao Shi, a one-time chief of China's security forces who is regarded by some analysts as being sympathetic to reversing the Tiananmen verdict.
"On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the 1989 democracy movement, " the one-page document says, "we are exercising our political rights granted to us by law in making a three-point petition to the country's highest legislative body."
In stanching all such political dissent this spring, the authorities have stressed the national imperative of maintaining "social stability" as China enters a crucial stage of the economic reforms begun by Mr. Deng 15 years ago. Unemployment and widespread labor unrest have shaken the confidence in the leadership.
The petitioners said, "We, as well as the Government, wish to see a stable social environment."
Six of the seven signers were on China's most-wanted list after the military crackdown on June 4, 1989. The seven are Wang Dan, one of the top leaders of the Tiananmen demonstrations, Ma Shaofang, Zhai Waimin, Shao Jiang, Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang and Guo Haifeng.
 
Signers Unavailable
 Attempts to reach the signers today were unsuccessful, and there were reports they had secluded themselves as they released the petition.
Mr. Wang's telephone was out of service. All of the signers risked arrest in putting their names to the petition. A general clampdown on dissent continues in advance of the fifth anniversary of the military assault.
Ten days ago, Mr. Wang and an American television crew that had taped an interview with him were detained briefly for questioning by the police.
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhai and Mr. Ma were detained during the March visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Earlier this month, the Chinese President and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, referred to the 1989 crisis as "a bad thing that has been turned into a good thing," adding, "As a result, our reform and opening-up program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller play."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Boeing Stock Rises on Report of Deal in China

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Shares of the Boeing Company rose yesterday after a published report said the company was about to receive a $5 billion order from China for more than 50 commercial jetliners, including some of Boeing's largest aircraft.
Boeing officials declined to comment, except to say that China remained an important customer. After President Clinton approved China's trading status yesterday, Larry Clarkson, the senior vice president for planning and international development at Boeing, said the company believed that if China's trading privileges had not been approved any deal would have been off. 
 The report, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, implied the order was imminent, but one Boeing official said the company did not believe that was true.
Shares of Boeing rose $2.50, to $47, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Analysts said the order had been at least partly anticipated, because of the rapid growth of China's economy and the current review of the country's trading status. The Clinton Administration approved the trade privileges, known as most-favored-nation status, despite limited improvement in China's human rights record.
 
Other Large Orders
 Analysts said the chairman of Boeing, Frank A. Shrontz, had told them earlier this week about specific large orders from Singapore and Saudi Arabia, but had made only passing remarks about China.
The Chinese "are in the midst of planning and we are in discussions with a number of airlines," a spokesman for Boeing, David Jensen, said. "But as far as whether a definite order will be placed any time soon, we can't say."
Mr. Jensen said the Chinese economy had been growing at a rate of 9 to 11 percent annually, and that air traffic normally correlated very closely to the growth of gross national product. "Air China is a predominantly Boeing carrier, with 43 Boeing aircraft and six on order," he added.
 
Aircraft Orders Down
 During the last few years, the worldwide recession and the resulting reduction in demand for airplanes have caused Boeing to cut its production and lay off workers. Orders from China account for 14 percent of Boeing's commercial aircraft orders and have helped the company, which is based in Seattle, avoid deeper cuts.
From 1991 to 1993, China's national carrier was split into about a dozen small airlines, with Air China of Beijing as the largest.
"The size of the order is a surprise to me because I don't see which of the carriers would be the logical buyer of that large a block of long-distance aircraft," said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace industry analyst with BT Securities in New York. "I don't think China has a single airline with the financial clout to bring an order like this to fruition."
Still, he said, Chinese air traffic has grown at a rate of 22 percent annually for the last 20 years, creating a great demand for aircraft.
The order "does reaffirm that China is going to be an important customer for Boeing and for the United States," said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "But the order does not erase the fact that Boeing will have very low levels of earnings for the next 18 months. It doesn't change any production schedules."
The deal with China would be only slightly smaller than a $6 billion Saudi Arabian aircraft order in February that was split between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, with Boeing building 46 of the 61 aircraft.

HEADLINE: Texas Plans to Sue U.S. Over Illegal Alien Costs

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 26

 BODY:
Following the lead of three other states, Texas announced plans today to sue the Federal Government to recover costs of public services for illegal immigrants.
In doing so, Gov. Ann W. Richards and other Texas officials appeared to go out of their way to refrain from casting the lawsuit as a direct attack on the immigrants themselves, as such moves have often been interpreted elsewhere, especially in California. Florida has already filed a suit against the Federal Government to recover money spent on educating, housing, hospitalizing and jailing illegal immigrants, and California and Arizona, which have already sued over prison costs, have also announced plans to broaden their lawsuits. 
 Texas officials said today that the suit was a legal means to correct a glaring budget imbalance under which many illegal immigrants paid taxes that were collected by the Federal Government while the state and local governments were left with the financial obligation for providing services ranging from emergency medical care to public education.
"While undocumented immigrants make contributions to the Texas economy, they also contribute substantially to the Federal coffers in the form of income taxes and Social Security payments, which are matched by businesses," said the Attorney General of Texas, Dan Morales, who announced the state's intention to file the lawsuit.
 
Legal Moves by California
 "However," he added, "the costs of delivering services to the immigrants is imposed upon the state and its communities."
In California, Gov. Pete Wilson accompanied an announcement of plans to file a similar lawsuit earlier this year with proposals for cutting the undocumented immigrants' eligibility for some services. He also proposed amending the Federal Constitution so that their United States-born children would no longer qualify for American citizenship and such automatic rights as Medicaid and welfare services.
But here in Texas, which shares a border of almost 1,200 miles with Mexico and where Governor Richards has been careful not to alienate heavily Hispanic South Texas with any anti-immigrant comments, the lawsuit is being cast as little more than a budget dispute with Federal officials.
"This wrangle has been going on for years and years and years and years," Ms. Richards, who is facing re-election this fall, said in Austin, the state capital. "There's nothing new. The only thing new is, states have made a commitment they're going to fight back."
A spokesman for Mr. Morales, Ward Tisdale, said he expected the lawsuit to be filed within a month or so, but he said the state had not arrived at a final estimate of how much it spends on services for illegal immigrants.
Last fall, the Texas Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs calculated that the overall cost of state and local services was nearly $500 million, though it said some of that was offset by sales taxes and other indirect taxes paid by an estimated 550,000 illegal immigrants in Texas. Mr. Tisdale said that estimate of the net costs might be revised.
 
Florida Sues for $1.5 Billion
 Florida filed a lawsuit last month seeking $1.5 billion, which Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, estimated as the rough cost over two years of providing a range of services to roughly 350,000 illegal immigrants there.
California has also sued, though the only motion currently in Federal court deals solely with the costs of jailing 17,000 illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. Governor Wilson wants $377 million in Federal payments, plus another $1.6 billion to build more prisons. He also has said the state will file additional lawsuits dealing with education and health-care costs.
Arizona, with a smaller population of illegal immigrants, filed its own lawsuit earlier this month, seeking $121 million.
In New York, which is generally believed to have the second largest population of illegal immigrants after California, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been seriously considering a lawsuit to recover the costs of a broad range of social services but has taken no action to file one, a spokesman said.
The various lawsuits' chances of success are unclear. Past attempts in court by New York and California to get more Federal money for the costs of jailing illegal immigrants failed. But they were not specifically based upon the legal theory that such costs were incurred as a direct result of the Federal Government's failure to enforce its own immigration laws.
Last month, President Clinton asked Congress for $350 million to help states pay for imprisoning illegal immigrants, but governors of several states quickly said that would be nowhere near enough money even if Congress agreed to appropriate it.
Here in Texas, Republicans who have been calling for such lawsuits wasted no time in condemning Governor Richards, a Democrat, for waiting so long and for not acting with more determination.
Her Republican opponent this fall, George W. Bush, a son of the former President, said in a statement issued today, "While other states have moved forward aggressively to force the Federal Government to either control the borders or pay the cost for their failure, Governor Richards has hung back and failed to lead on the issue, leaving Texans no other explanation than her desire to protect Bill Clinton from further criticism."

HEADLINE: House Bill on Derivatives Introduced

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Two powerful members of the House of Representatives introduced a bill yesterday to tighten the supervision of the derivatives activities of banks.
The bill was introduced by Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Jim Leach of Iowa, the ranking Republican member on the committee. It combines, in a somewhat milder form, separate derivatives legislation that each had introduced earlier this year. 
 Derivatives are customized financial contracts that have values based on underlying financial assets like stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. A handful of big banks are the largest dealers in derivatives. Other banks use derivatives as investments and to reduce their vulnerability to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives have become controversial because some people have worried that their complexity could lead to unexpected losses or even contribute to a systemwide crisis.
 
2d Bill in Works
 Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, held hearings this month on derivatives and said he intended to introduce a sweeping bill on the subject soon. Mr. Markey's subcommittee mainly oversees the brokerage industry, and his bill mainly would expand the regulation of derivatives activities by securities and insurance companies.
The bill introduced yesterday by Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Leach applies only to the banks and other institutions regulated by the House Banking Committee, including credit unions and Government-sponsored housing agencies like the Federal National Mortgage Corporation.
The bill orders the bank regulatory agencies to develop consistent standards relating to derivatives for capital, accounting, disclosure, examinations and suitability. It would force them to create a plan to get information on derivatives activities of banks quickly in the case of a crisis.
The bill would force a bank's management and directors to approve derivatives activity. And it would order regulators to seek widespread cooperation from other countries in creating uniform international standards on derivatives.
Banking executives conceded that these were mild measures that did not ban or restrict any specific derivatives. But they argued that the bill would impose additional paperwork and other burdens on banks and was not needed because current laws allowed bank regulators to supervise derivatives adequately.
"The timing of this is a bit curious," said Mark Brickell, a managing director at J. P. Morgan who is the vice chairman of the International Swap and Derivatives Dealers Association, a trade organization. "It is only yesterday that banking regulators, and indeed all five financial supervisors, testified that they already have the powers they need."
 
Federal Reserve Sees No Need

 
 On Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other regulators testified that the possibility of a taxpayer bailout caused by derivatives was remote and that no legislation was needed.
But Mr. Gonzalez dismissed those comments, saying that regulators had been lax in preventing failures of savings and loan institutions and other banking problems. "Sadly, the country is still paying for the last time the regulators fell asleep at the switch." Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement.
A spokesman for the banking committee said it would try to pass the bill this year. But others said that would be difficult in the time remaining in the session.
"Barring some unforeseen crisis in the next 60 days, I think the chances anything will pass this year are essentially zero," said Bert Ely, a bank policy consultant.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
When sudden baldness is bad for business, a lawyer decides to beard the rumors.

BYLINE: By David Margolick 

 BODY:
Until about a year ago Jeremiah Gutman, a man with a mane of flowing, slightly unruly white hair, bushy eyebrows and moustache, was periodically mistaken for a famous physicist. Standing at a bus stop in Los Angeles once, Mr. Gutman, a fixture in Manhattan's civil liberties bar for 40 years, was even asked for his autograph. "The guy gave me whatever he was carrying and I signed 'Albert Einstein,' " he recalled.
Almost overnight, however, Mr. Gutman, who is 70, has come to look more like Telly Savalas or Yul Brynner. Disease has clear-cut his distinguished head and, for a time, threatened to decimate his law practice as well. Therein lie several lessons for lawyers about the fragility of small law practices, the fickleness of some clients, the squeamishness of colleagues and the ravages of rumors. 
 Mr. Gutman once wore a beard that made him look like a beat poet; now, he has not had to shave for months. His hair was once luxuriant; now, a single strand grows on his nose. He trims it periodically, but there is little else either north or south.
"When I see myself in the mirror, I don't know who I am," he said. "I've turned into Kojak. Worse than that: Kojak had eyelashes."
Late last year, Mr. Gutman learned that he had alopecia generalis, an illness whose only physical effect is that it claims all of one's hair. Within a few months the man who once represented such hirsute sorts as Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin has come to resemble another, balder client of his in the 1969-70 trial of the Chicago Seven, David Dellinger.
Most of the the world, and the bar, however, know nothing about alopecia (pronounced ala-PEA-sha). They assumed that Mr. Gutman's hair was a casualty of chemotherapy, that he had cancer; that he was dying. And both the world and the bar began acting accordingly.
Some old allies, like Henry Schwartzchild and Ira Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union, did not mince words. "What's the matter with you?" they asked. When he told them, they commiserated with him.
Many others in his concentric circles -- groups like the National Coalition Against Censorship, the American-Israeli Civil Liberties Coalition and others with the words "civil" or "liberties" usually in their names -- blanched but didn't want to ask. Others, fearful of anything smelling of death or dying, didn't want to know. Still others, like Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, were so steeped in the constitutional right to privacy that they didn't think they should pry.
Mr. Gutman -- who used the locker he was given as editor of the New York University Law Review in 1948 to store the guns he had hussled up for Israel -- initially agreed. He figured that hair loss, like hemorrhoids, were not anybody else's business. But he underestimated how much some people cared.
"People were very concerned," said Lesly Lempert of Ithaca, president of the New York State Civil Liberties Union. "No one could possibly imagine the N.Y.C.L.U. without Mr. Gutman's presence."
Had it remained strictly a matter of appearances, Mr. Gutman might have remained silent. But business began dropping off nearly as quickly as his hair, down 70 percent in the last half of 1993.
Part of the loss, he knew, was attributable to the recession. The small businesses that make up half his clientele -- the rest are public interest matters he handles for nothing -- had economic troubles of their own, and stopped paying their legal bills.
"When half your business is not for money and half of the other half stops paying, you're in trouble," Mr. Gutman said recently in the cluttered offices of Levy, Gutman, Goldberg & Kaplan, in Suite 1776 of 275 Seventh Avenue, in the heart of the garment district. On his wall is perhaps the world's largest collection of "No Smoking" signs -- in 40 different languages, stolen, er, borrowed from Italian trains, Athenian buses and the like -- plus an assortment of paintings, mostly poor man's Rothkos.
There was evidence, however, that public perceptions of Mr. Gutman's health was partly to blame for his financial perils, that old clients were taking their business elsewhere. The Levy in Levy, Gutman, Goldberg & Kaplan has been dead since 1929; the Gutman, Mr. Gutman's father, died in 1948, and Mr. Goldman has been dead since 1982.
Indeed, there are more lawyers in the firm's name than there are in the firm, which now comprises Mr. Gutman, Philip Kaplan and a junior associate. When one of the three gets sick, or when the world thinks that he is sick, the whole place founders.
Mr. Gutman pondered his options. He thought of placing a notice in The New York Law Journal, or at the bottom of the front page of The New York Times, or sending out one of those printed cardboard announcements of the sort that are thrown out thousands of times in hundreds of law offices every morning: "Levy, Gutman, Goldberg & Kaplan is proud to announce that Jeremian Gutman is not suffering from cancer, is in good health and is looking for business," it would have said.
Instead, he decided to come clean, then rely on word of mouth. To friend and foe and client alike, he started volunteering the obvious and then providing the explanation.
It now seems that gossip runs both ways. Business has bounced back, and so has the mood of his once fearful colleagues. But the hair hasn't been so resilient. Mr. Gutman and his friends are still getting used to it.
"His new look is sort of a Wall Street corporate type," Mrs. Lempert said. "I think that's as troubling to him as anything."

HEADLINE: 10,000 Jobs Are Added In City for First Quarter

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
New York City added almost 10,000 jobs in the first three months of this year, the largest quarterly increase since the start of the local recession in early 1989, according to a report issued yesterday.
The report, produced by the city's Economic Policy and Marketing Group, provides the strongest evidence to date that what has long been a weak and hesitant local economic recovery is finally starting to produce meaningful employment gains. The group provides coordinated planning and marketing strategy for the city's economic development agencies. 
 Increased hiring by the private sector outweighed a continued decline in government jobs that will be accelerated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to reduce the city's work force. In addition to the 10,000 jobs added in the first quarter, 4,400 private jobs were added in April, preliminary figures showed.
 
'Very Encouraged'
 "I am very encouraged about the growth in employment, which suggests that we are getting the economy back on track," Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. But he said an improving local economy should not be counted on to bail New York out of its budget distress.
"It would be very imprudent to think that," he said. "I don't think this is going to have an immediate impact on the budget."
Since the local economy hit bottom at the end of 1992, New York City has added about 41,000 private-sector jobs, with more than half of the gains in the last six months alone. But the rebound remains quite modest. Only 12 percent of the 342,000 jobs lost from 1989 to 1992 have been regained.
Despite severe winter weather, hiring increased across most sectors of the economy. Wall Street led the pack, adding 5,700 employees in the first quarter. But the report warned that the financial sector, which has chalked up record profits in each of the last three years, cannot be counted on to generate similar gains because of the market uncertainty caused by rising interest rates.
 
Expansion in Queens
 Local manufacturing, which has been losing jobs almost without interruption for three decades, actually reversed direction for the first time in years. It was bolstered by a healthy expansion of industry in Queens, which has been steadily overtaking Brooklyn and Manhattan as the heart of the city's manufacturing sector.
Construction, devastated by the collapse of the commercial real-estate market after the 1987 stock market crash, also produced gains.
Manhattan and Queens, which dominate employment in the city and were the boroughs hit worst by the recession, showed the first real signs of life near the end of 1993. The other boroughs continued a rebound that began earlier.
"This broad-based hiring in the first quarter helped support the early stages of job growth in Manhattan and Queens," said James Parrot, chief economist of the city organization that prepared the report. "Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx edged closer to regaining their previous employment peaks."
While the quarterly job increase was the strongest in years, it made only a slight dent in the city's unemployment rate. Unemployment averaged 10 percent during the first quarter, down only slightly from 10.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 1993 and a yearly average of 10.2 percent.
The report noted that health care has become a crucial anchor of the local economy, accounting for close to 11 percent of total city employment and as much as 30 percent of the jobs in the Bronx. Employment by nursing homes and home health-care agencies is rising faster than in any other sector and now totals 69,000 jobs. That is as many people as are employed in all the law firms in the city.
The report, echoing other studies, found that the city was plagued by a shortage of "middle-level jobs" caused by a growing "polarization between high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage employment." That trend, it noted, "will leave many New Yorkers with little access to the career ladders which have traditionally pulled them out of poverty and into the middle class."
Despite the city's job gains, the report found that employment growth in all major sectors of the local economy still lagged well behind those of the nation as a whole and that a much lower proportion of adults in New York City were employed than in most other places in the nation.

HEADLINE: Withdrawal Pace Slows At Mutual Bond Funds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Mutual fund investors seem to be growing less alarmed about the prospect of higher interest rates, and withdrawals from bond funds have slowed. But there are still only limited indications that investors are willing to risk more cash, fund company executives said yesterday.
"It is a wait-and-see environment," said Joan Miller, a spokeswoman for the State Street Research group of funds. "We're not seeing mass redemptions, but we're not seeing much buying either." 
 At the T. Rowe Price group of funds, cash continued to flow out of bond funds in May, said Steve Norwitz, a spokesman, but he added that the pace was more moderate. And at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund group, it appeared that bond funds will approximately break even in terms of cash flow this month, after two months of net redemptions.
"They are not putting money in, but they have stopped taking money out," said Neal Litvack, an executive vice president of Fidelity. A survey of investors, done for Fidelity by the University of Michigan, found that 33 percent of those questioned in May expected interest rates to rise over the next six months, compared with 77 percent of those questioned in April.
 
Stock Funds Still Popular
 Stock mutual funds, meanwhile, continued to draw in money despite choppy performance and bearish talk, with international funds again growing popular, fund managers said. But the flows into the funds are well below those of earlier this year.
The comments by the fund companies came as the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, released figures for cash flows in April, showing that investors took a net $4.8 billion out of bond funds, compared with withdrawals of $7.7 billion in March. In stock funds, however, a net $11.3 billion was put into funds, up from $6.6 billion in March.
The cash-flow figures include new investments and withdrawals, as well as transfers between different types of funds. But they exclude reinvested dividends.
 
Some Investors Surprised
 Rising interest rates have damaged bond fund returns, evidently surprising some investors who did not understand the risks they were taking. Christian Twaites, a vice president of Aetna mutual funds, said that the company was getting more calls from investors who believed the funds were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits but has nothing to do with mutual funds.
Municipal bond funds saw their third consecutive month of net withdrawals in April, with investors taking out $1.6 billion, which was lower than the $2 billion that came out in March. Prior to February, the last month in which there were net withdrawals from such funds was August 1990, and the last time this occurred for three consecutive months was from August through October 1987.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Prices Fall for 3d Day In Broad Commodity Selloff

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A slide in coffee futures prices steepened yesterday as a broad collapse in commodity prices worsened.
Analysts said coffee and other commodities had climbed too far, too fast on heavy speculative buying. Cocoa, precious metal and grain futures also fell. Livestock and energy futures were mixed. 
 An index of 21 commodities tracked by the Commodity Research Bureau of Knight-Ridder Inc. retreated for the third consecutive day yesterday after reaching a three-and-a-half-year high of 238.36 on Monday. The commodity index, which is regarded as a gauge of inflation, fell 1.98 points, to 229.61.
Analysts attributed the sharp moves in some markets partly to positioning ahead of the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.
Unroasted arabica coffee beans for July delivery plunged 9.95 cents, to $1.178 a pound, on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The contract has fallen 27.7 cents, or 19 percent, since peaking on Monday at $1.455 a pound, a five-year high.
 
 
Cutback in Coffee Supply
 Coffee futures prices had more than doubled this year as supplies tightened. Large producers like Brazil and Colombia have exported less coffee than they did in 1993, and analysts had predicted smaller harvests this year because of cutbacks by growers after five years of low prices.
The sharp advance in coffee prices, most of which occurred in the last six weeks, had raised inflation fears along with increases in soybean, corn, crude oil and precious metal prices. All those markets have weakened substantially this week.
Cocoa for July delivery also fell for the third consecutive day, tumbling $32, to $1,330 a ton.
Crude oil futures steadied on the New York Mercantile Exchange after three days of losses.
Light sweet crude for July delivery rose 4 cents, to $17.74 a barrel; June heating oil rose 0.19 cent, to 47.82 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline fell 0.18 cent, to 51.49 cents a gallon; July natural gas rose 2.6 cents, to $1.862 for 1,000 cubic feet.
 
 
Wheat Falls on Russian Deal
 On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures fell sharply on the news that Russia bought European wheat instead of American wheat this week.
July wheat fell 9 cents, to $3.2175 a bushel; July corn fell 2.25 cents, to $2.645 a bushel; July oats fell 2.25 cents, to $1.1675 a bushel; July soybeans fell 2.75 cents, to $6.7225 a bushel.
Cattle futures rebounded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after plunging on Wednesday to their lowest price in nearly six years. Analysts said traders had overreacted to rising cattle supplies.
Live cattle for June delivery rose 1.5 cents, the permitted daily limit, to 63.97 cents a pound; August feeder cattle also rose 1.5 cents, to 74.82 cents a pound; June live hogs rose 0.37 cent, to 47.42 cents a pound; July frozen pork bellies sank 0.40 cent, to 41.22 cents a pound.

Treasuries Are Mixed; Long Bond's Price Dips

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the long bond's price bouncing up and down before ending lower.
Many market participants said trading drew tentative near the close in New York because the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to testify today about monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee. 
 With no new economic data yesterday, investors and dealers seemed transfixed by movements in the Commodity Research Bureau index, one measure of inflation pressures. Prices were helped as the index fell for the third straight day, finishing down 1.98, to 2229.61.
Prices were also aided for a time by a rebound in the dollar. A weak dollar tends to raise concerns that overseas investors will find dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
 
Yield Rises to 7.36%
 But the 30-year bond fell 4/32 , to 8625/32 , for a yield of 7.36 percent, up from 7.34 percent yesterday. Among the short maturities, the rate for a three-month bill was unchanged at 4.15 percent, while a six-month bill rose a basis point, to 4.57 percent. A 10-year note rose 4/32 , to 1015/32 , for a yield of 7.09 percent, down from 7.10 percent on Wednesday, while a seven-year issue was unchanged at 6.72 percent.
"Greenspan's testimony on monetary policy and interest rates, two of the market's favorites, could be an interesting discussion," said Matthew Alexy, a government-trading strategist at CS First Boston. "He will be giving more insight to the recent policy moves."
Mr. Alexy said the Fed essentially entered a new phase with the 50-basis- point increase in the Federal funds rate that it announced earlier this month. "It was an exclamation point and now the phase is one of assessment as the Fed judges the impact of higher rates and where the economy is going," he said.
Although today's testimony may not produce any surprises, "with Greenspan you can never be certain about what he says or how it will be interpreted by the market," Mr. Alexy said. "That's why the market drew cautious near the end of the session," he added.
In early trading, bonds gained on some of the momentum from the previous day's trading. The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing the first time for state unemployment benefits declined by 1,000 last week, but the market was aided by the department's report that the four-week moving average for unemployment claims rose to 366,750 from 359,250. The average, they said, was the highest since mid-February.
 
Views Differ on Economy
 Traders said the initial gains in the market were pared as views differed on whether the high level of unemployment claims implied a slowing of economic growth and if interest rate increases have been enough to slow the economy.
Analysts said the rise in employment claims appeared to contradict an increase in employment that was reflected in the Labor Department's monthly payroll report. One theory is that claims may have been artificially inflated by the Government's decision in late April to end a program that gave emergency benefits to the long-term unemployed.
The May jobs report is due June 3, and an early survey by MMS International projects a rise of 275,000.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $16.5 billion of one-year bills, and with the conclusion of the auction the supply picture for short-term Government paper lightens considerably, traders said. This, they say, will help improve prices.
The auction drew good retail interest, particularly from small investors who are finding rates offered by short-term Treasury issues as good as some other consumer alternatives. At auction the average yield for the new one-year bill was 5.01 percent, up from 4.77 percent last month and the highest yield since October 1991, when it was 5.12 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's one-year Treasury bill auction:

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
When Some Give Up the Ghost
Spring is usually the time when galleries that are in trouble finally decide to close, and this season is no exception. With the contemporary-art world still suffering from a sluggish economy, many galleries, most of which deal with younger or lesser-known artists, simply can't make a go of it.
"I gave it 10 years, but I became a bit of a dinosaur," said Josh Baer, whose Broome Street gallery in SoHo has featured contemporary artists including Nancy Spero, Chris Burden and Annette Lemieux. "It's just not going to work anymore, giving clients the services they need and paying the overhead while showing difficult art the market can't support." Mr. Baer, who is closing his gallery in mid-June, said he would be working with artists privately. "If I need a space to hold a show, I'll rent it," he said. 
 For Barbara Toll, a 13-year veteran of the SoHo gallery scene, the "level of frustration" has just risen too high. Her Greene Street space is to close on June 25. Ms. Toll said her decision was based on a combination of factors, partly economic and partly the realization that there was a shrinking audience for the avant-garde art she was showing.
Midori Nishizawa, director of the Akira Ikeda Gallery at 130 Prince Street in SoHo, expressed similar sentiments when she confirmed that the gallery would shut its doors at the end of July. "This is only our second year," she said. "Every gallery needs three years to get established, but it's difficult for someone like us, who show new artists where there is no easy market." Ms. Nishizawa said she was trying to move the gallery, but her plans are up in the air. She said Mr. Ikeda's three other galleries -- in Tokyo, Nagoya and Taudra Yokosuka, Japan -- are going strong.
Not so for Daniel Newburg's Greene Street gallery. Mr. Newburg said he saw the closing of his SoHo space in June as the "conclusion of a 10-year project."
"June will be my 10th anniversary," Mr. Newburg said. Producing 10 shows a year has simply become too much, he explained, adding, "I want to concentrate on more in-depth projects." He plans to continue working with many of the American and European contemporary artists he represented at his gallery, including the Swiss abstractionist John Armleder and the American installation artist Matthew McCaslin. "I won't represent them exclusively," he said. "But I'll work with them on a project-by-project basis."
Meanwhile, Mr. Newburg's next-door neighbor David Zwirner, is planning to expand into Mr. Newburg's space. "We had a good season, and we're optimistic," Mr. Zwirner said.
 
. . . aAnd Others Look to Expand
 In spring, many galleries also announce plans to move and open new spaces in the fall. Pat Hearn, who has been at 39 Wooster Street in SoHo for six years, isn't sure where she's going. "My lease is up, and there are so many spaces around at better prices," she said. She said she planned to close in August and reopen in a new location on Sept. 18.
Uptown, the Spanierman Gallery will be moving from 50 East 78th Street to 45 East 58th Street in August. "The old neighborhood has been slowly eroding," Mr. Spanierman said. "There are more women's boutiques and far fewer galleries. We're moving into much bigger quarters in a place I want to be, between the Fuller Building and Christie's."
 
Showcase for New York Artists
 The Hamptons have always been a popular spot for artists to play and work, which may be one reason the area is also popular with collectors and dealers. Many begin their annual migration to the East End of Long Island today. It makes sense, then, that a new gallery has just opened to showcase 23 New York City artists, many of whom own houses in the Hamptons.
The gallery, Off Shore, is at 74 Montauk Highway, at the Red Horse Market complex in East Hampton. It is a collaboration between Janelle Reiring and Helen Winer, co-owners of the SoHo gallery Metro Pictures, and Rachel Lehmann, owner of the Lehmann Gallery in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its director, David Maupin, was formerly the director of the Mary Boone Gallery in SoHo.
"The gallery is a product of the times," said Janelle Reiring. "This couldn't have ever been done in the 80's." In these tougher times, the artists involved, all of whom are represented by Manhattan galleries, are more than willing to give a gallery like Off Shore works on consignment. "It's crucial that we have cooperation from the artists and their dealers," Ms. Reiring said.
The gallery is to be open year round and feature artists like Donald Baechler, Ross Bleckner, Barbara Kruger, John Chamberlain, Chuck Close, Laurie Simmons, Eric Fischl and David Salle. The first show, a group exhibition, runs through June 13. An exhibition of paintings by April Gornik and sculptures by Bryan Hunt follows, on June 16.
 
Images in Calvin Klein Ads Attacked
 Maciej Toporowicz, a Polish-born artist, is obsessed with Obsession, the Calvin Klein perfume. He also has strong feelings about the designer's use of what the artist considers rather perfect Aryan types in ad campaigns. "Calvin Klein is consciously or unconsciously using Nazi images in his campaigns," Mr. Toporowicz said. "It's sexist and exclusionary."
A spokeswoman for Calvin Klein said the company had no comment at this time.
To make his point, Mr. Toporowicz created a poster featuring a photograph of "The Army," a sculpture of a male frontal nude by Hitler's favorite sculptor, Arno Breker, with the Obsession logo added to its bottom edge. The artist's favorite spot to paste up the poster is the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in SoHo, not far from the bus stops that often display the real Calvins.
Referring to the names of Mr. Klein's three fragrances, Mr. Toporowicz's press release announces, "There is no escape from obsession to eternity."
The artist said he had put up more than 200 posters of this image around Manhattan. "This is a difficult issue," he said. "What's interesting is that when people see me putting up the posters, they think they're really Calvin Klein posters. The Nazi image blends so perfectly with his campaign, it's hard to recognize the difference."
 
McEnroe Helps Restore a Library
 Another art institution has found a naming opportunity encouraged by a cash donation.
The New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture in Greenwich Village announced last week that the tennis player John McEnroe was financing the restoration and expansion of its library, which is to bear his name.
The donation, which amounts to $183,000, is to be given over a four-year period. "We're thrilled," said Lori Blount, a spokeswoman for the school. "John knows we have really needed a library."
Coincidentally, Graham Nickson, the school's dean, is represented by the Salander-O'Reilly Galleries in Manhattan, where Mr. McEnroe worked as a volunteer for six months last year, learning the art trade.
Mr. McEnroe, who recently opened a by-appointment gallery on Greene Street in SoHo, is at the French Open this week and could not be reached for comment.
 
More (Not Less) Than Expected
 Even in a down auction market, some things exceed everyone's expectations. At Sotheby's sale of American paintings in New York on Wednesday, John Singer Sargent's "Spanish Dancer," from the estate of Wendell Cherry, brought $7.5 million. Not only did the price set a record for the artist, it was also far above Sotheby's $4 million estimate. Sotheby's declines to identify the buyer.

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Rights in China

 BODY:
Succumbing to enormous pressure from business interests, President Clinton has walked away from his own sensible policy of linking Beijing's trade privileges to modest human rights progress.
By abandoning its public threat of meaningful sanctions, the Administration harms its foreign policy credibility and gravely endangers those brave Chinese citizens who stood up to a brutal dictatorship in the mistaken belief that Washington would defend their cause. 
 Mr. Clinton did not pretend that China had shown much progress in many of the areas he specified last year. But instead of imposing the serious trade penalties he then threatened, he has imposed useful but excessively narrow sanctions. Targeting only China's export of guns and ammunition, they will affect perhaps $100 million of China's more than $30 billion a year in exports to the U.S.
Mr. Clinton argues that he will continue to pursue human rights objectives, but mainly by non-economic means like broadcasting, supporting human rights groups and promoting a corporate code of conduct. He thus abandons America's most powerful tool for expanding freedom: negotiating the terms of access to America's indispensable market.
Congress, which first raised using America's trade leverage to support human rights, can mitigate the damage by broadening the President's proposal to penalize other categories of goods produced principally by companies associated with the Chinese Army. That approach, endorsed by Senator George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosi, would affect $900 million a year in Chinese exports without damaging economic reform.
Meanwhile, business leaders who have argued that trade and investment are the best ways to advance human rights can show their sincerity by taking up the President's proposal for a voluntary code of corporate conduct. Such a code should, minimally, bar products made by prison labor, discourage political indoctrination and surveillance in the workplace and encourage U.S. executives to discuss human rights with Chinese authorities.
A year ago, Mr. Clinton offered China an honorable way out of the yearly wrangle. Beijing merely had to live up to some of its own past commitments to respect internationally recognized human rights.
But China, encouraged by kid-gloves treatment from past Administrations, divided messages from the Clinton team and vocal lobbying by American business, chose to ignore the offer. Now Mr. Clinton has renewed China's trading status anyway. Washington thus signals Beijing that it is more concerned about the profits of Boeing and AT&T than about China's commitments or its citizens' rights.
Economic interests are a legitimate component of foreign policy. But with China enjoying a huge bilateral trade surplus and Beijing's development model dependent on continued access to American dollars, the U.S. had plenty of leverage to exert. Many people argue that encouraging China's economic boom is the most effective way to improve human rights. But experience elsewhere suggests that muscular diplomatic pressure helps.
The U.S. also has security interests with China, like cooperation on North Korean nuclear issues, regional stability and proliferation. But Washington has nothing to gain on any of these fronts by confirming China's suspicions that the U.S. is a paper tiger whose threats can safely be ignored. It is now up to Congress to correct that impression by enacting broader sanctions.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Bill Clinton's Teachings

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
China's 75 million Christians are forbidden to worship how and where they see fit. Protestant and Catholic clerics are often imprisoned and tortured.
President Clinton is a religious man. He talks of how much his religion means to him. He goes to church regularly. 
 So it was natural that when, on May 28, 1993, he signed an executive order giving the Chinese Communists one more year to show progress on human rights or face tariff penalties, he dealt with religion. "Overall significant progress" in releasing and accounting for religious prisoners was made a condition.
Mr. Clinton believes in the decent treatment of political prisoners too -- at least that they not be flogged daily or left in their own excrement. So the condition of significant progress was made about them too.
President Clinton is against the export of forced labor products so essential to Beijing's profits. The order demanded that China abide by formal pacts to keep them out of the U.S.
Mr. Clinton thinks quite poorly of wiping out a captive nation. Therefore the order demanded easing the destruction of Tibet's religion and culture.
No kowtowing to foreign pressures. Before his election, Mr. Clinton talked scornfully of President Bush coddling the Chinese tyranny.
Bill Clinton believes a President should provide leadership in political morality and democratic idealism. He thinks of himself as a teacher for those who serve under him.
Now he has decided that his own executive order does not mean what the American public and Congress thought and wanted -- no real human rights progress, no low-tariff privileges.
Somehow he thinks Americans will believe night is day -- that the Chinese Communists have imperfectly but sufficiently met the conditions of human rights progress. So he permanently "delinked" trade and human rights -- a complete, smarmy turnaround of every moral and political position he has taken on Communist China.
Mr. Clinton and those around him know that more political dissidents, more priests and bishops are being arrested than released, that crackdowns continue, harsher. And they know that China still exports slave labor products to the U.S. and to the world, that Tibet's blood still flows.
So the price of serving Mr. Clinton is to pretend that retreat is achievement. Government servants who have built careers and honor now are abandoning the latter to keep the former.
The moral contagion extends to some members of Congress. They saw the error of their ways after the China lobby began its hugely funded campaign against relating tariffs to human rights progress.
Two years ago Senator Bill Bradley, the proudly intellectual Democrat from New Jersey, voted for using the threat of higher tariffs to soften the wardens of the Chinese gulag. Now he says the idea is just a relic of the cold war.
That would brand the following as cold warriors: 60 percent of the American people, the majority of Congress, human rights organizations worldwide, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops, and of course some tens of millions of Chinese in slave labor camps, torture cells and forced-abortion clinics.
Mr. Bradley is known for speaking on morals and values.
Mr. Clinton's retreat is important far beyond the question of whether economic pressures would help human rights in China as they did in South Africa. The President showed his willingness to bow to business pressure at home on a major issue of foreign and human affairs. He showed himself surrendering to a dictatorship, turning himself inside out.
The Chinese gave him only contempt. Their only promise was that repression would continue. The President did not blink -- he surrendered, to China and the lobby.
Mr. Clinton already is criticized abroad for about-facing on foreign affairs. The surrender at Beijing will make it impossible for friend or foe to trust his foreign policy word -- even when he writes it into law himself.
When friends cannot trust a Presidential word, alliances erode. When foes do not believe a President, the risk is war by miscalculation, as in Korea and the Persian Gulf.
The teaching of Mr. Clinton is: Don't coddle tyrants, just surrender. For the President and his country, that is a sad and dangerous message to send.

HEADLINE: Past Looks Brighter Than Future for Robb

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The old Chuck Robb was back. If only for a moment, he was not one of the most endangered Democrats in the Senate, fighting to keep his seat and to restore a reputation tarnished by beauty queens, massages and secret tape-recordings.
On this evening in his Senate office, Mr. Robb drifted back a quarter of a century, to the glory days when he had returned from Vietnam laden with medals, to a bride whose father had been President and to whispers that he might even end up in the White House himself. He was in Philadelphia, he recalled, a fresh-faced marine from Virginia who managed to win over a crowd of anti-war protesters. 
 "I'm there in my major's uniform -- dress blues, ribbons, badges, medals and everything," he remembered with pride, "and I walked into a complete anti-war demonstration for my benefit."
But in the end, he was so successful in defusing the confrontation, he said, that after reports of it in the press, "I got a real nice note from President Nixon complimenting me."
 
Days of Glory
 Charles Spittal Robb takes comfort from the past, when he was known as the upstanding officer who married President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter, Lynda Bird, and as a Governor of Virginia who brought fiscal responsibility to the state. But the past is also what has brought Mr. Robb, 54, the lowest popularity ratings of any Democratic Senator seeking re-election this year.
Soon after he took his seat in the Senate, news reports of his extracurricular behavior as Governor began to emerge, at first a dribble but then a humiliating string of disclosures. They portrayed him as a reckless womanizer who attended wild parties at Virginia Beach where drugs were used and said he accepted a nude massage from a former Miss Virginia U.S.A. There were also reports of his aides' plotting to use a secretly tape-recorded telephone conversation of his longtime political rival, L. Douglas Wilder, to embarrass the fellow Democrat, who succeeded him as governor.
So damaging were those reports, that by most accounts, the only thing standing between Mr. Robb and sure defeat in November is Oliver L. North, the Iran-contra figure who is seeking the Republican nomination -- assuming that both men win their respective party primaries next month.
"It's easy to characterize this as a race between a number of less than perfect candidates," Mr. Robb said in an interview. "You have pundits who will just ratchet up the rhetoric on that. And so I am constantly pulled down into a matchup that causes people to say, 'A pox on both houses.' "
In a rather cynical recipe for victory, Mr. Robb's supporters hope that the pox on Mr. North -- with his bitter relations with many Republicans and his conviction on charges, later dismissed, that he lied to Congress about the arms-for-hostages deal -- will cancel out their own candidate's character weaknesses.
"Ollie North is far and away the best thing that Chuck Robb has going for him," said Thomas R. Morris, the president of Emory and Henry College in southwestern Virginia. "Ollie North is No. 1 and Lynda Johnson Robb is No. 2. Obviously, he'd be politically dead in the water without her strong support. With her at his side, it certainly mutes the criticism about past personal behavior, at least in terms of unfaithfulness, in the same way that Hillary Clinton stood by Bill Clinton."
 
Comparisons With Clinton
 There was a time when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Robb were linked not because of accusations of marital infidelity but as up-and-coming Southern Governors, known for their work in the Democratic Leadership Conference, a group of moderate Democrats. Mr. Robb recalled his successful efforts to persuade Mr. Clinton to succeed Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia as chairman.
Mr. Robb offers a careful, lawyerly response when asked if he identifies with the attacks on the President's character. "It's fair to say that he and I have had some interesting conversations," he said. "If you have been through certain fire, you have a shared empathy, no matter what the factual basis."
Perhaps taking a cue from Mr. Clinton, Mr. Robb's strategy is to persevere. Like the President, Mr. Robb at first refused to discuss the accusations about his personal life. But as he moved closer to the next month's primary, he issued a carefully worded confessional admitting "socializing under circumstances not appropriate for a married man," but denying knowingly being in the presence of drug users. The statement was reminiscent of Mr. Clinton's vague explanations on avoiding the draft and experimenting with marijuana.
In the interview and in campaign appearances, Mr. Robb dwelled more on his four years as Governor than his six years in the Senate, which have been overshadowed by disclosures about his behavior when he was Governor. He wants voters to remember the fiscal restraint he brought to Virginia's economy, and the jobs he helped create for the military industry.
But it will not be easy.
Although they are viewed as little threat to his nomination, Mr. Robb's two challengers in the primary, Virgil H. Goode Jr., a State Senator, and Sylvia Clute, a Richmond lawyer, kept the character issue at the forefront of a televised debate this week. "A vote for Chuck Robb, unfortunately, is a vote for a scandal-ridden campaign," Ms. Clute said.
The usually subdued Mr. Goode posed this question: "Do we want a Senator whose judgment is so flawed that despite warnings, he continued to hang out with cocaine users and drug doers?"
If that were not enough, former Governor Wilder is planning to run as an independent -- a move that some view as an effort to defeat Mr. Robb by dividing the Democratic vote. Mr. Wilder would no doubt remind voters of the long-running feud over the illegal tape-recording of a conversation Mr. Wilder, who was then Lieutenant Governor, had on a car phone with a political supporter in which he criticized Mr. Robb.
Mr. Robb's critics go well beyond the people who want his job. This week, Mary Sue Terry, a former State Attorney General who lost in a bid for Governor last year, endorsed Mr. Goode. She was a law school classmate of Mr. Robb and had supported him in the past.
Another influential Virginia Democrat who previously backed Mr. Robb, Representative James P. Moran Jr., also announced recently that he would not support the Senator. He would not explain why, but in an interview this was the best thing he could say about the Senator, "Some might suggest that he's a better politician than legislator."
One reason Mr. Robb has had difficulty blotting out the negatives is because it is never easy for a freshman Senator to make a mark; and he, in particular, has been distracted by the litany of personal disclosures.
While Mr. Robb has not distinguished himself by steering significant legislation, he cites his votes for the Persian Gulf War and for budgets to reduce the deficit as showing his mettle as a leader. He does not mention perhaps his most controversial vote: in favor of the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Robb defends his record, and in a familiar strategy for besieged politicians, blames the press for inaccurately portraying him while refusing to say exactly how he has been misrepresented. He said his achievements were not well known because he had never been one "to run for the cameras."
"To be reduced to a caricature is not anybody's idea of either a pleasant experience or of making life any easier for you," he said. "I've managed to stick to my knitting and get the job done in a difficult period."
But it may take more than knitting and Oliver North to deflect all the bad publicity. So in another, rather risky move, Mr. Robb has begun emphasizing his record of support for homosexual rights, and for overturning the ban on homosexuals in the military. Most notably, he appeared this month before the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a national gay political group.
While the move could backfire in a state as conservative as Virginia, Mr. Robb hopes that if the general election is splintered with a handful of candidates, homosexuals and liberals will be spurred by his stand to support him.
So far, Mr. Robb has avoided dwelling on Mr. North, though he said he would never underestimate "the fierce loyalty" of the Republican's supporters, nor the circumstances that allowed a man who worked in the White House to portray himself as "a martyr poking his finger in the eye of the establishment."
As Mr. Robb talks about hanging on to his Senate seat, the Washington whispers about his running for Vice President, or even President, could not seem farther away. Such a question, Mr. Robb said, "doesn't get asked by journalists anymore."
But the once-pristine Senator from Virginia says that "believe it or not" some people harken back to the magical days when he first squired Lynda Bird and think that bigger things are still in store for him.
"People go back to a storybook wedding or something, and they just think that the stars were supposed to work out a certain way," he said with a trace of wistfulness.

HEADLINE: George W. Ball Dies at 84; Vietnam's Devil's Advocate

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
George W. Ball, who as Under Secretary of State in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations argued forcefully but unsuccessfully against United States involvement in the Vietnam War, died Thursday night in New York Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.
The cause of death was not immediately determined, but his son, Douglas, said that Mr. Ball had entered the hospital on Wednesday and that his doctors had made a diagnosis of terminal abdominal cancer. 
 Mr. Ball's opposition to the Vietnam War was based on his belief that Europe, not Southeast Asia, was the central political arena and that the key to East-West rapprochement and world peace lay in a strong, unified Western Europe.
Mr. Ball, who also served as United States delegate to the United Nations in 1968, retired in 1982 as senior managing director of the New York investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb.
 
Career Began in New Deal
 In a career that began in the New Deal and spanned half a century, Mr. Ball was a lawyer, economist, author, investment banker, high Government official, diplomatic troubleshooter and adviser to Presidents. He never ran for elective office and rose no higher than Under Secretary, the No. 2 post in the State Department, which he held from 1961 to 1966. But he was an influential and often dissenting voice in the making of American foreign policy in the 1960's.
Mr. Ball was a leading exponent of European economic and political unity and of aid to underdeveloped nations; a mediator of crises in Cyprus, Pakistan, the Congo and elsewhere and a member of President Kennedy's inner circle in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
But he was perhaps best known as an early and consistent opponent of American involvement in Vietnam: a devil's advocate who challenged the basic assumptions about the war, yet never lost his influence within the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.
As early as 1961, when most Americans had no inkling of where Vietnam was, let alone what was going on there, Mr. Ball was urging President Kennedy not to send American servicemen, warning that hundreds of thousands of troops might ultimately have to go.
 
The Vietnamese Detour
 Later, when the Johnson Administration built up American involvement in the war, he argued against "the Vietnamese detour with its deep ruts and treacherous quicksands." Later on, he did not favor unilateral American withdrawal, but sought reduced involvement and a political settlement with the Communists.
"By a series of small steps, taken in good faith over a period of years," he said as the conflict swelled, "we have mired ourselves in a frustrating war that turns our otherwise sensible countrymen into placard-carrying hysterics and impedes our coming to grips with fundamental problems in our cities, our society and the world."
His opposition was not founded on pacifism, morality or other principles espoused by antiwar demonstrators. Indeed, he found it "stupid and unattractive" that antiwar protesters engaged "in self-flagellation, declaring in sanctimonious tones that American policy is thoroughly in the wrong and that we as a nation are as brutal and viciously ambitious as the other side."
His dissenting views stemmed rather from his belief that Southeast Asia was peripheral to American interests, diverting attention from the main arena, which he said lay in Europe.
 
Focus on Europe
 This theme -- that a united Western Europe was the key to American foreign policy because it would strengthen the Atlantic alliance and provide a cushion between the United States and the Soviet Union -- was, in fact, the touchstone of Mr. Ball's vision of global politics.
In this vision, the United States, a unified Europe and the Soviet Union would come finally to an East-West rapprochement, and these stronger nations of the northern half of the world, working together, would help the poorer peoples of the Southern Hemisphere, ultimately bringing peace and plenty to the planet.
With Europe and its problems as his immediate focus, Mr. Ball thus concluded that the whole Asian mainland, not merely Vietnam, was peripheral to American interests and that fighting there constituted an enormous waste of human and national resources.
Communist China, he contended, was overrated as a menace, and its existence should be accepted forthrightly. He favored trade with China, United Nations membership for Beijing and abandonment of the "myth" that Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan represented China.
 
Views Did Not Prevail
 Mr. Ball's views, for the most part, did not prevail while he was in office, though by the end of the Johnson years many top policy makers believed, as he had, that the Vietnam War could not be won. For most of his tenure, however, Mr. Ball was regarded in the Government as a kind of loyal oppositon.
"I've become," as he once said, "a champion of lost causes."
Detractors contended he was being used by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and President Johnson as a sophisticated yes man who could be relied upon to raise cogent objections and then be overruled, so critics could not say dissenting views were unheard in policy-making circles. But Mr. Ball's admirers called him a team player in the best sense and said his views were valued and had a moderating influence.
When he resigned as Under Secretary in 1966 to return to private life, Mr. Ball left on friendly terms and silenced his criticism of the war during the remaining Johnson years. It was not until after President Nixon took office that he attacked America's Vietnam policy publicly again.
He was called back several times in the Johnson Administration, serving on a Presidential advisory group that urged an end to a further buildup of the Vietnam War and providing counsel when North Korea captured an American intelligence ship, the Pueblo, in January 1968.
 
Author and Counsel
 In May 1968, President Johnson named Mr. Ball as the United States delegate to the United Nations after Arthur J. Goldberg, another opponent of the Vietnam War, resigned, apparently in frustration over his diminishing influence.
Mr. Ball returned to work as an investment banker when President Nixon entered the White House in 1969, but was called back by President Carter for counsel on crises in Iran and the Persian Gulf and on the Panama Canal Treaties. He also continued to write articles and books, occasionally stirring controversy with his views on Israel, the Middle East and other subjects.
Mr. Ball was the author of five books, "The Discipline of Power: Essentials of a Modern World Structure," published in 1968; "Diplomacy for a Crowded World," in 1976; "The Past Has Another Pattern," a memoir, in 1982; "Error and Betrayal in Lebanon," in 1983, and "The Passionate Attachment," a history of American-Israeli relations, written with his son, Douglas, in 1992. At his death, he was working on a book about America at the end of the 20th Century.
Tall, burly, with white wavy hair, a cleft chin and gray eyes behind dark- rimmed spectacles, Mr. Ball was a forceful speaker whose style, in writing too, struck an academic tone with literary flourishes. His sentences often began ponderously but wound up with stingers in the tail. In a memo to President Kennedy, for example, he wrote: "Whenever we extend the hand of friendship to President de Gaulle, he puts into it a dead fish."
 
Native of Iowa

George Wildman Ball was born on Dec. 21, 1909, in Des Moines, the third son of Amos and Edna Wildman Ball. His mother was a teacher and his father was a Scottish immigrant who became a vice president of Standard Oil of Indiana.
The family moved to Evanston, Ill., when George was 11, and he later enrolled at Northwestern University. He majored in English, founded a literary magazine, graduated in 1930 and earned his law degree from Northwestern in 1933.
Eager to become a part of the New Deal, he went to Washington and worked in the Farm Credit Bureau and in the Treasury Department. But his enthusiasm soon paled and he returned to Chicago in 1935 to join a tax law firm, one of whose partners was Adlai E. Stevenson. The two became close friends, and Mr. Stevenson, who went to Washington in 1941, helped place Mr. Ball in 1942 as a lawyer with the Lend-Lease Administration.
In London in 1944-45, Mr. Ball was director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, appraising the effects of the air war against Germany. It was in this capacity that he met and became close to Jean Monnet, who was to become known after the war as the architect of the European unification movement.
Captivated by Mr. Monnet's vision of Europe as a unified political-economic entity that could be a bulwark of Western strength, Mr. Ball after the war supported the unification cause, in effect becoming its Washington representative.
 
Lobbied for Common Market
 He became a founding partner of the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Ball, which represented the Common Market and the European Coal and Steel Community, and he pushed the first abortive efforts of British entry into the Common Market.
It was a short step into the political arena after Mr. Stevenson, then Governor of Illinois, joined the race for President in 1952. Then, and again in 1956, Mr. Ball was chief of volunteers in the Stevenson Presidential campaigns. In 1960, he backed John F. Kennedy.
When the Kennedy Administration took office, Mr. Ball was named Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. But less than a year later, when Chester Bowles resigned in November 1961, Mr. Ball was named Under Secretary of State.
Mr. Ball became an Administration trouble-shooter, shuttling between Athens, Ankara and Nicosia to mediate crises over Cyprus, and dashing off to Pakistan, the Congo, the Dominican Republic and other trouble spots to ease tensions or halt fighting. He was a prodigious toiler and traveler, often working six days a week and 70 hours at a stretch, and was usually at his best under pressure.
 
In Kennedy's Inner Circle
 He was one of a small circle of advisers to President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, when the discovery that Soviet missiles were being transported and installed in Cuba raised the specter of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Mr. Ball urged a naval blockade of Cuba coupled with a demand that the Soviet missiles be withdrawn, the course that was successfully followed.
After Mr. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Mr. Ball was one of the leaders who went to the White House to work out a transition to the new Administration. Resigning as Under Secretary in 1966, he joined Lehman Brothers and, except for his service at the United Nations and occasional duty as a Presidential adviser, remained with the firm for the rest of his career.
In the Carter Administration, Mr. Ball helped draft long-range American policy in the Persian Gulf. As an adviser to the National Security Council on Iran, he was critical of supporting Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, and favored formation of a broad coalition government in Teheran. He also helped mount a bipartisan effort for Senate ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties.
Mr. Ball's wife, Ruth Murdoch Ball, whom he married in 1932, died last August. He is survived by two sons, John Colin Ball, of West Concord, Mass., and Douglas Bleakly Ball, of Rockville Centre, L.I., and two grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York on June 21.

Joining the gift of water with the gift of love at a baptismal ceremony in Manhattan.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
"We thank thee, Almighty God, for the gift of water." The water that the Rev. Howard T. W. Stowe was praying over last Sunday was in the baptismal font at St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church on West 87th Street in Manhattan, where he is the rector and where he was about to baptize three young parishioners.
At Father Stowe's side was the Rev. Thomas Mafora, who had his own special reasons to be thankful for the gift of water. Father Mafora is the rector of All Saints' Anglican Church in Khuma, South Africa, a black township in the western Transvaal. 
 In the best of times, Khuma is not exactly paradise on earth. But in recent years, with the closing of some of the gold mines that had drawn thousands of workers to the area, many of Khuma's 35,000 people have been unemployed. Then the region was blistered by South Africa's worst drought in the 20th century. In February 1992, the white farmers on the Town Council of Stilfontein cut off Khuma's water supply.
The consequences of this were not altogether lost on the white authorities. Almost immediately, they warned whites in the area that their domestic servants who lived in Khuma had no water or sanitary services available and therefore could contaminate their employers with cholera, dysentery, diarrhea or other diseases.
"You are hereby requested to insure that your domestic servant/employee does not prepare any foodstuffs or handle any utensils unless she has washed herself properly," the Town Council announced.
While the whites may have been spared, Khuma's blacks were not. Word of the deaths and diseases wracking the township soon reached St. Ignatius of Antioch, a sister parish with All Saints since 1990.
St. Ignatius is an unusual parish. The Mass on Sunday, celebrated with the priests' backs to the congregation and rich with more Latin than one is likely to hear this side of Rome, would make the heart of the Vatican's Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger leap with joy -- until he realized that two of the celebrants at the altar or in the pulpit were women.
The solemn ritual does not keep the parish from offering help to parishioners and neighbors with AIDS or from running a soup kitchen and weekend shelter for the homeless. Informed of Khuma's plight, St. Ignatius quickly raised $20,000 from parishioners, friends and several other Episcopal parishes to pay for the drilling of a well in Khuma.
"We thank thee, Almighty God, for the gift of water," Father Stowe said in his prayer. "Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation. Through it Thou didst lead the children of Israel out of their bondage in Egypt and into the land of promise."
Last Sunday was the feast of Pentecost, or Whitsunday, and so Father Mafora preached on the transformation of Jesus's disciples by the coming of the Holy Spirit. Recounting the dissipation of the disciples' fear, he could not help but speak of his country and its passage out of bondage.
In June 1976, he said, the schoolchildren of Soweto, armed with "no weapon but the weapon of the Holy Spirit -- hope," were able to galvanize black South Africans to express their outrage over apartheid.
Father Mafora, a short, solid man who is 52 years old, had witnessed that protest. After Mass last Sunday he recalled his days as a priest at St. Paul's Anglican Church in Soweto. It was near a crossroads where the marching schoolchildren confronted the police on June 16, 1976. The children fled into the churchyard, which was bombarded with tear gas, he said, and the first one killed was Hector Peterson, a 13-year-old parishioner of St. Paul's.
At All Saints' Church in Khuma they call it Jacob's Well, after the place where Jesus told the Samaritan woman that he would give the water of eternal life (John 4:14). The well is in the churchyard, and people can get water free when they need it.
Since late last year the rains have returned. ("We call them rains of blessing," Father Mafora said.) The local authorities have begun to construct a better water supply for the whole township. "But the push came from this well," he said.
"We thank Thee, o Father, for the water of baptism," Father Stowe continued. "In it we are buried with Christ in His death. By it we share in His resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit."
When the thanksgiving over the water was completed, Father Stowe poured some on the heads of Anthony Clemons, Caroline Metz and Randolph Shorter, welcoming them into the community of the baptized.
It was water from Jacob's Well. It was, Father Mafora said, "pure from the ground and all across the sea."
Could anything better illustrate the idea of a sacrament? When the St. Ignatius parish put out a flyer seeking donations for the well, it had carried a line from W. H. Auden: "Thousands have lived without love, not one without water."
On Sunday, surely, the two were one.

HEADLINE: CHINA WELCOMES U.S. TRADE POLICY

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 27

 BODY:
China today welcomed President Clinton's decision to separate trade from human rights, saying a "historic opportunity" exists to improve relations between the United States and China, and pledging to make "major efforts" in that direction.
At a minimum, United States officials expect China to release several more well-known political prisoners, some with serious medical problems, and to complete an agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross to open China's prisons to outside inspection. 
 "If we get momentum in the relationship, and if there are some human rights improvements in coming months, then the President can very legitimately continue to stand up and say he did the right thing and not be pressured by Congress into reimposing the linkage," one Western diplomatic official said.
"It is absolutely critical that China in the coming weeks and months genuinely cooperate in a variety of areas to send the right signals," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Those signals, he said, would include China's continuing to release political prisoners as well as being seen as "addressing human rights issues important to the United States, including Tibet."
Over the last several months, China has arrested a number of dissidents as part of a nationwide clampdown in the name of maintaining "social stability." Labor organizers in Shanghai and Beijing have been jailed for drafting petitions to the Government, and intellectuals have been rounded up for calling for a new national debate on democracy and political reform.
Among those arrested was Wei Jingsheng, the country's best-known dissident, whose release last September after 14 years of imprisonment seemed to signal political relaxation. Western officials are now hoping that after the sensitive 5th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, these dissidents will once again be freed from detention.
In a lengthy statement issued today on Mr. Clinton's decision to extend China's special trading benefits, China's Foreign Ministry said: "The Chinese Government and people welcome this decision of President Clinton. The current situation offers a historic opportunity for the enhancement" of relations between the two countries.
The Chinese statement added, without providing specifics, that Beijing would make "major efforts for the improvement and growth" of relations and called on Washington to do the same.
 
Months of Talks
 Talks between White House emissaries and the Chinese leadership have been under way for several months, the Western official said, "and I think the dialogue has helped to clarify for the Chinese what it is the President is looking for."
"I know Washington is looking very carefully at what the deeds as well as the words actually are, and it is very important that the Chinese take the high road," the Western official said. "If there is only grudging acceptance of the new approach, combined with many more arrests and other sorts of acts that could be interpreted as 'in your face,' then it will make it much more difficult for the President to get through the next political season.
"I hope that what has come out of this private dialogue," he said, "is that the Chinese now do have a real stake in the relationship, and they realize President Clinton himself has personally put a lot at stake."
 
Diplomatic Visits to Increase
 The diplomat also said high-level diplomatic visits are likely to increase in the months ahead to consolidate Mr. Clinton's new policy, including talks to lay the groundwork for mutual state visits by the Chinese and American Presidents.
"There is definite talk about high-level visits," the official said. "One could imagine a series of exchanges and visits that would demonstrate an obvious improvement in the relationship. Under an optimistic scenario, Washington is ready for that."
China's Communist Party leaders did not comment directly on the decision in a day of meetings that centered on the visit of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia. On evening news broadcasts, the story of Mr. Clinton's decision appeared near the end of the program.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, met with foreign journalists twice during the day, but declined to characterize Mr. Clinton's decision as a victory for China. Instead, he chose diplomatic language and reiterated China's theme that trade relations are mutually beneficial and should not be the battleground for clashes over China's human rights record.
 
Call for End to Sanctions
 He called on the Clinton Administration to remove the last sanctions placed on high technology and military sales after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown by army troops on pro-democracy demonstrators that left hundreds dead.
"What the U.S. side did in the past few years," Mr. Wu said, "has impaired the bilateral trade and economic exchanges and the overall relations between the two countries, to the strong dissatisfaction of the two peoples."
"We have to point out with regret that while announcing the renewal" of China's low-tariff trade benefits, "the U.S. side stated that the existing sanctions against China would be maintained," Mr. Wu said. He added that he hoped the United States "will immediately remove all sanctions against China and abandon all measures detrimental to the development" of better relations.
In Beijing, American and Western business leaders were more demonstrative in their support for the decision, with most managers expressing relief that the annual uncertainty over the course of Washington's China policy has been removed.
 
Praise of U.S. Business Group
 "The President's decision should avert a trade war that would have wrought havoc on U.S. businesses, workers and consumers," a business coalition for United States-China trade said in a statement.
"American business serves as a positive force for change in China," said Calman J. Cohen, a spokesman for the coalition. "Our Chinese employees, managers and workers are exposed to Western values, encouraged to think independently, and offered opportunities previously unavailable in China."
Human rights organizations appeared determined to challenge Mr. Clinton's decision, and they expressed concern that the change will spell harsh consequences for dissidents in China.
Asia Watch, a human rights monitoring group, warned in a statement that "outspoken intellectuals, workers and religious activists who had the courage to express their views might now be more vulnerable to persecution and arrests, given that Chinese leaders understand that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption in trade."
Most dissidents in recent days have slipped out of Beijing or into seclusion as China's security authorities have made it clear they will not tolerate any attempt to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

HEADLINE: Christopher Presses Policy Of Engagement With Asia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, speaking in New York yesterday, cast President Clinton's decision to renew China's preferred trade status as part of a stepped-up policy of engagement throughout Asia.
In a speech to the Asia Society, Mr. Christopher said President Clinton's decision on Thursday to engage China, rather than punish it, was part of a strategy to build stability in Asia and share the continent's prosperity. 
"The President's decision reflects a comprehensive U.S. strategy of engagement and leadership in the Asia-Pacific," arena, he said. "It encourages Chinese cooperation in building a new regional and international order based upon peace and security."
He said extending China's trade privileges was part of a policy the Administration pursued in several ways this week: exchanging diplomatic missions with Vietnam, resuming talks with Japan over its trade barriers, and announcing talks with North Korea on its nuclear program.
 
The North Korean Angle
 Eager to respond to criticisms of the President's decision, Mr. Christopher also noted that China's cooperation was important for a chief foreign policy goal: persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
"Our relationship with China is important to all Americans," he said. "China possesses the world's largest army, a nuclear arsenal, and, not insignificantly, a veto in the United Nations Security Council."
Defending the President's decision, Mr. Christopher said China was too important to be isolated and too big to be pushed around. He added that its huge, fast-growing economy is a lucrative market for American companies.
Mr. Christopher asserted that the United States would continue to keep the heat on Beijing to improve its human rights performance.
"We're not backing away in any way from pursing human rights problems," he said, asserting that Washington's human rights dialogue with Beijing would intensify.
His speech was part of the Administration's damage control after lawmakers and human rights groups accused the President of flip-flopping after he had condemned President Bush for coddling China's rulers.
In an interview, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who heads a House caucus that has pushed for tough measures on China's human rights performance, said that although the President said on Thursday he would ban imports of Chinese weapons and ammunition, he "didn't announce any real sanctions yesterday."
She and other lawmakers are drafting a broader sanctions bill that is expected to call for denying favorable tariffs to products made by industries owned by China's military -- a measure that is expected to cover close to $1 billion of China's $30 billion in exports to the United States. It is estimated the ban on munitions will affect only $100 million in trade.
At the address, Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, voiced concern that the sanctions adopted were of only "token" significance.

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT BRISK 3% RATE IN FIRST QUARTER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
In a recalculation of first-quarter growth, the Government reported today that the economy expanded at a steady 3 percent annual clip during the winter because spending by consumers, business and the Federal Government was more than had originally been thought.
The surprising upward revision, from a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent, touched off a decline in the bond market as investors reacted to fears that the stronger growth could cause inflation and erode the value of fixed-income securities. 
 The figures coincided with Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said the economy was not yet reflecting any of the restraining effects from the four increases in short-term interest rates since early February. [Page 35.]
The latest figures -- while showing only half the growth rate of the fourth quarter of last year -- pointed to further solid expansion, with analysts predicting a rate of perhaps 4 percent in the April-to-June quarter. After that, they expect the economy to settle back to a pace it can sustain without risking revived inflation -- roughly 2.5 percent.
"Three percent G.D.P. in the face of the California earthquake and unusually severe weather is pretty darn impressive," said Joshua N. Feinman, an economist at the Bankers Trust Company. Like most economists, he had been anticipating a modest decline, not an increase, in the Commerce Department's revision of figures, a recalculation the agency performs twice each quarter as it obtains more complete information.
With the quickened first-quarter growth in mind, traders and economists began to focus on the release next Friday of the Government's figures on the job market in May. The employment report is considered the most important single gauge of economic conditions.
"Recent comforting hopes that the expansion is slowing significantly were undermined today by an upward revision to first-quarter G.D.P.," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, told his clients. "Such hopes could vanish altogether next week if job growth remains strong. Robust hiring would remind markets that a 125-basis-point increase in the Federal funds rate will not be sufficient to dramatically slow economic growth."
As a result, Mr. Lipsky suggested, a resumption of Federal Reserve moves to raise short-term interest rates could seem "much less distant."
Although the growth rate for the first quarter was a good deal less than the boomlike 7 percent rate in the final three months of 1993, it was higher than the 2.5 percent or so that analysts generally consider to be sustainable in the long run without sparking a surge in inflation. This estimate is based on the assumption of an annual rise of 1.5 percent in productivity, combined with growth of 1 percent in the work force.
Perhaps the most important element in the revision of the G.D.P. reported today was the growth in final sales -- spending and investment without regard to what happens to inventories -- at a rate of 2.2 percent, more than double the rise of nine-tenths of 1 percent reported for the quarter in the first G.D.P. report in late April.
 
Consumer Spending Up
 Spending by consumers was raised to a rate of 4.6 percent, from 3.8 percent, with purchases of nondurable goods like clothing up substantially while spending on services and on cars and other durable goods was modestly higher.
Business investment was higher than first estimated and the import-export sector was less of a drag, the department also found.
But the most startling change -- and the biggest after the increase in personal consumption -- was in nonmilitary spending by the Federal Government, which now shows an 18.3 percent rate of advance instead of a 7.6 percent rate of decline.
The biggest negative influence, though widely expected, was that inventories rose much less than previously estimated -- at a rate of $19.1 billion instead of $30.5 billion. But while this adjustment cut into first-quarter growth, it implied more potential demand for production in subsequent months as merchants replenished shelves and warehouses.
G.D.P., which measures the output of all goods and services in the country, counts everything produced regardless of whether it reaches the ultimate user.
 
Decline in Savings Rate
 As a result of continued heavy spending by consumers, combined with modest income growth and an end to a huge push of mortgage refinancings, the personal savings rate is now calculated at an unusually low 3.5 percent. This compares with 3.7 percent last month and 4 percent for the final 1993 quarter.
The dwindling amount of cash freed up by refinancing is one reason to expect some slackening of economic growth, said John E. Barnds, director of business and banking analysis at the NBD Bank in Detroit. He projects expansion at a rate of 2.75 to 3 percent in the second half of the year.
Today's report also brought an upward revision in inflation, to a 2.6 percent annual rate from 2.3 percent, as measured by the fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases. Analysts expressed no particular concern, however, noting that another inflation statistic in the report, the G.D.P. deflator, remained at the previously reported rate of 2.6 percent. The deflator takes account of changes in the composition of output.
Corporate profits, in today's first estimate for the quarter, fell $33.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate after rising $39.4 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. About $29 billion of the decline was attributed to the Los Angeles earthquake in January, which caused insurance companies to pay out benefits and led companies to take write-offs of uninsured damage to their property.

HEADLINE: Boutros-Ghali Says Sanctions on Haiti Need 'Several Weeks'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said today that he would wait no more than several weeks before asking the Security Council to consider whether tougher measures are needed to oust Haiti's military leaders.
To give expanded trade sanctions against Haiti some chance to work, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, the United Nations plans to provide helicopters and other equipment to the Dominican Republic to encourage the country to patrol its border with Haiti and prevent embargoed goods from getting through. 
 The Secretary General's comments, made after a meeting at the White House with President Clinton, suggested that he is in rough accord with Administration officials, who have expressed a growing determination to end the dictatorship in Haiti.
 
No Word on Force
 Mr. Boutros-Ghali would not say whether he would favor using military force to restore democracy to Haiti, a step Mr. Clinton and his aides have said they would consider if the near-total embargo imposed last weekend fails to oust military officers who took power in a 1991 coup. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali said that it would be "a question of weeks" before he would ask the Security Council to debate tougher action.
That is far less time than Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France suggested. He said sanctions should be allowed as long as four months to work.
A senior Administration official cautioned today that no change in the American course is likely until after Mr. Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott complete a broad effort in the next two weeks to consult with other countries.
The official also noted that Mr. Boutros-Ghali must report to the Security Council by June 30 about the sanctions' effect and said that his comments today may in part reflect that deadline.
A senior White House official who described the sense of urgency about Haiti within the Administration referred to it "a matter of political and economic reality."
While Mr. Clinton has promised for now to provide hearings for Haitian refugees before sending them back to Port-au-Prince, the official suggested that it had become increasingly clear that the policy would serve as no more than an interim solution.
William Gray, Mr. Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said after meetings this week with the Dominican Republic he was "feeling very upbeat" about the prospect of curbing shipments across the frontier.

HEADLINE: Korea Speeds Nuclear Fuel Removal, Impeding Inspection

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
In a new challenge to Washington, North Korea has stepped up its removal of fuel from a nuclear reactor, prompting concern that it may prevent international monitors from carrying out crucial inspections, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The move surprised the Clinton Administration, which only a week ago offered to begin high-level talks with the North Korean Government in Pyongyang. 
 Clinton Administration officials said they did not know whether the quickened pace reflected a determination on North Korea's part to destroy possible evidence that it had diverted fuel to its nuclear weapons program or was merely a bluff intended to throw inspectors and the United States off balance.
But it generated alarm and pessimism within the Administration, which has been taking a conciliatory tone toward North Korea this week.
At the same time, the Administration has warned that if the evidence is destroyed, not only will the high-level talks be called off, but the United States will have no choice but to press for international economic sanctions -- a move that North Korea has said it would consider an act of war.
The offer to hold talks was made on the condition that the North Koreans not divert fuel from the reactor at Yongbyon to make bombs or prevent inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency from inspecting some of the fuel rods currently in the reactor.
Specifically, the atomic energy agency wants North Korea to put aside 300 of the 8,000 rods from specific parts of the reactor so that measurements might be carried out in the future to determine how much plutonium the North Koreans might have diverted in past years.
 
Difficulty of Verification
 Hans Blix, the director general of the atomic energy agency, told Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations Secretary General, today that North Korea's discharge of fuel was now proceeding "at a very fast pace." He said the country had already removed more than 3,000 of the rods, effectively discharging nearly half the fuel in the reactor's core.
If the North Koreans continue to withdraw the rods at the current rate, they will have removed the rods the agency wants to inspect in a matter of days.
"Almost half of the fuel in the reactor core has been discharged and in a pattern that has precluded the agency's ability to implement the full range of the safeguards measures required," Mr. Blix said in a letter to Mr. Boutros-Ghali.
Should that happen, the atomic energy agency "would not be able to verify the amount of plutonium produced" in North Korea, Mr. Blix added.
The head of the nuclear monitoring agency also reported that talks between the agency and North Korea over inspecting the fuel rods had broken down and that the North Koreans had refused to discuss the agency's concerns.
 
Exchanges Go Poorly
 Adding to the renewed sense of crisis, Clinton Administration officials reported that working-level exchanges between American and North Korean officials this week did not go well.
When the American side proposed that the high-level talks be held in early June, the North Koreans responded by rejecting the Americans' demand that North Korea put aside some of the rods at the Yongbyon reactor for future inspection, a senior Clinton Administration official said.
In the hope of reaching an accommodation with North Korea, Washington and the atomic energy agency have taken a flexible stance. They have not insisted on immediate measurements of the fuel rods, but rather demanded that the possibility of inspecting them in the future be preserved.
A senior Clinton Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he was baffled by the North Korean move. He said there was no technical or safety reason for withdrawing the rods and noted that their removal would preclude the high-level talks with Washington.
Worried by Mr. Blix's report, American officials were hurriedly consulting diplomats at the United Nations today about the possibility of issuing a warning to North Korea. The C.I.A. and most other intelligence agencies say they believe that there is a "better than even" chance that North Korea has already produced one or two nuclear bombs, an assertion North Korea has denied.

HEADLINE: Street Peddlers in New York

 BODY:
New York City has lost 325,000 jobs -- that's a third of a million paychecks -- over the last five years. With unemployment on the rise and immigrants still streaming in looking for work, people by the thousands have turned to hawking goods illegally in the streets. Street vendors and their clamor are an integral part of life in the city. But the makeshift markets they create often make sidewalks impassable, allow opportunities for protection rackets and undercut legitimate merchants.
The Giuliani administration is right to crack down on illegal vendors, especially on dangerously crowded thoroughfares like Harlem's 125th Street. But the administration must also make it easier for those who wish to operate within the law to do so. That means creating more vendor licenses and establishing locations where they can sell their wares without creating a hazard to public safety. 
 Immigrants have always treated New York's streets as a marketplace where hard work and grit could lead to economic security. Early in the century, lower Manhattan was so choked with pushcarts that stores could not get deliveries and police and fire wagons had trouble navigating the streets. Licensing requirements and street restrictions have eased the crush in most of Manhattan's business districts. But uptown neighborhoods and areas of Brooklyn and Queens have recently become problems.
Along 125th Street in Harlem, laws governing street vending have no effect at all. Two years ago when David Dinkins, then Mayor, tried to sweep illegal vendors from the street, they staged a demonstration that shut the business strip down. A truce was called and illegal vending continued.
Vendors from all over the region took the truce as an invitation and swarmed into Harlem. Once there were about 200 vendors on 125th Street, some of whom had occupied the same spaces for as long as 10 years. These days on weekends as many as 1,000 hawkers clog the sidewalks, impeding police work and openly competing with legitimate merchants. The merchants are fined for garbage that vendors leave on the sidewalks. Competition among the vendors for space leads to street fights.
The city now proposes moving the vendors off the main thoroughfares and into open-air markets. The markets would be license-free zones where people pay a fee to operate. Those who refuse to relocate and continue illegal vending would be prosecuted.
Even the vendors concede that 125th Street is out of control. At the same time, they fear going out of business if the open-air sites are too far from prime shopping areas. The vendors also complain that the city's cap of 853 licenses for general vendors gives them no choice but to operate outside the law. The Department of Consumer affairs, which administers the licenses, has a waiting list of 5,000 people.
A report three years ago from the Department of Consumer Affairs pointed out that the cap was arbitrary, and recommended raising it. "Under this proposal," it said, "more vendors would have a stake in the regulatory system and an incentive to adhere to restrictions, to pay taxes, and to generally behave as a good neighbor." Unlicensed vendors have no such commitment; they operate with impunity, where and how they please.
By all means, enforce the law against illegal street peddling. But also make it possible to work within the law.

HEADLINE: Beach Season Begins Without a Cloud in the Forecast

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELMAR, N.J., May 26

 BODY:
After years of bad news about fouled water, pinched vacation budgets and storm-damaged beaches and boardwalks, the summer of 1994 appears to be shaping up as a good one both for beachgoers and those who depend on the summertime sun-and-sand crowd to make a living.
"We've received very positive indications from a cross-section of businesses at the shore that bookings for beach rentals are up above last year and water quality is excellent," said Karen Shaffer, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Tourism. 
 There is optimism as well in New York and Connecticut. Joan K. Davidson, Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for New York, said: "Early reports on beach conditions are good and we hope they hold up. It may be the best year in a long time."
 
Pure Fun and Big Bucks
 There are those who speak almost mystically of the lure of the ocean and its eternal rhythms. But for people like 19-year-old Cindy McGuire of West Orange, N.J., the attraction is as plainly evident as a nut-brown suntan or a roiling ride on a breaking wave.
"Summertime without the beach would be a complete drag," said Ms. McGuire, a secretary for a data analysis company who skipped a half-day at work this week to ride with friends to the beach at Belmar when temperatures reached the 80's. "The beach is pure fun."
It is also big bucks. The local and state economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have billions of dollars riding on how many people throng to area beaches this summer, which unofficially begins this Memorial Day weekend no matter what the calendar says.
Day-trippers and vacationers to the Jersey Shore's 127 miles of beaches contribute as much as $10 billion a year to the state's tourist economy. New York and to a lesser extent Connecticut also have extensive public and private investments that can soar or plunge depending on millions of decisions made each day of the summer by people who look at the sky and wonder if it is a good day for the beach.
They did not always think so in the late 1980's, when beachfronts were plagued with floating garbage, sewage and litter, including discarded hypodermic needles.
By the time New York City stopped ocean dumping of waste materials and other sources of pollution were halted, a new problem washed ashore in the form of a serious recession that cut into vacation budgets.
Then the coastline was battered by three powerful northeasters between October 1991 and December 1992, and millions of tons of sand were stripped from beaches and dunes.
Beachfront businesses like Lynne Watt's Beach Sweets, an ice cream and candy shop on the boardwalk in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., were wrecked by waves.
"Last summer was a nightmare because we were still rebuilding," Mrs. Watt said. "But now we're in great shape, and I have wrinkles on my face from smiling."
Severe erosion kept people away from Fire Island and a few other hard-hit Long Island beaches last year despite a persistent heat wave and water conditions so clear bathers were frightened by fish they could see for the first time. Rentals have picked up this season though property sales continue to lag, said Deborah Alter, owner of Fire Island Summer Space, a real-estate agency.
Long Island's 10 state beaches head into the summer in good shape, said Susan Gordon Ryan, regional director of the state park system. "There were a lot of snowstorms last winter, but none of them caused much beach erosion," she said.
 
'It Must Be the Cabin Fever'
 Memory of excellent beach conditions apparently merged with a terrible winter to induce many people to start reserving accommodations early for this year. On eastern Long Island many of the summer rentals are already booked in a market with season prices ranging from $3,000 for a one-room cabana to $170,000 for a house on the ocean with amenities like a private tennis court.
In Sea Girt, N.J., typical houses rent for $12,000 to $15,000 a summer, $30,000 if they are on the beach, said Kathryn Matthews, owner of G. A. Murphy Realtors.
"There are very few rentals left and our beach was already crowded last weekend like it was already July," she said. "It must be the cabin fever feeling of being locked up by all the snow last winter."
While it's possible to board a New York City subway or bus for Coney Island or the Rockaways, many people believe going to the beach means getting far away from the city. In the case of Lara Abrash and Gary Gugh of Hoboken, that means going to the Hamptons -- and paying for the privilege.
Ms. Abrash, a seasoned veteran of the Hampton scene, says she pays $28 for a round-trip ticket on the Long Island Rail Road. For those who make the trip by car, parking at the beach costs $10 a day, she added, and bars have a $10 entrance fee in the evening.
"It can easily cost me $100 for the weekend, and that's with eating pizzas or having barbecues," she said.
To reduce their costs, she and Mr. Gugh pay $150 apiece to have access on five weekends to a one-room bungalow that rents for $3,000 a summer. That means, she said, that as many as 10 to 12 people pile into the structure on a weekend, with most sleeping on the floor.
Rental agents and owners say that they discourage such overcrowding but that it makes the summer affordable for young people of modest means.
New Jersey this year has a new law called the seasonal rental ordinance, more popularly known as the "Animal House" law, that forces landlords to post bonds as high as $5,000 if they rent to rowdy groups that persistently draw the attention of the police. It is aimed at giving oceanfront communities the power to shut down rental units crammed with late-night revelers.
 
Radio-Free Areas
 Other additions aimed at keeping the peace at beaches this summer are radio-free zones on state beaches on Long Island. The aim of the clearly designated sections will be to preserve the natural ambience while heading off potential duels between heavy metal and grunge rockers, or salsa and rap aficionados.
Another trend -- nature and local history tours -- is propelled by the increasing number of people who love the beach but fear too much exposure to the sun.
"People are not sunbathing as long as they used to, and there's an effort to develop things that appeal to them," said Barbara Steele, director of tourism development in Ocean County.
On Long Beach Island there is the Jolly Trolley, sponsored by the Alliance for a Living Ocean, that generates interest in the seaside environment. In Monmouth County, Maryann Sabanskas, an environmental planning official, is knitting together the Bayshore Trail system, a waterfront network of bike and walking paths that will lead visitors from the beach along a string of historic and cultural sights on the southern edge of Raritan Bay.
 
Lasers, and Symphonies
 Moreover, competing beach towns are doing more to expand free activities to hold on to beachgoers after the sun goes down. In Point Pleasant Beach, which bills itself as a family destination, there are laser light shows on Sundays, symphony nights on Wednesdays, fireworks on Thursdays and weekly comings and goings of shows featuring elephants, tropical birds, clowns and cowboys.
Everyone agrees, however, that while all these diversions are welcome additions, the success of the summer comes down to one element only.
"If the sun shines we make money, if it rains we don't," concluded Tom Santorielli, a 67-year old counterman at Little Mac's, a boardwalk booth at Point Pleasant Beach that serves pizzas and traditional fare like sausage with peppers and onions on a roll.
After 40 years of summer work on the boardwalk, he observed, the ocean still rolls up the beach with a foamy hiss, youths fall in and out of love on a weekend, and people eat cotton candy and salt water taffy as a ritual.
"The only things that change are the prices," he added, saying that when he started on the boardwalk a whole pizza cost 75 cents, and now a slice goes for $1.70.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 3.68 In a Quiet Trading Day

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
As traders streamed out of Wall Street yesterday for the long Memorial Day weekend, the stock market closed up, but just barely, in quiet trading.
Stocks in the indexes did not rise by much, perhaps held back by a surprising economic report and falling bond prices that on another day might have stampeded traders into a strong selloff. 
 Nonetheless, McDonald's rose 1 1/8, to 61, after splitting its stock 2 for 1 and raising its quarterly dividend. Wal-Mart rose 1/4, to 23 7/8, and Bell Atlantic rose 1, to 53 1/2, on no immediate news.
General Electric rose 1/2, to 49, despite the filing of a G.E. shareholder lawsuit against Kidder, Peabody & Company, a G.E. unit, and Joseph Jett, a bond trader whom G.E. accused of creating $350 million in phony profits. Mr. Jett, who was dismissed, has denied any wrongdoing.
An exception to the mild stock movement was DSC Communications, a telecommunications equipment maker that is still suffering market consequences from losing a large Bell Atlantic contract to AT&T last week. DSC stock fell 15/16 , to 223/16 . At 4.3 million shares in Nasdaq trading, DSC was the most heavily traded stock yesterday.
The number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange was off sharply at about 186.4 million shares, more than a third lower than this year's average of 301 million shares.
The surprising Commerce Department report, for revised first-quarter gross domestic product growth, showed that the economy was growing faster than expected, but not by much -- a 3.0 percent pace, instead of the initial estimate of 2.6 percent.
What sent bond prices falling was Wall Street economists' expectation that the revision would be downward to 2.3 percent rather than upward, mainly because of the severe winter weather and the huge earthquake in California. The first-quarter revised number underscored the strength of the economy and its potential sparking a jump in inflation later this year. The inflation rate now is around 2.5 percent.
Long-term interest rates rose, in part over these inflation concerns. The most closely watched fixed-income investment, the 30-year Treasury bond, fell 10/32 , to 8614/32 , and the yield rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.36 percent the day before. Trading stopped at 2 P.M. for the holiday.
For the few stock traders left yesterday, a closely watched inflation indicator added to trading anxieties. The Commodity Research Bureau futures price index rose yesterday after falling for three straight days. It rose 1.27 points, to 230.88, mainly on rises in futures contracts for cattle, coffee and pork bellies.
And Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, could not have relieved trader anxieties, either. In his defense of the Fed's four increases in interest rates this year, Mr. Greenspan appeared to leave the door open even for more increases because of "uncertainties regarding the economic outlook."
 
Stock Indexes Barely Budge
 Whatever the case, the leading stock indexes barely budged. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.68 points, to 3,757.14, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.27 point, to 457.33. But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.50 points, to 733.14.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.18 point, to 252.79, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,128 to 913. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.32 points, to 440.94.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, only 12 rose, led by McDonald's and Bethlehem Steel, which rose 7/8, to 19 5/8, following increased assessments by stock analysts.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, only 215 rose, led by General Electric and Wal-Mart.
The most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, at 4 million shares, was Philip Morris, which fell 5/8, to 50, as investors continued to register their disappointment with the Philip Morris's board declining to spin off the controversial cigarette operations.
The most active stock on the American Stock Exchange, at 3.3 million shares, was the Exploration Company of Louisiana, which fell 1/8, to 1 5/8, after rising this week in heavy trading. Earlier this week, an analyst at Gaines Berland Inc., citing his own sources, said the oil company had made a "commercial discovery" of oil in China. He raised his recommendation to "strong speculative buy" from "buy." Exploration Company declined comment.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Dip as G.D.P. Is Revised

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
In abbreviated pre-holiday trading yesterday, prices of Treasury securities declined moderately after rebounding from sharp early losses.
The market dropped after the Government reported an upward revision in the first-quarter gross domestic product to an increase of 3 percent, from the 2.6 percent estimate a month ago. This surprised a bond market that had been expecting a downward revision to around 2.3 percent. 
 Dealers and traders were also focused on the appearance of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Banking Committee. But traders said there was little reaction to his remarks.
Mr. Greenspan did not break new ground for the bond market because traders and investors still expect short-term interest rates to move higher. Last week the Fed raised the Federal funds rate half a percentage point. That was the Fed's fourth rate increase of the year and lifted the central bank's target to 4.25 percent.
 
Long Bond Down
 The Treasury long bond was down 11/32 , to 8614/32 , for a yield of 7.39 percent, up 3 basis points from Thursday and 9 for the week. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said: "Going forward, the focus will clearly be on the economy's growth path and the potential dangers of inflation. Currently the business expansion seems quite balanced and shows no signs of overheating. As a result, the Fed is likely to keep the funds rate at 4.25 percent for some time."
Analysts said the unexpected strength in the revision to first-quarter G.D.P. stemmed largely from Government purchases, which were revised to a decline of 3.6 percent from a decline of 6.2 percent. The rest of the Commerce Department's report differed only slightly from some of the forecasts.
"Inventories were revised down, though not quite as much as expected, while personal consumption and net exports were revised up, also as expected," said Michael Englund, chief economist at MMS International.
Traders said the sharp selloff in bonds on the G.D.P. data appeared to be exaggerated by the thin pre-holiday conditions.
 
Added Downward Pressure
 "Given the size of yesterday's revision to Government spending, one has to wonder why they didn't compute this in the first G.D.P. estimate," Mr. Fine said.
With most market participants reluctant to hold long positions over a three-day weekend, there was added downward pressure on prices.
Other data released yesterday included the final tally of the Michigan Sentiment index of consumer confidence, which was 92.8, up slightly from the 91.5 preliminary May figure as well as the 92.6 April reading.

HEADLINE: White House Drops Bank-Regulation Bid

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today abandoned its effort to overhaul banking regulation this year, concluding that not enough time was left for Congress to act on it and that other initiatives should take precedence.
"It is becoming increasingly evident that this is just not going to be the year to get regulatory consolidation done," said Frank N. Newman, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. 
 The Treasury had sought to combine several agencies that regulate banks and savings and loan institutions, so as to save money for the Government and reduce the regulatory burden on financial institutions.
The decision to delay action represents a political victory for the Federal Reserve, which had bitterly fought the Administration's plan because it would have stripped the central bank of much of its influence over the banking system. Mr. Newman and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen made several concessions this spring to the Fed and the two sides had nearly reached a compromise.
But when Treasury officials began to outline the proposal this week to members of the House and Senate Banking Committees they found limited enthusiasm and a lot of concern about the need for Congress to focus on health care and to deal with two other banking bills before the November elections, said Government officials who insisted on anonymity.
Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said an overhaul plan would be presented next year. "They have some other things they'd like to push," he said, "so we just put it on pause. We hope we can get to the committees a complete version early next year."
Some officials have also suggested that the White House was not enthusiastic about the plan, which was developed by the Treasury Department with fairly little initial interagency consultation. But Robert E. Rubin, the head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, emphatically denied that the White House had stopped the planning.
The decision to postpone legislative action, he said, "has nothing to do with the White House -- that has to do with Secretary Bentsen and chairman Greenspan deciding, as is true of a lot of things, that the legislative calendar was so full that they couldn't do it."
The Administration's original plan called for creating one Federal Banking Commission that would have combined the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision and Office of the Comptroller with most of the bank regulatory functions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. The Fed would have been left with the oversight of a handful of the nation's biggest international banks.
The Treasury's plan initially won support from large bank holding companies that report to several regulators. But support dwindled as regional Federal Reserve officials all over the country began explaining their worries about the plan to local banks. The Fed argued that it needed bank regulatory powers to be able to set monetary policy effectively and respond quickly to financial crises.
Mr. Newman said the arrival of the Memorial Day Congressional recess had persuaded him that the Administration had run out of time.
Complicated health care legislation and two other banking bills have left important committees and members of Congress too busy to begin the lengthy process of working on new legislation from scratch, Mr. Newman said. As a result, the Treasury's banking experts will focus instead for the rest of this year on insuring that the two banking bills reach the President's desk, he said.
One of these bills would make it easier for banks to buy other banks and savings and loans in other states. The other is a collection of many small pieces of banking legislation, notably subsidies for small community financial institutions that lend money to small businesses and individuals in poor neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Gold Prices Move Higher

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against most leading currencies yesterday after failing to pierce a technical resistance level against the German mark.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery rose to $384.70 an ounce, from $383.80 on Thursday. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put the spot gold contract at $384.50 an ounce. 
 Trading in the dollar was sluggish, with many dealers squaring their positions ahead of the long holiday weekend. Financial markets in the United States will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6430 marks, down from 1.6480 marks on Thursday. Earlier in London, it was up slightly to 1.6445 marks, from 1.6425 marks Thursday.
The dollar also slipped to 104.30 yen, from 104.68 yen on Thursday.
The dollar edged up in early trading after the Commerce Department reported that the economy expanded at a revised rate of 3 percent in the first quarter. The result was above analysts' expectations and the Government's initial estimate of 2.6 percent.
But after moving above 1.65 marks, the dollar ran into considerable resistance, finishing lower on the day, traders said. "There was no appetite to take in dollars at those levels," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
There was also little reaction to comments from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who said in testimony before Congress that the recent weakness of the dollar was a source of concern for policy makers.
"He hinted that there was scope for perhaps another quarter-point rise in Fed funds if need be, but he couldn't afford to come out with anything that would upset the bond or equity market," said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica in London.
The British pound rose to $1.5100 in New York, from $1.5080 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4025 Swiss francs, off from 1.4058; 5.6110 French francs, down from 5.6275 Thursday; 1.3860 Canadian dollars, little changed from 1.3855, and 1,588 Italian lire, down from 1,600.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Borrowers Putting Rate Locks To the Test

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
As interest rates have risen the last few months, home buyers have become very eager to lock in a rate when applying for a mortgage. In the last few weeks, fluctuations in rates have also heightened interest in "relocks," a variation allowing borrowers to shift to a lower rate if rates decline during the lock-in period.
But borrowers fixated on the absolute best rate sometimes trip up when using either of these loan provisions. 
 Gary Sweatt, vice president of Mortgage Information Service, a mortgage broker in Wellesley, Mass., said people often failed to allow enough time for closing on a property. He recommends getting a rate that is guaranteed for 60 days. Locks are commonly offered for 30 days or 60 days, though 90-day terms may be available.
Any relock provision in the loan agreement can be exercised once between the application date and the closing date. Many borrowers do not understand that this is a one-time opportunity and that they must notify the lender on the new date to get the rate, Mr. Sweatt said.
"A lot of people who relock assume that they will just get the best rate during the 60 days it takes to close," he said, "and that's not true."
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage as reported by the Federal National Mortgage Association has risen almost two percentage points since the beginning of February, to 8.45 percent, but not without some backsliding. It reached 8.68 percent in early May, its high so far this year. After falling a week ago, it bounced back this week.
 "There has been a lot of interest in relocking because the market has been so volatile, up one day, down the next," said Bruce Lublin, president of Homerica Inc., a mortgage broker in Harrison, N.Y.
The charge for a lock and a relock is usually built into a loan in its interest rate or its points. (A point is a fee paid at closing equal to 1 percent of the loan.) Sometimes, though, a separate fee is charged at the time of application. It is generally a quarter-point to a half-point of the loan amount.
Some lenders offer what they call a buy-down, in which borrowers pay a half-point of the loan amount when they apply to lock in a rate for 60 days. If the rate stays the same or rises, the borrowers get the lock-in rate and the half-point payment is returned at closing. If rates drop and they relock, they forfeit their half-point payment.
"If rates go down more than a quarter-point, it generally pays to do it," Mr. Lublin said.
Lenders offer several other variations on guaranteed mortgage rates. A "look and lock" allows a borrower to hold on to a guaranteed rate for 30 days while shopping for a home. Once a contract is executed, the period is extended 45 days, and, for a small fee -- generally a quarter-point to a half-point -- it will be extended 60 days longer.
"It is really good for somebody who has found a property and is just going to contract," Mr. Lublin said.
A "list and lock" allows a seller to offer prospective buyers a locked-in rate, with a relock option, for 30 days and, after a fully executed contract is presented, for an additional 45 days. For a fee, the guaranteed rate will be extended 60 more days.
"If you have somebody interested, it is a really good inducement," Mr. Lublin said.
Of course, the amount saved by locking or relocking a loan rate may be less than the amount paid for the flexibility.
"If you're looking for the best rate," Mr. Sweatt said, "it is often just a matter of luck."

HEADLINE: We Need Watershed Protection and Filtration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree with the headline "Save the Watershed" (editorial, May 15), but disagree that "saving" the watershed would make filtration unnecessary. The Catskill-Delaware watersheds are so extensively developed, with some 200,000 residents in summer, 50 towns, 400 dairy farms and the discharges of 35 sewage treatment plants, that restoration to its earlier pristine state is not politically or economically feasible. 
 I chaired an Environmental Protection Agency expert panel drawn from outside New York, which issued a report in April 1993 after eight months study. We concluded that both watershed protection and filtration are essential to provide safe water for the people of New York. We based this conclusion in part on the risk of cryptosporidiosis, a serious intestinal disease caused by the parasite cryptosporidium, which comes from cattle and humans, and has been found in Catskill-Delaware waters.
Cryptosporidiosis is relatively new and similar to, but far more serious than giardiasis, which was reported by health authorities in about 2,500 people annually in New York City. Chlorination, the only treatment now available in New York City, while effective in inactivating the cysts of giardia, is not effective against the oocysts of cryptosporidium. New York City has not begun collecting data on cryptosporidiosis, but there is every reason to believe it will be at least as prevalent as giardiasis.
Shortly after the report was published, some 400,000 people in Milwaukee became seriously ill with cryptosporidiosis, with more than 100 deaths and many others permanently incapacitated. This was one of six recent major cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in the United States in the last 10 years. Cryptosporidiosis can be fatal to immuno-compromised individuals such as those who test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, AIDS patients, cancer patients undergoing treatment, very young children and the elderly.
Watershed protection can help reduce the risk from microbial contamination. North Carolina, for example, recently enacted legislation requiring all local authorities that have domain over drinking water watersheds to develop land use plans to be approved by the state. (All surface water supplies in North Carolina are already filtered.) Such legislation, along with land purchases, are valuable. They reduce the health risk and the cost of treatment, but they cannot eliminate the impact of development that has taken place, nor prevent all new development on 1,800 square miles of watershed.
Your conclusion that "To give in to filtration is to concede that New Yorkers cannot strike a sensible compromise between man and nature" is parochial. More than 90 percent of all surface water supplies in the United States, many with much better protected watersheds than New York's, provided filtration for safer water for their communities long before E.P.A. regulations required filtration. The price tag of $8 billion that the New York City Department of Environmental Protection floats and that you repeat is more than fourfold higher than is realistic.
Appropriate filtration would add only about 10 percent to 15 percent to the water bills of customers in the city, part of which should be offset by the excellent conservation and metering programs under way.
The assumption that watershed protection or filtration would be adequate is faulty. Almost all professionals agree that where substantial development has occurred on a watershed, as in New York, watershed protection and filtration are both necessary. New York City does not meet the letter, let alone the intent, of the surface water treatment rule of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Without filtration it is not likely to do so.
Because of far-sighted investments in developing mountain watersheds, New York City has one of the best sources of water of any large city in the world. Filtration will make it one of the safest.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Steady Economy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Having raised short-term interest rates four times in the last four months, the chairman of the nation's central bank said today that the increases had not slowed the economy and that economic growth would continue at its current pace in the second quarter of this year.
Rather than make explicit predictions about future levels of interest rates, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, devoted most of his appearance today before the Senate Banking Committee to explaining the reasoning behind the rate increases that have already taken place. It was Mr. Greenspan's first appearance before a Congressional committee since Feb. 22, and three of the four increases have come since then. 
 Responding to complaints by Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee that the rate increases so far would put a drag on economic growth, Mr. Greenspan said today that it would take a year or so for the higher rates to have their full effect. While retail sales may have fallen lately, he added, preliminary economic indicators show that growth has not slackened in the second quarter.
 
Concern Over Bank Lending
 The Commerce Department surprised many economists today by revising upward its estimate of first-quarter economic growth, to 3 percent from 2.6 percent, suggesting that the economy remained more robust this winter than expected, despite severe weather and the California earthquake.
Early in his testimony, Mr. Greenspan signaled particular concern about rising bank lending, which stimulates the economy and which the Federal Reserve can control directly by raising the short-term rates that banks pay to borrow money. Other Federal Reserve officials have expressed similar concerns in recent weeks, and the Fed announced on Monday that its latest surveys showed strong increases in lending.
One reason that higher interest rates have not slowed the economy may be that banks are lending on easier terms even as they charge higher rates, Mr. Greenspan said. Although he did not specify these terms, they presumably include requiring less collateral or smaller down payments.
Some Wall Street analysts interpreted Mr. Greenspan's comments -- including a remark that mutual fund and pension fund managers were right to worry about future inflation -- as a possible hint that the Fed would tighten monetary policy again this summer. "He certainly left plenty of room for additional tightening but he didn't actually make a case for one," said Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York.
Other analysts saw few clues in the testimony. "I don't think it shed any new light," said Robert Giordano, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Seeking to explain the sharp rise in long-term interest rates this year, Mr. Greenspan said that when the economy began showing signs of greater strength this spring, investors sold long-term bonds and chose shorter-maturity securities that would be less affected by inflation.
"Given the change in economic conditions and the market's perception of them," he said, "longer-term rates eventually would have increased significantly even had the Federal Reserve done nothing this year."
While Mr. Greenspan gave lengthy reviews of many other monetary policy issues as well, today's hearing was partly about politics. Three Democratic Senators gave long speeches criticizing the recent increases as unnecessary and urging Mr. Greenspan not to go further.
The Clinton Administration has not been critical of the Fed's interest rate increases because of concern that Presidential criticism of the Federal Reserve would alarm financial markets and perhaps prompt the central bank to raise interest rates even higher to show its independence.
In addition, many Administration officials feel that the Fed may be right to raise rates now to restrain inflation. And, in any case, they seem to prefer a modest rise in interest rates now to a possibly steeper increase closer to the 1996 election.
 
Criticism of Rate Rises
 Two of the three Democratic Senators who criticized the Fed's recent interest rate rises, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, are up for re-election this year but have called for a less restrictive monetary policy for many years. The third Senator, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is not running for re-election.
None of the committee's Republican members showed up for the hearing, which came at the beginning of Memorial Day recess for Congress.
Mr. Sarbanes emphasized the problems that higher interest rates were creating for many Americans, and urged Mr. Greenspan to consider their needs as well as Wall Street's desire for higher interest rates to protect the value of bonds. "We're getting calls in my office from people who can't make commitments on new homes because of higher interest rates," he said.

HEADLINE: Let Brooklyn and the Other Boroughs Share Tourism Spotlight

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your May 12 report on a hotel-restaurant-arts package deal to lure tourists to New York City quotes Deputy Mayor John Dyson stating the Convention and Visitors Bureau has been "asleep at the wheel." I agree wholeheartedly. While it sleeps, tourist dollars are spent elsewhere. 
 But any pain Manhattan has suffered is minor compared with that endured by Brooklyn. Despite the bureau's receiving $3.5 million to $4 million a year from the city under the dedicated hotel tax, it allocated a paltry $27,000 to Brooklyn last year.
Unfortunately, the new package deal follows the same agenda of indifference the Convention and Visitors Bureau has demonstrated for years. Brooklyn tourist destinations and attractions, restaurants and retail outlets are virtually absent from the new promotion, a campaign that is supported by more than $2 million in city and state funds.
Brooklyn has more tourism sites than any other borough outside Manhattan. The Brooklyn Bridge, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Brooklyn Children's Museum, Prospect Park, the world-renowned Brooklyn Academy of Music, Coney Island, and the Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation attract millions of visitors each year. And with virtually no tourism promotion assistance from the city.
My hope is this administration will seize the opportunity and reap the reward that Brooklyn tourism offers.
Tourists support Brooklyn restaurants, stores and attractions. This results in an increase in our tax base and expanded employment opportunities. Tourism also contributes to the stability of our commercial shopping districts and residential neighborhoods. It is critical to the economic future of all five boroughs.
New York City must bring Brooklyn out of Manhattan's shadow and allow its cultural and historic attractions to shine in the eyes of the world. Why not let Brooklyn and the other boroughs share the tourism spotlight?

HEADLINE: Retired Investors Adjust To Market Flip-Flops

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES 

 BODY:
Retired people who tried to escape the dismalreturns of "safe" investments like certificates of deposit by putting some money in stocks, bonds and mutual funds have gotten a taste of adventure this year.
The financial markets' overall declines, and intermittent flip-flops, have left plenty of small investors queasy. But they're particularly unsettling for older, more conservative people who have shorter time frames and who may want or need their money before the stock and bond markets recover. This group depends on investment income to supplement retirement checks and tends to keep close tabs on portfolios and cash flow. 
 Recent interviews with retired investors, and their financial planners and investment managers, showed that these people were responding to the market turmoil by tinkering with their portfolios -- not by making drastic changes. Generally, they are keeping a long-term perspective, a testament to their growing financial sophistication.
Around the edges, they are increasing their cash positions, turning to money market funds in particular. That trend could gather steam as recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board continue to ripple through the financial system and make fixed-rate investments more attractive.
Holders of bonds with long-term maturities, which have eroded in value this year, are often getting out altogether or shifting to bonds with shorter maturities, which would be less damaged by continued increases in interest rates, financial advisers said.
Most retired investors, though, are sticking with their stocks and equity funds because these investments offer the best prospect of higher income. A surprising number said they were even taking advantage of the stock market's low prices to put more emphasis on growth investments.
G. B. Mann, who is 82, a retired civil engineer living in Dallas, owns about 100 stocks -- and he's looking for more. "There are lots of good buys right now," he said. Mr. Mann has acquired stocks on his own and through an investment club affiliated with the National Association of Investors Corporation in Royal Oak, Mich.
Younger retirees, envisioning perhaps 30 years of retirement ahead, are showing the most willingness to ride out the market volatility.
Sally Duplaix, 58, a retired library director living in Branford, Conn., has invested in many mutual funds and plans to begin buying individual stocks through an investment club. The stock market and its recent setback is merely a blip on her screen. "I have a lot of confidence that if it goes down, it will come back up," she said. "I got through the 1987 downturn, and it didn't frighten me. I'm not concerned about the downtick we've had."
David Bugen, a financial planner and principal in the Individual Asset Planning Corporation in Morristown, N.J., said about half his clients were retired and were holding steady with their portfolios so far. "The question is," he said, "four or five months down the line, if we're having a protracted bear market, which is unknown at this time, will they still stick to their strategies?"
 Stocks, bonds and mutual funds represent only a small slice of retired people's assets. The Census Bureau, in a 1991 report on household wealth, found that only 9.4 percent of the net worth of people 65 years and older was in stocks and mutual funds. Not surprisingly, the largest portion of their assets was in homes or interest-earning accounts with banks. So retirees who are heavily invested in the stock and bond markets are not typical of their age group. They are more affluent and more likely to be concerned about maintaining their life style than worried about paying for necessities.
 Harold Evensky, a financial adviser and principal with Evensky, Brown & Katz in Coral Gables, Fla., said the retirees who could not stomach the recent market fluctuations were those who knew little about their investments. "The ones we see rolling back are the people who had a chunk of money in C.D.'s and moved it to bond funds that they didn't understand," Mr. Evensky said.
One way to gauge what retired investors are doing is to look at the eight mutual funds managed by Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc. for the American Association of Retired Persons. Howard Schneider, vice president of the A.A.R.P. Investment Program from Scudder, said: "We're seeing some fine-tuning, seeing people move into conservative, growth-oriented investments. We're seeing some modest redemptions."
Among the eight A.A.R.P. funds, the most significant outflow has been from the G.N.M.A. and U.S. Treasury fund, which shrank more than 5 percent in the 12 weeks ended May 18, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. The big gainer has been the High-Quality Money Market fund, whose assets grew 32 percent in the period. Also posting an increase was the Growth and Income fund, up 6.2 percent. Scudder said all the equity funds had experienced inflows of money.
Because retired people are especially concerned about cash flow, the market volatility has made them take a second look at their asset allocations, said Don Underwood, a vice president of retirement plans and services at Merrill Lynch & Company and co-author of "Grow Rich Slowly."
Merrill Lynch puts most retired people in the category of income and growth investors, and recommends a portfolio of 50 percent in equities, 40 percent in bonds and 10 percent in cash. Those benchmarks have remained the same this year, Mr. Underwood said. For more aggressive investors, Merrill now calls for 30 percent in bonds and 20 percent in cash, up from 5 percent in cash early this year.
Despite the tremors caused by the stock market's slide, Mr. Underwood said older people should have more in equities than the popular rule of thumb tied to age. That rule says to subtract your age from 100 to determine what portion of your portfolio to put in equitites. For someone 80 years old, it results in 20 percent in equities.
"If you're 80, you should not just settle for 20 percent if you're in good health," Mr. Underwood said, noting that people are living longer and are remaining more active. "We continue to recommend that our clients have a considerable portion, if not the majority, in equities."
 Retirees with money to invest heed the advice, in part out of concern that they could outlive their money. John B. Rice, 58, a retired state employee living in Salt Lake City, said he planned to cash in his bank C.D. when it matures and invest in more stocks. He described himself as a conservative investor, with holdings primarily in blue-chip stocks like General Electric and growth funds like Alliance. "I think the stock market will likely go up again," he said.
So does Lenore Rallis, a retired Dallas real estate broker and secretary who has invested in stocks through an investment club. Ms. Rallis said she planned to invest the proceeds from the sale of some real estate into growth stocks and mutual funds over the next 18 months and to "ease into the market."
"Over the long term, stocks are going to go up," she said. "As broad as I hope to be in it, then the whole world would have to go down the tube."
No one strategy, of course, works for all retired people, a diverse group to say the least. Mr. Bugen, the financial planner, described a retired man who recently called him after visiting a doctor. "He said that since he had moved his money out of the bank and into stocks and long-term bond funds, he couldn't sleep at night," Mr. Bugen said.
"Some people are saying, 'I'll live on less, but I won't live with the fluctuations,' " he added.
The litmus test for retired investors is whether they are comfortable. "Above all, you should be able to sleep at night," Mr. Schneider of Scudder said. "If your investments are keeping you up at night, they may not be worth it."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
With Costs Down, a Builder Trumpets Affordability

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
IN New York City the term "affordable housing" has come to be associated with new houses built with city and state capital grants on city-owned land. The land is provided at virtually no cost to the buyer. The land contribution and the grants make possible prices that are affordable to households earning about $25,000 to $50,000 a year.
In purely private housing development, there are no such subsidies. But with the drop in land prices in recent years, builders can set prices lower (meanwhile hoping market strength will push them up again). Accordingly, they are ready to promote as affordable housing the offerings they plan for the middle-income market. 
 Queens has been a center of conventionally financed small-home construction, driven in recent years by the upsurge in middle-income Korean- and Chinese-Americans with the savings to pump into housing. With the recession in the late 80's production dropped sharply and has yet to revive.
But a few days ago, in the College Point section of Queens, Joseph Kiel and Michael Blau, who are brothers-in-law building under the name B.K. Development, took a visitor to a vacant site on which they are about to start construction. They will produce "affordable housing," Mr. Blau emphasized.
The land is between 14th Avenue and 14th Road on 121st Street, which runs parallel to College Point Boulevard, one block away, the main commercial street of this venerable residential community in northwest Queens.
It was acquired from another developer who had filed plans for four three-family houses. Instead, the new owners will produce four two-family houses. The end houses will sell for $279,000 and the middle houses for $259,000, the builders say.
"In Flushing in '88 we would have gotten $450,000 for the end house," said Mr. Blau, who in addition to his home-building activities runs the family plumbing business, Blau Mechanical Corporation, in Bayside.
He would also have paid much more for the land. In College Point the land price was 30 percent of what it would have been in the 80's. Moreover, subcontractor prices are lower now. And savings are planned on materials to hold prices down further. The facades will be brick and aluminium siding, for example, instead of all brick.
IN the 80's, B.K. Development built about 30 two- and three-family houses a year in Queens, with developments in Briarwood, Flushing, Whitestone and College Point. But when the sales market fell they found it necessary to rent out their buildings. Mr. Blau said that they still hold everything they built over the last six years -- 15 houses with two or three rental tenants in each.
But little by little builders are finishing off projects on land that others were unable to hold. In Bayside, for example, George Greene, president of Red Oak Development Corporation, based in Great Neck, L.I., has acquired land for five two-family houses off Clearview Expressway at 204th Street and 42d Avenue. A bank foreclosed on the land, which another builder had owned.
Sale prices will be about $290,000 to $300,000, Mr. Greene said, for two-family houses for which buyers a few years ago would have paid $340,000 to $350,000. Sites are selling in foreclosure at about 65 percent of their value in the 80's, he said.
Not that loans are readily available to assist the building process. B.K. Development's College Point project will be done with the company's own resources rather than bank financing.
The slow pace of activity is reflected in figures that the Census Bureau worked out from information supplied by the Department of Buildings. Surprisingly, the Buildings Department itself keeps track only of the number of permits issued, not the number of housing units for which permits are sought, and is not even able to report relative changes in the pace of residential as opposed to commercial development. The Census Bureau, however, does its own analysis of total permits granted.
The census figures show that permits authorizing only 531 new privately owned housing units were issued last year. By contrast, more than 2,000 units a year were authorized from 1984 through the end of the decade. The pace plunged in 1990 and has remained slow ever since. Only the steady production under the New York Housing Partnership program -- new "affordable" houses built with city and state grants on city-owned land -- has kept production going at even its current low pace.
If there is a revival of home construction on mid-density land in Queens, typically zoned R-3 to R-5, the character of it will reflect the contextual zoning districts adopted in the late 80's. The change is graphically illustrated in College Point.
Gone are the "six, six and three" houses that were built in volume in the 80's under what was called infill zoning. This was a three-story, three-family house with six rooms on the second floor, six on the third and three on the first, plus a garage within the building.
Mr. Blau and Mr. Kiel built two of them side by side on Ninth Avenue between 117th Street and 119th Street in College Point in the mid-80's, and rented them out.
BY the time they came to develop another lot on the same street in 1989, three-story buildings had effectively been eliminated from R-4 zones that were predominantly built with the lower-density one-and two-family homes. Their Ninth Avenue land was on such a block.
They could therefore build only two stories in the three houses at 117-09 through 117-13 Ninth Avenue, though they managed to put three units in the two end houses. They put one duplex apartment at the rear and two flats in the front half of the structure.
Another change is the absence of the on-site garage. Instead, in the newer strip, parking is provided on pads at the sides of the houses as well as in the front.
The new buildings on the 100-by-100-foot lot on 121st Street will also reflect the new contextual zoning. There will be a three-bedroom apartment on the second floor and a two-bedroom with a garage on the first floor.
"The two-story, two-family contextual house is more in harmony with the area, and probably easier to sell as a result," said Leo D. Fakler, partner in the Fresh Meadow firm of Fakler & Eliason. One new touch will be a cathedral ceiling in the living room of the second-floor apartment, with a glass window a story-and-a-half high, he said.
As for the sales market, there will be little competition from new construction. But the builder's prices will conform with reality in the resale market, where prices are down about 30 percent from 1987.
Resale housing -- often about 60 years old -- is selling in the range of $170,000 to $200,000 for two-families and $160,000 to $180,000 for one-families, said Henry Skoros of the Suydam Agency, which Mr. Skoros's grandfather founded in 1890.
But the sales pace is picking up, he said. In a good year in the past, about 200 houses sold in College Point. On the basis of the pace so far "we'll probably get close to that this year," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Lower Manhattan BID;
An 'Engine for Economic Improvement' Downtown

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT'S finally happened: Downtown Manhattan's landlords have grouped into a Business Improvement District. Armed with a budget of $8.6 million and scheduled to start operating on Jan. 1, the new BID will try to accomplish as a group what neither individual landlords nor city officials nor residents have been able to do: Revive the flagging fortunes of an area that has been singularly resistant to economic recovery. 
 It will take more than cleaner streets, extra security or prettier signs, the top priorities for so many New York BIDs. The Lower Manhattan district will have to be an "engine for economic development," as Meyer (Sandy) Frucher, an executive vice president of Olympia & York USA, put it.
How should the new BID set its priorities and carry out its mandate? Six real estate experts offer their views.

Meyer (Sandy) Frucher, executive vice president, Olympia & York USA.
The BID has to identify industries other than the traditional FIRE industries -- finance, insurance, real estate -- that have traditionally made the Wall Street area their home. And it must figure out a strategy to attract those industries down here.
Top on the strategic list has to be transportation. The BID should push for a bus terminal, which could also provide parking for tourist buses. It should push for better connections with the suburbs, including extension of the Long Island Rail Road, maybe through Brooklyn. It has to find new landing sites for waterborne transportation and then ways to connect those to businesses.
The BID also has to identify the infrastructure needs of new types of companies. If it goes after small companies, do they need a central data-processing center? Do they need more restaurants, because they do not have internal dining rooms?
And do they need different financial incentives? A big processing company might be wooed by cheap power, but that won't do much for, say, an advertising agency.

Edward S. Gordon, chairman, Edward S. Gordon Company.
The agenda for the BID is, how do you make the area more appealing for business, which by definition makes it more productive and a place that provides more employment. Yes, sanitation and security are part of that, but they are side issues. Taxes and zoning are what is important.
I strongly believe that taxes are the curse of the city in general, and of downtown in particular. There's never been a cohesive group of people focusing on this, and the BID can finally provide this.
If I could wave a magic wand, I'd turn a section of downtown into a free-trade zone, a place where you don't pay taxes or tariffs on materials you bring in. That could bring light manufacturing back to the area.
I'd also like to see the BID work to loosen up zoning regulations, so you can get more residential and retail operations in the area.

Charles J. Maikish, director, World Trade Center.
In lower Manhattan we have the ingredients for a great cultural banquet. There's a historic trail, like Boston's Freedom Trail. There are great architectural gems like the Woolworth building. There's City Hall and right nearby are TriBeCa and Chinatown.
The BID must put that banquet together, and then publicize and promote it. It can sponsor the redevelopment of City Hall Park, and it can provide the kinds of experiences in Battery Park that you're now seeing in Bryant Park in midtown. It can operate a Freedom Trail walk. It can give TriBeCa's artists places to show their work.
The BID should certainly work with us. The Plaza of the Trade Center itself is intended to become a year-round place for events. We are looking at ways to temper the winds, and the temperature, to make that feasible.
The BID should try to attract the museum industry to lower Manhattan. it would be great to get a branch of MOMA or of the Met. And the maritime museum that we already have should be better promoted.
But first we must do something about the congestion down here. The BID should look at a trolley or jitney station, and at better connections to Grand Central and other hubs.
And it must work on security. Right now this is probably one of the safest areas in Manhattan because there is no populace here at night for criminals to prey upon. Yet it is perceived as unsafe. It is not well lit, and it is not well populated, and at night you get the sense of being in a desolate area.
The BID can provide street lighting, after hours security and information services. It can hold cultural events in the evening. And once it does that, and people do remain for functions and events, then we really will need the added elements of security.

Steven Spinola, president, Real Estate Board of New York
The BID must create a common theme for the area, one that pulls together the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street, the Seaport, Fraunces Tavern, all of the historic stuff.
They need to concentrate on proper signage, on prominently showing that when you walk out of the South Street Seaport there are other interesting places to go nearby. Maybe there should be a one-dollar bus that lets you ride all day across lower Manhattan.
The BID should form a relationship with the Visitors Bureau. There needs to be a consolidated marketing of all of the things that lower Manahttan has to offer. Let's have the proper maps, the brochures, the fliers, the proof that you can spend days in lower Manhattan and still not see everyting. That can encourage people to stay at the hotels.
And maybe it should promote some of the wonderful restaurants down there, even orchestrate a program whereby some of those restaurants will give local employees discounts if they stay for dinner. That's one way to liven the area up after 5 P.M.
But tourism certainly isn't all of it. The BID also has to refocus on bringing new business down here. They need to work with Con Ed to deal with false perceptions about energy problems in the area. In fact we have seven substations, we have significant power redundancy, yet no one's talking about it.
The BID should identify buildings on the outskirts of the business community that should be converted to residential use, and others that should be torn down. And it should spearhead sitting areas, maybe open markets that could temporarily be put in the open spaces left when the buildings are torn down.
But it should think in terms of eventually putting up new buildings again. And that means we should grandfather the floor area ratios.
Current zoning rules mean that many of the existing obsolete buildings could only be replaced by buildings half their size, and that is a disincentive to pull them down.
The BID should look at this as if lower Manhattan was a large office park or shopping center, and think of running it as such. Whatever it takes -- marketing, cleanliness, whatever -- is what the BID must do

Lewis Rudin, co-chairman, Rudin Management
If there had been a downtown BID in 1974 we'd have never lost the Westway project. But we did, and now the East Side highway is overcrowded and there is no West Side highway.
The BID should be lobbying Albany and City Hall to get a road built. If you can get in your car and be at the World Trade Center in 12 minutes or less, it feels like downtown is accessible. But now it feels like you can't really drive to Wall Street from Connecticut or Westchester.
And why not have mass transit on that road also, a monorail that would start at Grand Central? And shorter term, why not give a discount on the new Metrocard for anyone traveling to lower Manhattan from, say, Grand Central?
I believe the international community will save downtown. Maybe we should start advertising in The International Herald Tribune and tell the world that Wall Street is alive and well and that it now has a BID to look out for owners' and tenants' interests.
The BID should focus on drumming up the money and tax incentives to make it worthwhile to restore the buildings in the district's center. You have buildings like 40 Wall or 55 Broad that are totally empty, you have 60 Broad, which is 75 percent empty. These buildings, if they get filled up, would put millions of dollars in city coffers.

Arthur J. Mirante 2d, chief executive, Cushman & Wakefield
I wouldn't downplay the importance of a greater security presence on the street, of more guys in white uniforms with brooms, or of parks in areas that are now eyesores.
But after that, they have to attack the occupancy tax, the most visible penalty for doing business in New York City in general. This is the one economic item that doesn't favor any special interest groups. Maybe the BID should advocate giving relief from the tax to companies that sign leases downtown in the next couple of years, maybe they should suggest phased-in relief for existing tenants. That would reduce a company's projected cost of occupancy in Manhattan and thus would give it hope that a few years from now it'll get a little more for its money. That can keep a company from leaving the area.
In the past we have shown that we can redirect business activity with bonuses and zoning changes, without hurting the areas that are already thriving. Look at the office buildings we brought to the west side of Manhattan. We've actually moved the business center to Sixth Avenue, and it hasn't hurt Lexington or Third Avenue at all. Does downtown Manhattan qualify as an important enough area to deserve special benefits to attract business? I think it does.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
A Whirlwind of Plans for a Hot Newtown Property

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
A PRIZED piece of property in the center of Newtown with almost 2 million square feet in 60 handsome brick buildings on an 800-acre campus has become a hotspot of contention among local and state officials and civic leaders.
Built in the 1930's as the Fairfield Hills state mental hospital, the now diverse operation is outmoded and its buildings are almost empty. But the grounds and buildings have been well maintained and are suitable for recyling to other uses. 
 Proposals for redevelopment on long-term leases from the state, which will maintain ownership, are being sought by a task force appointed by the General Assembly. Preliminary recommendations will be presented next month and in 1995 the legislature will decide what the new uses will be, based on the task force's findings.
Meanwhile, a deluge of proposals has poured in.
"I've been here for 36 years," said State Representative Julia R. Wasserman, a Newtown Republican who heads the 20-member task force, "and I've never seen this much material on one issue. We sent out requests for proposals six months ago and got almost 400 replies."
When the downsizing of the complex is completed next year, there will be 1.5 million square feet available in the buildings and about 500 acres of open space ready for redevelopment, according to Gary Mullaney, a task force appointee from the state's Department of Mental Health. The rest will be retained for existing substance-abuse and mental-health quarters for patients and staff, a minimum-security women's prison and to house the Second Company Governor's Horse Guards, a volunteer unit of the state militia involved mainly with ceremonial functions.
Three proposals among the many under consideration by the task force head the list:
* A major equestrian center for horse shows, submitted by the Newtown Bridle Lands Association and endorsed by the Connecticut Horse Council.
* A conglomerate of small produce farms and an incubator operation for developing and packaging food products, submitted by the state's Department of Agriculture.
* A research and development park, submitted by the Newtown Economic Development Commission.
All three projects are proposed for the only large tract of open land -- about 270 acres at the north end of the property.
Other proposals include a new elementary school to accommodate increased enrollments, housing for low- and moderate-income people, a golf course, soccer and ballfields, a larger Town Hall, and a community center. In addition, several state and local agencies have submitted requests for space.
"Newtown has an enormous horse population," said the First Selectman and task force member, Robert Cascella, "so the horse park is the most emotionally charged issue." There are 2,500 horses in the town of 20,700 residents.
"There is nothing like what we are proposing in the entire Northeast," said Kurt Schneider, chairman of the Newtown Bridle Lands Association, a land trust dedicated to riding trails and green-space preservation. "We could handle indoor-outdoor Olympic style three-day events rivaling those in Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina, where they operate more than 300 days a year."
"It would boost tourism," he added, "creating a west-to-east swing through the state that would take a few days, instead of the shoreline pass-through that visitors do now, stopping briefly at the Norwalk Maritime Center and Mystic Seaport on their way to Massachusetts."
SINCE the Danbury State Fair grounds became a shopping mall in 1981 "the Connecticut Apaloosa, Morgan, Arab, Quarterhorse and Reining Horse Championships have all been held in West Springfield or Northampton, Mass.," said Richard Woolam, board chairman of the Connecticut Horse Council. "That's where all our money for food, lodging, gas, even laundry, goes. One cleaner did 1,900 shirts in five days."
"The Connecticut horse industry," said John J. Filchak 3d, Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture. "is one of the top five agricultural money-makers in the state, bringing in about $350 million out of the department's estimate of $1.7 billion annually."
The state is home to at least 18,000 horse owners and 60,000 horses. Despite this, Mr. Filchak is squarely behind the farming proposal, because, he says, "there are prime agricultural soils on that property that we are committed to preserve."
His agency supports a horse park "somewhere in Connecticut," Mr. Filchak said, "but the state is not convinced that private funding has been thoroughly explored."
Private equestrian centers have been informally proposed in the rural towns of Plymouth and Harwinton. But without support services, little local enthusiam and no financial underpinnings, such proposals do not seem promising.
In 1986 State Representative John Mordansky, Democrat of Stafford Springs, tried unsuccessfully to get state bonding for a horse park. A state study had indicated that in its first five years revenues from a major operation would rise from $2.08 million to $17.3 million annually.
Last year Mr. Mordansky sponsored another bill, requesting a $21 million bond issue to establish a horse park. Introduced after the biennial budget's bonding package was set, it passed the Environmental Committee unanimously, he said, "but the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee would not reopen the package so it died." He will resubmit it when the Legislature convenes in January.
"In my opinion," he said, "Newtown has all the criteria to make a horse park successful -- access to highways, lodging, and restaurants.".
BUT, asks First Selectman Cascella, "would we lose control of the community if we became host for a large horse park, and which proposal will most benefit the town economically?"
"We could realize about $2 million a year in real estate taxes from a research and development park," added Elizabeth Stocker, the town's Community Development Director.
Because the proposed research and development park would abut the town's existing industrial park, the proposal has raised fears among detractors that additional companies would be hard to find and once found they could fail, shifting the tax burden onto homeowners.
Curtis Clark, managing editor of The Newtown Bee, called additional industrial activity "inappropriate on prime land in the center of town." The newspaper's editorial board and the majority of letters to the editor support the horse park, he said.
If the legislature is receptive to the Mordansky bill it could follow the precedent of Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina, where horse parks have been financed by the states, and private nonprofit groups manage their operations.
"Private parks are not feasible," said Mr. Schneider, chairman of the Bridle Lands Association, "because of the land costs."
He cited as an example the privately developed Great Southwestern park outside Houston, which became the instrument of its own own destruction.
"Hotels, restaurants and support services grew up all around it," he said, "increasing the tax rate to a point where the park couldn't survive."

SILK STRIKE RECALLED
This week, students from Eastside High School in Paterson will re-enact the pageant presented at the end of the historic five-month strike against 292 Paterson silk mills in 1913. The re-enactment will be at 1 P.M. Thursday and 1 and 7 P.M. Friday at Passaic County Community College, College Boulevard.
Silk workers marched 900 strong from the Paterson mills, rode the ferry and continued their march to Madison Square Garden in New York City to portray highlights of the strike, which the workers won by establishing the eight-hour day and better working conditions that were eventually put into effect. 
 Four students, following an outline by a mural artist, Mike Alewitz, recycled a 28-foot-by-14-foot Gannett Outdoor Inc. billboard canvas in painting an interpretation of the 45-foot-by-17-foot backdrop used in the original pageant. The original showed the red brick facade of a mill with the castle built by Catholina Lambert, one of the mill owners, to survey his domain.
Although the strikers in 1913 included Polish, German, Syrian, Italian, English and French immigrants, the Eastside students involved in the entire production, most of whom are black or Hispanic, developed such a close identification with the strikers that they insisted that Botto House, the strike headquarters, be added to the left side of the mural.
Eighteen students from the senior honors English class taught by Cindy Mamakos wrote the pageant's script under the guidance of Rosemary McLaughlin, a playwright, and Steve Golin, an author.
Major roles will be played by 10 students from Anjenett Ray's drama classes. The school's 40-voice Concert Choir, directed by Cora Quince, will sing some selections, and the audience will be invited to join in the rallying songs from the strike.
The American Labor Museum, situated in the Botto House at 83 Norwood Street in Haledon, will sponsor the pageant. The museum is home to a vast collection of labor history materials, including documentary and feature film videotapes.
Admission to the pageant at Passaic College is $1 for students and the elderly and $3.50 for adults for the matinee performances; $3.50 for students and the elderly and $7.50 for adults for the evening performance.
Information: (201) 595-7953 (Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.).
 
SAMPLERS ON DISPLAY
 "Next onto God, dear parents, I address myself to you in humble thankfulness for all your care and charge on me bestowed," was cross-stitched onto a large sampler in 1778, along with the alphabet, about 20 more lines and the name of the author, 11-year-old Elizabeth Barnard.
She would undoubtedly be surprised to know that her fervent message survived the intervening centuries and will be among more than 40 samplers on display next Sunday at the Hendrick Van Allen House in Oakland.
A booklet containing transcriptions from all the samplers in the exhibition will be included with the admission of $3. A textile and sampler conservationist, Kathleen Craughwell, will be available by prearranged appointment for consultations on samplers at $5 each.
The show, "Antique Needlework Samplers," will be presented by Dixie Francis for the Oakland Historical Society, which has its home in the historic house on Route 202 (Ramapo Valley Road) at Franklin Avenue.
Information: (201) 825-9049.
 
NEWARK EVENTS
 Entertainment in Newark for the coming weekend will include an avant-garde band and a major fire apparatus muster.
Sekou Sundiata and his innovative ensemble, Dadahdoodahda, will present the performance art of poetry and music as part of a "poetry works" festival at 2 P.M. Saturday at the Newark Public Library.
Tanya Tyler-James will be the host for the program, co-sponsored by the Newark Writers Collective. The library is at 5 Washington Street, and admission is free.
Information: (201) 643-3606.
The 27th annual Antique Fire Apparatus Muster and Parade will be held from noon to 4:30 P.M. next Sunday at the Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street.
Antique fire engines and equipment, slides of Newark firefighters and scale models will be featured. The displays will be sprawled over the museum parking lot, the Newark Fire Museum in the garden and the garden itself. Admission is free.
Information: (201) 596-6550.
 
HORSE MONTH
 Carrying forward a cherished tradition, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has proclaimed June as Horse Month in New Jersey. Open houses and other programs will be offered statewide throughout the month.
Home to more than 60,000 horses representing about 60 breeds, the state has some 7,000 equine sites on more than 120,000 acres of land and counts the industry as a $4 billion component of the agricultural economy.
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture works with the New Jersey Equine Advisory Board, the Standardbred Sire State Program and the Thoroughbred Breeders Incentive Program to encourage the breeding and racing of outstanding horses.
Observances will begin on Saturday with a dressage show at the Meadow in Mount Holly (information: 609-261-0601) and the Ramble Farm Arabians open house from 1 to 4 P.M. in Warren (908-560-3519).
Next Sunday, events will include the Monmouth County Hunt's Hunter Pace in Allentown (609-259-9728); the Spring Show Series at the Meadow; an open house at Riding High Farm from noon to 4 P.M. in Allentown (609-259-3884); the New Jersey Bred Hunter Association Horse Show in Allentown (215-847-2613) and others. A full schedule of events is available.
Information: (609) 292-8896.
 
HOME AQUARIUM SHOW
 The Home Aquarium Show on Saturday and next Sunday at the New Jersey State Aquarium in Camden will feature the best in tanks, technology and accessories as well as special displays and experts on hand to answer questions and offer tips.
Since June is also National Zoo and Aquarium Month, visitors may enter a drawing to win a behind-the-scenes tour of the aquarium.
The show is free with the regular admission of $9, or $6 for children 2 to 11, free for younger children and $7.50 for students and the elderly. The aquarium, at 1 Riverside Drive, is open from 9:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. daily, with the hours extended to 8:30 P.M. on Sundays through the summer.

TRIANGLE SHOW

After its first musical in 1891 ("Po-ca-hon-tas"), the irreverent all-student Triangle Club show became a once-a-year event at Princeton University.
Those who missed the Triangle's 103d spring musical, which was presented last month, need not fuss. "The Bermuda Love Triangle: A Spanish Imposition," as it is called, is being revived in time for Reunions Weekend -- and before a national tour.
Instead of the customary revue format, this one falls into the category of a book musical. The Princeton Weekly Bulletin, the student newspaper, describes it as "a simple love story with sword fights, an exorcism, the traditional politically incorrect all-male kick line, penguins and dance hall girls named Tequila, Sangria, Kahlua, Pina and Colada." The setting is the rustic village of Buenas Noches; the triangle of the title is a voodoo artifact.
Jesus Villa, a sociology major (class of '94), conceived and wrote the show. Peter Mills, an English major (class of '95), composed most of the music. Eleven other students contributed lyrics and additional material.
The cast and the orchestra are immense. Two professionals, Robert Duke, the director, and Ken Leigh Rogers, the choreographer, got it all together.
Performances take place Friday and Saturday at 8:30 P.M. at the McCarter Theater on the university campus. Tickets are $15 to $21.

HEADLINE: Democrats Pick Their Champions

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON 

DATELINE: YORKTOWN HEIGHTS

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER'S northern Democrats, meeting in convention, endorsed Hamilton Fish Jr. last week as their candidate to fill the seat being vacated by his father, a Republican, but the closeness of the vote indicated a likely bruising primary in September.
Mr. Fish outpolled Dennis Mehiel, the former Westchester County Democratic Party chairman, on a second ballot after the initial count showed Mr. Fish ahead -- with 9,932 votes to 9,222 for Mr. Mehiel -- but failing to win a majority. 
 A third candidate, Neil McCarthy, a Lewisboro resident and member of a Manhattan law firm who ran unsuccessfully against the 13-term incumbent two years ago, got 4,741 votes, and a fourth entrant, Al Lynn, a businessman from Pound Ridge with a specialty in home health care, got 2,390 votes.
Under the terms of the convention, the candidate with the smallest total dropped out, and the delegates, representing the Westchester cities and towns in the 19th Congressional District, voted again. This time, with support flowing to the younger Mr. Fish from all three of his rivals, he won.
The candidates arrived in the convention hall just before the balloting, having come from a similar Democratic gathering in Orange County where Mr. Mehiel outpolled Mr. Fish by 60 percent to 40 percent. To complicate matters further, Mr. Fish had won the endorsement of Dutchess County Democrats the night before.
All four candidates had indicated earlier that they would seek recognition in a primary election if they failed to win their party's endorsement. With the closeness of the vote and the feeling among leading Democrats that this election represents the best chance in years to wrest the Hudson Valley seat from the Republicans, a primary appears certain for at least the two top vote getters.
 
State Senate Race
 No such ambivalence existed in another convention contest, this for the seat in the State Senate being vacated by the Republican Party's designated candidate for Governor, George E. Pataki. By an overwhelming margin, the delegates cast their ballots for Alfred B. DelBello, a former Westchester County Executive and the first Democrat to hold that post.
Mr. DelBello, who moved from Yonkers, where he was Mayor in the early 1970's, to Lewisboro, a largely rural town in northern Westchester 15 years ago, left the County Executive post in 1983 to run for Lieutenant Governor. He quit that job two years later because the Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, never folded Mr. DelBello into his inner circle.
Since then Mr. DelBello has worked as a consultant in the solid-waste management field and is a partner in a White Plains law firm. He has remained active in politics, supporting candidates and policies, and is considered to have retained his name recognition.
His support among delegates was so strong that one of his rivals for the candidacy in the 37th District, Linda D. Puglisi, Supervisor of Cortlandt, coupled her appreciation for candidacy with the announcement that she was withdrawing for the sake of harmony. Mr. DelBello handily beat another rival, Robert W. Elliott, Mayor of Croton-on-Hudson.
Facing election in what the Democratic Party chairman, Andrew J. Spano, described as "the second most heavily Republican district in the state," Mr. DelBello pledged to help restore the state's pre-eminence.
He said the state had suffered more in the last three and a half years of recession than any other state, "and the Hudson Valley more than any other region in the state." He was referring to corporate downsizing and the loss of jobs in companies like International Business Machines.
 
30 Percent Democratic
 He called for a "revolution" in the "Neanderthalic" State Senate, which he said was inbred by Republicans who block progress. The 37th District seat, he added, "has been taken for granted for too long by Republicans."
Mr. DelBello's likely Republican rival for the Senate seat is Assemblyman Vincent L. Leibell 3d, who had resisted announcing his candidacy until he was certain that his Republican colleague, Mr. Pataki, was firmly set in the race for Governor.
The district consists of 10 communities of northern Westchester, including part of White Plains, as well as all of Putnam County and six towns in Dutchess County. Enrollment is 40 percent Republican and Conservative, while Democrats represent 30 percent, most of the remaining being independent voters.
Variations on Mr. DelBello's theme -- that the Hudson Valley needed economic assistance -- were also heard from the Congressional candidates, with each coupling the issue with reasons they felt they could wrest the district from Republican control.
Mr. Mehiel used his "28 years of corporate experience" as an example. With his brother, he founded the Four M corporation, one of the country's largest independent makers of corrugated packaging. It employs 1,800 workers in 21 plants nationwide.
He said he had his employees covered by health insurance in 1967. "The family-leave law was only passed recently by Congress, but we had it in 1978," he said. He spoke of similar ideas for innovative policies in the environmental field.
He suggested that these experiences with "14 years of community service" were essential to being a strong candidate. He said he had been told not to take on the party's chairmanship if he ever wanted to run for office, but "I'm doing it anyway," he said.
In 1988, he sought the Democratic nomination in the 20th Congressional District as did his current rival, then known as Hamilton Fish 3d because his grandfather, a former Congressman, was still alive. Both Mr. Mehiel and the younger Mr. Fish lost a three-way primary to Nita M. Lowey, who beat the then-incumbent, Joseph DioGuardi.
Mr. Fish, at last week's convention, spoke of his lifelong allegiance to the Democratic Party, saying his father, who is giving up the seat because he has cancer, "supported me in my first race," adding to laughter, "and my grandfather less so."
 
Endorsed by a Roosevelt
 Mr. Fish is senior adviser to Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization based in Manhattan, and is development consultant to Doctors of the World, a human rights and medical relief organization.
He spoke of his commitment to the region and of the need to open it up to the more realistic Democratic policies. He was endorsed by Christopher Roosevelt, a grandson of the nation's wartime leader, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Al Lynn said his business background, operating Medlinc Inc., with 14 offices in the New York City area, suited him for the Congressional post. He has had no political experience, a fact that he said will help with a public out of work or facing layoffs. "Many share a cynicism about the democratic process," he said.
Mr. McCarthy, the only candidate among the four seeking their party's support to have run against Representative Fish, said the experience put him in a position to know the issues in the Hudson Valley region, thus making him the most viable candidate in the field.
The 19th Congressional District extends from White Plains to include all of Putnam County, 4 towns in Orange County and 10 municipalities in Dutchess County, including the city of Poughkeepsie.

As Goes the Trade Status, So Goes the Nation Fund

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
IF every person in China drank one cherry cola, ate one cheeseburger and bought one toothbrush, lots of Americans would become very rich. That may seem like a bit of a stretch, but it's the story that for years has attracted investors to companies that claimed to be China plays, and, more recently, to funds that are poised to take advantage of the growing Chinese economy.
Earlier this year, that tale seemed less likely to have a happy ending. United States officials' concerns about China's human rights record cast some doubt on whether the nation could continue to export goods to America under the advantageous terms of most-favored-nation status. In addition, the shares of the China Fund, a closed-end issue, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, were also depressed by a rights offering that ended in April. 
 But as optimism about China's trade status rose, so did the share price of the China Fund, which by Friday was at a 25 percent premium to the value of the fund's underlying portfolio. LESLIE EATON

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Sorting Out a Doomsday Argument

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
THE stage is set, Donald Christensen argues, for a new "bust" in mutual funds.
Twice before in this century, in 1929 and after the go-go 60's, fund investors lost a lot, Mr. Christensen, a New York investment analyst, tells us in his soon-to-be-published book, "Surviving the Coming Mutual Fund Crisis." And now elements of both crises have resurfaced, he says, to haunt the millions who have flocked to funds in recent years in a mania he likens to the Dutch tulip bulb craze and the flighty period leading to the stock market crash in 1929. 
 The book's apocalyptic vision may be overdrawn. While a spike in inflation would surely hurt the financial markets, the leverage that magnified the 1929 losses is absent. Regulation is stronger now, too. In part, the book's advice is extreme, but over all Mr. Christensen offers some solid counsel.
What worries Mr. Christensen is the re-emergence of high-risk investing and secrecy that contributed to the previous fund crises. During the go-go 1960's, for instance, the most successful funds were those using risky investing techniques -- buying shares in small, new companies, concentrating their portfolios, owning shares that could not be traded publicly. And when the market plummeted at the end of the decade, some of the highest fliers went with it.
Since 1990, many high-risk policies have crept back. The number of "nondiversified" funds, which can concentrate their portfolios in one industry or country, has risen markedly. More funds have also changed fundamental investment policies, allowing the use of options, leverage or derivative securities. The latter created losses for adjustable-rate mortgage funds during recent years.
Some sophisticated techniques have been untested. The short world income funds were built on complicated currency hedging techniques that did not work. In the late 1980's, two heavily marketed fund concepts based on option-writing -- government plus and option income funds -- disappeared after poor showings.
Ken Gregory, who edits the No-Load Fund Analyst in San Francisco, warns against generalizing about these developments, pointing out that many changes have been made because new financial instruments are available, and that many of the strategies are used to limit losses, not lift returns.
Still, Mr. Christensen says, investors should steer clear of funds that use the riskier strategies. His concern is echoed by John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. "If it's a new and complex strategy that the fund companies are introducing and they say 'trust us,' don't," he said.
Mr. Christensen advises avoiding stock funds with yearly expenses exceeding 1.25 percent, about the group's average. Expenses for funds owning government bonds should not exceed 0.8 percent, he says; corporate bonds, 1 percent.
And potential investors in unseasoned companies must know there are big risks, Mr. Christensen says. Managers are moving into smaller stocks, many with short track records, and their belief that they can succeed if they "are smart enough and work hard," Mr. Rekenthaler added, can lead "to a dangerous self-confidence."
Mr. Christensen also expresses alarm about the fund industry's tendency to withhold or camouflage information and mislead shareholders about their investments. Prospectuses and annual reports often present information in ways that befuddle investors, he says.
Investors should know who manages their money. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently ruled that a fund must disclose the name of its manager in its prospectus, with this exception: funds managed by teams of two people or more. About 15 percent of all funds in the Morningstar data base were team-managed in 1989; that jumped to 30 percent by the end of 1993.
How should investors pick a fund? Mr. Christensen, who publishes "The Insider Outlook," a newsletter that tracks the stocks that corporate insiders buy and sell, advises avoiding funds that lead the short-term performance charts as too risky. Instead, investors should look for strong three- to five-year track records.
And he urges shunning funds in the bottom 10 percent of the performance charts. But investors should make fair comparisons. Until recently funds that invest abroad, for instance, looked terrible compared with domestic equity funds.
Mr. Christensen also says stay away from funds labeled "high yield" or "high income," euphemisms for high risk. But junk bonds may well deserve a place in some investors' portfolios.
Investors should never buy shares on margin, Mr. Christensen says; doing so is very risky.
High-turnover funds should also be avoided, he says. But if investors shunned them all, Mr. Rekenthaler said, they would miss winners like Janus, Columbia Growth and Fidelity Magellan.
In the end, befitting his doomsday view, Mr. Christensen urges investors to stick with individual issues of stocks or bonds. But because funds can benefit some investors by offering diversification and professional management, this is an extreme approach.
The bottom line: remember that the fund industry's aim is sales. It is an investor's job, Mr. Christensen says, "to skeptically question and investigate the risk" of what the industry is trying to sell you.

HEADLINE: It's Small, Cheap and Not a Hyundai

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: ASAN, South Korea

 BODY:
A GIANT monster rampages through a city as people flee in terror. "There's only one thing more frightening to Japan," reads the text accompanying this clip from a science fiction movie. "A well-made car for under $8,500."
The commercial, being shown in some parts of the United States, is for the Sephia, a compact car with a base price of $8,495 that is being introduced into the American market by Kia Motors Corporation, South Korea's No. 2 auto maker, behind Hyundai. The Sephia will be followed at the end of the year by the Sportage, a small sport-utility vehicle that is drawing rave reviews. 
 Breaking into the United States will not be easy for Kia. Few Americans have ever heard of the company. It faces numerous competitors, including Chrysler's hot new Neon, which has a base price only $500 higher than the Sephia's. And Kia must overcome the image Korean cars have among American consumers for poor quality, a result of Hyundai's botched entry into the American market in the late 1980's.
But Kia is nothing if not audacious, and it has come far. When it started out 50 years ago, the company could not even manufacture a complete bicycle. It was not until 1973 that Kia developed Korea's first gasoline engine. And in 1981, the company nearly went bankrupt and was forced to quit the passenger car business for five years.
Kia's ambition is shared by the rest of Korea's auto industry. Helped by a growing home market more protected than Japan's, Korean output rose to two million vehicles last year, twice 1987's level. This year it might reach 2.4 million, enough to make Korea No. 5 in world auto production, behind Japan, the United States, Germany and France.
Exports, buoyed by the rise in the Japanese yen, which has made Japanese cars less competitive, soared 40 percent last year, to 640,000 vehicles.
And the industry, led by the "big three" of Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo, is investing more than $2 billion a year to double its capacity to more than four million vehicles by the year 2000.
A sign of the ambition is seen at Kia's four-year-old Asan Bay complex, which sprawls 3.8 miles from end to end on Korea's west coast, housing a factory and a modern test track. Capacity is being doubled to 650,000 vehicles a year by 1997 as part of a plan to double overall capacity to 1.25 million.
In doing so, Kia is taking on high debt, which analysts say could get the company in trouble again if business turns sour. But Kia officials say the debt is not too large and is necessary.
"Unless an auto maker reaches a production capacity of one million units a year, it will be difficult for that company to survive," said Kim Sun Hong, Kia's chairman.
Mr. Kim, 63, knows what it is like to be on the brink. He is known here as the "Lee Iacocca of Korea" for his role in saving Kia in 1981.
In an economy dominated by family-owned conglomerates, known as "chaebol," Mr. Kim is a rarity -- a professional manager, not an owner, who worked his way up from the shop floor. That, plus the fact that Kia is focused on only one business, has made it a model in the eyes of Korea's Government, which is trying to loosen the power of the chaebol.
In trying to enter the United States, Kia is being helped by the fact that the American market is booming and the strong yen has forced the Japanese to raise prices. "There's a hole in the market" for a low-priced compact car, said Greg Warner, executive vice president of Kia Motors America in Irvine, Calif.
Mr. Warner used to work for Hyundai and is eager to avoid the mistakes that company made in entering the American market. Sales soared to 264,000 cars in 1988 as buyers snapped up Hyundai's inexpensive Excel. But sales fell almost as rapidly as drivers began finding problems.
Hyundai, Korea's most advanced car maker, has improved its quality, and its sales elsewhere in the world continue to grow. But in the United States its image has proved more difficult to repair than its product, and sales remain at just 110,000 a year. "We are more cautious now," said Juhn Myung Hun, director of export marketing for Hyundai's America group.
Kia has, in a sense, already succeeded in the United States. It has made the Festiva, a subcompact sold by Ford, which owns 10 percent of Kia. The Festiva has recently been succeeded by the Aspire, also made by Kia.
But Kia is still mindful of the lessons of Hyundai. Its advertising does not mention the word "Korea." It has made it easy for dealers to take on a Kia franchise for an investment of as little as $25,000. It is offering an extensive warranty program. Above all, its initial sales goals are modest and it is expanding slowly. It now has 66 dealers in 11 Western states and won't have nationwide coverage until the end of 1995.
"Our strategy is to avoid big damage," Mr. Kim said, adding that some setbacks are inevitable. "The Japanese faced a great deal of difficulties and some failures in the first 10 years," he said. "We need to have our own experience firsthand."
Kia's American efforts could get a big lift when the car maker begins selling the Sportage. "That, I think, is going to be the franchise," said Chris Cedergren, senior vice president of AutoPacific Inc., a market research firm in Santa Ana, Calif.
The Sportage, which has little competition in its price range other than the Suzuki Sidekick, has drawn such positive reviews that both Ford and Mazda, which owns 8 percent of Kia, are thinking of selling it under their own names.
Kia was founded by Kim Chul Ho, who at 18 went to Japan to work at a steel mill. In 1930, he set up a company in Japan making nuts and bolts, and he prospered. In 1944, Mr. Kim returned to Korea and set up a company to make bicycle parts, later moving to complete bicycles. The name "Kia" in Chinese characters means to rise in Asia toward the world. By 1973, when Mr. Kim died, his company was about to begin passenger car production.
The current chairman (no relation to the founder) joined Kia after studying engineering at Seoul National University and rose quickly through the ranks, becoming president of Kia's machine tool subsidiary in his early 40's.
In 1981 Kia suffered huge losses after the second oil shock, which sent Korea's economy into a tailspin. Kia's president at the time, the son of the founder, had to bail out, selling his shares to employees and handing the reins to Mr. Kim.
That same year, Korea's Government decided to restructure the ailing industry. Kia was forced to give up passenger car production, but in exchange was given a monopoly on certain trucks and buses.
Mr. Kim bet the company on the Bongo, a small van made under a license from Mazda. Mr. Kim put the logo of the minivan on the uniform of every employee. And instead of saying "good morning," employees greeted one another each day with "Let's sell Bongos." The campaign was so intense it became known as "Bongoism." But sales took off and Kia's recovery began.

AROUND 1985, Mazda approached Kia about manufacturing a subcompact that Mazda had designed for Ford. Lured by the prospect of exports of what was to become the Festiva, the Government let Kia back into making cars.
Kia's share of Korea's passenger car market quickly climbed to 30 percent. Last year, its overall vehicle production reached 600,000 units, double the level in 1989. The company is now planning, with help from Mazda, to make a mid-sized sedan.
Earnings, however, have been weakened by expansion. Last year, Kia had net income of 18.7 billion won, or $23.1 million, on sales of $5.1 billion. But Don Lee, auto analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Seoul, forecasts that Kia's earnings will double this year and double again in 1995.
While Kia and the other Korean companies are now growing rapidly, there are still doubts about the future. Korean companies are still behind Japan in product quality, productivity and variety, and they are dependent on Japan for technology and production equipment. Kia's factory, for instance, was largely designed by Mazda, and the Sephia has a Mazda-designed engine.
What has been sustaining the Koreans has been the price advantage over Japan because of the strong yen, but Japanese companies are taking steps to offset the yen's rise. "Korean auto makers will not be able to depend on price alone," said Mr. Lee, the analyst. "They have three years or so to boost their competitiveness."
Some analysts say the industry is due for a shakeout because it is building far more cars than are needed. Such fears were heightened recently by the decision of the Samsung Group, a huge conglomerate, to enter the passenger car business with technology and designs provided by Nissan Motor Company of Japan.
The existing auto makers have protested, and Korea's Government is reluctant to approve Samsung's move, worrying that a glut would undermine the entire Korean industry. Growth of the domestic market is slowing, having increased only 13 percent last year, down from growth rates as high as 45 percent in the late 1980's.
Whether Samsung goes ahead or not remains to be seen. Last year, it bought a stake in Kia, raising fears of a hostile takeover. Some analysts say the conglomerate might eventually decide it makes more sense to enter the auto business through an acquisition. If Korea's Lee Iacocca wants to maintain the independence of the company he rescued, Kia cannot falter.
 
Growing Wings In a Sheltered Nest
 IT is the common wisdom in South Korea that buying a foreign car invites a tax audit. It is little wonder, then, that only about 2,000 foreign cars were sold in Korea last year, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of the market. Even in Japan, imports hold a 3 percent share.
Korea has borrowed a page from Japan by using a protected home market as a launching pad. Now Washington, which has spent much of its time trying to pry Japan's market open, is putting some pressure on Korea as well.
The barriers are formidable. Japanese cars are banned completely, in part because of Japan's history as a colonial ruler of Korea. All car purchases are taxed at percentages that rise sharply for larger and more expensive cars. While Korea says the tax system is meant to discourage excessive consumption, the United States has charged that the system effectively discriminates against foreign cars, which tend to be larger.
Korean officials say they are opening the market. Tariffs on imported cars were reduced this year to 10 percent, the same level as in Europe, down from 30 percent in the mid-1980's. (The United States tariff is 2.5 percent on cars and 25 percent on commercial vehicles.) And the Government has declared that buying a foreign car will not be grounds for a tax audit.
"From 1988 on, our automobile market has been completely open," said Cho Kwan Hyun, executive vice chairman of the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association.
But Washington is not buying this. It is a safe bet that as Korea becomes a major auto exporter, the pressure to accept more imports will only grow.

HEADLINE: Profile;
Even in a 'Big Tent,' Little Insults, Little Compromises

BYLINE: By TERESA RIORDAN; Teresa Riordan writes the Patents column on alternate Mondays.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Bruce A. Lehman swore before God and his country to uphold the laws of the land, his mother was holding the Bible.
Nothing extraordinary about that. But then, in a paneled sanctum of the Commerce Department, with a military color guard standing by, Mr. Lehman introduced to the assembled officials and well-wishers not only his mother and sister but also his male partner of 15 years, their 8-year-old child, and her lesbian mother, with whom Mr. Lehman and his companion share child-rearing duties. 
 The dignity of last September's swearing-in -- an unusual one even in the Clinton Administration's big-tent embrace of diversity -- suggested that Mr. Lehman had risen above society's prejudices as he stepped into his role as Assistant Commerce Secretary and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks -- the first openly gay man ever to be confirmed by the Senate as a high-ranking Government official. But the truth is that even for someone as successful and savvy and mainstream as Mr. Lehman, the uncharted territory of a public gay man can be strewn with insult and compromise.
As if to emphasize the Patent Office's link to industry, as well as its historic remoteness from the corridors of power, Mr. Lehman's office in Crystal City, Va., looks out on a highway, an elevated train line, National Airport, and, finally, the ruddy Potomac.
Northward along the Potomac lies the distant profile of monumental Washington, with the view dominated by the Capitol, where Mr. Lehman worked from 1974 to 1983 as a congressional aide -- and where he had two revelations that have shaped his life.
One, that he was gay. In 1978, after nine years of monogamous marriage to a "wonderful" woman, he finally acknowledged this both to himself and to her.
The other revelation was professional: Long before just about anyone else, Mr. Lehman foresaw that the field of intellectual property, far from being an arcane technical specialty, could be an important economic and policy tool -- and the basis of a career for an ambitious young man.
"I knew back then this was an uncut diamond," Mr. Lehman said.
While his predecessors have been seen as mere stewards of a backwater bureaucracy, Mr. Lehman has leveraged his perch into a central policy-making role.
His boss, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, stops short of dubbing his patents commissioner an intellectual property czar, but acknowledges that "in many respects, he plays that role in a de facto way."
Mr. Lehman somehow avoided the conservative wrath that Roberta Achtenberg, an Assistant Secretary at the Housing and Urban Development Department, the highest-ranking openly gay woman in the Administration, drew at her confirmation hearings.
"The Washington Times wrote a big story on my nomination trying to stir up some outrage from conservative Republicans," Mr. Lehman said. "The problem is, they all know me, and they kind of like me, and they didn't want to make a martyr of me."
While Mr. Lehman's long friendships on Capitol Hill and among his colleagues have insulated him from public attacks, he has not been spared anonymous barbs. A few weeks ago someone posted on the Internet's Intellectual Property bulletin board a note about the "queer commissioner."
Earlier this year, Mr. Lehman prepared a speech for the Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom, in San Francisco. In the speech, which he gave to his director of media affairs, Ruth M. Ford, to look over, he said he had not been the target of much anti-gay bias. "Ruth came back and said, 'We've got to change this,' " Mr. Lehman recalled. "I said, 'Why?' She said, 'We just haven't shown you the hate mail.' "
Ms. Ford said most such mail was thrown away, but mentioned one -- "somebody had written 'faggot faggot faggot' across it."

THE main criticism of Mr. Lehman's nomination as patents commissioner from some corners came not because he is gay but because his specialty has been copyright law rather than patents.
In the early 1980's, Mr. Lehman applied for the job of the Registrar of Copyrights. When he didn't get it, he did a lucrative stint as a copyright lawyer and lobbyist at the Washington firm Swidler & Berlin, where his clients included Lotus and Microsoft.
Part of the clash with the patent world was over style as much as substance. "Patent lawyers tend to be the type of people who wear plastic pen liners in their shirt pockets," said one intellectual property expert who declined to be quoted by name, "while copyright people tend to be wild and crazy artist types who became lawyers only because they had to to make a living."
The new patents commissioner has clearly spiced up the bland bureaucracy. Mr. Lehman, who at 48 exudes a boyish air, dresses impeccably, his stylish suits detailed with a fresh white handkerchief, and displays a touch of exotic color, perhaps a mint-colored watchband or the ruby background of a Brooks Brothers tie.
On a glass side table in his office sits a handsomely framed photograph taken at last year's White House Christmas party. Bill and Hillary Clinton stand in the middle. Mr. Lehman is to the left, under a portrait of George Washington. To the right is Mr. Lehman's partner, smiling, a trimmed tree behind him.
At about the time that picture was taken, Mr. Lehman threw a party of his own at his Georgetown home in honor of a visiting patent delegation from Russia, with Mr. Lehman's personal assistant, Mary Ann Villemi, playing the role of greeter and coat taker. His partner's conspicuous absence seemed to symbolize the subtle but constant compromises Mr. Lehman must make.
Being openly gay, though, may have helped him get this job, while it might have stymied his appointment in a previous administration. Both he and Ms. Achtenberg were considered to be at the top of a short list of people backed by gay activists.
Mr. Brown said that while he was "certainly conscious" that the gay community had backed the nomination, "Bruce Lehman is not here because he's gay. He's the absolute best person for the job."
At a recent meeting, Mr. Lehman jumped into a spiel by a diversity consulting team from Boston hoping to renew its contract with the patent office. The lead consultant was telling Mr. Lehman and his associates that of course her approach would not be to force antidiscrimination concepts down workers' throats. Mr. Lehman interrupted.
"As far as I'm concerned," he said, "it's got to be forced down their throats. If they want to be bigots, they can go work for someone else's department."
Later that day, between meetings, Mr. Lehman agreed to spend some time talking about his life. He suggested stopping at the Four Seasons in Georgetown for drinks before his final obligation of the day, a dinner put on by the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, a gay organization that was honoring him that night.
On the way, Mr. Lehman picked up the phone in his Government car and called his daughter's mother, who conceived the child through artificial insemination with Mr. Lehman's partner. Although the girl lives mainly with her mother, and her companion, she spends weekends and vacations with the men. On the phone, Mr. Lehman sorted out who would take care of her the next night.
Sitting in the highly civilized lounge at the Four Seasons, Mr. Lehman reflected that, professionally, he had suffered little discrimination. "I'm involved in an area where it's hard to say where I'm going to push a gay-rights agenda," he said.
But halfway into his first glass of wine, Mr. Lehman made a startling proclamation, one that proved a clear reminder that whatever his professional achievements, the marriage between his public and private lives is an uneasy one. His longtime partner, Mr. Lehman said, does not consider himself publicly gay and does not want his name used.
That is surprising, Mr. Lehman was told. After all, he was introduced publicly at the swearing-in, they have been to the White House together as a couple, and some of Mr. Lehman's friends casually mention the partner's name during interviews. Indeed, his partner, a prominent scientific researcher, is arguably a public figure himself. Close to the time Mr. Lehman was sworn in, his partner made a major scientific discovery that received front-page attention worldwide.

THUS far Mr. Lehman had not shown a glimpse of what some consider his trademark temper. But now he started to grow testy. On this deeply personal subject, he worked himself up to a roar, capturing the attention of a sizable portion of the Four Seasons crowd.
"What right is there for anybody to tie my partner into this?" he said. "I've been very careful never to say his name. The reason he doesn't want to be outed is that the right wing will attack him. This is not an abstract thing. This is something we live with every day."
He also talked about his daughter, saying, "There are places in this country where people would take such a child away from their parents, including right here where I'm sitting, in Virginia."
"Nothing could be a better example of the discrimination we suffer -- this is like being a Jew in the 1930's," he said.
Mr. Lehman did not bring it up, but the next day a colleague recalled that three years ago Mr. Lehman and his partner were beaten near Dupont Circle. Asked later, Mr. Lehman reluctantly elaborated. Until now only close friends had known about it.
A carload of "college boys shouted epithets at us," Mr. Lehman said. His partner shouted back. The car lurched onto the sidewalk. "I said, 'You touch me and you're going to jail.' Before you knew it, we were on the ground, being kicked and beaten."
He and his partner, bloody and bruised, went to the hospital.
Mr. Lehman testified against his assailants, and several of them become the first people ever convicted under the District of Columbia's hate-crime law. "The only way you can overcome this kind of intolerance is to stand up to it," he said.
On the way to the Gertrude Stein dinner, the car stopped to pick up Mr. Lehman's partner. It was an awkward ride. Mr. Lehman's partner, apparently taken by surprise by a reporter's presence, said nothing.
At the dinner, the cocktail hour was well under way, and Mr. Lehman and his partner melted into a crowd that included the Mayor of Washington and other politicians. Mr. Lehman's companion was asked if he was available the next day to discuss whether his name could be used in this article. He said he did not talk about his personal life with reporters. And then, this nameless, silent man sat down, clinging to anonymity in a room full of 200 people. A short while later, Mr. Lehman walked to the podium to accept his award.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Democrats Rediscover Knack of Losing

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE battle for Owensboro, Ky., may be the straw that broke the donkey's back.
Democrats never expected this year's Congressional elections to be easy. But the loss Tuesday of a House seat in rural Kentucky that had been Democratic for 129 years washed away the plaintive excuses Democrats have embraced since their defeat in the Georgia Senate race two weeks after Bill Clinton's election. The outcome in Kentucky marked the eighth in a streak of big defeats by Republican upstarts. 
 Could these be the stirrings of a grand realignment that will send Democratic voters fleeing to the Republican Party in November? Maybe not. Still, the results from these early contests will probably send Democratic candidates fleeing from their own President.
"Democrats are wise not to dismiss this as a series of random accidents," said Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. "If you're the Democratic Party, you're now the party of government. And you're the party to blame if voters want to send a message of unhappiness."
Yet the reality is far more complicated than whether Mr. Clinton has coattails, or reverse coattails. As much as they like to ascribe their successes to what they view as Mr. Clinton's emergence as a pariah, the Republicans should get credit for taking a lesson from their disastrous national convention in 1992.
Scorned by voters who were offended by their strident stands in Houston, Republicans are soft-pedaling issues like abortion, homosexual rights and school prayer that were once such successful calls to ideological arms. To the unknowing voter, the Republicans are sounding like Democrats.
But the Republicans have an advantage: If they are not too obvious, they can benefit from the mobilization of the far right, and they can also exploit voter discontent, since it is a Democrat who sits in the White House, the citadel of politics-as-usual. Such is the strategy of New York Republicans, who last week nominated State Senator George Pataki for Governor -- a move that could give Gov. Mario M. Cuomo his most serious opposition since 1982. Mr. Pataki, who supports a woman's right to an abortion, strikes a more mainstream tone on social issues than Mr. Cuomo's past opponents. To salve the far right, the Republicans nominated Herbert London, Mr. Pataki's far more conservative rival, as comptroller.
The Republican victor in Kentucky, Ron Lewis, is a fundamentalist minister who owns a religious bookstore. But his handlers carefully did not let his work become a big part of the dialogue. With money from the national Republican Party, he stuck to attacking the Democrat, former State Senator Joe Prather, as a tax-and-spend Clinton clone. That did not keep the religious right from working the churches and helping turn out the vote.
"They're hiding the social issues under a rock, they're going underground," said Peter Fenn, a strategist both for Mr. Prather and for Dan Webber, another Democrat who lost a special election for a House seat in Oklahoma earlier this month. "On gays in the military, Prather had a modified 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. They creamed him with it in the Christian churches, but it didn't show up in Lewis's advertising."
This is not to say that the Republicans have been entirely skillful in handling social issues. In some cases, Republicans have been so fearful of a backlash that they have forfeited issues they had championed, like family values, that have since been taken up by Mr. Clinton. And in many states, Republican parties are in turmoil over conservative extremists' attempts to gain control.
The best measure of how the election results have shaken Democrats is that the President himself lashed out at the religious right as fanatics in a private meeting with Democratic leaders the day after the Kentucky voting. He implored Democrats to fight back, telling them that Mr. Prather should have responded to a Republican commercial in which Mr. Prather's image dissolves into the face of Mr. Clinton and then back again. Mr. Prather, he said, should have retaliated with a commercial of himself and the late Representative William Natcher, a beloved Democrat who held the seat for 41 years until he died two months ago.
 
No Lack of Explanations
 Democrats have offered an assortment of explanations for their losses of the two House seats, for last year's losses of the governorships of Virginia and New Jersey and mayoral races in New York and Los Angeles and the Senate seat in Texas, and for the Georgia Senate seat the year before that. (Not to mention the loss of the lieutenant governorship in the President's home state.) In the same period, the Democrats have not won any pivotal seats from Republicans.
While it is common for the party out of power to win seats in special elections, the uninterrupted pattern of Republican victories is noteworthy. The most popular explanation among Democrats last week was that many of their party's recent standard-bearers have been lousy candidates. In the case of Mr. Prather, the party assembled 12 "talking points" to explain the loss. (The defeat prompted a snide comment by Paul Begala, a political adviser to Mr. Clinton: "This was a test of a candidate's low I.Q., not a test of the President's popularity.")
But in politics, excuses count for nothing -- and perceptions count for everything. And the perception that Republicans are on a roll certainly energizes the party faithful. By contrast, Mr. Clinton cannot seem to get on a roll -- at least one that lasts. Democrats hoped that passage of a health care proposal would save them, but thus far Republicans have had success ridiculing the plan as wildly expensive. Nor is Mr. Clinton benefiting from the economic recovery, perhaps because the improving conditions have yet to touch the lives of many individual voters appreciably. "We've come out of the recession, but there's still insecurity about the economic future," said Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is seeking re-election.
The trial heats only compound the fears of Democrats. Just as the Republicans may have learned from their losses after the 1992 convention, Democrats are paying the price for their victory. After a party wins the White House, it almost always suffers in the following mid-term elections. The Democrats are also more at risk because they have more seats to defend, especially across the South, where many conservative white Democrats are retiring from Congress in districts that have been close to turning Republican.
With Republicans effectively defusing the social issues, the challenge for the Democrats is to prove that even as the incumbents they are best positioned to help the people. "Health care has got to be passed by November," said Mr. Fenn. "This is a symbolic issue of Mr. Clinton and the Democratic Party. Putting it off until after the election would be a devastating mistake." Mr. Fenn is still reeling from his clients' losses in Oklahoma and Kentucky, and he is not about to advise his other candidates to embrace the Clinton agenda.
And Ben Sheffner, an analyst of Congressional contests, saw reasons for the Democrats to worry about their numerical advantage in the House. Just suppose, he said, that voters are in a "throw the bums out" mood and their resentment results in "throwing out three Democratic bums for every two Republican bums."

Balkan Road Signs: This Way to Chaos

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia

 BODY:
PART museum pieces, part twisted jokes, the road signs of the former Yugoslavia now chart a nation's destruction. There are countless signs to towns that cannot be reached, countless towns for which there are no longer any signs, and countless reasons for supposing that towns indicated have been reduced to rubble anyway or are swiftly headed that way.
Drive east from Zagreb and a strange thing happens. There is nothing to the east of Croatia. Europe plunges into a nameless abyss, for Serbia, and its capital, Belgrade, are too malevolent to mention. 
 They have disappeared without trace from road signs on what was once the main Yugoslav highway linking Zagreb and Belgrade.
This highway, known under Tito as the "Road of Brotherhood and Unity," was cut during the 1991 Serbian-Croatian war. Then, in September 1992, Cyrus R. Vance, a United Nations mediator in the Balkans, announced that he had secured an agreement between Croats and Serbs to reopen the road and rename it -- of all things -- "Road of Peace." The road never opened, peace never came, and Serbs never gave up their hold on about one-quarter of Croatia.
Signs on the highway near Zagreb now indicate Slavonski Brod, and even the bustling village of Lipovac (once about as well known in Zagreb as South Orange, N.J., but now thrust to prominence by the fact that it stands on the Croatian side of the border with the Serbian vacuum).
Budapest -- anathema to Croats during the nation's long subjection to the Austro-Hungarian Empire -- has also gained favor as a mentionable foreign capital.
"Mass psychology here does not allow any road sign to Belgrade," said Zarko Puhovski, a political scientist in Zagreb. "The hatred is too great. It would be destroyed."
Hatred. There is a rough equation here: With the same velocity as road signs have lost their sense, hatred has grown in the former Yugoslavia. Neighbors have lost touch with each other. Companies have lost access to their raw materials. People have lost their livelihoods, their homes, and their psychological bearings.
In the same month as the Channel Tunnel was opened in one corner of Europe, linking Britain and France for the first time since the Ice Age, this Balkan corner of Europe continued its headlong retreat toward the paleolithic era of transport and communication.
To travel in Bosnia is to understand that only when road signs mean something and links are restored between communities will peace finally come, and, with it, some chance of making a living.
Consider a sign on the main road out of Tuzla, the largest Bosnian town after Sarajevo that is still in the hands of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. It reads: "Zagreb 325 kilometers. Belgrade 227 kilometers. Sarajevo 120 kilometers."
The sign points to roads that were the main arteries of Yugoslavia and are still essential to any economic revival in this region. But because roads north of Tuzla are cut by the Serbian lines in and around Brcko, Zagreb is in fact well over 1,000 kilometers -- 650 miles and more -- away, via the southern coastal towns of Split and Rijeka.
Belgrade lies beyond enemy territory and can scarcely be visited by the Muslims of Tuzla. For anyone else, a journey to the Serbian capital that avoided the front lines of the Bosnian war would involve a three-day trek through Croatia and Hungary.
As for Sarajevo, it lies at the far end of a labyrinth of primitive mountain roads the United Nations has put to use in an attempt to steer its aid convoys away from front lines. These trails -- which boast names like "Acorn," "Finch" and "Skoda" bestowed upon them by the United Nations -- must be taken because the main road to Sarajevo is cut by Serbian forces south of Kladanj.
So the 120-kilometer Tuzla-Sarajevo journey -- about 80 miles -- takes about 12 hours.
It takes that long because of scenes like this: ten hulking United Nations trucks escorted by a couple of armored personnel carriers stalled, amid scrawny goats, begging children and heavily armed Bosnians, on a 10-foot-wide mountain trail that has a 45-degree gradient. The road, awash in mud and dotted with suspension-busting potholes, was employed only for the occasional ox-drawn cart in the days before war tore up the maps of Bosnia.
 
A Fatal Turn
 Patience is, however, very strongly recommended, even when traffic simply stops. Wrong turns often lead to ambushes by bandits after money, or straight into mine fields.
One such wrong turn led two American journalists -- one from the popular culture magazine Spin and the other from a Seattle weekly, Magnolia News -- to their deaths this month on the road between Sarajevo and Mostar (this road gets tricky because two bridges have been blown up and traffic has to find its way onto a makeshift ferry operated by the United Nations on the Neretva River).
To get into Sarajevo itself involves taking a winding trail over Mount Ig- man, the scene, in happier days, of the Olympic ski jump. The ski jump is still there, but is now flanked by United Nations and Bosnian soldiers.
Sarajevo is still there, too, at least some vestigial bits of it; but the city is full of signs that only point to Europe's new curtains of iron.
One indicates the road to Grbavica, a Serbian-held part of town that cannot be visited from the Muslim side. Another points to Pale -- previously 45 minutes away by car, now accessible most quickly through a United Nations flight to Zagreb, followed by flights to Vienna and Budapest, and then a long drive south through Belgrade (where the airport has been closed by United Nations sanctions) and on to Pale.
There is at least one honest sign in the former Yugoslavia. It stands on the outskirts of the front-line Muslim-held town of Kladanj, south of Tuzla. It points east, across the lines, to the Serbian-held town of Vlasenica, about 20 miles away. Somebody has scratched out "Vlasenica" and scrawled one word: "Death."

HEADLINE: Clinton and China: How Promise Self-Destructed

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; The following article is based on reporting by Thomas L. Friedman, Elaine Sciolino and Patrick E. Tyler and was written by Ms. Sciolino.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Warren Christopher was in China, and the President was furious.
The Secretary of State's high-profile trip in March was supposed to have been the capstone of the Administration's strategy of working intensively with Beijing to resolve their dispute over human rights. Instead, things were getting worse by the day. Mr. Christopher was trading insults with the Chinese authorities, who were preoccupied with their annual National People's Congress, and he was facing harsh criticism from the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. 
 As President Clinton watched his China policy heading over a cliff, he exploded in front of aides in the Oval Office, "What the hell is Chris doing there now?"
The President's outburst, say aides, reflected his frustration not only with his Secretary of State but also with a policy that was supposed to have been an effortless success but was turning into a diplomatic tar baby.
In the end, Mr. Clinton would renew China's trade privileges and abandon an agonizing annual ritual of linking renewal of trade benefits to improvements in Beijing's human rights performance. The story of how he got there, reconstructed in interviews with senior Administration officials, lawmakers and business and human rights leaders, is a tale of broken campaign promises and fierce inter-agency battles, secret diplomacy and 11th-hour indecision.
Mr. Clinton decided on the central issue of extending the trade benefits months before his announcement on Thursday, though he was still changing his mind about the details until the final moment. He called former President Jimmy Carter with a last-minute offer for him to head an independent blue-ribbon human rights panel recommended by Mr. Christopher that would press China to make more progress. Mr. Carter not only said no, he advised Mr. Clinton to scrap the idea, saying it would not be taken seriously by human rights organizations.
Mr. Clinton discarded it just before heading to the White House briefing room to make his announcement.
 
The Prelude
Campaign Promise And an Order
 When Mr. Clinton began his Presidential campaign, his views on China were shaped as much by immediate political needs as by geopolitical strategy. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. favored using the threat of withdrawing "most-favored- nation" benefits from China if it did not improve its human rights record. Candidate Clinton, who needed their support to win the Democratic Party nomination, was not about to contradict them.
When it came time for the new President to draw up his policy, Senator Mitchell and his allies in Congress threatened to pass legislation withdrawing China's trade benefits if Beijing did not do more to ease repression. To head off such a law, with its inherent inflexibility, Mr. Clinton asked his aides to draft an executive order that would mollify the Democrats in Congress but remain vague enough to allow the President to change course a year later.
With no senior member of the Administration opposing the idea, Mr. Clinton signed Presidential Executive Order 12850 at the White House on May 28, 1993. It renewed China's trade benefits for another year but said China must meet two "mandatory" conditions to win another extension in June 1994: end restrictions on emigration by close family members of dissidents and comply with a 1992 agreement banning the export of prison-labor products to the United States. China was also supposed to make "overall, significant progress" on a number of other issues, ranging from easing the crackdown on Tibet to accounting for political prisoners.
Chinese dissidents, liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans, Asia Watch, members of the U.S.-China Business Council and even a representative of Tibet's leadership gathered at the White House for the signing of the order, which was widely hailed as a masterful solution.
But it was a false consensus, because each side saw in the executive order what it wanted to see. The liberal Democrats thought the directive had finally put some muscle into the trade threat, and the business sector thought that it was ambiguous enough finally to eviscerate the trade threat.
 
Policy Shift
 'Downward Spiral' Forces a Change
 China was not impressed, and over the next few months, the relationship with the United States deteriorated. The Chinese loaded chemicals for making weapons on a freighter headed for Iran, shipped technology for M-11 missiles to Pakistan in violation of an international missile agreement and rejected pleas from the Clinton Administration to cancel a long-scheduled underground nuclear test.
As it became apparent that the executive order was not having its desired effect and that the threat to revoke China's trade benefits might actually have to be carried out, the American business sector mobilized.
"We consistently sent the President and his advisers letters and short papers arguing that extending trade with China was critical for helping the economy and jobs," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "That was argument No. 1. There was a subordinate argument -- that it would also advance human rights."
In mid-July, Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, argued in a classified paper that the relationship was on a "downward spiral" and urged an entirely new strategy of intensive engagement with Beijing in which incentives would substitute for threats. But it took more than two more months before Mr. Clinton signed an "action memorandum" putting the strategy into effect with a series of high-level exchanges, including a meeting between Mr. Clinton and China's President, Jiang Zemin, in Seattle in November.
The high-profile meeting yielded little. But within weeks a consensus began to emerge in the Administration that the United States had to find a formula to allow the extension of China's trade benefits.
Shortly after the New Year, Secretary Christopher ordered his legal advisers to prepare an analysis of exactly how little China had to do to meet the executive order. Their conclusion: As long as China met the two mandatory conditions, on emigration of dissidents' families and the export of prison goods, Mr. Christopher could recommend renewal; the rest could be finessed.
 
Christopher Trip
Clinton Is Angry And 'Disappointed'
 One incident more than any other threatened to derail this approach, however: a meeting in late February in Beijing between Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent democracy campaigner, and Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. Shortly before Mr. Christopher was to pay his first visit to Beijing as Secretary of State, Mr. Shattuck held the 90-minute encounter in a very public setting -- the coffee garden of the China World Hotel.
He never informed Mr. Christopher or Mr. Lord what he was planning, and the embassy took a hands-off approach, deciding not to report back to Washington on the impending meeting or its expected impact. Mr. Wei quickly publicized the meeting, and China furiously denounced the United States, calling Mr. Wei a "criminal on parole" and charging Mr. Shattuck with breaking Chinese laws.
Over the next few days, China rounded up dissidents in an effort to insure an uneventful National People's Congress. Mr. Christopher decided to go ahead with his visit to Beijing anyway, arguing that if he canceled, the Chinese would make no more concessions and the President would be forced to revoke China's trade benefits. But Mr. Christopher found himself on the defensive throughout his three-day trip, and the furor obscured the few concessions he won from Beijing.
Mr. Clinton was so distraught by the public criticism of his China policy set off by the Christopher episode that he made no effort to support his Secretary of State in public and told reporters that he was "disappointed" with the trip.
Returning to Washington, Mr. Christopher immediately requested a meeting of senior national security and economic advisers in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where he defended his trip and convinced the group that their backbiting had been "counterproductive." The President did not attend.
 
The Decision
Several Influences, Including Carter
 From the beginning of the process, senior Clinton officials had issued the same warning to Beijing: Don't think you can come in at the last minute with a few cosmetic concessions on human rights and win renewal of your low tariffs. But as the deadline approached, and it became clear that China was not going to move very much, the strategy shifted. China was told directly that a few, last-minute, face-saving concessions would do.
During Richard M. Nixon's funeral in late April, Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, and other officials met with Li Daoyu, China's Ambassador to the United States, in a cramped meeting room in the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., and proposed that a secret emissary be sent to Beijing. Mr. Christopher recruited Michael H. Armacost, a former Ambassador to Japan, who was sent with a proposal for the Chinese leadership: If Beijing made enough minor gestures to cover the basics of the executive order, the Administration was prepared to drop the link between trade and human rights permanently.
China's leaders moved a bit. They invited an American technical team to discuss the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts, and promised to release an important democracy protester and give visas to the families of certain dissidents.
Since the Chinese had already agreed to abide by an understanding with Washington on banning exports of goods made with prison labor, the concession on the visas gave the Clinton team just enough to be able to say that the two "mandatory" conditions of the executive order had been met.
Mr. Christopher drafted his recommendation to the President as he flew home from the Middle East on May 19. He stated bluntly that there had been no "overall, significant progress" on the five other conditions in the executive order. In fact, he wrote, China's human rights record remained far below basic international standards.
Mr. Clinton rejected sweeping sanctions against China's military establishment after aides pointed out that it would be impossible to identify most items made at sites controlled by the military. He even wavered in the final days over whether it would be better to make a clean break with the past and impose no sanctions at all, an argument made by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the economic team. He accepted Mr. Christopher's recommendation to impose high tariffs on Chinese-made munitions, but ended the agonizing annual ritual linking human rights and trade.
 
How the U.S. Needs China
 Aides say several arguments tipped the balance for Mr. Clinton.
His experience as President had taught him something that he had not understood as Governor of Arkansas. It was not just how much America needed China for business reasons; it was how much the United States needed China for national security reasons -- to deal with North Korea, the United Nations Security Council and the spread of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Clinton was also moved by Mr. Bentsen's argument that when the United States acts unilaterally to impose sanctions against China because of human rights abuses, it has the worst of all worlds: the policy is not effective and markets are lost. Sanctions must be imposed by allies or not at all.
In the end, it may have been Mr. Carter who, in a series of long conversations, had the greatest impact on Mr. Clinton's thinking. As President, Mr. Carter had normalized relations with Beijing, and in a last-ditch effort to wrench more concessions from the Chinese, the Clinton Administration summoned him to Washington to help. In a meeting with Ambassador Li on May 19, Mr. Carter asked the Chinese to do two things -- set a date for talks with Tibet's leadership and release more political prisoners.
The Chinese did neither.
Mr. Carter later balked when Mr. Clinton asked him to head a human rights panel. With both business and human rights leaders with vastly different agendas sitting on the committee, it would end up doing embarrassingly little, the former President said.
In announcing the decision to extend China's trade benefits on Thursday, Mr. Clinton cited Mr. Carter's support, and told reporters, "We do not do this with rose-colored glasses on." He told his aides that he was counting on the Chinese to live up to their argument that taking threats out of the relationship will make it politically much easier for them to improve their human rights performance.
Mr. Lord drove that point home to Ambassador Li when he formally informed him of the President's decision. "You said this way was going to be more productive," the Assistant Secretary of State said. "Now prove it."

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA FOILS EFFORTS TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR PLANS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's latest plan to stop North Korea's nuclear program appeared on the verge of collapse today as North Korea declared it would "never allow" outsiders to derail its nuclear plans, and officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency left the country saying their inspection efforts had failed.
North Korea's announcement came as reports here indicated that Pyongyang appears to be preparing to test a new medium-range missile over the Sea of Japan. 
 In the past, the Central Intelligence Agency has said North Korea's extensive missile program is part of an effort to prove that its nuclear arsenal could strike all the major cities in Japan and South Korea. The last test, a year ago, prompted considerable alarm here after the missile, which was not armed, landed near Japan's west coast.
Taken together, the latest events suggest that Clinton Administration officials may have been too optimistic last week when they expressed confidence that a new approach to North Korea -- including an offer of high-level talks about diplomatic and economic links that the North has long sought -- could break a yearlong impasse over keeping the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
"The fact of the matter is that we don't really understand what they are doing," an American official based in Asia who follows the situation closely said today. "They may be toying with us, or they may have suddenly decided that they have to save the nuclear program at all cost."
While the talks with North Korea over the last year and a half have often seemed an endless cycle of optimistic predictions followed by warnings of impending confrontation, they have never before seemed to carry so much urgency.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, which dispatched an inspection team to observe the removal of the fuel rods from the reactor at Yongbyon, says that North Korea is within days of obliterating evidence of how much, if any, nuclear fuel has been diverted to its weapons program. Washington has said that if the evidence is destroyed, it will have no choice but to seek economic sanctions, a measure Pyongyang has said it will consider an act of war.
With the collapse of the talks with the atomic energy agency, an arm of the United Nations, the Security Council was considering a weekend meeting to issue another warning to the North. But it is unclear whether China, which has veto power, will back the sanctions it has consistently opposed and what effect the Administration's decision to renew China's favorable trade status might have on China's position.
A call for sanctions would be a major reversal for the State Department, which just two weeks ago began a new effort to engage the North. Both South Korea and Washington dropped several conditions they had required North Korea to fulfill before another round of talks on diplomatic and economic ties. On Friday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher described that effort, along with the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status this week, as part of a strategy to press American interests throughout Asia without isolating important countries.
 
North Steams Ahead
 But from the start, many American officials have viewed the diplomatic engagement of the North as an exercise in self-deception that disregarded evidence that Pyongyang was speeding ahead with its nuclear program. That argument has gained credence as North Korea rushes to replaced more than 8,000 fuel rods, a process that ultimately could produce enough fuel for four or five nuclear weapons.
The rods can be reprocessed into bomb-grade plutonium, and North Korea has expended much of its scarce hard currency in recent years building a reprocessing center near the reactor.
The atomic energy agency has been insisting that North Korea comply with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and permit the agency to track the fuel rods. It also wants to take samples from selected rods, which would reveal how much plutonium was extracted during the last reloading in 1989, when inspectors were barred.
So far North Korea has allowed the agency to observe part of the reloading from a distance, but has refused to allow the taking of samples, or "segregation" of about 300 specific rods for future tests.
Today the agency announced that officials sent to Pyongyang to negotiate had left after the North Koreans "rejected all I.A.E.A. proposals put forward with the aim of maintaining the I.A.E.A.'s ability to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements, so as to be able to verify the history of the reactor core." Two inspectors remain, but their activities appear to be severely restricted.
 
A Whisper of Flexibility?
 Referring to the agency's demand to mark and sample the rods, North Korea said today that "we can never allow this under the present condition, no matter what others say and what counteraction they may take," an apparent reference to economic sanctions. It said that stopping the refueling, as the agency has demanded, would result in "colossal economic losses and formidable danger."
Offering one hint of flexibility, North Korea said it might place all the rods under unspecified surveillance and suggested the agency might be allowed to measure them "when the nuclear problem is solved in a package deal in the future." However, the agency said last week that such a process would obscure critical rods under thousands of meaningless ones and would prevent the measurements from being taken.
On Friday the agency's director, Hans Blix, alarmed officials in Washington when he said North Korea was removing rods "at a very fast pace" and would begin, within days, to remove the crucial rods. If that occurred, he said, his agency "would not be in a position to verify, with any degree of confidence," that all nuclear material in North Korea was under the prescribed safeguards.
 
Uneasiness in Japan
 North Korea today accused the energy agency of taking "an arrogant stance" and insisted that Pyongyang enjoyed a "unique status" that enabled it to pick and choose what inspections it would undergo. It has claimed that status since it threatened in March 1993 to withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty.
Several Japanese newspapers reported today that the United States had passed along to Tokyo satellite reconnaissance suggesting that a test launch of the Rodong 1, North Korea's experimental missile, was imminent.
The satellite imagery, the reports said, showed mobile-launcher trucks operating near the coast, and North Korean ships staking out positions off the coast, perhaps to monitor a test launch. Last year Japan was taken by surprise when North Korea tested the missile and did not have enough tracking equipment focused on the launch to determine with any accuracy how far the missile had flown. The American warning was presumably intended to assure that both Japanese and American surveillance was ready to pick up a new launch.
The C.I.A. has said the Rodong 1 missile could be fitted to carry a nuclear warhead -- if the North Koreans have learned how to detonate one. North Korea has also been active in exporting missiles to the Middle East, especially to Iran. The Rodong 1 is believed to have a range of 600 or so miles, which would place Osaka, Japan's second-largest metropolitan area, in striking distance from the North Korean coast.

HEADLINE: Ancient Rock in Crosscurrents of Today

SERIES: Searching Its Soul: The American Catholic Church -- First of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
On Sundays at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, in a gang-ridden area near downtown, the pews fill up for the Spanish-English Mass at 10:45. Then at the noon Mass, the one that features a mariachi band in gray costumes with gold buttons down the legs, the aisles are jammed and the congregation spills out the front and side doors onto the sidewalk.
"Between 5,000 and 6,000 come each Sunday -- 10,000 on the big feast days," said the Rev. Dennis O'Neil, St. Thomas's 54-year-old pastor. The worshipers are largely Salvadorans, Hondurans, Guatemalans and Mexicans, including lots of young couples with babies in their arms and toddlers in tow. 
 Twenty miles and several socioeconomic levels away, in the affluent seaside municipality of Santa Monica, another Roman Catholic church stands locked, barricaded behind scaffolding because of severe structural damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. That does not discourage the thousand or so St. Monica worshipers, mostly young adults between 18 and 35 years old, who stream in and out of the parish high school gymnasium for an evening Mass that resounds with sacred music recast in the rhythms of rock, jazz and country-and-Western.
St. Thomas the Apostle and St. Monica's are two of the most vibrant faces of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, a church that embraces one of every four Americans and that remains a major moral and even political force in American life. Beyond its direct influence on the schooling and inner lives of millions of practicing Catholics, the church is one of the country's largest providers of social services, from soup kitchens to inner-city hospitals, and it has been a powerful rallying point in the politics of abortion and sexual morality.
Yet around the country there are other, far less vibrant faces of American Catholicism, and signs of problems that run much deeper than the well-known internecine disagreements over contraception or even the scandals in which priests have molested children.
Over the last three decades, one of every three Catholic schools closed, even as the Catholic population grew. Already, more than 300 parishes are led by sisters or lay people because of the emerging shortage of priests.
Most important, the church is struggling against a cooling of devotion among many members. A parish not far from St. Monica's, in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, has experienced a kind of malaise seen in many other churches around the country as attendance and enthusiasm have dwindled. In the 1960's, Corpus Christi Church in Pacific Palisades was often filled to its capacity of 1,000 for the main Sunday Mass; today that many may show up only at Christmas or Easter, and attendance at theweekend services ranges from 100 to 300.
Msgr. John A. Mihan described the Corpus Christi Church as "dormant" when he took over five years ago. "Over a long time, we had lost many people who were confused or disillusioned with the church for some reason," he said. The church has embarked on a membership drive, including such measures as special Masses for young families.
Nationwide, Sunday Mass attendance, generally considered the most reliable measure of Catholic commitment, has fallen. In surveys in the 1960's, more than two-thirds of people who call themselves Catholics said they attended weekly Mass. Today, 37 percent say they do, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll in April. Church authorities in large cities report still lower figures. Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston recently said Mass attendance there was only 25 percent to 30 percent.
In the early 1960's, both Catholics and Protestants gave 2.2 percent of their income to their churches. By the mid-1980's, Protestants were still giving the same share while Catholics were giving only half as much, according to data compiled by the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the sociologist and author.
"If giving as a percent of income is a valid measure of commitment to the church, we are in trouble." said R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame.
Although many individual Catholic institutions like St. Thomas and St. Monica continue to radiate vitality, the church as a whole is suffering an ominous erosion of its essential infrastructure -- in the Catholic schools that have yet to be replaced as a means of inculcating Catholic values in future successive generations; in the ranks of priests and sisters who have long been the mainstays of church leadership, and in the religious knowledge and the moral and financial support of the Catholic laity.
Demographic shifts are adding to the strain, with traditional urban Catholic populations dispersing to suburbs, leaving behind costly church buildings with too few worshipers. In the last five years, the archdioceses of Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago and San Francisco have had to close many older parishes, often stirring angry protests.
Strengthened by new streams of Catholic immigrants from Latin American and Asia, membership in the Catholic Church grew by 1.5 million over the last two years, to about 60 million. But the growth has been slowed by dropouts and conversions to other faiths. Twenty years ago, 90 percent of Hispanic Americans identified themselves as Catholic; now, two-thirds to three-quarters do. Many have joined evangelical and pentecostal churches.
Indeed, once Catholics reach their adult years, studies show, they are more likely than other Americans to abandon the church of their upbringing, some through intermarriage but many with recriminations that the church is either too conservative or too liberal for their tastes.
The increasing reports of cases in which priests have molested children, and what many perceive as the church's initial efforts to conceal the problem, has definitely hurt the church's image and has left some dioceses facing potentially devastating lawsuits. In the New York Times/CBS News Poll in April, 52 percent of Catholics said they believed that the church had done a poor job of handling such charges. But only one-third of Catholics said their overall opinion of the church had become more negative. The nationwide telephone poll of 446 Catholic adults has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.
Adding to the difficulty of addressing the church's long-range problems is the new, and often extreme, polarization among many Catholics. American Catholicism is rent by doctrinal disputes that now stretch from sexual morality to the definition of Catholicism itself. Priests, theologians and lay leaders eye one another with suspicion, and distrust has reached into the ranks of the bishops.
Liberals accuse conservatives of trying to undo the reforms instituted by the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's, which gave ordinary believers a greater role in church affairs and made the church more receptive to modern ideas like religious liberty. Conservatives accuse liberals of twisting the reforms to justify an anything-goes attitude toward church teachings.
The new catechism of the Catholic Church was approved by Pope John Paul II in 1992 to give Catholics around the world a single, comprehensive statement of church teaching. But the English translation from the original French was delayed until Friday because the Vatican and American traditionalists believed that efforts to avoid references to humankind as "man" or "men" were distorting doctrine to appease feminists.
"I have seen visceral hatred among conservative Catholics for what they see as perversions of Vatican II by the more or less mainstream left," Michael Novak, a neoconservative Catholic author, said in a speech last year. He added that he had also seen "at least an equally visceral hatred" from the left for Pope John Paul II and others viewed as instruments of a Vatican retreat to the past.
 
Deep Roots
Hope and Help For the Multitudes
 Despite its troubles, the Catholic Church remains deeply rooted in many communities across the country, with its network of 20,000 parishes, nearly 9,000 elementary and high schools, more than 200 colleges and universities, more than 550 hospitals and a social-service system second only to the government's. It also remains one of the few institutions linking the rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless, the established and the newcomers of society.
Hospices for the dying, spiritual counseling centers for executives, treatment programs for drug addicts, legal aid for refugees, marriage-preparation courses and marriage-renewal weekends -- the church's pastoral and social work goes on in thousands of quietly thriving efforts that escape the attention given to papal rebukes or theological questioning.
By noontime on a Sunday in Lent, a hundred adults at St. Thomas the Apostle met to prepare for baptism at Easter; the parish also baptizes 100 infants every month. In the garage at the rear of the parking lot, Juan Flores manned the parish food bank as he has for nine years, this time accompanied by his 8-year old grandson.
Father O'Neil had opened the parish school building so that Indian parishioners, immigrants from the Oaxaca region of Mexico, could attend a meeting about the uprising in the neighboring state of Chiapas. He sat down in a tent erected in the parking lot by a parish group selling Central American snacks to raise money for a festival. "When I came, this place was locked up tight as a drum at 5 P.M.," Father O'Neil said. "Now it's open until 11."
In an area rife with drugs and gangs, where two or three families typically share an apartment or sometimes live in unheated garages, St. Thomas is "a kind of zone of non-violence," he said. In nine years, he said, there have been no graffiti on the church, and gangs do not bother people obviously going to and from there.
Father O'Neil started a soccer league for children. The parish helped each national group mount its own religious festivals. The parish school, run by lay people, was designated a "National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence" by the United States Department of Education.
Father O'Neil described church efforts to bring Hispanic-Americans and Korean-Americans together after the 1992 rioting. (St. Thomas was one of the churches where people brought back merchandise they had stolen.) He described negotiations with the police to find a place where single mothers could set up as tamale vendors.
Then the priest excused himself to talk quietly with a man whose wife and children had been severely burned in a neighborhood fire.
St. Thomas the Apostle represents a new, energetic wave of an old phenomenon: immigrant Catholicism. Fifteen years ago, not a single Mass at St. Thomas was in Spanish, and Los Angeles had not yet passed Chicago and New York to become the nation's largest archdiocese.
Father O'Neil's Central American parishioners, like the Irish and Italians and Poles before them, come from cultures where the central place of religion and the church is taken for granted. Yet many actually become more involved in church life here than in their homelands.
The church assists them in the difficult passage from one culture to another, offering a mix of material aid, cultural identity, moral guidance and spiritual solace. In the Los Angeles archdiocese now, Mass is said in 46 languages.
 
Deep Changes
A Blend of Piety And Personality
 In much the way that St. Thomas's responds to the social and economic needs of its Central American immigrants, St. Monica's addresses the emotional needs of its well-educated, professional parishioners, two-career couples and retired folks as well as singles pursuing their vocations in Southern California's medical complexes, film studios and engineering firms.
Known for lively worship and priests who are both open-minded and direct about their personal faith, the parish draws people from all over the city to its array of activities. Jan Scruton, who recently switched to St. Monica's after 30 years of attendance at the now-languishing church in Pacific Palisades, said she had come because the priests were friendlier and more engaging.
"That human element makes such a big difference," Ms. Scruton said. "Nobody wants to go to church and hear a droning lecture every day or be chastised continuously for your sins. Really, life's too short."
There are Bible groups and bereavement groups and bowling groups, a social-justice group and a gay and lesbian outreach ministry. Before the 6:30 Mass every morning, a handful of parishioners assemble, as in monasteries, to say morning prayers.
At a dinner for parish staff and volunteers, young people hoot and pump their arms. The mood swings between ribbing of the priests and tearful testimonials about the "home" or "family" that St. Monica's has given them.
"The one thing about St. Monica's is that the door is always open," said Peter Bohanek, a 26-year-old building manager who was baptized as an infant but reared with virtually no religious training after his parents divorced.
"My previous impression was that the Catholic Church was very rigid, although I didn't really know if that was true," Mr. Bohanek said, but at St. Monica's "the bottom line is that people with so many different experiences and outlooks can be honest with each other about their problems and their faith."
Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson, who heads the parish, stresses flexibility. Homosexuality, for instance, is "a very difficult issue for our church," he said. St. Monica's will not bless gay or lesbian marriages or contradict the church's teachings, but "if we want gays and lesbians to grow in the Gospel, we can't ask them to leave."
This may be a far cry from what older Catholics sometimes bemoan, the lost solidarity of an immigrant faith in which priests, nuns, parents and schoolchildren all knew their places and their catechism -- a church preserved in the amber of Hollywood sentimentality in the 1944 Oscar-winning film, "Going My Way."
Curiously enough, it was at St. Monica's that the film's screenwriter-producer-director, Leo McCarey, observed the relationship between a younger priest and an older one that he transformed into roles played by Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald. Fifty years later, Mr. McCarey would find a parish bustling with an energy and enterprise that, said Ysidro E. Reyes, an 81-year-old lifetime member of the parish, it did not have in the 1940's. "There were just Sunday Masses and a few raffles and things," Mr. Reyes said.
 
Wide Embrace
A Spiritual Bridge With Many Lanes
 Few other American institutions stretch so effectively across lines of ethnicity, race, education and economic class as the Catholic Church. However tenuously, the church links outsiders like St. Thomas's new immigrants with the college-educated grandchildren of Irish, Italian and Slavic immigrants, now the insiders occupying city halls and downtown executive suites.
Not far from St. Thomas the Apostle's parish school is the manicured, high-fenced campus of Loyola High School, a college-preparatory school in the neigborhood since 1917.
Although a quarter of Loyola's male students are on scholarship and about half are Hispanic, Asian or black, "many of the kids come in their mothers' Mercedeses," Father O'Neil said. Many, he added, also tutor the children at St. Thomas.
And at St. Monica's, even while the church faced huge expenses to repair earthquake damage, Monsignor Torgerson went before the congregation to make the annual appeal for money the archdiocese uses to subsidize poorer parishes like St. Thomas. That Sunday, parishioners pledged $90,000.
One frequent worshiper at St. Monica who represents the bridging function of Catholicism is Richard J. Riordan, a former businessman and now Mayor of Los Angeles, who has helped the archdiocese raise money for social programs and made large personal donations to the church.
The Mayor is a close friend of Roger Cardinal Mahony, the energetic Archbishop of Los Angeles and another bridging figure. A conservative in morals and matters of church authority, Cardinal Mahony earned his reputation as a church leader in Fresno and Stockton, Calif., by backing hard-pressed farm workers.
Visibly identified with his archdiocese's Hispanic population and the immigrants from the Philippines and Southeast Asia, the Cardinal is equally at home with the city's power structure, meeting regularly with newspaper publishers and movie executives as well as the area's political leaders.
The Catholic Church also stands astride some of the nation's deepest political rifts. Church officials' opposition to abortion is well known; their defense of traditional sexual morality has put them on the conservative side of the nation's cultural battles. In Washington and California, the church played a major role in defeating proposals to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
At the same time, the Catholic bishops' criticism of nuclear arms and their advocacy of welfare measures for the poor became rallying points for critics of the Reagan Republicanism. They bolstered opposition to the Reagan Administration's emphasis on military measures in Central America. More recently, they pressed anti-abortion Republicans to back passage of maternal-leave legislation.
 
Turning Point
Early 60's Saw A Second Genesis
 Neither the bright spots nor the dark shadows in American Catholicism, neither its bursts of creativity nor its bitter controversies, can be understood apart from the Second Vatican Council, the landmark event in 20th-century Catholicism when the world's bishops gathered in four sessions from 1962 to 1965.
From the 16th through the 19th century, Catholicism had increasingly defined itself as hierarchical, other-worldly and anti-modern. In a trend that culminated in the declaration of papal infallibility by the First Vatican Council in 1870, church governance emphasized the Pope at the pinnacle of a sharply defined hierarchy. Spirituality emphasized the individual soul's pursuit of salvation in an afterlife. Politically and intellectually, Catholicism inveighed against modern culture as reflected in forces as diverse as Protestantism, capitalism, socialism, natural science and psychotherapy.
The Second Vatican Council marked a new direction. It affirmed the active participation of the laity in worship and the responsibilities of bishops along with the Pope for church governance. It avoided condemnations, took a sympathetic stance toward the modern world, endorsed freedom of religion and conscience and emphasized that holiness was found in marriage, everyday work and the struggle for justice as well as in prayer and priestly life.
The revised liturgy expressed the new egalitarianism and communal participation. The church authorized celebration of the Mass in local languages rather than in Latin. The priest now faced the worshipers across the altar rather than standing at their head with his back to the congregation.
Most importantly the new liturgy, along with the other, less visible changes, shattered many Catholics' assumption that their church's rules and practices were immutable and beyond discussion.
The council would inevitably have disrupted church life, but its impact was magnified by other events in the 1960's. American Catholics were rapidly shedding the traces of their immigrant subcultures for the American mainstream. A mood of rebellion against traditional standards, authorities and institutions of all kinds was sweeping the West and the United States in particular.
Where Catholic theology, religious education and worship had previously been marked by strict uniformity, now the pendulum swung to unprecedented experimentation. Papal efforts to reassert teachings like the prohibition of contraception only seemed to undermine church authority in other moral matters, especially in regard to sexuality, where the church continued to forbid sex outside of marriage and homosexual sex.
The post-conciliar turmoil spurred an exodus of men from the priesthood and women from convents -- and a dramatic decline in recruits. The reality of fewer and older priests has often been noted. Even more dramatic has been the declining number of sisters, to 94,000 last year from 181,000 in 1965.
The effect has rippled through Catholic institutions, especially the school system. Despite salaries much lower than for public school teachers, the replacement of sisters by lay teachers increased costs. Higher costs and population shifts resulted in the closing of more than 4,000 of the 13,000 Catholic schools that operated in 1965.
In 1965 half the Catholic school-age population attended Catholic schools. Today less than a quarter does -- and there is virtual unanimity that Sunday school or after-school classes have not taken up the slack in inculcating the faith.
Nor has the full impact of what may be the total disappearance of many women's religious orders yet been felt. Half the remaining sisters are now over 65, but more than 40 percent of those between 70 and 80 are still working, and so are more than 10 percent of those over 80.
Figures like those contribute to the belief that the next decade will be crucial for American Catholicism. Much of its leadership, in schools and hospitals and even within parishes, will pass to laity from priests and sisters. Equally important, leadership will pass from those raised in the strictures of the pre-conciliar church to a generation formed in the fluid, conflict-ridden years after Vatican II.
The Vatican's strategy for this period of transition is to foster what its proponents call a "counter-cultural" church -- one that stands firm against pleas to reconsider its teachings on questions like contraception, homosexuality and abortion or its restriction of the priesthood to male celibates.
In the 15 years since his election, Pope John Paul II has appointed 185 of the 283 currently active American bishops, most of them conservatives, especially for the larger dioceses. The Vatican has urged a return to more traditional patterns of seminary education and priestly life, maintaining clear-cut lines between the clergy and laity.
At the national level, church initiatives have been increasingly stymied by disagreements. In November 1992, after nine years' work, for example, the bishops failed to agree enough to pass a pastoral letter on the concerns of women, a project that had been followed intensely by many Catholic women's groups.
But the impact of these high-level struggles on the grass-roots life of the church is not easily measured.
Delis Alejandro, a laywoman who works full time at St. Monica's directing the Young Adult Ministry and numerous other programs, said that church statements and actions coming from the Pope or bishops affected her work "all the time."
Even young women deeply involved in the church have questions about its attitude toward their sex, for example. "As a woman you often feel slighted and ignored in reading church documents," Ms. Alejandro said.
"It does affect you; it affects the way people talk to you," she said. One way or the other, "if you're a person of prayer, you just have to trust that the Lord will lead you."

HEADLINE: As P.L.O. Replaces Israelis, Jordan Remains on Sideline

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, May 28

 BODY:
The self-rule agreement that has swept Israeli soldiers from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho has also seen neighboring Jordan, once regarded as the power broker between the Palestinians and the United States, sidelined and neglected.
Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, repeatedly failed to inform the Jordanians about the details of his negotiations with Israel. And relations between the P.L.O. chief and King Hussein, while rocky in the past, are described by those close to the King as "dismal." Jordanian negotiators also say that trade and commercial deals cut between the Palestinians and the Israelis have intentionally excluded Jordan. 
And the decision to carry out the agreement before resolving the final status of the 1.5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, along with the border disputes with Israel and banking regulations has left many officials less than enthusiastic about the new accord.
"We have been kept out of the process," said the Minister of Information, Jawad al-Anani. "And now we have to live with the complexity of the agreement between Israel and the P.L.O. With the absence of any real leverage, the situation is determined by the Israelis and the Palestinians, in that order. We are left to coexist with whatever they agree upon."
 
An Economic Feud
 A senior official characterized the self-rule agreement, which gives the P.L.O. administrative control over Gaza and Jericho, as filled with "half-baked ideas and solutions that could lead to chaos."
The disputes between the Jordanians and the Palestinians are mainly economic.
Jordanian and P.L.O. officials, despite a series of meetings, have yet to determine who will control future banks in the West Bank and Gaza, whether the Jordanian currency will be used by the Palestinian administration in self-rule areas and whether financial transactions by the Palestinians will flow through Jordan.
Palestinian officials say they are worried that Jordan could dominate the economy in the self-rule areas. And they insist that the agreement with Israel, which they acknowledge will limit Jordanian access to their market, offers them steps to take control of their own economy gradually.
"We are very vulnerable," said a senior Palestinian official. "And we do not entirely trust the motives of the Jordanians."
 
Longstanding Ties
 Jordan has long had an interest in the West Bank, which it ruled until it was captured by Israeli forces in 1967. It was only in 1988, after the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, that King Hussein finally severed legal and administrative links with the West Bank. And the King still speaks of a special Jordanian role in administering the Muslim holy sites of East Jerusalem.
Of Jordan's population of 4 million, over 60 percent are of Palestinian origin, and for years it was assumed that any withdrawal of Israeli forces would leave behind a joint Palestinian and Jordanian confederation.
The eclipse of Jordan, after decades of influence over Palestinian affairs, has embittered many in the Government and contributed to the further deterioration in relations between Amman and the P.L.O.
When the final agreement between Israel and the P.L.O. was signed this month establishing Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and Gaza, the lower house of the Jordanian Parliament issued a statement that condemned "the sale of Palestine."
 
Economic Lockout
 There are many aspects of the agreement that Jordan finds distasteful, but none irks officials more than what they see as the joint decision by Israel and the P.L.O. to lock them out of the Palestinian market through a high tariff system.
"The Israeli and Palestinian economies have forged what amounts to a new customs union," Dr. Anani said. "The Israeli tariff structure will be applicable on both the Israeli and the Palestinian territory. This means that if I want to send goods to the West Bank and Gaza I have to pay Israeli tariffs, that are very high."
Jordanian officials, who estimated that they could do $400 million in trade a year with the Palestinians, now say they will be lucky to do $150 million in trade a year because of the tariff system.
Jordanian officials also worry that the lack of monetary control in the self-rule areas could affect the Jordanian dinar, the principal currency in the West Bank. They have asked the Palestinians to open an account in the Jordanian Central Bank, something Palestinian leaders have so far refused to consider.
 
Banks Still Operate
 The five Jordanian bank branches now operating in the West Bank will, for now, function under a Jordanian-Israeli accord signed in December. But Jordanian officials say they are unsure how the banks will function over the long term given the absence of a Palestinian monetary authority.
"The banks are there, and they are working right now, but there is no one authorized to supervise them," said a cabinet minister. "This should be done by the Palestinian monetary authority, which does not exist."
Mr. Arafat has called for the creation of a Palestinian currency, a move that could see the estimated $400 million in Jordanian dinars in the West Bank and Gaza driven out of circulation.
Israeli officials have rejected the proposal for a separate currency but the P.L.O. chairman's request still rankles many Jordanian officials.
"If the dinar is removed from circulation it could see a rush on the banks and a diminishing of our foreign reserves," a Government economist said. "This is something that can't just be decided upon, but must be coordinated with us."

HEADLINE: Daniel Flood, 90, Who Quit Congress in Disgrace, Is Dead

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
Daniel J. Flood, who as a Congressman helped direct the billions of tax dollars that poured into Federal social programs in the 1960's and 1970's but resigned in disgrace in 1980, died yesterday at Mercy Hospital in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He was 90 and lived in Wilkes-Barre.
The cause was pneumonia, according to the hospital. 
 Mr. Flood left the House of Representatives after 31 years of service when he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Federal campaign laws by taking payoffs from five people.
He had originally been charged by Federal prosecutors with having lined his pockets with hundreds of thousands of dollars from contractors and lobbyists. A jury voted 11 to 1 to convict him on five bribery and three perjury counts. The only juror to vote for acquittal was the subject of a jury tampering investigation and failed two lie detector tests, but no further legal action was taken in that case.
 
Sentence of Probation
 Mr. Flood agreed to enter the guilty plea before the start of a second trial, which had been postponed four times. He was sentenced to a year's probation. He was later the target of Federal investigations into drug abuse and ethics violations but they ended without resolution.
Mr. Flood's source of power was the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Education and Welfare of the House Appropriations Committee, a position he held from 1967 to 1979.
In the 1960's and 1970's, amid the outpouring of Federal legislation that was aimed at social problems, Mr. Flood was among a small group of committee and subcommittee chairmen in the House and Senate who shaped the amounts and directions of financial aid for schools and hospitals. They also helped draft the legislation that was to provide money for the unemployed, needy and sick. At one time his subcommittee alone drafted legislation that directed $75 million a year.
Mr. Flood, who had been a Shakespearean actor in his youth and spoke with mellifluous tones, was a sartorial dandy who was known for his waxed mustache and often referred to as "Dapper Dan" on Capitol Hill. Yet he also was viewed with affection and even awe by the widows and orphans of his district in eastern Pennsylvania, which never lacked for Federal money if he could help it.
 
Rerouted Highway
 A grateful constituency emblazoned his name throughout his district. There is a Daniel J. Flood Elementary School, a Daniel J. Flood Rural Health Center and a Daniel J. Flood Industrial Park.
Mr. Flood forced Federal planners to route a major interstate highway through his district, and he was instrumental in getting an airport and a large new veterans hospital. Millions of dollars in military contracts were channeled into his district during the Vietnam War.
"Little birdies fly by and drop these goodies on my desk," he once joked.
Repeatedly re-elected, he often received as much as 70 percent of the vote.
Mr. Flood graduated from Syracuse University, and after his fling at acting, studied law and became deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania. First elected to Congress in 1944, he was defeated after serving one term, won again in 1948 only to be defeated again in 1952. He was elected again in 1954 and was a House member until his resignation in 1980.
He is survived by his wife, Catherine, of Wilkes-Barre.

HEADLINE: Solzhenitsyn Attacks Gorbachev and New 'Reforms'

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, May 28

 BODY:
Showing that 20 years of exile had only deepened his thunder, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn used his first news conference back on Russian soil today to fire bolts at Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Westernizing reformers, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and, above all, unrepentant Communist "oppressors and executioners."
Like a prophet of old emerging from long seclusion to castigate a fallen world, the 75-year-old writer held forth with passion and eloquence for almost two hours on Russia's need for repentance and reconciliation, on the errors of its post-Communist course, on the sufferings of the Russian nation. 
 No, he declared, he had not returned too late. Had he come back any earlier, he would have only become embroiled in power struggles and confusion.
"I not only believe I am not late, but that I have come just at the right time," he declared, "because the scum of triviality has cleared, and the people have ripened enough to become conscious of their fate in its essence and depth. I think it is precisely now that I am useful, not three years ago when two powers clashed like two goats on a bridge until one fell off."
The reference was evidently to the losing struggle of Mr. Gorbachev, the former President, against Boris N. Yeltsin, the current President.
 
Looking to Tradition
 But the central point threading through the news conference was that both Mr. Gorbachev's "perestroika" and the attempts at reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union had brought Russia to a hideous quandary, and that the nation was now ready to search for an order built on Russia's history, tradition and spirit -- and that this was the mission for which Mr. Solzhenitsyn had prepared himself in his long exile.
The writer, whose exile and international fame arose from his searing accounts of the Stalinist terror, arrived in Vladivostok on Friday after 20 years of exile, 18 of them in seclusion in Vermont. From this Pacific port, he intends to travel slowly across Russia by rail in two special cars, reacquainting himself with a nation that has dramatically changed from the totalitarian state from which he was ejected in February 1974. He said that he had no firm itinerary for the trip and that it would develop as he went.
Mr. Solzhenitsyn spent his first morning in Russia today wandering through the weekly farmers' market on Vladivostok's main square and visiting a hospital, where he held three hours of talks with doctors. But it was evident in his first declaration, on the main square Friday, and far more so today, that he did not intend to wait to speak out. Indeed, he had long tried to warn Russia against Communism and the dangers that emerging from it would hold.
"But I couldn't shout from there -- my books were banned, my warnings were not heeded," he said. "I would be happy to be proved a false prophet, but what I anticipated has come to pass: We are climbing out in the clumsiest, most awkward, most destructive fashion for life and for the national spirit. I understand this. I am not surprised. It is to this I came."
 
Anger and Moral Reproach
 Then the thunderbolts fell. His tone had the same anger and moral reproach that made his most celebrated work, "The Gulag Archipelago," so potent an indictment of the Soviet terror system -- and that have made his impassioned commentaries on the West and on Russia so controversial.
*On Mr. Gorbachev: "There were many paths out" of Communism, "but Gorbachev had no such goal. Gorbachev flung out slogans of perestroika, but he was really thinking of how to transfer the nomenklatura to comfortable commercial seats. His perestroika was hypocrisy. He lost seven years; he did nothing in seven years; he destroyed all the structure of industry without replacing them with anything."
*On Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of Mr. Yeltsin's economic program: "The 'reform' Gaidar gave out was brainless. I refuse to recognize that this is reform. Reform is a constructive, thought-through system of actions linked one to another." Mr. Gaidar, he said, did only two things. He freed prices while monopolies were still intact, enabling them to charge whatever they wanted while reducing production. And, Mr. Solzhenitsyn said, he began "a deceptive privatization," in which "for some ridiculous sum people took over national properties, and all the so-called 'vouchers' -- a ridiculous word -- don't amount to a 300th of one percent of the national wealth."
*On Mr. Zhirinovsky, the ardent nationalist who fared unexpectedly well in the Dec. 12 parliamentary elections: "Zhirinovsky is a caricature of a Russian patriot. It's as if someone wanted to create a purported Russian patriot so that he would be hateful to the whole world."
 
Eluding Questions on Yeltsin
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn eluded several questions about Mr. Yeltsin, for whom he has expressed guarded support in the past, saying there were many things he could say, but not yet.
But he was critical of virtually all aspects of Russia's current attempts at democracy and reform, which he branded "false democracy." Russians, he said, have to stop waiting for some "monarch, boyar, politburo or general secretary" to issue good decrees, and to take their fate into their own hands, above all in local elections. And they have to "rip up" party lists and programs, and to vote instead "for people in whom you believe, whose main quality must be honesty, selflessness, not thinking of one's own pocket."
Mr. Solzhenitsyn was equally critical of turning Russia into a federation of ethnic republics, in most of which, he said, Russians were a minority. Such republics, he said, were a Soviet invention "to crush the Russian nation."
"Why must the Russian nation be subjugated to minorities?" he asked. "I always said that nations were the embellishment of mankind, that they must be protected, even the smallest nation, its language and culture, but that doesn't mean that that nation must rule the Russian majority. There must be only equal provinces."
 
To Gather the Russian Nation
 Mr. Solzhenitsyn voiced some of his strongest opposition to the fact that roughly 25 million Russians were suddenly left in foreign states with the breakup of the Soviet Union into 15 independent countries. Gathering the Russian nation, he said, was a priority.
"Twenty-five million Russians do not live in Russia," he declared. "There was never such a diaspora. I was totally amazed to learn that they gave away 12 million Russians to Ukraine, five or six Russian provinces. Nobody said a word. I appealed to the Ukrainian President, to Russians living in Ukraine, vote with us. Nobody paid heed. Seven million Russians were given to Kazakhstan. Nobody said a word."
Mr. Solzhenitsyn acknowledged that he had no ready recipe for Russia's renewal. But he said the answer was not in trying forcibly to graft the experience of the West on to Russia. "Our life, spiritual and otherwise, must be formed from our own tradition, our understanding, our atmosphere," he said.
"What unifying idea will come, I don't know," he said, "but the thought that comes naturally to mind is love for one's nation without servility, without false claims, with acknowledgment of sins and failings. Such patriotism could unite the Russian people."
 
Facing the Gulag Legacy
 Above all, to move forward Russia must face up to the legacy of the Gulag, he said, much as the Germans faced up to their responsibility in the Holocaust.
"National reconciliation is a great thing and much needed, but there cannot be national reconciliation without spiritual cleansing," he said. "I wholeheartedly support national reconciliation, but first the oppressors and the executioners must repent."
As for himself, Mr. Solzhenitsyn said with the hint of a smile: "I don't intend to forgive anyone because personally, I have absolutely no anger. When I was arrested in 1945 it was for good cause -- I was indeed opposed to this regime."
Then he turned hard: "But those I sat with, Russian prisoners betrayed by the Soviet Union who went first to camps, then to their death -- to German camps, then to Soviet camps -- for them I will never forgive."

HEADLINE: Rightist's Rise Poses New Threat to Mexican Party's Rule

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ACATLAN DE JUAREZ, Mexico, May 22

 BODY:
Like the hulking sugar mill that feeds on the cane fields outside this quiet town in western Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party has seemed perpetual to most people here, as permanent as government itself.
"Before, you could never believe that the party might go," said Juan Zarate, a 70-year-old farm worker, marveling at the fiery, bearded man prophesizing such change from a gazebo in the town square. "But this guy hit them very hard, and he was right." 
 Since thrashing both the governing-party candidate and his leading opponent in the country's first-ever presidential debate on May 12, the gazebo prophet, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, has shot from a distant third in the race to suddenly challenge the party that has defined the Mexican state for 65 years.
Opinion polls taken after the debate have shown Mr. Fernandez, a 53-year-old lawyer and former congressman, surging close to and even slightly ahead of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a former Budget Minister who replaced the assassinated Luis Donaldo Colosio as the governing-party nominee.
 
Rallies Draw Thousands
 After months in which Mr. Fernandez rarely held an outdoor campaign event, rallies of his conservative National Action Party, or PAN, are drawing thousands of people, even in smaller provincial cities. Now it is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist vanquished by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in a 1988 vote stained by fraud, who trails at a distance.
Whether Mr. Fernandez can maintain his position, much less improve on it, is highly uncertain. His campaign is short on money, uneven in its organization, shaky in its confidence. Asked how he felt about the candidate's long jump in the polls, one of his chief strategists answered, "A little frightened." And he looked it.
Still, if doubts remained about the electorate's volatility -- after the triumphant start of Mexico's trade agreement with the United States and Canada, a peasant uprising in the south and Mr. Colosio's slaying in the north -- Mr. Fernandez would seem to have answered them.
"Everyone began with the assumption that the PAN could not win," said Juan Molinar Horcasitas, a political scientist at El Colegio de Mexico, a leading research institution that is sympathetic to the party. "We have to revise that assumption now. The momentum is on Diego's side."
 
A Candidate Is Eliminated
 Last fall, Mr. Fernandez appeared to have reached the summit of his political career simply by gaining the nomination of a party that holds the opposition's first three state governorships but never won much more than 20 percent in a national vote.
The firebrand businessman widely considered PAN's strongest potential candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, was eliminated when the party's legislators backed a Government-sponsored constitutional amendment barring Mexicans with a foreign-born parent from seeking high office before the year 2000; Mr. Fox's mother was born in Spain.
As the party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Fernandez cast what was probably the single most important vote for the measure. And after negotiating PAN's support for many of the policy changes that helped to cement Mr. Salinas's political control, even some confederates began to question his willingness to take on the Government. When a group of prominent members abandoned PAN last year, maintaining that it had sold out to the Salinas Administration, Mr. Fernandez was a focus of their attacks.
 
'Going for Victory'
 The Diego Fernandez that has emerged since is at times hard to recognize as the same man.
Gone is some of the long, thick beard that set off his piercing brown eyes in a look that recalled Charlton Heston's portrayal of Moses in "The Ten Commandments." Back is the looser, more combative style familiar to people who knew Mr. Fernandez as a young litigator and legislator.
"We are going for victory!" he bellowed to a crowd of perhaps 10,000 or 15,000 people the other night in a park in downtown Guadalajara, the country's second-largest city. "We are going for the presidency of the republic!"
The next day, as he dove into a crowded street market, bantering with the vendors, hoisting small children in the air and kissing their mothers, it became clearer how Mr. Fernandez means to take on the somber Mr. Cardenas and the stiff Mr. Zedillo.
Still echoing from the debate among the three leading candidates is Mr. Fernandez's sharp answer to Mr. Zedillo's proud claim to having written a report that was a blueprint for Mr. Salinas's sweeping economic changes.
"As far as we are concerned, your National Development Plan has produced 40 million poor people," Mr. Fernandez said, citing the highest of many estimates on the number of Mexicans living below the poverty line.
 
The Poor's Burden Grows
 Increasingly, Mr. Fernandez has seized on the same argument that Mr. Cardenas has tried to make for the last five years: that however laudable the goals of Mr. Salinas's economic policies, the cost to poor families and small businesses has been far too high.
"We have not penetrated enough in rural sectors and among poor people," Mr. Fernandez said, chomping on his trademark Mexican cigar in an interview. "I want to get around to the little towns, the farm villages."
Having focused his efforts until now on younger voters and women, Mr. Fernandez is seeking to expand his appeal after seeing that many of the supporters he picked up in the debate came from a countryside that has long been a stronghold of the governing party.
For much of PAN's 55-year history, the party's defense of free-market economics, open trade and conservative social values has branded it among such voters as the party of the rich, the Americans and the Roman Catholic Church. But where Mr. Salinas was once seen as having seized PAN's platforms by opening up the economy, strengthening relations with the United States and ending Government antagonism toward the church, it has begun to look as though he in fact lifted a burden.
 
Ruling Party on Defensive
 After the trade accord and a dinner last year at which Mr. Salinas solicited $25 million donations from powerful businessmen, it is the governing party that must defend itself against accusations of selling out and of collusion with the rich.
Mr. Fernandez calls for more aid to farmers, more antipoverty money for the cities, and more competition among banks, which Mr. Salinas has protected even as the high cost of credit has helped to choke off economic growth.
The social issues on which Mr. Fernandez and the PAN remain firmly to the right of the political center may prove less of an electoral handicap than they have been in the past. In public statements, the candidate has grown more and more vague in discussing his strong opposition to legalizing abortion.
He has also taken to talking of a wild youth that extended until, at the age of 35, he fell in love with Claudia Gutierrez, a 15-year-old girl who lived across the street from his law office. They were married a year later and have three children, in addition to a 20-year-old son from a previous liaison whom Mr. Fernandez recognized last year.

HEADLINE: Panel Finds Lag in Saving Environment

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 28

 BODY:
The panel set up to monitor international efforts to protect the environment has ended its first substantive meeting here acknowledging that much remains to be done to meet the goals set two years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
After two weeks of debate, the 53-nation Commission on Sustainable Development concluded on Friday that the international community was failing to provide the money and the know-how needed to foster environmentally benign development in poor countries and that rich countries should do more to restrict harmful consumption by their citizens. 
 But the commission made no concrete decisions beyond agreeing to improve preparations for its next session, in 1995.
It also made no critical evaluation of the reports submitted by regional organizations and governments, including that of the United States, on their environmental protection plans, despite hopes at Rio that the commission would become a kind of environmental world court.
 
Resistance on Forests
 An attempt to pull together into a single plan various efforts to save the world's shrinking forests was blocked by Brazil, which appears determined to resist what it sees as outside interference with its management of the Amazon forest, the world's largest.
In his summary of the meeting, the chairman, Klaus Topfer, Germany's Environment Minister, said he was encouraged that the two international conventions agreed to at Rio -- on fighting climate change and preserving the diversity of the planet's animals and plants -- had come into force and that a third convention, combating drought and the change of arable land into desert, would be agreed to "in a few weeks' time."
But he said the world's efforts to finance the Rio summit's environmental goals had fallen "significantly short of expectations and requirements." He also called for "additional efforts" by industrialized countries to give poorer countries technology to raise living standards in environmentally sound ways.
Mr. Topfer said northern industrialized countries in particular needed to take "additional measures" to change "those contemporary patterns of consumption and production which are detrimental to sustainable development." This implies a need for their citizens to reduce their energy consumption, for instance, and create less garbage.
A major setback, in the view of many delegations, came when Brazil stymied an attempt by 17 environment ministers to start a coordinated campaign to save the world's forests.
 
Organizations Disappointed
 Private environmental organizations generally expressed disappointment with the meeting's outcome. "Results are middling at best and have not met the challenges of the follow-up to Rio," said Scott A. Hajost, international counsel for the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.
"This is becoming another United Nations talking shop," said Maximo Kalau of the Green Forum, a Filipino group. "The ministers of economy and development who really count are not involved."
Mr. Topfer echoed the view that by themselves environment ministers could do little to save a world threatened by the efforts of more powerful branches of government to promote industry, exports and jobs.
At the Rio summit, heads of state and government from most of the countries in the world agreed that the program for cleaning up the planet and allowing poorer countries to develop their economies in an environmentally sustainable way would cost some $600 billion a year and require $125 billion annually in foreign aid.
While rich countries promised "new and additional resources" and reiterated pledges to raise aid to 0.7 percent of their economic output, they have so far offered only $2 billion in new money over the next three years, through a fund called the Global Environmental Facility.
Total aid remains at half the target figure, and little has been done to fulfill the vague Rio promise to help the developing world acquire environmentally friendly technology.

HEADLINE: Factory Areas May Be Sites Of Superstores

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Attempting to spur redevelopment of thousands of acres of abandoned and underused industrial land in New York City, top city officials are proposing to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that the city relax restrictions in manufacturing areas to encourage the entry of the huge specialized discount retailers and warehouse stores so popular in the suburbs.
"We have to have a more fluid land-use policy," said Clay W. Lifflander, president of the City Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit arm of the city government responsible for attracting and retaining business in New York. "Large retail stores are an example of what we need to be more open to." 
 Officials of the Giuliani administration, in interviews yesterday and Friday, said that the Mayor would be presented with a range of recommendations next week to make it easier for larger retailers to locate in the city. These include raising the limit on the size of stores in certain areas zoned for light and medium manufacturing to 100,000 square feet or more, from a current 10,000 square feet.
 
The Zoning Variance Gantlet
 Under present rules affecting some 17,000 to 20,000 industrial acres -- or about 10 percent of the land in New York -- most retailers need to obtain a zoning variance to build a large store, a highly complex gantlet that can take years to run and discourages many from even trying.
Looking to fill the employment vacuum left by the shrinkage of manufacturing and the loss of many of New York's traditional department stores, city officials are aiming to create more jobs, generate higher tax revenues and encourage city residents to shop for big-ticket goods like furniture and home appliances in the city rather than driving to the suburbs.
Making it easier for large retailers to enter New York City is a highly sensitive issue within the Giuliani administration. It pits the Mayor's desire to stimulate economic development and growth, particularly outside Manhattan and in some of the more rundown sections of the city, against the interests of small merchants and storekeepers who form a crucial element of his political constituency.
Smaller merchants are concerned that an influx of big discounters and other superstores in the city would be a direct threat to their livelihood and undermine the vitality of dozens of local shopping districts scattered across the city. The proposal also may raise fears among some experts and local business leaders who argue that the city should not give up on the manufacturing sector, which still provides tens of thousands of jobs for relatively unskilled workers, including many who do not speak English well.
The plan -- being prepared by Mr. Lifflander, City Planning Chairman Joseph B. Rose and Deputy Mayors Fran Reiter and John S. Dyson, will set out a number of options for the Mayor. But all foresee much wider retail and commercial use of land now vacant, underused or occupied by abandoned multi-story industrial buildings.
"They are looking at all the possibilities," said Cristyne F. Lategano, Mayor Giuliani's press secretary. "The Mayor has not made any decisions yet, but he is looking forward to what his economic team develops."
Any proposal backed by the Mayor would face a number of hurdles. After a state-mandated environmental impact study, it would need to be approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council. The process is likely to take several years and prove highly controversial.
The plans for redeveloping derelict industrial zones are under discussion at the same time the Giuliani administration is looking at ways to avoid concentrating the placement of homeless shelters, drug clinics and other social service operations in residential neighborhoods, where they often generate enormous political controversy and sometimes contribute to increased crime and the degradation of the quality of life.
Mr. Rose has already recommended that light manufacturing zones should be opened to social service centers.
 
Zoning Revised in 1974
 "A reform and re-evaluation of our zoning laws is long overdue," Mr. Rose said. "We are looking at all of these related issues -- the placement of social service centers, restrictions on manufacturing zones, and the like -- in an effort to rationalize the way decisions are made in the city." The last major zoning revision in the city was in 1974.
Some of the nation's largest discount and speciality retailers -- like Kmart, and Home Depot in Queens, Bed, Bath and Beyond and Barnes & Noble in Manhattan, and Caldor's in Brooklyn and Queens -- have already started to enter New York City after years of shunning it as too expensive and too congested. So far they have generally located in or near traditional retailing centers of the city.
But those companies and others such as Walmart, the Price Club and the Sports Authority increasingly see New York and other large cities as the last untapped territory in a national landscape now saturated with suburban shopping centers. To build the high-volume, low-margin specialty discount stores with extensive parking that has proven a formula for retailing success in recent years, they need large parcels of land, often 10 acres or more. There are few such sites available in the city now zoned for commercial and retailing use.
Rather than see more such stores built in surrounding suburban locations, where they serve as a powerful lure to city residents to spend their money, officials are determined to clear away obstacles to their building in New York City.
"We've got to open our eyes to what is happening all around us," said Mr. Lifflander of the economic development corporation. "People worry about the decimation of neighborhood retail. It's being decimated already. If we won't have large-scale retailers, they will just be decimated to the benefit of New Jersey, Nassau County and Connecticut."
 
Limits Are Considered
 City officials are looking at a number of strategies aimed at easing the impact of superstores on local merchants. Mr. Lifflander said that one possibility may be to limit big food supermarkets, which tend to cater to local communities, in order to help sustain the thousands of green grocers and food stores that serve neighborhoods in the city.
But big stores that draw from a wide region, such as home appliance centers and furniture warehouse stores, would be encouraged to locate at abandoned industrial sites, such as the old Taystee Bakery site in Flushing that Home Depot wants to buy.
City officials also contend that the adverse impact of big retailers on local merchants may have been exaggerated.
Local political officials with close ties to the city's well-organized small business sector appear more receptive to such arguments than in the past.
"We understand the concerns of the mom-and-pop stores," said Dan Andrews, spokesman for Claire Shulman, Queens borough president. "But we think they can continue to operate with minimal impact from the large retailers by being more flexible and service-oriented."
"It is already difficult enough to run a small business in the city," said William Kurland, co-owner of Shakespeare & Co., a popular bookseller with locations on the Upper West Side and in Astor Place. "The threat is that the Walmarts and Barnes & Nobles will destroy what is special about New York City. It is almost impossible to compete against multinational enterprises backed by some of the largest corporations in the country."

HEADLINE: City College Students Study the Anatomy of Hate

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
At a time when anti-Semitic speeches by black nationalists draw attention at college campuses, a group of students at the City College of New York is dissecting the sentiments of ethnic bias.
In a quiet conference room with a sweeping view of Harlem, Tricia Ferrell, a pre-law student, spoke softly earlier this month about her recent visit to former Nazi concentration camps in Poland. 
 "It was almost indescribable to me," said Ms. Ferrell, who is one of nine students who traveled to Poland last month with a class sponsored by the college's Conflict Resolution Center.
 
'Hate Produces Hate'
 Ms. Ferrell, who is black, said what she found most incomprehensible was the hate that led to the annihilation of millions of Jews.
"It's not like someone hurt your family member and you're retaliating," she said. "Hate produces hate."
City College's Conflict Resolution Center was established last year in the wake of several incidents that heightened black-Jewish tensions in New York, notably the 1991 disturbances in Crown Heights and the furor over an anti-Semitic speech by Dr. Leonard Jeffries, a professor at City College. Recently, speeches by Khalid Muhammad, a leader of the Nation of Islam who called Jews "bloodsuckers" in a speech at a New Jersey campus, have ignited debates at other colleges.
 
A Looming 'Crisis'
 William B. Helmreich, a sociology professor who is a co-director of the center, said that only a tiny percentage of students on any campus actually agree with hate speeches delivered at some college campuses. Nevertheless, he said, racial misunderstandings have reached the level of a "crisis that threatens to engulf our city," so there is still a need for a laboratory where ideas about racial and ethnic bias can be discussed openly.
Even if they have to change the thinking of young people one at a time, or one classroom at a time, Professor Helmreich said, the hope for the Conflict Resolution Center is that knowledge can breed understanding.
He and the center's co-director, Francis Terrell, a professor of political science who is also director of the college's Greenberg Center for Legal Education and Urban Policy, chose nine students for this semester's class on the Holocaust.
Conflict resolution programs and centers have cropped up at many other schools, but the two professors who direct the City College program say their school can particularly benefit from such an effort.
 
A Diverse Student Body
 In addition to being the employer of Dr. Jeffries and Michael Levin, two professors -- one black and one white -- who brought notoriety to the college for their statements on racial superiority, the school also touts itself as the most ethnically diverse college in America, with students from 90 countries.
"These people speak to the potential we have," Professor Helmreich said, referring to the nine students who traveled to Poland.
"When you see how these students were transformed, how we are creating an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding -- and this is the home of Leonard Jeffries -- then you have to think if it can be done here, it can be done anywhere," he said.
As part of the course, the students, four of whom are Jewish while the rest were from a range of ethnic groups, traveled to Poland on a trip sponsored by the International March of the Living, a group that organized an event in which thousands of youths, most of them Jewish, traced a two-mile journey from Auschwitz to Birkenau that Jews were forced to take to the gas chambers.The students at City College took part in the march.
Most of the students, including two of the Jewish ones, said that before their trip, they had spent little time thinking about the Holocaust. But afterward their recollections poured out in one class session in anguished comments about the universality of the suffering, and how Jews and blacks have much in common.
 
'An Analogous History'
 "I don't understand why all the animosity between our two groups because we have basically had an analogous history," said Curtis LeBlanc, who is black. "We really both have been through a Holocaust."
Shoshana Kurtz, who is the daughter of Holocaust survivors and an architecture student, said she acted almost as a representative of survivors for her classmates by relating some of the stories she had heard from her parents and from others in the community of survivors in Brooklyn in which she grew up.
"I've come home with a sense of renewal," Ms. Kurtz said, her voice breaking. "I have a great deal of responsibility as a child of survivors and I never knew how I was going to go about taking that responsibility, but I did it."
"I'm neither Jewish nor German nor of any other ethnic group that was affected by the the Holocaust," said Maria Lin, a pre-law student whose family is from Taiwan. "On the other hand, I have been touched by racism. In that aspect, it relates to me 100 percent."

HEADLINE: Too Relaxed on High-Tech Exports

 BODY:
Nuclear arms makers in Iraq, Iran, India and Pakistan were just some of the recipients of U.S. high-tech exports in the past -- exports that they could use to make bombs. Yet even as nuclear proliferation emerges as the principal threat to America's security, bills wending their way through the Senate and House would make it even easier for renegade states to obtain U.S. technology useful for building bombs.
The technology of concern has both civilian and military uses, like machine tools for grinding bomb parts to exacting specifications and devices known as krytrons, electronic triggers used to fire up photocopying machines that can also serve as nuclear detonators. 
 Some relaxation of export controls makes sense. For instance, U.S. exporters are entitled to a level playing field when it comes to getting expeditious licensing decisions. A 90-day deadline for decisions embodied in these bills would reduce the chance of foreign competitors sealing deals while U.S. companies wait for license approvals.
But the laissez-faire licensing envisaged in these bills goes too far to boost exports at the expense of preventing proliferation. Congress needs to redraft them.
Easy waivers of reasonable regulations, as provided in the proposed legislation, are unjustified. The Senate bill, for instance, authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, acting alone, to grant relief from export controls. That is a clear conflict since the Commerce Department's prime purpose is to promote U.S. exports. Other agencies charged with curbing proliferation, such as the Defense and State Departments, need to be involved in such decisions.
The bills rightly reflect the fact that U.S. export controls will not work when too many suppliers abroad refuse to abide by them, putting U.S. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. But multilateral controls have usually been established when the U.S. imposed tough standards of its own and persuaded other states to follow its lead. And that takes time.
The bills, however, do not allow much time; they mandate that the U.S. Government relax its own controls within 18 months if they are not adopted by other supplier states. But knowing that U.S. controls will expire can only reduce the incentive for others to follow suit. That will lead to the lowest common denominator of international control, or none at all.
The bills also fail to require the collection of data that would make it easier to detect and stop proliferators. The U.S. Customs Service wants to require shippers to file export declarations electronically in advance for all goods, whether licensed or not, identifying the product being transported and its ultimate destination. That would enable U.S. agencies to identify patterns of suspicious shipments and sometimes seize unlawful exports before they embark.
The General Accounting Office has documented how, even under existing law, the U.S. has too often failed to prevent shipment of dangerous technology to would-be nuclear-weapons states. Between 1988 and 1990, for instance, of the 410 applications that U.S. companies filed to export nuclear-related technology to Iraq, only 5 percent were turned down. One-third of the 89 applications to ship to sensitive end users like the Iraqi Ministry of Defense were approved.
The G.A.O. found equally lax patterns for exports to Iran, Pakistan and India. Prudent licensing regulations, carefully drawn, expeditiously implemented and studiously monitored, could prevent a dangerous repetition.
The job loss from such regulation is minimal. In 1992, for instance, U.S. exports of manufactured goods totaled $447 billion. Only $18 billion -- barely 4 percent -- required a license to be shipped abroad. Licenses were denied for less than $700 million worth of goods, or one-tenth of 1 percent of all manufactured goods exported.
In a $6 trillion economy that does not affect many jobs. And it is a reasonable price to pay to prevent proliferation from getting out of control.

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes a Nuclear Power Step Backward;
Eximbank's Standards

 BODY:
To the Editor:
An important issue mentioned only briefly in your May 22 article on Czech reactors and Westinghouse is the United States Export-Import Bank's lack of adequate procedures for reviewing the environmental impacts of the projects it guarantees.
The Eximbank's environmental procedures are far weaker than those of other Federal agencies, such as the Agency for International Development and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. In Congressional testimony Feb. 23, Kenneth Brody, Eximbank president and chairman, called procedures "obviously unsatisfactory," acknowledging they had to be "substantially strengthened." Eximbank's activities should be transparent and publicly accountable, and consistent with United States environmental foreign policy, including the Rio Climate and Biodiversity Conventions. 
 Despite the Clinton Administration statements of intentions, it is unlikely to make these improvements unilaterally. The Eximbank argues that stronger environmental procedures would put United States businesses at a competitive disadvantage against countries that lack such standards or have minimal ones.
The Group of Seven economic summit to be held in Naples next July provides an opportunity for the Clinton Administration to provide leadership and forge consensus on this issue among the countries with the most active export credit agencies.
The overarching mission of the Eximbank is to create jobs in the United States through promotion of exports. Improved environmental procedures could encourage the Eximbank to assist producers of advanced energy-efficient and environmentally sound technologies in reaching international markets. These smaller, rapidly growing, high-technology companies are of importance to our country's economic competitiveness in future.

Javits Center Facing Tougher Outside Competition

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Officials at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center say they are finally beginning to crack the stubborn issues that have plagued the hall since it opened in 1986: high costs, wasteful union rules, mob intrusion and thefts. But now, they say, they face more of an external threat: growing competition from cities building new halls, some surpassing the Javits in size.
Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Atlanta have expanded convention complexes in recent years, and other cities are expected to follow suit. 
 Javits officials say they will not be able to compete for large events unless they can provide the kind of spaces these shows require.
Fabian G. Palomino, president of the center, a state authority, is proposing that the center's floor space be doubled, but has declined to comment on how the project might be built. But Mr. Palomino, a confidant of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for re-election this year, said, "It's going to be a very concrete proposal, developed in the near future."
He added: "The Convention and Visitors Bureau identified some 70 conventions and trade shows which would come if there were available room or dates."
The center, spanning 34th to 38th Streets on the Hudson River, has been struggling for years to reverse a decline in attendance. Partly as a result of the recession, the number of events dropped by a third between 1989 and 1993 and the number of convention delegates was reduced by nearly half.
The center was also dogged by its own reputation as the nation's toughest hall, with bad employee attitudes, abusive practices and exorbitant prices. Exhibitors had to pay electricians $70 to replace a light bulb.
Step have been taken to correct the problems. eWages have been cut a third, to bring them more in line with other unionized halls, and work rules liberalized. Prosecutors and union regulators cracked down on corruption. Center officials say better security has virtually eliminated thefts and losses, which once approached $1 million a year.
Such improvements "have increased the demand for space to the point where the center must be enlarged," Mr. Palomino said, adding that public attendance recovered some last year.
But the problems are far from over. Javits got mixed reviews last week from exhibitors at some of the 2,000 booths at concurrent shows on fashion, medical devices and computer printing.
"The union thing is a mess," said Jennifer Weber at the White Rice fashion company booth. Her co-workers were nearly finished hanging a backdrop curtain when a union man came along, claimed jurisdiction and charged $70 for 30 minutes, she said.
At Star of India's fashion display, Satya Verma said four booths cost $20,000 at Javits, five times the Las Vegas fee.
In addition, a new dispute, over the center's move to take control of exhibitors' information racks at shows, has incensed Steven Hacker, head of the International Association of Exposition Management. "This threatens to drive away any remaining business," he said. "Javits may soon be the prettiest, most functional empty convention hall in the country."
But others praise Javits. Donald Kingston, whose Top Rock Private Dancer company makes skimpy apparel for Frederick's of Hollywood, said, "I've been to shows all over the country, and this is one of the nicest."
David Larkin, whose Larkin Group manages shows, said: "Things are getting better at Javits. There's no tipping. Before, everybody had their hands out, but now if I find that, I can get them fired. Yes, it costs more here. But while a cup of coffee may be cheaper in Dallas, there aren't as many buyers. This is New York, and this is where the action is." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Has Had Too Much of a Chance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In regard to the May 8 Soapbox essay, "Give Manufacturng a Chance," what would you call the more than 30 years during which manufacturing has been given the tightest of zoning protection and the most exotic of governmental incentives? Yet manufacturing employment has plummeted consistently from 956,000 in 1960 to 283,000, according to the latest Commerce Department report. And even as manufacturing employment was so steadily declining, the city's land areas zoned for manufacturing only were being increased so that they now total far more than the area of Manhattan. 
 My purpose is not to down-play the importance of manufacturing employment, but to urge that some rationality be applied to this major protectionist zoning, which prevents the replenishment of the city's critically short housing supply. How bad is the problem? It would take more than 600,000 new or totally rebuilt units to make up for the shortage.
The scarcity of housing means, aside from the very visible misery of the homeless, the less visible problems of those living in unhealthy, overcrowded quarters. It is also part of the reason why hundreds of thousands of middle- and upper-income families and dozens of Fortune 500 companies have departed from New York over the last decade, leaving tax rolls less and less able to support ever-growing multitudes on welfare and in the public schools.
The timing of the "Give Manufacturing a Chance" article is particularly sensitive because current planners are just beginning to seriously review the antiquated zoning regulations that have done nothing to slow the decline of manufacturing, but have badly affected the city's housing stock and the city's future.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: PARKCHESTER;
Housing Jewel in the Bronx Loses Its Luster

BYLINE: By JANE LII 

 BODY:
When Merna Wright, 48, an immigrant from Antigua, bought her two-bedroom apartment in the Parkchester housing development for $36,000 eight years ago, she thought she had achieved the American dream. But now that dream is crumbling like the soggy plaster in her apartment.
Her dank apartment stinks of decay. Mold and mildew cover her walls, and the paint is peeling. All her possessions, save a sofa and some knickknacks, are in the middle of the room, covered with plastic sheets. 
 "I never thought it would be like this," she said last week.
Ms. Wright, a clerk in a fabric store, is among a number of middle- and low-income owners and renters in this development complex -- once one of the Bronx's crown jewels -- who say their apartments have fallen into disrepair over the years. They have demanded that the Parkchester South Condominium board make improvements. Recently, nearly 2,000 people gathered in St. Raymond's church to vent their frustrations.
"It's outrageous that people have to live in this condition," says Celeste Ramirez, the housing services coordinator in the Bronx Borough President's office. "This has been a crumbling infrastructure for a while. It needs an infusion of money and repairs. Piecemeal doesn't do it."
Conceding some problems but saying tenants are exaggerating claims that 95 percent of the apartments are in disrepair, Margaret Walsh, first vice president of the Parkchester South Condominium and a longtime resident, nevertheless agreed that long-term investment is needed. But she said the board cannot raise enough money from owners to institute capital changes. She estimated that at least $100 million is needed.
State Senator Pedro Espada Jr., whose district includes part of the Parkchester complex, said the entire complex's electrical system must be rewired and its plumbing system replaced, among other things. He said he plans to appeal to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Federal Government.
"If we cannot do for Parkchester what we do for Steinbrenner," he said, "then we've lost the Bronx."
Built in the 1930's by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the complex was home to mostly Jewish and Irish tenants. In 1968, investors led by Harry B. Helmsley bought it for $90 million and began converting it into condominiums. The north quadrant was converted in 1973, and the rest in 1986. Today most of the residents are black and Hispanic.
A tour of a dozen apartments in four buildings last week showed water leaks of varying severity in all the units, as well as other problems like broken pipes, holes in the walls and toilets not working. The tour also found many basement sewer caps off the openings. One couple living on the first floor, Julio and Sarah Montalvo, said raw sewage fills the hallway and their foyer when it rains.
Cassandra Vernon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said 688 violations had been cited at the Parkchester complex since 1985, most of them in the last year.
The Helmsley organization, along with other investors, still owns about 50 percent of the complex. Helmsley officials said last week that they were not prepared to comment on the situation. JANE H. LII

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Ann Christopher, a nursing student, says she routinely gets into shouting matches about service and quality with the workers at her loca: Consumers Food supermarket in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.
 Mary Hunter, who was buying a few boxes of pasta last week at an Associated market nearby, regularly pays $13 in cab fare to do her "real" shopping at a Pathmark on the other side of the borough. 
 And Karen Hess, a culinary historian who has three supermarkets within walking distance of her home on the Upper West Side, still thinks that in general, based on its food shopping conditions, New York might well qualify as a former Soviet republic.
 "You could write an article about the horrors of Russian supermarkets, just by going to our supermarkets here," she insists. "The mess. The lines. The filth! And everybody is very, very rude."
 From the poorest of New York's neighborhoods to the wealthiest, the same complaints have long been heard -- the stores are cramped and dirty, the cashiers huffy, the meat questionable, the produce drooping, the prices higher than at the wonderful A & P up in Westchester County. In many areas of the city, often the poorer ones, people must travel considerable distances if they want to avoid poorly stocked and often expensive, bodegas and other small stores.
 This profile of the city's supermarket landscape is underscored by a New York Times computer analysis of data from state regulators and the supermarket industry, as well as an informal survey of markets in five neighborhoods.
 What is most apparent from the data is that, except in the wealthiest neighborhoods, what the majority of New Yorkers lack most is the comfort, choice and variety that chain stores can offer. The chain stores, like D'Agostino, Gristede's or Food Emporium, are overwhelmingly concentrated on the Upper East and West Sides. By contract, the analysis found, the poorest areas were dominated by smaller, independently owned stores, which cannot offer as many products, or as many brands.
 At the same time, there was a marked lack of modern technology and creature comforts. More than half of the city's markets failed state health inspections the first time around. And only about half the stores in the market survey had electronic scanning equipment, many aisles were cluttered with boxes and, in Manhattan, at least half the checkout aisles were closed.
 Of course, any New Yorker who has given the subject much thought understands, perhaps even accepts, that food shopping in the city will never rise to the wide-aisled, mini-mall standard of American supermarket bliss. Many a New Yorker has even turned this chronic case of good-shopping deprivation into a point of local pride: "We like shopping item by item, day by day, the European way," the line goes. And it is undeniable that small stores all over the city offer an unparalleled variety of food, though often at a price.
 Still, at a time of rapid evolution in the way Americans, and even New Yorkers, shop for all manner of things, the city's supermarket scene has remained remarkably resistant to change. Across the nation, stores of all kinds are becoming larger, more comprehensive, more economy-sized. In the last several years, the so-called superstores -- specializing in everything from housewares to books and records to computer products -- have begun to crack the New York market.
As for food shopping, which is about as basic and close to the heart as shopping gets: "New Yorkers get the worst of both worlds," says Travis Plunkett of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "They get smaller stores with higher prices and nastier employees. Anyone who's spent any time outside the city at other grocery stores knows what they're missing."
It's not that everyone wants to do all their food shopping in a store with aisles as wide as Broadway, or expects prices to fall to suburban levels; what New York's long-suffering shoppers seem to be saying is that they would simply like a taste of modern times.
The state of the local supermarket industry is in large measure a byproduct of the city's peculiar geographic and political economies. The cramped verticality of life here necessarily means small stores with limited display and storage space, not to mention small apartments with hardly any storage space at all. And recent efforts to bring in big chain supermarkets have met with stiff opposition from politically powerful small-business groups.
Now, though, the supermarket landscape could be on the verge of significant change. The city's economic woes have left consumers ever more eager for superstore bargains. Conscious of a growing demand, several chains have said they are eager to open new stores, and the Giuliani administration is considering a zoning change designed to attract large stores to formerly industrial areas.
Even in this climate of change, though, "New York consumers are not in an enviable position," says Doug McAuley, a Chicago-based consumer-products specialist with Gemini Consulting, a management-consulting firm. "The real question is whether New York will go along with the changes or not. They may just raise prices even higher."
 
 
WEDGED IN AND PILED UP
 They're small and cramped. They often look dirty. But just how small, cramped and dirty?
Stores in the city are inspected for health-code violations by the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. According to The Times's analysis of state records, 53 percent of the city's supermarkets fail their inspections on the first round. While most pass upon re-inspection, the state says, 12 percent are in violation at any given time, compared with 8 percent for the entire state.
And that's just the stores that get inspected; with only 57 inspectors and three supervisors checking more than 16,000 sites for things like rodent infestation and mishandled meat, some markets haven't been checked in two years, said Gerald Moore, a department spokesman.
As for size, the average American supermarket covers 35,000 square feet, according to the Food Marketing Institute, a national trade association. The typical New York City market covers 5,000 to 10,000. And while four shopping carts can easily move through the aisles at an average-sized suburban market, an A & P in the Westchester County community of Bronxville, The informal store survey, which was not designed to be a statistically valid sample of the entire city, found that bodegas' aisles were an average of just over two carts wide, while the chain stores' aisles were about a cart wider; the independents fell in between. More than a third of the stores had piles of boxes, and in some cases stock wagons, in the aisles.
Indeed, the New York supermarket's ability to wedge things in and pile them up draws praise from some quarters.
"The New York City food retailing sector has adapted itself to the unique economic circumstances of New York," says Edward McLaughlin, a professor of food marketing at Cornell University. "They have skillfully managed to sell a remarkable array of products in a very small space."
Still, with so little space, New York City supermarkets don't offer the variety that many suburban stores can. The typical American supermarket displays 40,000 to 60,000 items; the average New York City supermarket has perhaps one-tenth that number.
By and large, the city's supermarkets come in three forms. There is the regional chain store, represented by Waldbaum's, Pathmark and A & P. There are the local chains, like Sloan's, Gristede's (recently acquired by the Sloan's parent company, Red Apple) and D'Agostino. And then there are the independents, the vast majority of city supermarkets, which might share a name like Key Food or Associated, but are owned by individuals. Filling in across the city are neighborhood convenience stores, delicatessens and bodegas.
What the city has few of is big supermarkets. This is largely the legacy of the 1960's and 70's, when some of the regional chains followed the stream of middle-class whites out of the city, and especially the boroughs outside Manhattan. In recent years, the chains that have made overtures about returning say they have found themselves stymied by a lack of suitable real estate and cumbersome zoning laws.
According to The Times's analysis, the poorest quarter of the city's community districts had roughly 1.5 chain stores for every 100,000 people. In the areas that ranked in the top quarter economically, there were a little over 7 per 100,000 people. At the same time, the poorest quarter had 8.4 independent stores, compared with 3.4 in the wealthiest neighborhoods.
The chains argue that things would become easier if City Hall decides to eliminate a zoning restriction that has discouraged many large stores. Right now, a commercial developer needs a special permit to build in an industrial area -- practically the only place for a store of 30,000 square feet or more. The application process, which requires an environmental-impact statement and a variety of hearings, can take two years or more.
"It's a lot of rigamarole," says Barry Dinerstein, a planner for the City Planning Department.
The desire for big stores seems strongest in the poorer neighborhoods, which are dominated by small independent markets. The most vociferous, and potent, opponents of the big stores, and of efforts to loosen the zoning restrictions, are associations of small-business owners, many of whom run the independents. Even as residents in many neighborhoods press for the big stores, the small-store owners argue that they are more responsive to local needs.
"The chains can never adapt fast enough to changes in the neighborhoods," said Al Rodriguez, who owns two Associated stores and is a spokesman for the National Supermarket Association, a mainly Hispanic storeowners' group. "No one gives the customer the service we give."
Changing the zoning "will create a shopping-center effect, which we have seen in the suburbs," argues Richard Lipsky, president of the Neighborhood Small Business Association, founded a year ago to battle superstores like the Home Depot that recently opened near Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.
Whether big stores are necessarily better is also a matter of considerable debate. Their critics point out that their prices tend to be higher for national name brand products. But supporters of the big stores point out that they do offer a greater choice across price lines.
"The large stores have a lot of shelf space, so they have the ability to have a generic, a house brand and a national brand for a given item, and they can have different sizes," said Mr. Dinerstein. "You may be able to save money that way."
Adds Harvey M. Gutman, a senior vice president at Pathmark Stores Inc., which has 16 stores in the city and is trying to build a new one on 125th Street in Harlem, "People in the city should have the choice to shop as most other residents of the United States shop, or not."
 
 
THE PRICE FREEZE

What is clear, however, is that the lack of space and the high cost of labor, rent and distribution in New York have created a floor below which grocery prices are unlikely to fall, no matter how big the store. While huge warehouse clubs and other discounters around the country are forcing supermarkets to lower their prices, prices in New York have remained relatively static, not to mention relatively high.
According to a 1992 study by the Inter-City Cost of Living Index for the American Chamber of Commerce, New York's grocery prices are among the highest in the country. A market basket of 27 items cost an average of $147.20 in the city, compared with an average of $100 in 99 other areas, said Ed Sturgeon, co-chairman of the index. A survey of Nassau and Suffolk Counties conducted six months earlier found an average price of $120.40, he added.
In New York, the true competition seems to be whatever is across the street -- usually a similar-size supermarket or a greengrocer. On Church Avenue in East Flatbush, for example, a half-gallon of Tropicana orange juice cost $2.99 at both the Consumers Food supermarket and the West Indian Grocery, a much smaller, Korean-owned store nearby.
Indeed, analyses of prices within the city tend to present a confusing picture. A 1991 report for the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, "The Poor Pay More . . . for Less," found that supermarkets in poor neighborhoods consistently charged shoppers an average of 5.2 percent more than those in the rest of the city. However, the findings were disputed by the industry, which argued with the methodology used.
The informal survey of 24 stores in 5 areas found prices at the stores on the Upper West Side were 9 percent higher, on average, than the stores in the other boroughs, an average of $37.69 compared with $34.22. The highest prices were found at an Upper West Side D'Agostino, where the market basket of 19 items cost $41.10.
A spokeswoman for D'Agostino, Mary Moore, questioned the prices, adding: "We have never tried to be the lowest guy in town, but we are certainly not the highest. "We will be high on some items perhaps, but we will be low on most prices."
In the last couple of years, many of the national supermarket chains have adopted new buying practices that have allowed them to increase the industry's razor-slim profit margins. Mr. McAuley, the consultant, says that while this new approach has yet to reach the city, it may ultimately foster more intense competition, and with it a reduction in New York's traditionally high grocery prices.
"My guess is some chain will figure out how to do it and go the way of the rest of the country," he says, "and that could cause a big shakeup."
 
 
SEEKING MORE STORES

Changes in zoning laws and business practice, however, would not address what many people say is the biggest problem: Getting more supermarkets, even if they aren't the biggest supermarkets, into the city's poorer neighborhoods.
For instance, the 125,000 people who live in the area covered by Community Board 4 in the High Bridge section of the Bronx, have only one "real" supermarket, a four-year-old Waldbaum's in a shopping center on 161st Street, plus about 15 small independent stores.
"The bottom line is, for any city of 125,000 people, you would have a lot more than we have right now," said Herbert Samuels, the district manager. "I think this is typical for any poor area."
Like Mr. Samuels, Viola D. Greene, the district manager of Community Board 16 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, is puzzled by the absence of stores in poor areas, which then become dependent on convenience stores and bodegas that seldom carry full arrays of groceries and often charge high prices.
"We don't have the income of an Upper West Side perhaps, but we do have the need," she said. And people who cannot afford cars are unlikely to go elsewhere, she added. "They are hostages to shopping within the neighborhood."
Why exactly do chain-store owners tend to avoid these neighborhoods?
"Some managements may be more motivated by stereotypes than analysis," said the author of the Consumer Affairs report, Glenn Von Nostitz, now a deputy public advocate.
In addition to a disparity in prices, his study found that rents in poor areas were generally lower, and that reports of "shrinkage" -- money lost through theft or breakage -- tended to be anecdotal, not factual.
Howard Tisch, the longtime president of the Metropolitan Food Coun-
cil, a 1,200-member citywide trade organization, calls the report "substantially incorrect." He contends that supermarkets decide where to open based on projected returns on their investments, since they are businesses, not charities.
Without exception, store owners say they prefer doing business in areas they perceive as wealthy.
"You make a lot better profit selling filet mignon than you do chopped meat," said Mr. Tisch, a one-time consumer-affairs official in the Lindsay administration. "It isn't a question of whether they're running a profit. It's how much of a profit. That's the American way."
Added Arthur Waldbaum, senior vice president for sales and merchandising at Waldbaum's, "My ability to be a great merchant comes through much better in an upscale neighborhood." He says his stores turn a profit in various kinds of neighborhoods.
At the same time, chains that don't, or won't, operate stores in poor neighborhoods point to the independents as proof that people are getting their groceries somewhere.
"They're not starving up there" in the Bronx, said Nicholas D'Agostino, chairman and chief executive officer of the 22-store chain that bears his name. "Everybody needs to buy food, but they don't have to shop at a D'Agostino."
Four years ago, in an effort to bring in more supermarkets, the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit agency based in Harlem that studies food and hunger issues, convened the Supermarket Project, a group of development and social-service agencies, as well as supermarket owners. One result is a city program that will establish supermarkets in two long-deprived neighborhoods in Brooklyn by the end of next year.
"We learned that the reason you're not seeing new development of supermarket spaces throughout the city is that it doesn't work economically," said Pamela Fairclough, the project's director. "The revenue stream you get from a 10,000 or 20,000-square-foot store doesn't cover the construction costs. A 40,000-square-foot store does."
Officials call the city plan the first of its kind anywhere in the country. It offered developers subsidies of 90 percent on the cost of leasing the city-owned land and another 30 percent on construction through the Economic Development Corporation, said Angela Brown, the agency's vice president for Brooklyn. The program plans two retail strips, one on Rockaway Avenue near Pitkin Avenue in Brownsville, and the other in Coney Island, on Mermaid Avenue near 29th Street. Both will have Pioneer markets, one 12,000 square feet and the other 18,000. Similar projects are being planned in the Bronx.
Even as some try to bring stores to the inner city, and for all the stores' emphasis on the well-to-do, many of those shoppers have been lost for good. There is an untold but significant number who would rather drive to the suburbs.
"It was the chaos, the size of the stores and the availability of the products, and having to transport things back to the apartment," said Julie Sogg Seymour, vice president of a midtown antiques and jewelry store. A few years ago, when her daughter was small, a friend told her about the clean and roomy Grand Union in Closter, N.J. Soon she was rounding up friends and heading across the river in her pickup truck on a weekly basis.
"Some mothers meet for lunch," Ms. Seymour said. "We used to meet and go to New Jersey and grocery shop." Even though the mothers' group has disbanded, she still goes to New Jersey to buy food.
There is one admittedly nice way in which New York's supermarkets have remained a breed apart: many stores still offer home delivery.
"If you're going to pay through the nose for groceries," said Mr. Plunkett, the consumer advocate, "you might as well have them delivered."

Chart: "SURVEYING THE STORES"
 
CHOICE: Chain supermarkets - A&P, D'Agostino and the like - are overwhelmingly concentrated in the wealthiest areas, the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan. Poor areas rely heavily on independent stores, which are generally smaller and less well-stocked.
 
COST: Compared with most Americans New Yorkers pay a lot for food. In visits to stores in five neighborhoods areound the city, prices were highest in the wealthiest area chosen, the Upper West Side. On individual items, prices varied widely. A can of Bumble Bee chunk white tuna cost 69 cents at a Pioneer market in the South Bronx, $1.89 at Brothers Super in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
 
CLEANLINESS: More than half of the city's supermarkets fail their health-code inspections the first time around, according to state regulators. At any given time, 12 percent of the city's markets are considered to be inviolation, compared with 8 percent statewide.

HEADLINE: Shakespeare Meets Emma Lazarus

BYLINE: By Bette Pesetsky; Bette Pesetsky's most recent novel is "Cast a Spell."

 BODY:

THE PRINCE OF WEST END AVENUE
By Alan Isler.
246 pp. Bridgehampton, L.I.:
Bridge Works Publishing Company. $19.95. 
 ALAN ISLER uses to advantage the mythic power of the theater in his first novel, "The Prince of West End Avenue." But it turns out to be a distinctly unconventional sort of theater. As the story begins, a production of "Hamlet" is in rehearsal by a troupe whose actors are drawn from the residents of the Emma Lazarus retirement home on New York's Upper West Side. The fate of the play itself is uncertain, and chaos reigns. Death, you see, has already decimated the cast and threatens to do so again. In addition, all the contretemps involved in putting on a play are present -- jealousies, casting problems, politics.
The Emma Lazarus is a world largely dominated by an emigre culture rich with allusions to the past, yet also with romances and rivalries, with the sense that life is definitely not over. There is a kind of nostalgia in Mr. Isler's depiction of his characters and the complex web of their memories. But curtains are drawn over parts of their lives, shielding nightmare events they cannot bear to examine too closely. The darkness of the past animates their present.
Otto Korner, an engaging and erudite retired librarian, is the novel's narrator; originally, he is cast as the ghost in "Hamlet." The octogenarian Korner, once a published poet and writer of articles on literary subjects, now keeps a journal, whose aim is to clarify once and for all certain truths about "anti-art: in brief, Dada." A Holocaust survivor, he has lived, since his rescue, in search of a purpose.
Korner's memories are rattled by the appearance of young Mandy Dattner, a newly hired physical therapist. Can she be a reincarnation of the beautiful Magda Damrosch, who perished at Auschwitz? Recollections pull Korner back to the early decades of the century when, unable to serve in the Kaiser's army in World War I and thus a visible target for sentiments directed against his family in Germany, he was sent to Switzerland to continue his studies. It was on the way to Zurich that he first glimpsed the unattainable Magda and fell in love with her.
If Korner moved cautiously on the fringes of a changing world, Magda was in the thick of events, holding court at the Cabaret Voltaire with the artists Hans Arp and Max Oppenheimer and the poet Tristan Tzara. In Korner's memories of Magda, we witness the birth of the Dada movement.
The exiled Korner also met and had a drink with Lenin: "What did we talk about, Lenin and I? Not about political economy or the rights of the proletariat. You will scarcely believe me if I tell you that we spoke of love -- or, rather, that I spoke of it." Korner even spent an evening listening to a noisy and unimpressive James Joyce. But what did such meetings mean? They were, Korner concludes, like much of life, to be considered merely coincidences.
Moving back and forth from the world of his memories to the present world of the "Hamlet" production, Korner finds only turbulence and change. With the death of Adolphe Sinsheimer, who was both the play's director and its Hamlet and the only Emma Lazarus resident with professional acting experience (as "a Ruritanian soldier in the movie 'The Prisoner of Zenda' "), the stage is set for new intrigues. Cabals form at Goldstein's Dairy Restaurant, with plots to take over the floundering "Hamlet."
Mr. Isler displays a sharp and original wit, with touches of black humor. Some jokes are genuinely funny, as when the play's self-appointed replacement director, who fears offending Orthodox members of the audience, changes the line "Is she to be buried in Christian burial?" to "Is she to be buried in Mineola?" But at whom are we laughing?
Although the other emigres are skillfully drawn, not one holds the fascination of Otto Korner. And the men, like Korner's friend Benno Hamburger, have a depth and complexity not shown by the residence's vocal and conniving women, who seem more like stock characters. Korner's second wife, the Contessa, whom he marries during his early retirement, is an exception: as we spy on his recollections of their failed physical union, we wince as he cruelly describes her aging body.
Gradually, though, "The Prince of West End Avenue" emerges as a paradoxical tale of how to make peace with an unbearable past and the sin of pride. In a powerful scene toward the end of the novel, when Korner at last speaks at length of his first wife, Meta, and his son, the pettier concerns of the Emma Lazarus home abruptly diminish. It is then that we realize how much Otto Korner's story is able to haunt us.

HEADLINE: 'WE'RE ALL RACIST NOW'

BYLINE: By H.G. Bissinger; H. G. Bissinger is the author of "Friday Night Lights," about the obsession of Odessa, Tex., with its high-school football team. He is currently working on a book about the future of the American city.

 BODY:
When first spied off the thick spine of the Eisenhower Expressway, Proviso West High School suggests all the ingredients of a stable place. Its low-slung beige brick, undulating for acre after acre over the fairways and greens of the old golf course in Hillside, Ill., makes it seem more like a corporate campus than a suburban high school. Its location, nestled in a comfortable patch between a cemetery, a shopping mall and a movie theater, gives it the feel of a sanctuary sealed off from the monotone of Chicago's western suburbs, with their endless strip malls and four-lane highways and fast-food restaurants. In the strong early-morning light, when the school parking lot is empty of the rattle of cars, and students have not yet begun to congregate outside the metal doors waiting to be let in, there is something truly monumental about Proviso West, a place built in the helter-skelter suburban-boom-town days of the 1950's -- and built to endure.
Inside the school there is the feel of a place where taxpayers' money was well spent -- a kind of mini-Pentagon, with more than half a million square feet. Adjacent to the main complex is the high canopy of the field house with its fast track surfaces. There is the gym with row after row of rising bleachers, and the sparkling indoor pool, where a swimmer pulls smooth, fine strokes that barely break the water. 
 The grounds, at first glance, are just as lovely: well-kept wooden benches, an outdoor stage, the Senior Circle courtyard so filled with the chirping of birds that it sounds rigged -- all the shrubbery impeccably manicured and flat topped. In one corner of Senior Circle there is an elegant sundial that was donated by the class of 1963. Near the sundial is a stone bench donated by the class of 1962 with an inscription that says, "The Future Belongs to Those Who Prepare for It."
Proviso West and its sister school, Proviso East, form what is known as Proviso Township High Schools District 209. Ten communities feed into the district, all of them in the near-western suburbs of Chicago, with populations ranging from 4,000 to 27,000. Beginning in the 1950's, many of them boomed from tiny villages into thriving, healthy communities. Some, like Bellwood, had their roots among the working class. Others, like Hillside and Westchester, were bedroom communities where median incomes and housing prices ranked among the top 35 percent of all Chicago suburbs. During this growth spurt they were also distinguished by something else -- they were almost totally white. Of the communities feeding into the schools, only one, Maywood, had any black population to speak of in 1960. The others all had black populations of less than 1 percent.
It was in this era that Proviso (pronounced pro-VEYE-zo) West was spawned. Built in the late 1950's with a $6.75 million bond issue, it was more than a school: it was a symbol. At the dedication ceremonies on Nov. 16, 1958, the words of the American educator James Bryant Conant were invoked: "Our purpose is to cultivate in the largest number of our future citizens an appreciation of both the responsibilities and the benefits which come to them because they are American and free."
Later on, at the punch-and-cookie tours arranged by volunteers, several thousand people came to admire the place their tax dollars had built. And what a place it was, with floor-to-ceiling glass and sweeping curves and airy space, with touches like the tiled outdoor mall that could be used for student dances and the mosaic mural of Sioux Indian themes that arched its way along the western facade. The Chicago newspapers heralded the school's opening.
Thirty-six years later, those touches have become almost invisible. The mural is still there, but the blue of its tile is faded, almost lusterless. Students have been discouraged from using the Senior Circle since someone set fire to the shrubbery there a few years ago. Once-white curtains now spill out of the windows like dirty handkerchiefs hanging out of pockets. On a bulletin board in the social studies office, a teacher has posted a chart from Mad magazine showing that, one way or another, for today's students all academic roads lead to the same thing anyway -- a job flipping burgers at McDonald's.
Over the past decade, Proviso West has experienced a dizzying degree of demographic and socioeconomic change. In the 1990-91 academic year, 11 percent of the students were from low-income families. This year, the figure has almost doubled, to 19 percent. In 1973-74, the school, with roughly 4,500 students, was less than 1 percent black and Asian, nearly 2 percent Latino and 98 percent white. Now, 20 years later, there are only 2,300 students, of whom roughly 56 percent are black, 22 percent Latino, 18 percent white and the balance Asian.
Between 1970 and 1990, the population of the township shrank nearly 12 percent, to 152,000. Pockets of middle-class comfort became increasingly harder to find. Factories and companies that had once prospered there shut their doors. Looming over these unhappy developments was rampant white flight: as the black population more than tripled, the white population plummeted. Whites are still the predominant racial group in Proviso Township, but in the past two decades their numbers have fallen 40 percent.
Some whites who went to Proviso West in the 1970's would never, ever send their children there. They say the best thing to do would be to close it and sell it off to a big corporation. They describe it as a "jail" and complain about how the place is killing their property values. When asked to think of ways to improve the educational environment of the school, they come up with ideas like metal detectors and hall sweeps with K-9 police tracking dogs.
"I would say with metal detectors, I would feel a little bit better," says one parent, Annette LoBello. "You never know who's going to come in a car and get you with an AK-47." (School officials say there has been only one shooting incident on Proviso West property in the history of the school.) As for the K-9 dogs, LoBello sees the idea as a plus for everybody: "So bring the dogs in. If nothing's happening, then what's the worry?"
LoBello has decided that her two children, both of whom are not even 10 yet, will not go to Proviso West. But the whole issue of public education is still very much on her mind. She served as the coordinator of Citizens United for Better Education, a movement founded by several Westchester residents in 1992 to explore the possibility of "de-annexing" their town from the Proviso high-school district. The idea was to join a neighboring district that had appreciably better American College Testing (A.C.T.) scores, that sent more students to college and that, like Westchester, was more than 90 percent white. The effort failed, but LoBello, a reservations agent for Southwest Airlines, is now working with the group on another plan in which Westchester and perhaps one or two other communities would separate from Proviso West and create their own school district.
Thomas Winkler, a lawyer from Westchester who is among those studying the new district idea, explains the impetus behind it: the needs of students from Westchester are simply no longer compatible with the needs of other Proviso West students. "You're just getting a very different student coming out of the Westchester elementary and middle schools, a much brighter student," says Winkler.
Blacks believe such assertions are unfair and insulting. Many students from Westchester may come to Proviso West better prepared to do the work, they say, but that does not make them inherently smarter than the school's other pupils. Wylmarie Sykes, a professor at Malcolm X College in Chicago and the current president of District 209's school board, says: "There are some Westchester students who do well and some who do less so. You have high-achieving students of all races and economic backgrounds."
As proof, she points to her four children, who graduated from Proviso East and went on to academic success at M.I.T., Georgetown and West Point. She acknowledges that there are students at both Proviso East and Proviso West who are suffering academically but maintains that their problems are often the fault of the schools serving them.
Teaching must become more innovative, the school day must be lengthened, the community must pass property tax referendums for urgently needed improvements in instruction. "I think all kids can learn everything that we have to teach," she says. "The same things that the honors kids are taught can be learned by all kids."
"It's not that your child is better than my child," says Janice Bennett, whose daughter, Charise, ranks in the top 10 percent of the junior class at Proviso West. "It's only color that separates the two."
But that separation is becoming wider all the time. Proviso West is an example of the painful drama of race that is being played out in many communities. A kind of negative synergy is at work. Whites respond to integration by abandoning their communities the moment blacks move in. Blacks, seeking suburban refuge from the crime and chaos of the city just as whites did 20 years earlier, move, only to find themselves still isolated.
It's Friday, and to Bill Paterson, a Proviso West social studies teacher, it's been a long week. The inspiration doesn't come so easily anymore, and it is on days like this, when he feels tired, just wanting to go home, that the VCR comes in so handy. It's the second video of the week for his sociology classes. The first was a "20/20" segment on an exorcism conducted by a Roman Catholic priest, and Paterson felt obliged to warn that the material, in which the subject of the exorcism screams and speaks in tongues and has to be tied to a chair, might be too scary to watch. Roughly 10 minutes into the film now being watched, the process of human reproduction is shown. Paterson hasn't said much so far, but the image of sperm meeting egg causes him to speak up.
"How many people know about this from personal experience?" he asks the class, which is made up of juniors and seniors and is mostly minority. "We got any fathers in here? Any mothers?" Some of the students laugh embarrassedly, but then, this is Mr. Paterson, or Mr. P. as his students call him, and Mr. P. often jokes.
With the film playing, Paterson continues his line of questioning, whispering to a female student, "We got anyone pregnant in here?" She turns her head and looks at him almost quizzically, as if trying to figure out what on earth such a question has to do with sociology class. She says nothing, hoping to dismiss the whole thing with a little laugh, but he doesn't let up. "Come on, you'd know."
There are days, particularly with his junior honors class, when Paterson is an electric teacher. In trying to explain the theories behind the French Revolution, for example, he used to ask students to consider what it would be like if there were a revolution at Proviso West. He then assigned each of his students roles, producing a lively, spirited debate. He doesn't do much of that anymore, and he explains why: "I have run into problems now that I have a lot of black kids. They won't shut up."
Over the past 20 years, the school's academic performance has faltered. Some teachers say that students in general no longer have a thirst for learning. They're drowning in the immediacy of the cable age and the video age and are sadly incapable of viewing their future beyond the next 24 hours. These teachers also say that, given the changing economic landscape, it's difficult to blame students. It must be hard, they say, for a Proviso West student to walk across the frontage road to the mall and see empty storefront windows, or to hear stories from older friends who have come back home with their hard-earned college degrees and can't find jobs that will pay the rent, much less repay the tuition loans. "It breaks my heart when I think about what they're going to be in 10 years," says Ann Rebello, a social studies teacher, of her students.
Rebello is also acutely aware of the assumptions that are made about Proviso West students purely on the basis of their color. Upon hearing that she had taken a job at a school that was more than 80 percent minority, acquaintances immediately assumed she was "in a bad school with bad kids." They kept telling her that the only way to survive would be with toughness and rigidity. But when she got to Proviso West last fall as a new teacher, Rebello found students who were open, yearning for attention. "You don't have to be tough to teach here," she says.
Paterson, who is 53 and started at the school in 1971 when it was virtually all white, sees the place very differently. In relating what he believes is the inevitable decline of Proviso West into an underclass school, he stresses the socioeconomic changes that have transformed the township over the past 20 years but also focuses on one racial group -- the blacks. His outspokenness has made him something of a patron saint among some white students. "There are some days I come in, I don't want to see anyone black," he says. "I've just had it."
Paterson cites the behavior of blacks in the hallways between classes ("The conduct of some of these black males is incredibly immature -- the yelling, the screaming, the way they hit girls"). He talks about the time three blacks came into his class and started beating up one of his black students with a bat. (As it happened, none of the three attended the school.) He tells stories of white students who have dropped out because they couldn't stand being with blacks ("You know, Mr. P., I'm sitting in an English IV Academic class, and I'm sitting here with these black kids who can't even write a complete sentence"). He also tells the story of a former teacher, now retired, who moved to a small coastal island so he would never have to see another black face.
"I wish I could leave this year," says Paterson. "There are days I come here when I can hardly face it. I have to force myself."
Proviso West was conceived during an era of social and racial upheaval in America's cities. Blacks were moving to Chicago from the South by the thousands, and whites responded by getting out as fast as they could. Many of those whites set their sights on Proviso Township because of its proximity to the city, its strong economic base, its relatively cheap housing and its absence of blacks.
During most of the 1960's, Proviso West was exclusively white and Proviso East predominantly white. For most of the decade the schools were stable. The township was stable. But on Dec. 4, 1969, Fred Hampton, the leader of the Chicago Black Panthers, was killed by the police during an apartment raid on the city's West Side. Hampton had been a native of Maywood, where Proviso East is, and disorders at the school began on Dec. 10, when white students opposed a black-student-sponsored memorial assembly in Hampton's honor. Five days later, after 95 police officers were brought in to stop a rock-and-bottle-throwing melee, the school was closed.
The riots shook the township to its core. White flight began again, not in the traditional pattern from the city to the suburbs, but from Proviso Township to other suburbs. In 1970 in Maywood, there were 17,286 whites and 12,416 blacks. By 1980, the white total had dropped two-thirds and the black population had risen two-thirds. Neighboring Bellwood had one black resident out of 20,729 in 1960. Today, Bellwood is 71 percent black. People who remember the changeover in Proviso Township say it happened the way it did on the West Side of Chicago during the 1950's. The minute a black family moved into a Bellwood neighborhood, whites just emptied out. Only affluent Westchester was exempt from this trend. In 1970, out of 20,033 residents, Westchester had 12 blacks. By 1980, there were 14.
For a time, Proviso West High School remained insulated from the racial changes that were transforming the township. But in the late 70's, school officials say, the Federal Government began to question whether District 209 was practicing segregation at its two high schools, and the boundaries were voluntarily changed. Patricia Berent, who teaches English at Proviso West, still remembers the faculty meeting at which the boundary changes were announced. She remembers the ominous tone of the meeting, the clear suggestion that Proviso West teachers had no idea what they were in store for, considering how accustomed they had grown to the prototypical white suburban school setting -- "the country club style," as the Chicago Tribune had described the school when it first opened.
"The implication was, it wasn't going to be pretty," says Berent. There was this feeling in the community that Proviso West "wasn't built for black kids," she says. "Black kids with white kids was going to ruin the education system over there." So the whites did what whites often do when the homogeneity of their environment is threatened. "In many ways, they abandoned the school."
But integrated schools can blossom in the suburbs, and as an example there's Oak Park, just a stone's throw from Proviso Township.
In the late 1960's, a noted urbanologist predicted that parts of Oak Park, which borders Chicago's West Side, would become virtually all black by 1980. But instead of throwing up their hands and fleeing for the suburbs, residents planned for integration and welcomed it. "It was a community-wide effort where the community made a decision to embrace diversity as a source of richness and a source of strength," says Donald Offermann, the principal of Oak Park and River Forest High School. To prevent white flight, realtors agreed not to indulge in the kind of panic-peddling and blockbusting that had been so rampant on the West Side of Chicago: whites being told that if they didn't sell their houses immediately, they would would be worth next to nothing a few months later when the block "went black."
To encourage a sense of stability, the village government passed an ordinance prohibiting "for sale" signs. Some dilapidated apartment buildings were purchased, restored and then remarketed to prevent them from falling prey to permanent blight. Black families were welcomed into the community and encouraged to buy homes on blocks where their presence would further integration. How well did such planning and commitment work? Over the past 20 years, housing prices in Oak Park have more than quadrupled. As for education, average A.C.T. scores at Oak Park and River Forest High School, which is 28 percent black and 4 percent Latino, are well above both the state and national averages and rank in the top 25 percent of all high-school districts in the Chicago area.
But Oak Park is an exception. "Most areas are doing nothing to insure from happening the destructive process of racial change that has taken place in the central cities," says Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at Harvard and the author of a recent study showing an accelerated trend toward segregation in the nation's schools since the late 1960's. The kinds of issues that Proviso is constantly up against -- lack of financial support, lack of community support, racial hostility and white flight, unmotivated students -- can be found in suburbs across the land. "This is what we should really be concentrating on right now," says Orfield.
His study, conducted for the National School Boards Association, showed that in the suburbs around the largest cities, 58 percent of blacks and 64 percent of Latinos attend schools that are at least half minority. Given that minority enrollment is rapidly increasing in these schools, the study predicted even greater suburban segregation unless "offsetting plans are put in motion." Instead, Orfield sees two distinct reactions among suburban school districts: first avoidance, then panic. "I get a call from a suburb every few days -- 'Will you come and tell us what to do?' " says Orfield. "It's usually 10 to 15 years too late." As for those whites who think they can somehow avoid integration by moving away, he issues a quick and blunt response.
"The places they are moving to will go through the same process in 10 to 15 years."
Contrary to Proviso West's reputation for violence and turmoil, often fostered by people who have never set foot inside during school hours, the place is orderly and quiet. The curriculum, in the best tradition of public education, is expansive and egalitarian, offering courses ranging from the vocational to the college level. The students, rich and poor, black, Latino and white, say it is still possible to get a good education.
It is true that A.C.T. scores at Proviso West are below those of surrounding suburban districts. It is true that the number of students who go on to four-year colleges is not as high as in those districts. But it's also true that many Proviso students have come from the difficult streets of Chicago, and that even within their new communities the temptations of drugs and gangs may still bepresent. Many also come from families so troubled that just getting to school is a major accomplishment.
"We are at one of the most complex times in the history of this district," says Thomas Jandris, Proviso West's principal. When he came to the school in 1992, he saw a place that confirmed that first-glance impression off the Eisenhower Expressway -- a classic and beautiful suburban school. "The facade was calm," he says. But once he got inside, it didn't take very long to realize something else entirely: "The undertow was incredible." Jandris found a place beset by an overwhelming flatness, as if nearly everyone who worked there had just about given up and accepted as a fait accompli the downward cycle of the school. The attitude toward students, he felt, was symbolized by the lack of doors on the bathroom entrances, even on the stalls inside.
"It's not very elegantly stated," says Jandris. "It sounds very simple, but education and the best interests of students have grown far apart." And for the past two years he has worked to bridge this gap. He put doors back on the bathrooms. He abolished the requirement for students to wear ID's around their necks like dog tags. At the same time, he has been tough, instituting a strict new attendance policy.
But he also knows that the road to recovery for Proviso West is long, and he speaks bluntly about two issues that make change so elusive. One is the conduct of a school board that for 20 years, during the most pivotal time in the history of the Proviso district, fretted excessively over maintenance contracts and patronage hiring and not enough over the educational needs of its students. The other issue that concerns Jandris may ultimately pose far more of a challenge. "The bigotry is the same as it's been for 10,000 years of humanity," he says. "It's based on ignorance and fear. It is alive and well in Proviso Township in very insidious ways."
Whites may not be sending their children to Proviso West in significant numbers anymore, but they still exert enormous influence over both Proviso West and Proviso East. The high-school district is still predominantly white and has a very high proportion of elderly residents. It doesn't take much imagination to wonder how white voters respond when asked to approve property-tax-rate hikes so spending can be increased at its two predominantly minority high schools.
Since 1969, there have been three referendums asking voters to approve increases in the property tax rate for Proviso Township High School District 209's education fund, and each has been defeated. Schools ask taxpayers for more money all the time, but in the Proviso district the need is double-edged: to maintain the current quality of education and also to afford better instruction for the students at both high schools who are considered at risk. The percentage coming into Proviso West with serious learning problems continues to grow, and administrators say that as many as 25 percent of all students at the school are "at risk" academically. "You want to stretch and prepare and help get ready those students who are clearly not ready now," says Dale Crawford, the district's assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction. "They need more attention. The resources they need are significantly more than for the kid who is O.K."
Financial relief seems unlikely, however, either at the local or state level. School financing proposals are often talked about in the state capital, Springfield, but the net result of the impassioned rhetoric, says Peter Parrillo, Proviso Township High Schools' business manager, has been loss. State educational aid has declined from 12 percent of the district budget in 1984 to about 7 percent for the fiscal year that ends in June. "I have always been appalled at the way in which the state of Illinois, and the local officials of Cook County, have prostituted education in this state," says Parrillo, who is retiring this year and feels free to speak his mind.
If the State Legislature does nothing, and local taxpayers do nothing, the only other choice is obvious. Curriculum gets cut to the bone, extracurricular activities get cut to the bone, troubled students continue to founder and the very mission of Proviso West, to provide a comprehensive education for everyone, becomes impossible to sustain. It turns into the educational equivalent of a public housing project. Those with the greatest needs stay because they have no other place to go; those with the greatest means flee farther west to other suburbs, or to the parochial and private schools that ring Proviso West like buzzards.
"You do a slash-and-burn cut," says James Boyd, a school board member. "Then the remaining ones who do care are going to leave."
In the meantime, some of those who work in the district continue to fight the good fight. A new superintendent was hired for the district in 1992 after a national search. New principals were put in place at Proviso West and Proviso East. The school board has been revamped. A carefully written mission statement has been distributed in the hope of creating unity and a strong sense of purpose.
Patricia Berent doesn't have a problem with educational credos. In her experience as a teacher at Proviso West since 1969, she has seen them come and go. On paper they sound wonderful, sometimes inspirational. But in her third-floor classroom during first period, they seem as vapid as the poster on the wall of Bo Jackson with a book in his hands. Most of the students in her remedial English class are freshmen who, though not typical of the majority of Proviso West students, read at the third-grade to the fifth-grade level, causing Berent to wonder what, if anything, they were taught before they got here. "It's too late to make these kids academically prepared for college," says Berent. "It's almost too late for them to be at a maturity level to get a good job." A girl sucks on a lollipop. A boy examines his finger.
Today, Berent's class and another remedial English class are working together. The assignment is to take a statement by a noted black figure and explain the essence of its meaning. Two gleaming banks of Macintosh computers flank the walls. The students sit down before them. There is the familiar whir and click of floppy disk into disk drive. Some just stare at the screen. Some play, piling up data window after window on the gleaming screen like thick layers of paint, to the point where they can no longer find the file they were working on in the first place. Some write a sentence, maybe two, before becoming absolutely locked up, frozen, shifting from side to side, calling for the teacher because they need help, desperately need help.
"Miss Berent . . . Hey, Miss Berent. . . ."
She works the room diligently, poking and prodding and nurturing and negotiating, moving back and forth from Macintosh to Macintosh. She knows the children are trying, and she is trying. Slowly, bit by bit, words appear on the screens:
The pepel from wen Martin Luther King Jr. Lived did not wrly get along. Martin Luther King wanted wigth and blck people.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Brogth the word to me and some of my friends to. That if a person do a job, be the best they can be, so Iam. By cutting hair and putting S cure in pepole hair. Like the other day, when I was looking at TV the door bell rung, and my little brother answer it. It was three boys with some mast up hair comeing into my house. So I cut there hair, because they need it. And they were happy.
Violence in America is very bad. I saw a let of bad things in my life, once I saw a boy get shot at a fair where I lived at it was about three people got shot that night. One time I saw this man get beat so bad that he was crying blood.
Alexis Wallce has that look on her face, eyes blazing, mouth slightly open, and she's walking through the aisles between desks on one of her patented search-and-destroy missions. Weren't they listening at the very beginning of the semester when she told them that Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" was one of her all-time favorites? Did they think she was joking? If they did, they won't be laughing now. And she knows who the slackers are. She knows who read Act I last night and who did not, who is for real and who thinks they can fake their way through a question by pleading that it was too hard to understand and, Come on, Mrs. Wallace, how were we supposed to figure out all that crazy language, "thou" this and "yore" that? Why do they think she gave the quiz at the beginning of class, and why do they think she immediately graded it and then read the scores aloud, one by one, in a very, very loud voice. "Fifty!" "Twenty!" "Fifty!"
"I did not say your scores to embarrass you. I said your scores to motivate you."
And now she is off through the classroom, and no one is safe, not even the girl at the back who has taken her pacifier out of its little plastic holder and is fervently sucking on it. "I want to make sure that you're getting it," she says almost sweetly. "There is no shame. We're all learning." Her students in the class, sophomores in a college preparatory curriculum, aren't falling for it, and one thing is for sure: none of the students have their heads resting on their desks so they can take a little nap. In some classes you can do that and no one messes with you. But not in Mrs. Wallace's class.
She finds her primary victim. It is Keith. She reads a passage from "Julius Caesar," Act I, Scene II: "Why, there was a crown offered him: and being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting."
She asks Keith to explain. He says nothing. She repeats the passage, her voice even louder, so that pretty much everyone on all three floors of the school can hear it. He tries to say he doesn't understand it, but she cuts him off midsentence. She won't tolerate that excuse, because she knows what he can do when he does the homework, reads the study guides and adheres to the New Year's resolution that Wallace set for the class at the beginning of the semester: Positive Mental Attitude, P.M.A.
"You're not an imbecile. You're supposed to have an I.Q. over 10!"
She reads another passage, and once again there is the same silence.
"Are you trying? Are you trying? No!"
He still pleads ignorance, but it doesn't register. After all, he failed the quiz miserably, and that tells her it isn't a matter of aptitude but a matter of motivation and self-confidence.
"I am trying to open up the passage between the two ears," she says. She eases off after that, the fire and brimstone replaced with a familial warmth, and after class, students rush up to her calling her "Mother," and she calls them "Baby." Ten years from now, few of the students in this class may remember a line of "Julius Caesar." But she is pretty sure none of them will forget the experience of having been taught it. Her teaching philosophy derives from something Frederick Douglass once said: "If nothing is expected of a man, he finds that expectation hard to contradict."
"We have some teachers who say these kids can't learn and don't know this and don't know that," says Wallace. "I think some teachers use as an excuse, 'This is Proviso,' and they don't have to perform."
When Eric Eversley was hired as the first black Superintendent of District 209 in 1992, he found a similar atmosphere: "There was sort of a culture here, sort of a feeling that we tried everything and still our students are not successful." Eversley's arrival from the Cherry Creek School District in Englewood, Colo., where he had been a principal and administrator for 18 years, was greeted with euphoria. School board members and teachers fixated on his doctorate in education from Harvard: it seemed incredible to them, almost a miracle, that anyone from Harvard would ever take any interest in Proviso. Since those heady moments there has been disappointment among many faculty members. Part of that feeling stems from his remote managerial style. Much of it stems from what he expects of Proviso students. There is something painfully ironic about this, since Eversley is bitterly faulted not for expecting too little, but too much.
Among other measures, he instituted a policy requiring all students to take a minimum of three solid subjects -- like English, mathematics, science, social studies and a foreign language -- every semester. Graduation requirements have been increased. At best, his detractors say, these changes are cosmetic. At worst, they are implemented only so they can be written up one day in the Harvard Educational Review, impressive on paper and of no practical effect in the classroom.
Eversley himself, while sympathetic to the demands of teaching today, has grave concerns about the child who can get lost in the system when teachers focus on all that a student cannot do; that's not something he learned at Harvard. When he met with the faculty and staff of the two high schools for the first time, he told them what it was like to grow up with an alcoholic father who beat him. He also told them what happened to him in high school and how he learned that the difference between success and failure is not the canyon so many believe it to be but a crevice, and that a childcan be motivated to cross it by something as simple as a tap on the shoulder.
Eversley said he would never forget the counselor at Central High School in Minneapolis who told him that he should just go find a job somewhere, something to keep him out of trouble. It wasn't hard to figure out what the counselor was really telling him: he would never amount to anything. But he also told them about his English teacher, Mrs. Grosz, who yanked him out of typing class his senior year and made him sign up for advanced English instead. "This Superintendent believes that the road from where one is to where one can be is transferable," Eversley told the faculty and staff that day in August. "This Superintendent believes that every student can learn virtually everything we have to teach."
Precisely by saying that, Eversley alienated many in the room, people hoping to hear the opposite. To his detractors, the personal story of Eric Eversley does carry a distinct message: it is unique to Eric Eversley. What good, they ask, is increasing graduation requirements if students are unable to do what is required of them now? What good is elimination of tracking if it means pairing students who want to read Plato and Camus with students who say they can't read because reading makes them fall asleep? What do you do about the student who is flunking a course, knows that he can do better, promises to do better and still flunks? These critics cite the fact that more than 40 percent of the students at both high schools had at least one nonpassing grade last semester. That high failure rate doesn't mean the schooling is too difficult; what it really means, and what is much more disturbing, is that many students see little point in succeeding in school because success in school has no relevance.
"Schools are about hope and the future," says Stephen Bogaerts, a Proviso East English teacher who advocates a complete restructuring of the school. "But if you don't have a hope, and you don't believe in the future, schools are oddly anachronistic. That's why students are not intimidated by failure. If they fail, it's too bad. Failure is the same as success."
Wallace has heard all the arguments over relevance. She knows the failure rate is high, and she knows there are some students who see school as little more than a distraction. But she also knows there are many more who can be reached if a teacher takes the time and feels the passion to reach them.
The day after the debacle of "Julius Caesar," Act I, Wallace gives a quiz on Act II. The failure rate is high again, and she is not pleased, not pleased at all. Her mouth is pursed, as if she just tasted something sour, and she isn't interested in excuses, not interested in who had to do what after school. When the bell rings and students gather up their books, Wallace's eyes get that heat-seeking glare.
"Sit down! This is my time. I'm talking!"
There will be a quiz on Act III. The scores will be read aloud so everyone knows exactly where they stand. And those who fail. . . .
"Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Anyone who doesn't pass the test has an after-school appointment! Let your parents know!"
"O.K., the day of reckoning is here," she says the next day as she begins to read the results, somber and quiet, as if it's really her own day of reckoning. "Seventy." "Eighty." "One hundred." "Eighty." "Eighty." "Ninety." "Ninety." All but one of the students have passed. But Wallace still has something to say to the class, because she always has something to say to the class.
"Give yourselves a hand."
THE BRIGHTEST STUDENTS in the school are in a double-period honors course for juniors called American Studies. Entrance is based on strict academic requirements, and the reading list is an educator's dream. The racial makeup of the students in the course is almost the opposite of the makeup of the school. Of the 52 students, only 7 are black and 4 Latino.
Most of the other students appear to take comfort in the honors courses. They like the intellectual challenge and also seem to relish any situation at school in which they are in the majority. As one student put it, her process for picking senior-year elective courses has as much to do with racial makeup as it does with course content. The more blacks there are in a course, the less inclined she is to take it: "I'm thinking, 'A lot of blacks in this class, a lot of blacks in this class, a lot of blacks in this class. . . .' "
Six of the students in American Studies are eager to say how they feel about going to school here. They feel that what they have to say is crucial to understanding the school. They also feel that, as members of the school's white minority, they often go unheard. They are involved in extracurricular activities. They do well in school. They all want to go to college, and they all have ambitions to become lawyers and doctors and business executives. Most of them live in Westchester, where they saw almost no blacks and did not even have a single black teacher at their grammar schools.
As the six students begin to describe the school they seem a little like children attacking a pinata. "It's like going to hell here," says one. "I get pushed, and because I'm white I can't say anything because there's too many of 'em. I'll get my butt kicked."
"They think they can touch you, they think they can do anything to you."
"I cannot stand the race. I'll never date anyone who isn't white."
"They're always saying 'slave' this and 'slave' that. Sorry, I don't know a slave. I never owned a slave. I'm sick of them throwing it in our face."
When asked to describe a typical black, one of the students responds this way: "Ignorant, rude, loud."
"Ignorant and scum, a lot of poverty, self-righteous, you owe me that, you owe me this, gimme, gimme, gimme," says another.
One student brings up a scene in "2001: A Space Odyssey" when a group of apes goes out of control: "In a typical day in the hallways, that's what it looks like here." Others laugh and nod their heads approvingly. They think it's a good description. They like it.
Despite this atmosphere, they all agree that they have gotten a strong education at Proviso West. They also have a potential solution for fixing the school's problems: remove the predominantly black town of Bellwood from the school's attendance boundaries. Or, if that won't work, remove almost exclusively white Westchester from the attendance boundaries and let its students go someplace else. As they talk about it, it sounds almost like a liberation movement in an occupied territory. They sound just like their parents.
On another day, the seven blacks enrolled in American Studies file into an empty classroom to speak their minds. They, too, are honors students. They, too, plan to go to college. They, too, have ambitions to be lawyers and doctors and businessmen, and they all come from Bellwood, the place the white students would dump from the attendance boundaries. They say they are acutely aware of a double standard that exists for them among whites, the expectation that they can't do the work. At the beginning of the year it was made clear to the American Studies class that those who could not keep up would be asked to leave. That standard is one of the reasons the course is so good. "Everybody looked at us," says Charise Bennett. Four students were asked to leave during the school year, all of them white. And when a cheating scandal broke out, it was among white students.
When they talk about whites, it isn't with bitterness but with frustration, almost amusement. Of the seven, only one says that the experience of being at Proviso West has made her feel more prejudiced against whites. They laugh about the way whites insist on talking to them in what they think is "black dialect" -- the way they say "What's up" and "Hey, girl." They also laugh at the way whites, when they go on field trips, stare out the window of the bus and exclaim over graffiti, as if they had never seen it before. The whites strike them as being insulated and utterly unaware of the larger world outside their communities.
These black students also talk about the way other black students often treat them, about how they are accused of being "nerds" and "sellouts" because they are on the honors track. "Why are you in a class with all the white kids?" they are asked. "Why are you using a white man's book?" Steven Freeman Jr., the one black male in American Studies, gets such comments routinely. "They are shocked that a black male can read," he says. "They expect me to take the book and throw it in my locker." He described the following interplay between teacher and student as being typical:
"Excuse me, I'm just trying to wake you up so you can pay attention."
"Well, I'm going back to sleep because you ain't sayin' nothing."
Because of the expectations that many white (and black) students have of them, these seven students exist almost entirely in their own world. "We're not accepted by the white people because they think we're not smart enough," says Loura Banks. "We're not accepted by black people because they think we're too smart. So we just hang with each other."
But they continue to believe in the school, and they are committed to it, and so are many of their parents. Loura Banks's father, Leo, is a member of the school board. Charise Bennett's mother, Janice, is so involved in her daughter's education that teachers, if they believe in self-preservation, should just run when they see her, for as Janice Bennett puts it, "If something happens to my child, someone's in trouble."
Because of all the rumors of violence swirling around Proviso West, Janice Bennett sent her daughter to a parochial school her freshman year. But the atmosphere there, which included fights during chapel, wasn't what she expected from any school, much less one that was costing her $4,000 a year. So Charise went to Proviso West, where she has excelled, has been challenged and is said by some teachers to be the smartest student in the school. Her mother, a supervisor with AT&T nearby in Oak Brook, is aware that her daughter is perceived as being something of an anomaly at the school, but it doesn't bother her a whole lot as long as Charise continues to get a good education.
"She hasn't sold out to Whitey," says Janice Bennett. "She's sold out to her mama, who will kick her butt." Through her daughter, she is also aware of how many white students are disgruntled and want to leave. But she knows the survival of Proviso West depends on their staying, not because they're any smarter than her daughter, but because of the political and economic clout they carry. "If all the white children choose to leave," she says, "and it's just Hispanics and blacks, the quality of the school will go down."
Of the communities in the high-school district, Westchester is by far the wealthiest. The median home price, $127,200, is more than $50,000 higher than that of Bellwood. Only about 5 percent of Proviso West's students come from Westchester, but, because of its property values, Westchester accounts for about 18 percent of the district's tax base. This disparity does not sit well with many who live there, nor does the dwindling academic performance of the school, which is why Citizens United for Better Education was created with the goal of realigning Westchester with a high school in neighboring Lyons Township.
Lyons Township High School did perform better academically than Proviso West in several key areas, but the statistic that received the most attention had to do with racial breakdown. At the time de-annexation was being discussed, Proviso West was 27 percent white, Lyons Township 92 percent white. "They would call me and say, 'I don't want my white daughter to go to school with those blacks over there,' " recalls Robert Milano, the former principal of Proviso West. "But the minute they had their meetings, they said, 'Oh, no, it's not racial.' "
But David Ricordati, a Westchester village trustee, who spearheaded the movement, calls the charge of racism a convenient smoke screen for the rapid educational and social decline of the school: "For them to hang their hat on race, that's a very easy out." Because the issue of de-annexation is fraught with legal and procedural complications, it died without much progress. But Ricordati says he thinks negative feelings about Proviso West have only intensified among those who live in Westchester because "they think it's a lost cause, that it cannot be turned around."
Reluctantly, almost painfully, Al and Becky Lasky would probably agree. Unlike other Westchester citizens who rail against the school and criticize it, the Laskys have a different vantage point -- they actually sent their two daughters there because they felt it was important. They wanted to make a statement to Westchester residents, to say that there is a choice in Proviso West, a good choice. "I've had parochial school shoved down my throat all my life," says Becky Lasky. "We wanted our kids to be in a bigger environment. We were so excited about them being in a multicultural environment."
They joined the parent-teacher organization at the school, but the number of parents you could count on -- 30 to 40 out of a student population of more than 2,000 -- never increased. And it struck them, as it struck others, that despite newspaper notices and calls to students' homes, attendance at these meetings was about 80 percent white in a school that was 80 percent minority.
In 1991, they campaigned for a tax referendum to provide more revenue for the district's education fund. It was defeated. The Laskys and others couldn't help but realize that if all the parents from Bellwood whose children went to Proviso West had voted yes the referendum might well have passed.
Their daughters began to describe an atmosphere at school that didn't seem racially harmonious, but petty and almost totally segregated. "I had this feeling that blacks and whites and yellows and greens can all work together," says Becky Lasky. "I raised my kids with that philosophy. I found out that no matter how hard you try, you never got anywhere." As a result, Al and Becky Lasky are no longer on the board of the parent-teacher organization. When the next referendum comes around, it seems doubtful that they will campaign. Their youngest daughter, Kimberly, is a junior at Proviso West, and they are just waiting for her to graduate so that, as Al Lasky puts it, "We're done."
"We fought the war and we lost," he says. "That's how I feel. If we had to do it differently, I think we would."
Al Lasky insists that race has little to do with the problems of Proviso West. But Kim, sitting with him in their tidy living room, disagrees. "It's all about race," she says. That comment burns straight to the soul.
"You don't start out as racist," says Kim. "We're all racist now."
It's the end of another day at Proviso West, and for Dennis Bobbe, a social studies teacher, it's not a moment too soon. He came to the school in 1966 when it was at its apex, filled with those seemingly timeless shows of spirit, the pep rallies, the sock hops, the earnest debates over war and peace. Now, it's nobody's school, all the spirit sucked dry. He finds nothing remarkable about Proviso West at all, except, perhaps, for the pathos. "They're actively resisting learning," he says of his students. "They just don't want to learn. It's not fun. It's too much effort." He pauses, and then takes a turn inward.
"Maybe it's me."
He knows they're bored to tears. He knows what their ability to analyze or do something in-depth is. He knows what the pop culture effects of television and music are, "the bing-bang-boom," as he calls it.
"I can't compete."
He caters to them, minimizing the complexity of the material and the amount. He tries to be an entertainer, even though that contradicts his whole persona -- beard, soft voice, pudgy body. "Kids come in asking for a routine. A vaudeville show. Abbott and Costello. Who's on first?" He talks about United States history and he sees the glaze set in their eyes. He could lecture naked. He could lecture upside down. He could not lecture at all. Would they even notice? He's getting too old, too entrenched to grope for meaningful answers. "I am near the end of my career."
Yet he wonders what happened to the notion of the American public school as a sacred place, a vital place, a place unlike any other in the world. "What was it that peeled away? What was it that was lost?"
It is a gray, late-winter day as he teaches his seventh-period class. He has pulled down a map depicting the boundary changes in Europe during World War I. Over another blackboard hangs a pithy statement that reads, "Not Preparing! Is Preparing Not to Pass." As Bobbe talks about the war, he tries to engage everyone, including those who have their heads on their desks.
"Who is Herbert Hoover?" he asks.
"The vacuum guy?" asks one student.
"Overall, there were 10 million killed in the military in World War I," says Bobbe.
A girl yawns.
He tells them that Woodrow Wilson had once been the president of Princeton University.
"What do you mean, while he was President?" asks a student.
"No, before," says Bobbe.
He introduces Wilson's 14 points. He introduces some of the post-World War I European leaders: Clemenceau, Lloyd George.
"Boy George?" says a student.
"All right, we'll stop here. Monday, I won't be here. We'll have a movie."
The bell rings and the students shuffle out of class.
There are two narrow windows in Bobbe's classroom. From them you can see a thin line of students leaving the building. They walk past the drab wheat colors of the baseball field and the brown concrete of the football stadium. Some gather in clumps outside the tall metal gates of the school at the bus stop. Others walk past the mall, where so many stores are closed.
Maybe it's the way they seem so anonymous and swallowed up in their jackets, with those oversize hoods and long hemlines. Maybe it's just the grayness and chill of the ceaseless Midwestern winter. But from Bobbe's narrow windows, as they walk slowly away, for a moment, just a brief moment before they disappear, they look as if they have just finished a day shift at the factory instead of a day at school.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Proviso West was conceived during the suburban-boom-town days of the 1950's, when whites were leaving Chicago in droves.

(pg. 26-27); Bill Paterson, above, a social studies teacher, focuses on blacks as the cause of the school's decline. "I have run into a lot of problems now that I have a lot of black kids," he says. "They won't shut up." Some days he can barely face the class and relies on videos, right, to do the teaching for him. (pg. 28-29); Awvee Storey lives in predominantly black Bellwood. Some white students think redrawing the boundaries to exclude the neighborhood from the high-school district would solve the school's problems. Steve Freeman and Charise Bennett, two of the seven black honors students in American Studies, are conscious of the feeling that they are expected to fail. But the four students who couldn't keep up this year were white. Alexis Wallace is convinced that learning isn't a question of aptitude but of motivation and self-confidence. Her teaching philosophy derives from what Frederick Douglass once said: "If nothing is expected of a man, he finds that expectation hard to contradict."

Plans for Church Fund-Raising Festival Upset Neighbors

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN 

DATELINE: HOLMDEL

 BODY:
WHETHER a Greek Orthodox church fund-raising festival should take place has sent some strong ripples of discontent through this wealthiest of Monmouth County communities. The festival is expected to attract 8,000 to 10,000 people over three days to a quiet, hilly residential neighborhood overlooking the Garden State Parkway.
Dr. Henry D. Ferris Jr., a veterinarian and the Mayor of the 17.9-square-mile township, called the festival issue one more example of his rapidly changing suburban municipality's search for a defined identity. More new homes and more new residents, coupled with highway shopping centers and office buildings, have changed the landscape here forever. 
 But the almost 100 homeowners on the streets near the Kimisis Tis Theotokou (Assumption of the Virgin Mary) Greek Orthodox Church at 20 Hillcrest Road, near a main thoroughfare, South Beers Street, view it differently.
They say the 18-year-old festival, which is scheduled for Friday through next Sunday and will be held on the church grounds for the first time, will lower the property values on their $300,000 to $400,000 dwellings and bring with it noise, parking and public safety problems.
They say that the area cannot contain the cars and the crowds and that their peace and privacy will be violated. They appealed the zoning officer's festival approval to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The festival had previously been held at a Route 34 farm, at another nearby church and at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft.
 
Possibilty of Picketing
 "This is not why we came to Holmdel," said William N. Jarocki of Hillcrest Court, an Old Bridge industrial arts teacher who has lived in Holmdel since 1974 -- 14 years before the church opened its doors, when there was a battle over whether it should be constructed in a residential area. He is a leader in the drive to stop the festival. "We will picket and we will protest, if necessary," he added.
Clementine A. Foley, a banker, has lived on South Beers Street for 20 years with her husband, Timothy Foley, an auditor, and their three children. She said that because of the festival, they were canceling a college graduation party planned at home for their daughter. "The traffic and the noise would be too much for us," she said.
The church president, George Karatzia of Marlboro, said: "I cannot believe what I am hearing. In a world gone mad with violence and with hate, our church represents sanity and hope. What do they have against us? We want to practice our religion and preserve our heritage."
About 125 children attend Sunday school classes, he said. A Greek language school is held during the week for youngsters and adults.
Mr. Karatzia, the owner of gift shops in two New York hotels, said church members were "tired of being like gypsies in the night," moving the festival from place to place. The church was established in 1976 with 55 families ,and worship was conducted in several places, including a school, a hotel and other churches.
Today, there are 350 families and about 1,000 members, who live here and in nearby municipalities. Two of its more prominent members are Clay Constantinou of Colts Neck, a lawyer and the New Jersey finance chairman for the Clinton Presidential campaign, and Assemblyman Steven J. Corodemus of Atlantic Highlands, also a lawyer.
Meantime, the Township Committee became involved directly in the festival issue when it denied a church request to hang two banners advertising the event, including a large helium-filled balloon that would have floated over the parkway. So have the Zoning Board, the zoning officer, the police chief, the township administrator and many townspeople taking the side of the church or of the residents of the Hillcrest Road area.
There was also concern in the Greek community over an editorial page cartoon in the May 18 issue of The Middletown Independent, a weekly newspaper, that showed Hellenic dancers in native costume and a protester carrying a sign with the message "Beware of Greeks bearing festivals."
But such infighting has become almost a way of life over the last 15 years in this township, with its 13,356 residents and its median family income of almost $88,000, the highest in the county. Battles are being waged by those who want to halt any further development and those who believe there can be economic and environmental compromises. That has not stopped the building of million-dollar homes on the sites of the old corn and tomato fields and peach and apple orchards.
 
Growth and Problems
 "People move to Holmdel for the great schools and the ambiance," said Gary D. Aumiller, the Deputy Mayor and an AT&T Corporation engineer here. "But with the growth has come problems. It is sad to see such unhappiness over the Greek church festival. It should be a time for celebration. It's not the way it once was."
James P. Constantine, a Princeton-based planner and a municipal zoning expert, called the Holmdel festival matter a "classic example" of similar situations throughout the state.
Interestingly, he said, the problem in a residential area is not the church itself but the ancillary activities that take place there. "People seem to object to a church's business operations," he said.
Those who oppose the Holmdel festival say they are sorry now that they reluctantly gave their approval to construction of the $1.5 million Byzantine-style church and administrative building on five and a half acres in 1986.
The buildings have orange Spanish clay tile roofs that make them easily visible from the south side of the parkway between Exits 117 and 114. As a matter of fact, Mr. Karatzia said the church had recently received a $500 donation from a parkway motorist who said he gained "peace and satisfaction" from seeing the church during his daily commuting from Bergen County.
"They told us there would never be any festivals at the church," said Dr. Girolamo Pugliese, who lives directly across the street from the church. He is a general practitioner whose office has been in nearby Keyport for 33 years. "We took them at their word."
He complained that the church buildings had destroyed his view of the Raritan River and Raritan Bay to the north. "I am not against the church; I am against the festival," he said.
 
A 'Good Job' in Planning
 R. Bruce Phillips, who has been the Police Chief for 23 years, said he was "impressed with the excellent parking, security and safety plans" prepared by the festival officials.
"They have done a good job," he said, "and I don't think there will be any problems. The church and the festival are assets to our community." Chief Phillips said he would be at the festival personally for the three days to make certain all goes well.
Support came also from the Rev. William C. Anderson, pastor of St. Benedict's Catholic Church, where the festival had been held previously.
Gregory Ploussas, a local resident and a professional engineer in Laurence Harbor, is the festival's treasurer. He said the church hopes to net about $40,000 from the event. It will help to financea $900,000 community center now under construction, he said.
Two tents will be set up for festival activities. There will be Greek food and pastries prepared by church members as well as authentic folk dancing and boutiques. Also planned are church tours by the Rev. George H. Dounelis, the pastor, who has been here 14 years. Hours of the festival are 5 P.M. to midnight Friday, noon to midnight Saturday and noon to 8 P.M. next Sunday.
Previous festivals have drawn thousands of people, and the church estimates that 8,000 to 10,000 people could attend this one.
"Every single one of our church members will be working to make this festival a success," said Theodore Countouroudas of Holmdel, the festival chairman and a building contractor. He predicted there would be support for the Holmdel festival from the 22 other Greek Orthodox churches in New Jersey. "We like to help each other out," he said.

Some neighbors, like Dr. Girolamo Pugliese, left, oppose the site of the festival. "They told us there would never be any festivals at the church," he said.

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE first time I had any symptoms, I thought it was dysentery caused by food poisoning," said Paul A. Gangi, a product manager at Prodigy, an on-line computer service in White Plains.
"The next time," Mr. Gangi continued, "the attack was much worse, and I went to my family doctor who treated it as a stomach virus and put me on antibiotics. But I kept getting worse and losing weight. Finally, after many false starts, in 1989 I was diagnosed by Dr. Burton Korelitz, a specialist in the field, as having Crohn's disease." 
 Crohn's disease, Mr. Gangi said, is painful and incurable, a disease that inflames the small and large intestines, causing diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bowel obstruction and other complications. Not only is its cause unknown but also there is no cure.
"It is a very nonglamorous disease, not something you want to talk about," he said adding that there are an estimated two million Americans afflicted with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis -- collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease because the symptoms and complications are similar. Each year in the United States 30,000 new cases are diagnosed, an average of 82 a day or 3.5 an hour.
 
'Very Isolated and Alone'
 "Anyone can develop it, but adults between the ages of 20 and 40 are most susceptible," said Mr. Gangi, who is 32 and developed the first signs of the disease when he was 24. "Ten percent of the sufferers are kids under 18, and for them it can mean their growth is delayed and they develop other serious problems.
"In my case it came out of the blue, because I have always been very athletic -- I played football in high school and college -- and healthy. I found it very hard to understand what was happening, and I began to search for information at libraries and through computer networks. But I was not able to find much out there. I started to feel very isolated and alone."
The low point came, he said, when he was on a business trip. "I was suddenly seized with unbearable pain that later was diagnosed as being caused by an internal abscess brought on by the disease," he said. "My weight had dropped from 160 to 120 pounds. One of the symptoms of the disease is that you can't retain nutrients or calories. Food goes right through you.
"I was put in the hospital, and just at that time my wife was four months pregnant with our twins. I'd say I felt the future looked very bleak. But thankfully I was treated successfully with massive doses of antibiotics and medications, and my condition stabilized. I'm feeling pretty good now. I'm on an immune-suppressant medication, which follows one school of thought that Crohn's is linked to an overactive immune system. But I have to go for a white blood cell count every week so that my immune system isn't too suppressed."
 
Combining Forces
 Mr. Gangi said he found it very difficult to cope with the disease alone until a friend put him in touch with a chapter of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, a nonprofit research-oriented volunteer health organization with 70 chapters nationwide. "They had the educational and supportive services that helped me, and I was so grateful for them that I began to think of ways that we could share the information with other sufferers."
Although at the time the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation was listed as a medical topic on the Prodigy bulletin board, Mr. Gangi felt an expanded nationwide educational program would be helpful. "Well, I was working at Prodigy, and it just seemed a natural fix, so I presented the ideas to my bosses and they agreed to meet with Terry Jennings and others at the foundation to discuss the possibility of combining forces to create an educational network for people who are suffering from the disease. But first they had to be convinced that the forum would be profitable for Prodigy."
Eighteen months ago the Crohn's and Colitis Forum was begun as a new Prodigy on-line information service. And from early indications, Mr. Gangi said, both Prodigy and the foundation are benefiting. The two other national on-line services, Compuserve and America on Line, have medical bulletin boards and some medical features, Mr. Gangi said, "but nothing as comprehensive on colitis as the Crohn's and Colitis Forum."
Mr. Gangi added: "The forum has attracted thousands of new Prodigy members who have enrolled in the service, and Prodigy pays the foundation a fee for every new member that comes to Prodigy from the foundation's promotion plus a proportion of fees we collect from Prodigy members using the forum."
 
A National Round Table
 Prodigy, he emphasized, can be described as the pipeline, the conduit, but the information that goes into it for the forum is managed by the foundation.
Members using the Prodigy service pay $14.95 a month for the service, which includes two hours of the forum and hundreds of other features, like money management, travel and entertainment, shopping services and bulletin boards. Additional forum time costs $3.60 an hour.
Mr. Gangi demonstrated the forum by turning on a screen connecting him to a network of people nationwide who were discussing ways of coping with and sharing tips on how to live with the chronic disease.
"It is like having a national round table of people who have the same interests as yourself," he said. "It's a terrific support system. I use it often myself, and I know I have received a lot of information from others."
One of the forum's important features is its library, a database of the latest information on diagnostic testing, medications, surgery and diet. In addition, there is on-line communication with doctors, who answer questions from Prodigy users. And users can obtain information on advances in health care, foundation activities, research initiatives and recommended books.
Ellen L. Ochs, who lives in Larchmont, is president of the Fairfield/ Westchester chapter of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation.
 
'No Idea of the Suffering'
 "Our goal is to raise as many funds as we can for research to find the cause and the cure of this really horrible illness," she said. "Because it's not a socially acceptable disease but one that's unpleasant to discuss, people really have no idea of the suffering and chronic debilitating side effects it extracts from its victims. Imagine, if you will, having a bad stomach virus or a bad case of dysentery on and off for the rest of your life, and you have a pretty good idea of a simplified version of Crohn's disease."
Treatment of children, she said, is especially difficult.
"Because so many nutrients and calories are lost in the course of the disease, children who suffer from it are likely to be undersized in their development and in the worst scenario can literally starve to death if nutrients are not replaced," she said. "And the nutrients have to be delivered internally via a spaghetti-like tube, which is inserted in the child's chest. It requires cooperation from every member of the family, and it is not an easy thing to deal with it. It places an economic and social burden on the young patients and their families.
 
No Shortage of Theories
 "It's an unpredictable disease. Some patients recover after one attack; others are hospitalized or need surgery. And as for the theories that cause it, there is no shortage of them. Everything from genetics to environment. It is baffling, as studies made of identical twins will show one twin getting the disease and the other completely free from it."
Seventy-seven cents of every dollar the foundation spends, Mrs. Ochs said, goes into research and educational programs. "We hope some day researchers will find the cause and the cure," she added.

HEADLINE: SOAPBOX;
Riverboat Gambling on the Hudson

BYLINE: By KENNETH M. COUGHLIN; Herbert E. Berman, a Democratic from Canarsie, is the chairman of the City Council Finance Committee.

 BODY:
THE date was May 4, and the topic under discussion at a public hearing in City Hall was this: Should there be riverboat gambling in New York City? According to a proposal put forward by the City Council Finance Committee, six riverboats would create as many as 10,000 new jobs and would add at least $300 million a year to city and state coffers.
One of the speakers was Bernard Goldstein, a pioneer of the riverboat casino industry along the Mississippi River. "I can't think of any place better than New York City for a riverboat," he said. "Whatever the revenues are on the Mississippi, just add a few more zeroes." 
 Riverboat casinos are cropping up all over the country. By the end of the year, Mississippi alone will harbor 40 of them. The riverboat share of the casino market went from 3 percent in 1992 to 13 percent last year.
Any other industry that was riding a national wave of popularity and promised New York such rich rewards would be immediately welcomed and showered with incentives and tax abatements. But a plan to introduce riverboat gambling is greeted with expressions of horror and dismay -- and bombarded by a series of criticisms that actually make no sense.
Our proposal called for starting with six boats, each of which would carry 3,500 passengers along with about 1,100 slot machines and 55 gaming tables. The boats would make regular cruises on the Hudson and other New York waterways -- they would not be permanently docked. Any company receiving a license would be expected to pay for major improvements to the boat's dock area.
We recommended that the city charge an admission fee of at least $3 a person.
City and state would share 25 percent of the company's daily win, worth about $150 million a year to each, and both city and state would reap additional hundreds of millions of dollars in indirect revenues -- from employee taxes and from the businesses that would benefit from the thousands of new tourists the boats would attract.
Why, then, is the city so reluctant?
* Some New Yorkers take an ostrich-like approach, opposing legalized gambling as morally wrong and a particular burden on the poor. It's as though they didn't notice that we have had off-track betting parlors and a state lottery for more than two decades and nonlegalized sports betting in every office in the city.
Even more to the point, New Yorkers are already gambling in casinos -- in Atlantic City and in the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. According to a recent study, 10 million New Yorkers visit Atlantic City every year. And every year casino gamblers in the New York metropolitan area contribute $1 billion to the economies of New Jersey and Connecticut.
* Critics of legalized gambling in the city contend that revenue from casinos would not be "new" money but rather money that would otherwise have been spent on goods and services. Certainly whatever share we regained of that $1 billion spent in our neighboring states would be "new." So would the revenues from those visitors attracted to New York because of its riverboat casinos.
* Opponents say that all legalized gambling did for Atlantic City was to turn it into a crime-ridden slum, and that New York would suffer a similar fate. In fact, Atlantic City's problems are the result of poor management, years of corruption and the insane notion that 12 casinos would turn a depressed area into an economically vibrant community.
We have no such dreams about the impact of riverboat casinos in a metropolis the size of New York; even revenues of $300 million or more a year, though surely important, would have limited impact on a $32 billion budget.
And the notion that the riverboats would be taken over by the criminal element, particularly organized crime, is not borne out by the experience of riverboat operators in other states.
Illinois police officials, for example, report success in keeping crime out with a variety of aggressive policing techniques ranging from an intensive investigation and monitoring of the licensing process to quarterly audits of casino operations. It is also easier to control the environment of a casino out on the water than one on land.
Riverboat casinos would create thousands of new jobs, provide many millions of dollars for city services and spur the development of the city's waterfront. Stringent guidelines and careful strategic planning can get the job done right. It's time to forget about the nay-sayers.

HEADLINE: The Titans of Tint Make Their Picks

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS; Deborah L. Jacobs, an independent journalist based in New York, specializes in legal and business topics.

 BODY:
THE titans of tint came to town this month.
Dressed in hues they describe as firethorn, cornmeal and purple haze -- or just in suits of plain old gray flannel -- the men and women of the Color Marketing Group gathered at a New York hotel for their spring ritual of secret caucuses and swatch exchanges. Their mission: to determine which colors will be big sellers on the nation's clothing racks, showroom floors and supermarket shelves the next two years. 
 The group, based in Alexandria, Va., is a powerful trade association whose 1,400 members include in-house color marketers at Fortune 500 companies as well as color consultants who charge tens of thousands of dollars for a two-week assignment. But the group is just one part, albeit a highly organized one, of an elite industry of colorists. Their job is to help steer multimillion-dollar marketing decisions using colors and their psychological undertones. Specific goals range from building corporate images to improving sales.
The marketers say they forecast the popularity of colors rather than force their choices upon a helpless public. But just try to find a pink this year that isn't peachy. And good luck getting away from green -- and a weathered brick color called Smithsonian, named last year at a Color Marketing Group meeting in Washington, which also seems to be everywhere.
The 15 new colors identified in workshops during the Color Marketing Group's latest meeting will start to appear next year and, the group predicts, will flourish in 1996. Announced with fanfare at the close of the three-day gathering, the new colors include three shades of gray -- wet gray (like the sky on a cloudy day), highway (reminiscent of the interstate) and purple veil (lavender-tinted) -- and yellowy greens named plantain (like an unripe banana) and winter moss (evergreen with a yellow tinge).
Does this mean yet more of the earth tones that now permeate the stores? Yes, said Nada Napoletan Rutka, a color consultant in Pittsburgh who is president of the Color Marketing Group. During the affluent 1980's, colors in the marketplace were considerably brighter and changed quickly as conspicuous consumers snatched up new hues, said Ms. Rutka, who attended the recent Color Marketing Group meeting dressed in a suit of "purple passion" (or was it "plummet?").
Given today's economic uncertainties, consumers spend more cautiously and look for colors that don't shift drastically each year, she said. Concern about the environment is another influence on current and future palettes.
Using information gleaned at past Color Marketing Group meetings, Reebok International has toned down the trim of its sneakers, phasing out the bright reds, oranges and yellows of the 1980's, said Pamela Boucher, a trend and color forecaster at the company, which is based in Stoughton, Mass. To match the back-to-nature colors that people are wearing from the ankles up, the company is also offering shoes of "blackened green," Ms. Boucher said.
Color Marketing Group palettes are not models for exact imitation, in-house color advisers say. "Those colors are just directions," said Linda Trent, director of the color and design marketing department at the Sherwin-Williams Company, the Cleveland paint manufacturer. The company relies on them "to develop paint colors that are going to be responded to positively in the marketplace."
Still, industries that are tightly linked will strive to coordinate their palettes, so that car manufacturers, for instance, can find exterior paint that matches the upholstery inside their latest models.
While color "plays a role in creating momentary appeal," color marketers also address more long-term goals, said Anita Hersh, president of Lister Butler Inc., a New York consulting firm in corporate and brand identity. When color is part of a brand's identity, it "needs to be selected with longevity in mind," she said.
Since 1987, for example, the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, in Toledo, Ohio, has owned a trademark on the pink used in its insulation.
THEN there is the case of Best Western International Inc. As part of a continuing $1.3 billion effort to upgrade the quality of its hotels, Best Western considered the effect of color on the company's image. Among the conclusions of its two-year research effort: people associated the stark colors of the company's logo -- a bright yellow and black emblem -- with budget hotels, fast-food chains and convenience stores. The old signs were "telling the customer that we were lower quality than we really were," said William S. Watson, senior vice president for worldwide marketing at the Phoenix-based company. The new logo features refined golden letters against a deep blue background.
Fiskars Inc., which introduced its popular orange-handled scissors in the late 1960's, has stuck with the color in succeeding decades. Since the scissors were initially designed for industrial use, the company chose "safety orange" to make them visible in factories. During the decades since then, Fiskars had become "so synonymous with orange" that it hasn't made sense to change, said Sandra Cashman, a spokeswoman for the Wausau, Wis., company.
Fiskars' strategy defies the popular assumption that orange -- along with chartreuse and sulfur -- is one of the colors people most dislike. These are colors commonly associated with "bodily functions," said Leatrice Eiseman, a color consultant in Seabek, Wash., who has studied the psychology of color.
Blue is still America's favorite color, Ms. Eiseman said. And the current popularity of soft, pastel shades reflects the quest for calm during volatile social and economic times.
But color consultants caution against looking for a "magic bullet" to bolster sales. "Everyone has an opinion about what color means," Ms. Hersh said.
Indeed, the willingness of consumers to try new colors varies. The Cooper Marketing Group, a research company in Oak Park, Ill., has surveyed consumers the last several years and divided them into three color personalities. [See chart.]
Such studies suggest that marketers should keep their customers in mind when choosing palettes. Lands' End Inc., for instance, knows that many of its customers prefer brighter colors, rather than the dusty shades that now seem popular, said Andrea Sapon, a manager in the brand integrity group of the mail-order clothing company. The company has recently added some terra-cotta clothing, but kept the old standby reds and blues that its audience expects.
Color is more than an abstract preference for some consumers. "People who are fair skinned with dark hair don't look good in the new colors," said Lori Solinger, a television journalist in Providence, R.I., who reports on health and fitness. Limited by the options on a recent shopping trip, Ms. Solinger came home with a jacket of pale yellowy-green -- a shade color marketers might describe as "romaine" or "green tea." When Ms. Solinger wore the jacket to work, colleagues asked her whether she was feeling ill. She has since relegated the item to the back of her closet.
"Stores will lose revenues from people who cannot wear those colors," Ms. Solinger said. "Designers and forecasters are totally shutting them out."
Marketers say the new palettes offer something for everyone, but acknowledge that if the goods don't sell, the consequences will be costly.
Color is "like a seed," said James King, a researcher at DuPont Automotive in Troy, Mich., one of the largest producers of top-coat paint for cars. "It has to fall on receptive ground."
 
How They Choose the Colors of the Future
 MOST of the decisions by the Color Marketing Group are made in secret caucuses at the association's meetings, which are held in the spring to consider consumer colors and in the fall for industrial colors.
In advance of the meetings, participants mail in assessments of trends they perceive, along with color samples. Past submissions have included leaves, pieces of yarn, photos clipped from magazines and even an onion skin, said Nada Napoletan Rutka, president of the group.
Using such materials as a starting point, participants in the meetings divide into workshops to negotiate color directions. Each workshop then sends a representative to a final round of discussions from which the marketing group's palette of new colors emerges. These are the hues that the group formally predicts will be popular two years down the line.
People who go to the marketing group meetings (nearly 650 attended the most recent one) can also take away samples of colors developed during the previous year. To do that, they help themselves to snippings from giant spools of yarn.
During this month's meeting, Janice E. Rybinski, a manager for the 3M Company in Southfield, Mich., collected yarn in espresso, craft and manatee -- various shades of brown. "The public has to get used to these colors before they'll buy a $20,000 car," said Ms. Rybinski, who helps design the graphics used to sell cars.
Paper reproductions of the new palette will be available to Color Marketing Group members several months from now. The six-inch by two-inch packet fans out into samples of the 15 colors that were just picked as well as colors chosen at meetings during the last two years.
Nonmembers can buy the set of samples for $7,000. Why so expensive? "If you consider how many people have input into it," Ms. Rutka said, "$7,000 is cheap."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Noises Off at the Venerable Actors Studio

BYLINE: By WENDY SMITH; Wendy Smith is the author of "Real Life Drama: The
Group Theater and America, 1931-1940."

 BODY:
MENTION THE ACTORS studio, and the image is usually immediate: a shabby rehearsal room crammed with folding chairs in which the small and intense Lee Strasberg is guiding Robert De Niro or Ellen Burstyn or Al Pacino through a Method acting exercise that packs enough energy to blow a few fuses.
 But that is theatrical history. Strasberg died 12 years ago. Since that time, his baby, the Studio, has had to make its way in the world with an often contentious group of surrogate parents hovering around it. 
Patty Ewald, the Studio's executive director, sees the most recent controversy as instigated by "a group of old-timers who want to bomb the place and take it back to ground zero." But Rob Barron, who became a member in 1988 (like all Studio members, he was invited to join and pays no fees), said, "It doesn't matter who raised these questions or if Strasberg telegrammed us from the dead; the point is what the issues are."
 They are familiar at many nonprofit institutions, particularly those struggling to reinvent themselves after the demise of a strong leader. In the Studio's case, a major question involves its tradition as an almost cultish place in midtown Manhattan that imparts to a chosen few a special theatrical style. Must it grow beyond this to survive? If so, how does it change from a personalized shoestring operation to a formal program with a budget and steady income?
 An announcement last month that the Studio and the New School for Social Research are establishing a joint master of fine arts program seemed to answer the latter question, at least. Under this plan, the once-secretive Studio, founded in 1947 by Cheryl Crawford, Robert Lewis and Elia Kazan as a training ground for professional actors, will now impart to beginners the techniques developed by Strasberg and other acting teachers influenced by the Russian director Konstantin Stanislavsky.
 But further answers are not so easy for the dozen or so members of the executive committee that administers the Studio with its artistic director, Frank Corsaro (widely known as an innovative director of operas). And the last nine months are the proof.
 While negotiating with the New School, the executive commitee discovered that long-unresolved issues about the Studio's artistic goals and administration had flared into open debate. They became public when a letter from a disgruntled member turned up in the mailboxes of the general Studio membership (about 900 people), several journalists and various New School officials.
 The dispute centers on the efforts of the 69-year-old Mr. Corsaro -- backed by a majority of the executive committee and Ms. Ewald, the executive director -- to make the Studio less cloistered and to refashion it into a more dynamic, even businesslike organization.
 Since 1988, when Mr. Corsaro became its artistic director at the urging of Paul Newman, its president, the Actors Studio has added more than 100 new members, opened up its famous "sessions" to diverse stylistic approaches, presented workshop productions for invited audiences of nonmembers and revived -- at least tentatively -- the dream of a full-fledged Actors Studio Theater.
 These expanded ambitions have required money, as did the decision to professionalize the Studio administration by paying salaries to a few staff members, including Mr. Corsaro and Ms. Ewald, who each receive $75,000 annually. (The cash crunch became so acute in November 1993, however, that both Mr. Corsaro and Ms. Ewald deferred their salaries.) But the costs of these changes were not immediately felt because for several years Mr. Newman covered most expenses.
 Eventually, though, Mr. Newman, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and the executive committee agreed that the organization had to become more self-sufficient. In the early 1990's, the Studio found itself with a vastly expanded budget -- $450,000 this year -- that was no longer being provided by one source. The onerous task of raising funds, everyone agrees, now eats up too much of the executive committee's time.
 The Studio, in short, is a different institution from the one presided over by Lee Strasberg from 1951 until his death. Then it was a shrine to a single technique: the famous Method that Strasberg distilled from his understanding of Stanislavsky's teachings, an emotionally charged acting style made famous in the film and theater performances of such Studio members as Ms. Burstyn, Mr. De Niro, Mr. Newman, Mr. Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Harvey Keitel, Kim Stanley and Eli Wallach.
 Strasberg ran the organization virtually by fiat and did not draw a salary; there was hardly any administration, and most jobs were handled by unpaid volunteers. The Studio existed to enable its members to experiment and explore through scene work, called sessions in Studio terminology, that was commented on by Strasberg and their peers.
 To a vocal minority whose most outspoken advocate, the actress Vivian Nathan, is an executive committee member, that is the way the Studio should remain. While Mr. Corsaro insists that "the organization must move forward or die," Ms. Nathan retorts that the "business can be run as simply or as complicatedly as we make it." In a "statement of conscience" delivered to the executive committee last September, she bemoaned what she called declining artistic standards at the Studio and said a swollen administration was consuming its funds.
 By the time a general membership meeting was held in New York in January, Ms. Nathan's statement (and an equally disgruntled letter from members of the Studio's Los Angeles branch) had been widely disseminated. The tumultuous meeting, described by an observer as "one of the best pieces of live theater we've had in years," revealed that finances and administration have become flashpoints for a wider unease about the Studio's direction and administration.
 Jacqueline Knapp, who organized a celebrity auction for the Studio last September that netted about $160,000, was one of several members distressed by the news that the money had been spent. "Evidently, the Studio's budget is very high," she said, "which concerns a lot of people. How many benefits can you do to keep the Studio growing?"
 That's where the New School comes in. On April 6, the New School and the Studio announced that this fall (pending approval by the New York State Department of Education) they would begin a three-year master of fine arts program in theater arts, administered by and offered at the New School but with a curriculum created and taught by Studio members. Selected students will be permitted to attend Tuesday and Friday sessions at the Studio, which is still in its original home, a former church on West 44th Street.
 Executive committee members, like the director Arthur Penn, are frank about the economic imperatives behind the New School program. Without it, he says, "the Actors Studio is, I'm afraid, struggling in a fairly terminal illness. The financial handwriting is on the wall; to succeed and survive, smaller cultural organizations have to affiliate."
 Those who support the teaching idea hope it will give the Studio a higher profile. "I think that finally the Studio will become a community asset," Mr. Corsaro said. James Lipton, an executive committee member and the curriculum's principal creator, added: "Many of our members already teach, but they're often lone voices within their departments for the Studio's policy of dealing with all aspects of theater as a unified process with a guiding central methodology."
 The exact nature of that methodology, however, is not as clear as it was when the Studio was ruled by Strasberg's iron hand. The fierce debates of recent months suggest that the changes that have taken place since his death have created uncertainty about the Studio's -- and Mr. Corsaro's -- focus.
 At the heart of the Actors Studio stand the legendary Tuesday and Friday sessions. In Strasberg's day both were led by the artistic director; now the Tuesday sessions are run by a rotating roster of moderators that includes Ms. Burstyn, Ms. Nathan, Lee Grant and Estelle Parsons, while Mr. Corsaro moderates on Fridays. "Frank, being a director, has a viewpoint more toward finished performance," said Ms. Burstyn, who succeeded Strasberg as artistic director but resigned in 1988 to devote more time to her career. "The Tuesday moderator's focus is more on the acting instrument. It's like a violinist running scales and working on fingering on Tuesday, performing a whole piece on Friday."
 Purists regard Mr. Corsaro's acting sessions with suspicion, believing that the Studio's basic function as a place for actors to deepen their craft is abrogated when the emphasis is on producing polished work. Mr. Corsaro makes it clear that he wants the Studio work to evolve toward a finished product; his hope is to revive the Actors Studio Theater, which presented several professional productions in the early 1960's.
 "That is at the heart of what I'm trying to do," he said. "The whole Stanislavsky system evolved out of having a theater. It wasn't a hothouse bloom. Eventually, the educative and theatrical elements must be fused to keep the Studio in the public eye."
 THESE DAYS, THE FRIDAY sessions are attended by a noticeably younger group of members, who are undoubtedly more receptive to Mr. Corsaro's philosophy. They do not have the opportunities their elders did to perform regularly in the commercial theater. "People can't just train; they need a place to put their training," said Barry Primus, a director and West Coast member. "That's why today we have to supply not just the training but the theater itself."
 When Mr. Corsaro speaks about the need for such a theater, he can be eloquent. "We have a treasure in our work that we must not be afraid to make full use of," he said. "We should be the National Theater of the United States, not its best-kept secret." For his part, Mr. Corsaro is getting mixed reviews. Comments by a range of Studio members indicate that many feel he does not spend enough time at the Studio and that even when he is there his mind sometimes seems to be elsewhere.
 "I have great admiration for Frank," said one member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But it takes a lot to get him to pay attention." Another member said: "When I first came to the Studio I was very pro-Frank; I think he breathed a lot of life into the place. But if, in the middle of a session, somebody said, 'Hey, Frank, the Toronto Opera just called; they want you to go up there this afternoon and start directing "La Boheme," ' he would stop in mid-sentence and be out the door."
 Mr. Corsaro is aware of the criticisms: "When I made the agreement with the Actors Studio, I warned them that it was sprung on me rather suddenly and that I had contractual commitments; in opera you're booked several years ahead. However, I made sure that whatever opera I did was either in New York or at a time when I wasn't needed at the Studio. I have never on any occasion neglected my duties there."
 Contention is nothing new at the Actors Studio, where memories are long and the past weighs heavily on the present. Its leaders and members are aware that while the Method remains the most popularly known acting style in the world, the Studio is no longer the mecca it was, partly because its basic technique is available elsewhere.
 "I don't think the Studio means the same thing in the world today," says Michael Howard, one of many Strasberg-trained actors who now teach privately. "But it had to change; it was so much a matter of Lee's point of view. I think Frank is searching for a way to make the Studio viable and useful."
 The valuable thing, said Estelle Parsons, "is to have a place to do the work. It was never that someone was going to bring you a message from God."

HEADLINE: Pedestrian Safety Needs a Higher Priority

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. James Donald Wynne, an original member of the faculty of York College in Jamaica, Queens, was killed while crossing the busy boulevard that cuts through the York campus by a car with a suspended driver at the wheel (news article, May 19). His death was a tragedy, more so because the site was long known as dangerous. 
 By 1991, the New York City Department of Transportation had given the site an 83 rating, on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 as the most dangerous. The city's inspectors should then have inspected the site and recommended a traffic light, but with only five inspectors for the entire city -- as opposed to 25 in 1991 -- they still have not got around to it. With their current workload, they do not often visit sites with ratings lower than 90.
We would like to see a higher priority for pedestrian safety. Not only would lives be saved, but the economic vitality of New York would also benefit. We hope the city will inspect sites with a rating of 75 and higher, make sure there is adequate staff to follow through on recommendations by inspectors and install lights (or other appropriate safety measures) within two years of a first complaint.
It is odd, and troubling, that 2,200 intersections in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx will have their traffic signals replaced by new computerized signals to increase traffic flow at a cost of $5.8 million over four years, yet the city can manage to install only 60 lights a year for reasons of safety.
But, that much said, it should also be noted that pedestrians still have the legal right of way within crosswalks.

HEADLINE: Turnover in Congress Won't Match That of 1874

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree entirely with the substance of "Self-Limiting Terms in Congress" (editorial, May 16). Why impose mechanical term limits when retirements have swelled, and elections can give voters the last word? 
 But you include a piece of supposed fact that has been floating around the press for some little while -- that 183 incumbents lost their seats in 1874, following the "pay grab" of 1873, in which, as you state, "Congress voted to give itself a big pay raise and made it retroactive for two years."
The total membership of the House was then only 292, which would mean that some 63 percent of the total membership turned over. That kind of outcome lies at the extreme edge of legislative elections in any country or any time -- as, for example, the 1993 elections in Canada or 1994 in Italy. In no American case was turnover so large, not even 1854, when the explosive forces of the coming Civil War blew the party system apart.
Some may think this an exercise in pedantry, but one aspect of professional work in any field is to get rid of bad data when they appear. The number of incumbents actually defeated for re-election in 1874 was not 183, but 52: 51 Republicans, 1 Democrat.
For the Republicans, 1874 was the worst defeat in the party's 20-year history. George Templeton Strong, that prominent New Yorker of his day, observed in his diary that it was "the Waterloo or Sedan of the Republican Party," a rout. Strong's judgment about the causes of this defeat stressed (1) reaction to corruption and scandals in Washington; (2) economic slump, and (3) Southern fatigue with the excesses of Reconstruction. This is how subsequent historians have also viewed the matter.
Nowhere does Strong mention the pay grab as an issue, though it might have been subsumed under general public fed-upness with corruption and scandals in Washington. Strong's analysis, like that of his contemporaries and later historians, is cast in purely partisan terms. In those days, incumbency had zero effect on the outcome of Congressional elections. This effect remained negligible until the 1950's, when the party system began showing signs of unraveling.
In 1874, all incumbents of both parties contested only 153 of the 292 House seats, 30 fewer than the supposed number of those defeated. This share of seats contested by incumbents, little more than half the total, was typical for that period. There were no primaries then, so there's no way of getting a picture of how many incumbents might have been forced out for renomination by their party's convention because of the pay grab (or any other) issue. That the 1874 result was so typical implies there were few, if any, such cases.
Then as now, most of the time most of this turnover did not involve shifting of the seat from one party to another. Political Waterloos don't happen in just any election -- and 16
years more had to go by before the next major partisan upheaval.
Since the 1874 partisan turnover was abnormal for its era, the House that met in December 1875 had only 101 surviving incumbents, scarcely more than one-third of the total. Despite the accelerated retirement rates of 1992 and 1994, nothing of the sort seems conceivable in the wake of this year's election.
But none of this detracts from the valid argument you make on term limits.

HEADLINE: Tyranny of the Minority

BYLINE: By Arthur S. Flemming and Ray Marshall; Arthur S. Flemming, a Republican, is a former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Ray Marshall, a Democrat, is a former Secretary of Labor.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Many Americans think the primary cause of gridlock in Congress is the inability of a majority to agree on action. The real problem is more basic. In the Senate, majority rule is becoming the exception rather than the rule.
Week after week, we see as many as 59 of the 100 senators ready to act on legislation -- to pass or defeat it. But Senate rules permit a minority of 41 or fewer to filibuster -- to prevent the majority from voting at all. To stop a filibuster, 60 votes are needed. A minority -- sometimes one senator -- can demand ransom in exchange for providing the 60th vote; often, the price is either watered-down legislation or "pork." Today, once a filibuster is announced -- no speeches are necessary -- the Senate takes up other business until deals can be struck for the 60 votes. 
 The threat of a filibuster affects nearly every issue, forcing dilution and deal-making even before bills are introduced. On May 17, it led to the Government's giveaway sale of Nevada land containing gold worth $10 billion to a Canadian mining company for only $9,765.
This year in an 11-day period filibusters delayed or weakened the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act, National Competitiveness Act and the Goals 2000 education bill. In 1993, they blocked, delayed or altered majority action on the Brady gun control bill and bills dealing with jobs (economic stimulus), national service, voter registration, and environmental and campaign finance reforms.
The Framers wrote a Constitution that protected minorities in many ways, but they insisted on majority rule in Congress. As Alexander Hamilton explained in "The Federalist": "If the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority, the smaller number will overrule the greater. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good."
Even after senators discovered they could filibuster to circumvent the intent of the Constitution, most of them respected the distinction between opposing legislation and obstructing democracy, and reserved their filibusters for extraordinary matters.
Since 1990, senators have had to attempt to end filibusters 89 times -- an average of 22 times a year -- compared to fewer than one attempt a year from 1917 through 1967 and just over 10 a year from 1968 to 1989.
Today's filibuster epidemic means that in effect the Senate needs nearly as many votes to pass legislation (60) as it does to override a veto, enact a constitutional amendment or impeach a President (67).
Americans may differ over the details of health care reform, how to combat violence and protect the environment and strengthen families. But few differ on respect for that bedrock principle of democracy, majority rule.
As advisory committee members of Action, Not Gridlock!, a new nonpartisan organization concerned with effective democracy, we urge Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals to tell all senators to respect majority rule and to give the Senate back its right to vote.

HEADLINE: Searching Its Soul: The U.S. Catholic Church -- Second of four articles.;
Wellspring of Priests Dries Up, Changing Much of Parish Life

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOLEDO, Ohio

 BODY:
To a traditional Roman Catholic, Sunday at St. Mary of the Assumption parish would come as a shock.
The morning services are mostly run by Sister Virginia Welsh, who greets the worshipers, directs the choir and offers "reflections" in lieu of the sermon that under Vatican rules she is not allowed to preach. On hand to say the Mass itself is an elderly priest who divides his time between this parish and another. 
 Later, as Sister Welsh chats with the congregation, hatches plans for the parish school and presents prospective church members at a regional ceremony, she leaves no doubt that she is the parish leader, and a popular one.
Yet this is no renegade group: Sister Welsh, 45, was appointed to leadership of this struggling inner-city parish by the Toledo bishop. Today, even as theorists debate the future of the Roman Catholic Church, a deepening shortage of priests is already forcing a transformation of Catholic life in the United States, among other things handing vast new responsibilities to women.
The scarcity of priests, who for centuries have been the personification of Catholicism, is also confronting church leaders with a serious dilemma. Either the church must relax the centuries-old rules that limit priesthood to celibate men -- which the Vatican shows no sign of doing -- or it must accept a decline in regular access to the sacred rites that are the soul of the Catholic faith, but can be carried out only by the ordained.
"The Catholic Church cannot reproduce a celibate male clergy," said Richard A. Schoenherr, a sociologist and former priest at the University of Wisconsin who has documented the emerging shortage. "This is a major event in its history, with far-reaching consequences."
Between resignations of unhappy priests and a drastic drop in new recruits, the priesthood is aging and shrinking. Over the 30 years from 1975 to 2005, the number of priests in relation to Catholics in the United States is expected to fall by half, to one priest for every 2,200, leaving far too few to perform all their time-honored functions.
Already, more than 10 percent of the 20,000 parishes in the United States, mainly in rural and inner-city areas, do not have a resident pastor, instead sharing increasingly weary priests with other congregations. Many large parishes that once had several priests who not only said Mass but also ran the schools, visited the sick and worked with youth may now have just one or two aging priests, their customary duties increasingly filled by lay people if at all.
More than 300 parishes around the country, including St. Mary's in Toledo, are led by "pastoral administrators," most of them sisters, some of them married women or married men who increasingly are studying to become permanent deacons. These parish leaders perform nearly all the tasks once done by priests except for the rites that are the spiritual backbone of Catholicism, like absolving sin, anointing the sick and dying and especially celebrating the eucharist, the memorial of the Last Supper that according to church teaching makes Jesus truly present in the bread and wine at Mass.
In such parishes, the sacraments are usually performed by part-time or "circuit-rider" priests who lack the intimate ties to the community once so characteristic of parish life. Alternately, lay leaders lead communion services distributing bread already consecrated by a priest, a truncated ritual that lacks the spiritual meaning of a full Mass.
Many Catholics see the infusion of lay people into administrative and pastoral functions as invigorating. But the changes are altering the texture of Catholic life and raising new questions about the future of the church.
"It creates a strain," said the Rev. Philip J. Murnion, director of the National Pastoral Life Center in New York. "It's the Catholic style for there to be a connection between leading a parish in its general work and leading a parish in its worship."
A global phenomenon, the deepening scarcity of priests is also causing more Catholics to question the rules, set by the Vatican, that restrict ordination to celibate men. A majority of American priests and church members oppose the ban on marriage, surveys show, and even some bishops have publicly questioned the ban, which scholars argue is rooted more in tradition than religious doctrine. The priest shortage is also adding fuel to calls for ordaining women, a change also supported by a majority of Catholics.
But the Vatican has held fast, calling for prayer and stronger efforts to recruit celibate priests. And so the American church is improvising, experimenting with new roles for lay people and the more thinly spread priests alike, cautiously watching as parish life changes.
 
The Decline
The Workers Become Few
 The dwindling supply of priests reflects deep changes both inside and outside the church. The Second Vatican Council that ended in 1965, which affirmed that married people as well as the celibate could attain holiness, led to an unanticipated exodus of younger priests. Resignations, especially over the issue of celibacy, continue to plague the church.
More significantly, the supply of new recruits has drastically shrunk. Long gone are the days when good Catholic families expected to give a son to the priesthood: from 1966 to 1993 the number of students in seminaries, high school through graduate level, fell by 85 percent, to 6,244 from 42,767, according to data collected by Georgetown University. Graduate theology students, in the final stages of preparation for ordainment, fell to 3,416 from 8,325, and their average age rose as a higher proportion of men who had finished college and even worked in secular jobs decided to take vows.
The Rev. William Kubacki of the Toledo diocese, whose job is to find and nurture recruits, has worked strenuously to find just two or three candidates a year. The No. 1 constraint, he said, is the difficulty many men have today with the notion of such a permanent, total commitment; concern about celibacy is close behind. In addition, he said, far fewer parents than in the past actively encourage their sons to enter religious life. "To me it's a whole sense of values," he said.
Others say the lurid sex-abuse scandals of recent years must also be taking a toll. "People aren't going to encourage young men to become priests when it's got such a taint," Dr. Schoenherr said.
Church leaders are concerned about the quality as well as the quantity of the next generation of priests, who will face more daunting tasks than ever. Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at Catholic University, said seminaries were being forced to relax their admissions standards. He said he sensed a growing restlessness with the quality of leadership among younger priests, who are increasingly required to preside over large parishes and lay staffs.
"The job is tougher than it used to be and the expectations are higher than ever," he said. "The laity are educated people now, and they want inspiring, capable leadership."
 
The Changes
Women in Charge, Up to a Point
 The new face of Catholicism is visible in northern Ohio, in the traditional Catholic heartland. The diocese of Toledo includes 163 parishes, many of them in small towns and rural areas, serving 325,000 Catholics. Two hundred priests are active today, not enough to meet the needs, and the diocese already knows there will be 50 fewer in just six years.
Bishop James R. Hoffman says he is determined to keep parishes going whenever feasible, but doing so has required some creativity. Already, more than 30 parishes in the diocese are served by visiting priests. Another six, including St. Mary of the Assumption in Toledo, have full-time nonordained leaders like Sister Welsh. In the coming year, as 10 to 12 parishes lose priests to retirement, these new models will spread.
St. Mary's was once the thriving hub of a German community, with 800 people attending Sunday Mass. That population has largely moved to the suburbs, and the church now serves an ethnically mixed membership of about 600, with perhaps 220 attending each Sunday. For sacramental purposes, this and a nearby church, also run by a sister, share the Rev. James O'Reilly, a 67-year-old Jesuit who had previously worked in education and as a missionary.
"You see a crumbling of the structures we once had because of the shortage of priests," said Father O'Reilly, who praised Sister Welsh for her energetic leadership. "It's change or die."
Parish members say that while a few people were disturbed when Sister Welsh took over four years ago, most have been pleased. "I think we were ready for a change," said Ellen McComis, whose family has attended St. Mary's for five generations. Arthur and Ellen Jones, parishioners for 20 years who moved across town but still drive back to St. Mary's, were effusive in their praise. "She does a fine homily," Mr. Jones said.
Sister Welsh, who calls herself middle of the road on church traditions, knew early on that she wanted a religious life, attending a convent high school before joining the Franciscan order in Tiffin, Ohio. "I never dreamed I'd be leading a parish," she said; she had expected to end up teaching school. But as opportunities opened, she began doing pastoral work, obtained a master's degree in pastoral ministry from Loyola University in Chicago and, she believes, found her true calling.
"At this point we're able to meet the needs of the people pretty well," she said of St. Mary's unusual structure. Still, she can hardly conceal the frustrations caused by theological boundaries.
"The person leading the parish in every other way should preside at the great prayer on Sunday," she said. "But I can't."
She nurtures potential new members of the church, but she cannot preside over their baptism. She counsels members on their personal problems, but cannot absolve them in confession. When a member dies she counsels the family and may lead a funeral prayer, but she cannot perform full rites.
"We pastor the people, but the high point, the privileged point, is to be able to call the presence of Jesus among us through the eucharist," Sister Welsh said. "It's at that point that we have to step aside for someone else.
"The person who knows the community best is not the person leading the prayer."
 
The Threat
When Practical Dilutes Mystical
 Some Catholics welcome the emerging arrangements, arguing that they elicit more active and democratic participation in the church by its members. Ruth Wallace, a professor of sociology at Georgetown University who has studied parishes around the country run by women, said, "I came away thinking that I was looking at the Catholic Church of the future, and I was inspired by it."
But theologians worry about a diminishment of Catholicism as priests become less available, and as a gap opens between management of parish life and sacred functions. Communion services using previously consecrated bread, for example, while officially approved as a stopgap, lack the resonance of a full Mass because nonpriests cannot ceremonially recite the words of Christ as he broke bread and drank wine at the Last Supper ("This is my body. . . . This is my blood. . . .").
"You miss the sense of participation across time with the action of Christ at the Last Supper," Father Murnion said. "You miss the transformation of the elements into the presence of Christ among us."
Catholicism is not just about words and prayer, he noted, but also about a mystical physical bond with Christ. "The bread and wine, the water we pour, the oil we anoint people with -- these are the physical reality, how Christ works through people," he said. "It's a complicated symbolic thing that's lost. It's not rational."
To many Catholics, the threat to essential rites has become a powerful argument for allowing married men and women into the priesthood. If the church maintains current restrictions, said Dr. Schoenherr, who left the priesthood himself because of the marriage ban, a sacred experience "that is uniquely Catholic will be gradually leached out of the system." He predicts that over the coming decade or two the building tensions, theological and economic, will force the Vatican to relax the rules.
Others are less sure of that. Conservatives maintain that ordaining married men would be too drastic a departure from the tradition of the Roman church. And they argue that by tradition and also by Scripture, women cannot take on the priest's role as representative of Jesus at Mass.
But all agree that the decline in the priesthood is raising fundamental questions that must be confronted. "What is at stake is not just whether we'll have more priests, or women and married priests, but what is the mission for the priesthood," Father Murnion said. "I think we're struggling with what's the mission of the church at the end of the 20th century, and what is the priest's role in that."

HEADLINE: WEIGHING OPTIONS, U.S. AIDES ASSESS INVASION OF HAITI

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
United States intelligence officials have concluded that an American-led invasion to restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti would succeed easily. But they warn that it would not bring a quick end to the turmoil and violence that have swept the country, and that an international force to maintain order could be needed there for years.
The view, which represents a broad consensus among intelligence agencies and some of Father Aristide's staunchest supporters, comes as the Clinton Administration is struggling to develop a plan both to return the deposed President and to create conditions so he can govern peacefully. 
 While President Clinton is relying on economic sanctions to persuade Haiti's military leaders to leave, he has pointedly refused to rule out military force if sanctions fail.
Pentagon officials are confident that Haiti's minimally equipped 7,500-man armed forces could easily be swept aside. And a force of 650 marines -- the kind of force officials said might serve as an invasion vanguard -- was sent for training to Guantanamo Bay last week.
Whether Mr. Clinton uses diplomacy or force to return the Haitian President to power, he faces the difficult task of trying to rebuild Haiti's military and political institutions while avoiding an open-ended commitment of American troops. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of Somalia, Administration officials say Washington will not launch any military operation in Haiti without a firm plan for disengagement.
"The view of the intelligence community is unambiguous that restoring Aristide through military force would be a simple proposition, but withdrawing international forces quickly after that step would be extremely unlikely," a senior intelligence official said. Even in the case of a diplomatic solution, he said, "maintaining order represents a long-term proposition."
So far, the Administration's plan for keeping the peace in Haiti after Father Aristide's return is sketchy.
Senior Administration officials said Washington saw a need for a peacekeeping force of several thousand to help protect Father Aristide, retrain the Haitian military and keep order through December 1995, the end of Father Aristide's term.
But the United States and its allies have not yet agreed on the exact size and duties of the peacekeeping force, on the extent of the American role or how long the force would need to stay.
Since allies are being told that the peacekeeping force would be sent in after a diplomatic solution, it is unclear which countries, if any, would be willing to send troops if Father Aristide were returned through military action.
In addition, the United States and its allies are struggling to define some of the fundamental tasks they would face after Father Aristide's return.
At a recent meeting in Ottawa, for example, Defense Secretary William J. Perry told his Canadian counterpart that deep-seated opposition to Father Aristide extends into the lower ranks of the Haitian military. But the Canadians said the depth of the problem might not be so bad, suggesting more intelligence on the Haitian military might be needed.
Struggling to devise a way to turn the daunting task of maintaining security over to the Haitians, the two sides discussed a plan to train and equip Haitian expatriates from Montreal and New York to form the nucleus of a new Haitian police force.
"he problem is not getting in," one Pentagon-based general said. "It is getting out."
 
Restoring Aristide: An Urgent Situation
 In interviews and speeches in recent weeks, President Clinton and his top aides have described the situation in Haiti as a serious threat to American security, implying that Father Aristide, who was elected in December 1990 with two-thirds of the vote, needed to be restored to power in a matter of months. Mr. Clinton has cited the threat of a surge in refugees trying to come here, and has said Haiti is used as a staging area for drug shipments to the United States.
Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, said in an interview: "It is our intention to send a very clear signal to the military and police leadership in Port-au-Prince that this situation is urgent, and at the end of the day, they'e going to be gone, and that the end of the day is not that far off." To that end, the Administration has pushed for tougher and more rigorously enforced economic sanctions.
William H. Gray 3d, the Administration's new special envoy for Haiti, said it was far too soon to conclude that sanctions would not be effective since they had only recently been put into effect and the United States was pressing the Dominican Republic to seal its border with Haiti.
"The sanctions are at a level totally different than in the past," Mr. Gray said. "What we've really got to do is restore democracy. Along with that, we have to insure that the military and police are compatible with democratic values. And we've got to bring economic growth and the prospect of hope. All three have to be done together."
But top Bush Administration officials contend that the economic sanctions will backfire by raising the general level of misery in Haiti, the poorest county in the hemisphere, unleashing a new flood of refugees and putting pressure on the Administration to take military action.
Even some Administration officials are skeptical that sanctions will work in the months that Washington seems to have alloted for the military rulers to be removed.
"We have less of a chance of achieving a negotiated outcome than at any time since Aristide was overthrown," said a State Department official. "It's by a process of subtraction that we're getting to the military option."
By this view, a solution will be found only when it is clear to Haiti's military that the United States is on the verge of an invasion, or through military intervention itself.
Senior Administration officials said invading Haiti would be one of the easier American military operations in years.
Haiti's military is ill equipped and poorly trained, they say, armed with sufficient firepower to terrorize the civilian population but not enough to pose serious resistance to an American invasion.
"The system that runs Haiti now runs it through what they're pleased to call the Haitian military, but it is not a military in the normal sense of the word," a senior Administration official said. "It's more like a combination of an old-fashioned political machine and the Mafia."
According to Administration officials, the Haitian armed forces consist of about 7,500 to 7,700 men. About half of the force, including about 1,300 police officers, are stationed in the capital, Port-au-Prince. The military's 925-member officer corps offers only broad guidance to the enlisted ranks, which have an unusual degree of autonomy to decide what operations they will join.
The military is equipped with six American-made lightly armored vehicles, which are rolled out occasionally for effect, but not all are in working order.
The army has four or five 105-millimeter artillery pieces and a similar number of 75-millimeter guns. But the Haitian troops do not train with them and they were last seen fired this month at the inauguration of the military-backed "provisional president," Emil Jonassaint. "They are the kind of things you would see on the lawn of an American Legion post," a Pentagon official said.
The Haitian air force consists of two Italian training aircraft and some cargo planes, and the navy consists of four patrol boats. "On a good day, two work," the Pentagon official said.
To hold down American casualties, an invasion would probably involve a division's worth of troops -- some 15,000 soldiers -- and could feature special operations forces, Army Rangers, Army airborne units and marines.
Military experts said American forces would seize the airport and ports and take over Government buildings and communications centers.
Unlike Somalia, which was awash in arms and run by violent, closely-knit clans, the Haitian military is not expected to offer much resistance. One Administration official said its response would be "surrender and dispersal."
But if Haiti is not Somalia, neither is it Panama or Grenada, where the United States mounted lightning invasions, installed friendly governments and then quickly withdrew.
 
Long-Term Problem: And After Aristide?
 The real problem, officials say, would be what to do after Father Aristide was installed. It is not that maintaining order and trying to build Haiti's institutions are impossible, intelligence officials say, but that the United States and its allies must go in with their eyes open and be prepared for the long haul.
To build a peacekeeping force, the Administration is engaged in high-level consultations.
Some options under consideration would keep the American role to transport and logistics, while drawing on Canadian, Argentine and French-speaking forces from African nations like Senegal and the Ivory Coast. Among the 1.7 million members of the American military, there are only 124 troops who speak Creole, the language most Haitians speak.
Administration officials tick off several potentially vexing scenarios if Father Aristide is returned: If he and the Haitian Parliament renew their confrontation, who should peacekeepers support? If crowds loyal to Father Aristide try to retaliate against military or police officials, should the peacekeepers prevent it? What if Father Aristide tells the force to leave after a few weeks? Can the force prevent foes from trying to kill the Haitian leader?
Much, officials say, will depend on Father Aristide's political skills.
Pentagon officials, in particular, worry about what they see as deep-seated resistance within the Haitian military to Father Aristide.
"Both sides would be afraid of each other," a Pentagon official said. "There are no viable institutions that make this work. There's the potential for mob violence, chaos and disorder."
Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee and is a strong supporter of Father Aristide, disputed the Pentagon's view of the depth of the opposition.
Mr. Oberstar, who taught Enlish to Haitian troops from 1959 to 1962, said many of the enlisted force and most of the public would welcome the restoration of Father Aristide and the intervention of American troops.
But even Mr. Oberstar said that the Haitian military would have to be rebuilt and that peacekeeping troops would need to stay three to five years.
And if the Administration is ambivalent about the military option, so is the man they want to return to power. "If I ask for military intervention, I will be impeached by my Constitution," Father Aristide said in an interview with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on CNN on May 7.
When pressed if he would support removing the military under any conditions, Father Aristide, said: "We should stop those thugs. It's possible to remove them. It's a question of having the political will to do that."

HEADLINE: For High School Graduates, A Job Market of Dead Ends

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
For hundreds of thousands of people graduating from high school this spring, the diploma is a one-way ticket to low-paying, part-time jobs at best.
Most graduates who are planning to go straight to work are offered the same low wages, the same part-time hours and the same assignments in the restaurants, supermarkets, motels and gasoline stations where they worked in after-school jobs they held as students. 
 And they might consider themselves lucky. In 1993, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, nearly a quarter of high school graduates who did not go on to college and wanted jobs were still unemployed in October, compared with 21 percent of each year's new graduates in the 1980's and 16 percent in the 1970's. For the first time, unemployment grew among graduates while the economy was growing.
"The market is fraught with dead ends," said Alison Bernstein, the head of education programs at the Ford Foundation. "Unless they have certain kinds of skills, they can get locked on a path that doesn't take them anywhere. They could be among the working poor very early."
Not long ago, a graduate of Craigmont High and Middle School in Memphis could walk from graduation into the factory of International Harvester or Firestone Tire and Rubber and start earning real money.
"If you could hit a nail every time one went by on an assembly line," Ada Jane Walters, the principal, said, "you got a job that in today's market would pay $12 or $13 an hour."
But Harvester and Firestone, like many other manufacturers, have flown, leaving behind fast-growing, lower-wage industries. Today, Federal Express, the biggest employer in Memphis, offers high school graduates 20-hour-a-week jobs for $8 an hour. "We try to be very up front about it," said Chuck W. Thomson, a vice president for personnel at Federal Express. "We tell them they should take this job with the understanding that it will be part time indefinitely."
Kroger supermarkets here offer $4.50 an hour for entry-level jobs like stock clerks. Jack Overbrook, the head of personnel, said promotion to full time and a wage of $7 or $8 "could take three or four years."
So it goes around the nation.
Adjusted for inflation, the starting pay of people with at least four-year college degrees has slipped a bit in two decades, said Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. But in the same period, wages have plunged 25 percent to 30 percent for men with only high school diplomas and 15 percent to 18 percent for women in that category.
The nation's economy is producing two million new jobs a year, but they come with wages typically below $8 an hour, or about $16,000 a year, and without fringe benefits, much opportunity for promotion or promises that the jobs will last.
Many students have taken the statistics to heart by going to college and vocational schools. The Labor Department said on May 20 that 63 percent of last year's 2.3 million high school graduates had entered two- or four-year colleges by October, compared with 50 percent in 1980. Labor experts say the wisest young people persevere in looking for jobs and seek a special edge by cultivating skills that better-paying employers covet.
But even college degrees, good attitudes and skills do not guarantee a decent job. The growth of low-paid, low-skilled jobs is outpacing the growth of more-skilled jobs in fields like health care and data processing.
At the same time, industry is shedding layers of middle-management jobs held by college graduates, creating an additional challenge for high school graduates: People with college degrees have invaded their blue-collar turf. As a result, of last year's 736,000 new high school graduates who joined the labor force a year ago, 24 percent -- nearly four times the rate for all workers -- were still unemployed in October.
 
Aware of the Realities
 Students at Craigmont, a three-story yellow brick building on the working-class fringe of north Memphis, are well aware of the world that awaits them.
Stephen Sigman, a senior and a part-time waiter at a Shoney's restaurant, seems to be the kind of worker that employers crave. "You learn teamwork," he said of his job. "How to pace yourself. Take responsibility. If you slack off, you get complaints."
He wants to go to college, but, he said, a D-plus average and serious dyslexia will hold him back at least a year or two while he spends $60 a week from his wages for tutoring.
"I don't want to be a bottom man," he said. "I want to be something you can look up to. But a lot of people come out of college with no place to go. Me and my friends, that's the biggest fear that teen-agers have."
Craigmont, the city's largest public school with 1,928 students in grades 7 through 12, resembles many urban schools outside the impoverished cores of bigger cities like New York and Chicago. Thirty-six percent of the students are black, and most others are white. Eighteen percent are poor enough to qualify for free lunches.
Dr. Walters, the principal, said Craigmont was like most other high schools in that it had done little to refine its vocational education to meet the needs of the marketplace.
Craigmont has had some success in beefing up courses in fields like food service management and data processing. Susan Brooks, who teaches data processing, has set up an advisory council of executives, and this year she helped one senior land a data-processing job at the Paine Webber stock brokerage and another find one at First Tennessee Bank.
But of Craigmont's 214 graduating seniors, less than the national average of 63 percent will go straight to two- or four-year colleges.
The guidance counselor, Mary Beth Yates, said 142 seniors, or 66 percent, say they would like to go, but for lack of money or ambition or adequate grades and test scores, only 80 have been admitted to colleges in the fall.
Some students are considering six months or a year of trade school or plan to join the armed forces. But around half of the seniors will head straight for the job market the day after the graduation on June 6.
 
Goals and Wanderlust
 The realities of the job market have taken a psychological toll. "For some reason," Ms. Yates said, "our kids are not real adventuresome."
Rebecca Powell, the class valedictorian, is a rarity in having a specific career goal and some wanderlust. She will study music at Indiana University. "I want to be a professional flutist in an orchestra," she said.
By contrast, few Craigmont students, college bound or not, speak of becoming President, a new Elvis Presley or Martin Luther King Jr. or Golda Meier, or a woman who builds cathedrals or the black who cures cancer, or even of becoming master machinists or crack computer programmers. They want the security of homes and wages that pay the rent, not adventures and risks.
"This is the era of lowered expectations," said Harold Hodgkinson, an expert in American education who is director of the Center for Demographic Policy in Washington. "For this group of kids, lowered expectations is a mentally healthy way for some of them to go. You can't get hurt if your expectations are low."
Tim Ferguson has been working part time as peer counselor at a drug treatment center where he was once a client. And he might make a career of it. "I'm not trying to be an adult right now," he said.
Joi Taylor thinks of moving from her cashier's job at Kroger's to a cashier's job at a Mississippi casino. Any job, she said, is less important than other goals -- "a husband, a dog, a son and a house."
Christy Johnston said of her aspirations: "Maybe college. Maybe going to flight attendant school. Helping the homeless." Pressed, she confided: "Falling in love. Staying with him. Not getting divorced."
Still, some students here embody their elders' theories about skill and work-ready attitudes.
 
High Hurdles, Hard Worker
 Wadena Heard, who faces bigger hurdles than most, is 20 and the single mother of a 4-year-old girl. She works four hours a day after school at a Kroger's and lives in a three-room, weather-battered bungalow with seven people -- three generations of women and little girls. She reads to her child, Tyresea, in the single bed they share in a tiny bedroom. A corner of the ceiling has been pulled away and a large bucket in the corner collects leaks; their clothes hang on nails on the wall.
But Ms. Heard threw herself into Craigmont's vocational courses in food service. She often presides over the kitchen where food is prepared for guests, and she organizes student and faculty receptions. "She could go right out today and run a catering service," her English teacher, John Hester, said. "She's always looking for things that go beyond the call of normal classroom procedure."
Ms. Heard's goals? "I want my own house," she said. 'I want to be married to my baby's daddy. I want to get me a car so I can have transportation. I want to go to college and be a registered dietitian."
College will have to wait. "I'm scared," she said. "I'd say in a year I'd be ready." College or no college, Dr. Walters said: "She will be a very productive member of society. There's something inside of her. She will work very hard for the money she makes."
Terrance Burtis wants to tackle the job market now. In the middle of his senior year, he became hooked on computers, staying through lunch and after hours to master them. "He's the most improved student I have in my classroom," said Ms. Brooks, his teacher, who added that he could go to college or vocational school and become a programmer.
But Mr. Burtis says he has been assured $8 an hour for a kitchen management job at Shoney's, and he is also taking a test for a job in the United States Postal Service. He intends to grab one or the other, he says, or some college graduate will.
"Pretty much the people I know who have college still have jobs like at restaurants, jobs that ordinary people can do," he said.

HEADLINE: At Wellesley, or 'First Lady Central,' the Talk Is About, Well, First Ladies

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WELLESLEY, Mass., May 27

 BODY:
At Wellesley College graduation on Friday, there was talk of first ladies, as there often is on a campus where, when women refer to Hillary, it can mean only one Hillary, their Hillary, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Class of 1969.
"It's been sort of First Lady central," the commencement speaker, Cokie Roberts, a correspondent for ABC News and National Public Radio, and a Wellesley alumna, told the graduates. 
 Four years ago the speaker was Barbara Bush, and students protested on the ground that she was selected only because she was the wife of the President. Mrs. Bush brought another first lady with her, Raisa Gorbachev, wife of the then-Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
This year, a week after her death, the women were thinking about another First Lady, though not a Wellesley grad, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The graduates had not even been born when she became the widow of the assassinated President, but still she had been a part of their lives. They had learned about her through their mothers.
 
The Two Jackies
 "I remember my mom and the other mothers on the block talking about her," said Jennifer Vanasco, 22, from Garden City, L.I., who gave the student commencement address. "I remember them all running out to buy the book 'Jackie O.' "
As a little girl listening to her mother talk, Ms. Vanasco said, she just assumed there were two women named Jackie: Jackie Kennedy and Jackie Onassis. "Jackie Kennedy was the graceful, elegant hostess type who gave White House tours and was the perfect mother and the perfect wife and the perfect feminine woman all the time," said Ms. Vanasco, who is known at Wellesley as Jay. "Jackie Onassis did what she wanted. She was more aggressive. If she wanted to marry Onassis, she did. If she wanted to become a book editor, she did."
It wasn't until high school that Ms. Vanasco learned, in history class, that Jackie Kennedy and Jackie Onassis were the same woman. "I was just shocked that people had talked so differently about the same person," Ms. Vanasco said. "I thought they couldn't have known the first incarnation of her very well."
 
Editor of Student Paper
 Ms. Vanasco, who worked at a day-care center to help pay her college bills, and was the editor of the student newspaper, The Wellesley News, said she had come to admire Jackie Kennedy Onassis. "I thought it was wonderful that she was a book editor," she said. "She would have been fascinating to talk to."
The mothers remembered where they were when Jack Kennedy was shot; they remember watching it all on television. The daughters saw the film of the shooting years later, in school. "The first time I saw it I cried," said Eugenie Bisulco. "Jackie was looking straight at him when his head was blown apart. That's why I think she's so strong."
Surrounded by bold young women determined to become doctors, lawyers, physicists and teachers, the mothers seemed intent on giving the First Lady of their youth her due. "Jackie was always more than just a wife," said Eugenie's mother, Genevieve Bisulco, who is an art teacher.
"I was a little upset about all the money she spent on clothes," said Dorinda Pell Cruickshank, whose daughter, Blair Cruickshank, was among the graduates. "But maybe if I was having a tough married life, I'd go out and shop, too."
 
Chicken and Strawberries
 Talking about Jackie as they ate chicken sandwiches and strawberries on the lawn in the afternoon sunlight, some of the graduates seemed to echo their mothers. "Grace and elegance has a power of its own," said Tanya Jelacic, who majored in biology and English. "I grew up in Washington, and when we'd go downtown and see pictures of the First Ladies, my mother would always point her out and say, 'This lady has style.' "
Leigh Condon, an American Studies major, said she had written her thesis about the Sixties. "The Kennedys and Camelot were a wonderful thing," she said. "They gave the country a lot of hope. From a cultural, sociological point of view, there was something amazing about the Jackie Kennedy look. I respected Jackie for that -- her beauty, grace and charm. At a woman's college in the Nineties, that's not something to be admired. You're supposed to have a strong, powerful front."
Another graduate, Nichole Peterson, said: "In order to be taken seriously, you're not supposed to dress too femininely."
At Wellesley, an elite woman's college founded in 1870, rolling wooden hoops across the lawn is an end-of-the-year ritual for graduating seniors. The legend used to be that the woman who won the hoop rolling race would be the first to get married (the president of Wellesley, Diana Chapman Walsh, who is an expert on public health policy, won in 1966, and was married two weeks after graduation). Now, the winner is said to be destined to become the first C.E.O.
 
Hillary Clinton Most Admired
 And so the First Lady that many of today's graduates, and their mothers, too, most admire is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Ask them about her, and they all have the same response: "She's incredibly smart."
And, added, Sheila Kiernan, 21, who was an intern last summer at the White House: "She's incredibly articulate. She fabulous. She's someone I hold in awe. When she testified before Congress, she was so articulate. I can't go through the newspaper without focusing on articles about her. She's so different from Jackie. Jackie was from another time."
Yashika Olden, an international relations major, said that as much as she looked up to Jackie Kennedy, she hoped that people would also remember another widow of a slain leader, a woman who is still alive. "I have to admire Coretta Scott King," said Ms. Olden, who is black, referring to the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. "She held her family together as well."
 
Cornell University
 Special to The New York Times
ITHACA, N.Y., May 29 -- As Cornell University awarded degrees to 3,615 undergraduates and 2,329 graduate students, the university president, Frank H. T. Rhodes, singled out two in particular for recognition today: Helene Rosenblatt, who at age 70 earned her degree in human ecology, 53 years after starting, and Mary Jo Fink, who received a master's degree in hotel administration nine weeks after she was told she had cancer. He said the love of those around them and their hope in the future had spurred them on.
 
Vassar College
 Dr. Bernadine Healy, the former head of the National Institutes of Health, was the speaker at the Vassar College commencement, where 525 seniors received diplomas. Dr. Healy, a 1965 graduate, spoke of the changes wrought by medical technology in the last half-century and said: "Today we are confronting the economic challenge -- the dollar cost -- of the extraordinary success of the wonders of biology and medicine. But tomorrow we will confront ethical, social and moral challenges that will make the problems of economics we are facing now seem very easy."

HEADLINE: Economics By Ripples

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Trying to maneuver the economy with a series of interest rate increases is like trying to change the heading of a supertanker on a collision course: each decision is followed by an agonizing wait before any effect is discernible.
But for the economy, unlike the supertanker, this waiting period will last as much as a year, rather than minutes. So nobody can answer definitively the question of whether the Federal Reserve's four short-term interest rate increases in four months will be effective in preventing future inflation without drastically slowing economic growth now. 
 "Anybody who gave you an honest answer to that would have to say, 'I don't know,' " Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor, said today in a telephone interview.
The Fed directly controls only the rates that banks pay to borrow money overnight. Increasing these rates makes it more expensive for banks to raise money for new loans to companies and individuals and in turn forces them to charge higher loan rates. But it takes time for the number of loans to slow down, and even more time for the slowdown to ripple through the economy as loan-starved businesses and consumers begin to buy less.
When rising short-term interest rates happen to touch off a sharp increase in longer-term rates, as occurred this year, then the effects are somewhat accelerated. Higher long-term interest rates usually tend to slow the construction and sale of homes, although thousands of Americans blunted that effect this spring by rushing into the housing market before rates could go higher.
 
Luck or Prescience?
 A year from now, the effects of the higher interest rates will still not be entirely clear. If economies in Western Europe are evolving from leaden to sprightly and American exports soaring, the Fed's critics may say that it was just lucky not to have tipped the economy into a recession.
If oil prices jump, the Fed's defenders will, on past performance, blame that rather than higher interest rates for any economic slowdown that may come.
Even if a year from now economists agree on the effects of the series of interest rate increases, they will almost certainly still be divided over whether the Federal Reserve was right. The reason is that while a collision course may be clear to a ship's captain, who may see a rocky shoreline ahead or another vessel, considerable debate remains over whether the economy was headed for trouble when the Federal Reserve began to act.
Federal Reserve officials are concerned that growth in the coming years may consistently exceed 2.5 percent, their best estimate of the economy's speed limit at full capacity. Break the speed limit for too long and sooner or later the penalty will be inflation, they warn.
The central bank's critics, like Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, contend that the economy can grow as fast as 3.5 percent without risk of inflation. The critics see Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, as resembling a ship's pilot who stays well below the speed limit and slows down before every turn. The economy grew at an annual pace of 3 percent in the first three months of this year.
At a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Friday, Mr. Sarbanes held up an enlarged print of an editorial cartoon that appeared recently in Florida. The cartoon showed Mr. Greenspan looking especially glum and carrying a large sign that read, "The economy is picking up! We are doomed!"
Mr. Greenspan, who usually has a tight-lipped smile if he smiles at all, flashed a toothy grin when he saw the cartoon. He responded later during the hearing that he favored economic growth but thought that keeping inflation low was one of the best ways to assure that growth would be sustainable over the long term.
 
Gauging Sustainable Growth
 The argument over the economy's maximum sustainable growth rate lies at the heart of the question of whether the Federal Reserve has been right to raise interest rates. To back up his argument, Mr. Greenspan cited on Friday new research by the Fed showing that companies and individuals work more efficiently and productively when inflation is low.
"We've done a lot of work on demonstrating that there is a quite robust relationship between the rate of inflation on the one hand and the rate of growth and productivity on the other," he said. "With the lower the inflation, the higher the productivity growth rate."
Some research at central banks around the world has suggested that for every percentage point shaved off the inflation rate, the productivity of a nation's people may increase by an extra tenth or two-tenths of a percentage point each year, said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
The enthusiasm of central banks for such research is predictable. Their main responsibility is to keep prices stable, so central bank economists have long looked for extra benefits to low inflation.
But many other economists are skeptical of such claims. While extremely high inflation clearly hurts productivity, the United States did not reach such levels even during the late 1970's, said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "I don't think it has been well documented at lower levels," she said.
The debate over the link between productivity and inflation is important because a growth in productivity helps determine the economy's speed limit. When experts like Mr. Greenspan estimate the economy's fastest sustainable growth at full capacity to be about 2.5 percent, they are adding together annual productivity gains of about 1.5 percent and annual increases in the labor force of 1 percent or so.
Productivity actually grew 1.7 percent last year, but changes considerably from quarter to quarter, according to Labor Department figures.
 
High-Productivity Model

 
 When people like Mr. Sarbanes use figures like 3.5 percent, they are assuming a much faster growth in productivity. Support for such a view comes from a scattering of business leaders, like George M. C. Fisher, the chairman and chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company.
Mr. Fisher said in an interview earlier this month that he thought productivity growth had permanently accelerated because American companies had learned to develop products and put them on the market much faster than before.
Mr. Greenspan contended on Friday that although higher interest rates might slow the economy now, they would increase the economy's maximum growth rate in the future. The higher rates would hold down inflation and thereby increase the growth in productivity.

HEADLINE: A Call for Easing Labor-Management Tension

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
A commission created by President Clinton has concluded that the American workplace cannot become truly efficient and globally competitive until the hostility between labor and management -- particularly when unions try to organize a company -- is greatly reduced.
The White House wants the findings of the 10-member commission, which includes three former Secretaries of Labor, corporate executives and union leaders, to serve as the centerpiece for whatever labor legislation it might propose in the President's first term. 
 "What we want is a new framework for worker-management relations that breaks the stalemate that now exists and holds back innovation and efficiency at the workplace," said Thomas Kochan, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a commission member.
To this end, the commission is trying to broker a compromise that would give workers and managers shared power in running their companies. That is a tall order, but part of the commission's mandate from the Clinton Administration.
Having received word of the findings, which will not be made public until Thursday, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is interpreting them as evidence that the National Labor Relations Act, passed in 1935 and still the nation's basic labor law, should be amended to make union organizing, guaranteed in the 1935 act, easier and faster.
But management is unlikely to embrace that view.
"It is my sense of the business community that it would not be very supportive of making it easier for unions to organize," said Jeffrey C. McGuiness, president of the Labor Policy Association, a Washington group subsidized by corporations. "I would question whether a brokered deal is possible that takes into account all the different employment issues raised by the commission."
Labor and management usually give in to fundamental change only during periods of great crisis. The labor law that emerged from one of those periods, the Great Depression, drew some of its provisions from a similar, detailed study of the American workplace by a Presidential commission. There has been no such study since, and a question now is whether there is enough of a crisis to again force significant change.
The panel, formally known as the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, asserts that the necessary crisis does indeed exist -- fed by such factors as stagnant wages, global competition, polarized incomes and high unemployment for the unskilled.
The commission hopes this crisis will encourage workers and managers to accept the commission's findings as "facts" -- and then to agree on solutions.
 
 
'First Step'
 "Before we can make progress, we have to agree on the reality, the facts, what the trends show," said Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, "and this first step is an important predicate to further debate over what to do about the facts."
But the commission's principal findings, disclosed by members in interviews in advance of the report's public release on Thursday, might not go down so easily.
The commission found, for example, a rising number of conflicts when unions try to organize a company's workers. These conflicts have a ripple effect and "can create an atmosphere of confrontation in worker-management relations throughout the economy," the report says. It also says that 40 million to 50 million workers -- more than 30 percent of the nation's work force -- yearn to participate in making decisions on the job, a yearning that many managers welcome, but many others reject.
 
 
More Basic IssueRole of Unions
 Apart from organizing, the Clinton Administration has sidestepped the issue of whether unions are necessary in the modern workplace, although organized labor supported Mr. Clinton in the last election. The commission reflects that middle-of-the-road approach. While unions, which have seen their membership decline in recent years, have made positive contributions, the commission found, nonunion companies also function well.
The 150-page report offers three major findings, and they are intertwined. All three require a solution, in the commission's view, for a fair and efficient workplace to emerge.
The report found that when workers have tried to organize unions, the rate at which workers have been dismissed illegally has risen in recent years. In addition, the number of first contracts successfully negotiated after a union is formed has declined, the commission found.
All this might seem to imply that management is the heavy in this process. But the findings include an important, balancing caveat: the illegal resistance has occurred at relatively few companies.
 
 
'Quite Small'
 "We basically say that the number of illegal dismissals is quite small in relation to the total workers engaged in organizing, but it has increased," said Paul A. Allaire, the chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a management representative on the commission. "But even if it is small, reducing this conflict could have quite a positive impact on labor-management relationships in all their aspects. The conflict colors the relationship nationally."
Getting rid of this conflict, in turn, would foster the trust and information-sharing that is necessary to make greater use of teams in the workplace, teams in which workers and supervisors share decision making, in effect running their operations together.
In its second major finding, the commission reported that employee participation is a growing phenomenon, involving more than 20 percent of the work force, but operating successfully in only a small number of "high performance" corporations, like Xerox, AT&T and Motorola. Where it operates well, employee participation improves product quality and efficiency, the commission found. But in weeks of hearings and gathering information, the commission found a disconcerting dichotomy in Corporate America.
"In the mornings, at most of our hearings, we would hear from executives and union leaders, talking about the high-production workplaces, and we would say, 'That is wonderful; that has to be the future,' " Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, said. "And in the afternoon you would hear from workers who tried to form a union and were fired or in other ways were treated like dirt. The people in the morning were the best companies, representing the skilled and the educated. And the people in the afternoon were the unskilled and the minorities."
Some of the high-production companies had unions. But the commission, holding to the middle ground, found that worker-management teams had operated successfully in both union and nonunion settings. As a commission member, Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Automobile Workers, accepted that finding. But he disagreed personally.
 
 
'Protect Workers'
 "I say absolutely that worker-management committees work better in a union setting," he said. "If you are going to have true labor-management cooperation, then you have to have equal partnership, and that requires unions to protect workers."
Protection in the new workplace ties in with the commission's third major finding: an explosion of court litigation involving worker-manager disputes. Declining union membership has added to the problem, the unions having once played a larger role in resolving disputes. The litigation is costly for management and labor, and unavailable to low-wage workers who cannot afford lawyers.
The alternatives to the courts -- mediation, arbitration and informal procedures for resolving disputes -- are not being used to their full potential, the commission found.
But in this area, like the others, the commission stops short of recommending solutions or changes in the law, although its original mandate from the Clinton Administration was to do so by now. Instead, a "discourse" is to proceed, as John T. Dunlop, the commission's chairman, puts it, in which labor and business are to agree on solutions. These are to be embodied in the commission's final report in the fall. The chief broker emerging in this process is Mr. Dunlop, a Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration.
But the task this time is not easy. Union leaders, for example, want to allow workers at a company to affiliate with a union as their bargaining representative simply by persuading a majority of them to sign union cards. That would mean amending the National Labor Relations Act, which requires elections -- a more complicated procedure easier for managers to block.
Similarly, the act also prohibits unions created by companies, on the ground that such unions would fail to represent worker interests in issues like pay and benefits. Now this ban has become an obstacle to the organization of worker-management teams. Several have been challenged and disbanded as company unions. One solution would be to change the Labor Relations Act. Another would be to leave the law alone and hope the teams will proliferate anyway. Still a third would be legislation that authorizes the teams and protects from dismissal workers whose actions anger managers.

HEADLINE: Washington's Decline Is the Issue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Four years after a blue-ribbon panel found that the District of Columbia was facing an immediate fiscal crisis that was undermining the quality of life, the city appears to be in worse shape than ever.
Beyond the gleam of the White House, Capitol Hill, embassies and the tourist stops, more than 2,200 public housing units are boarded up while 8,200 families are on waiting lists, the crime rate is higher than ever, children pass through metal detectors in every high school and nearly every junior high school, one of every eight residents receives financial aid from the city and one of every six receives food stamps. 
 And don't even think about finding a convenient parking space.
There's more: the tax revenue to address these problems is shrinking and a steady migration to the Maryland and Virginia suburbs is continuing. After falling 3 percent from 1985 to 1990, the city's population fell another 5 percent through last year, to 578,000, the lowest since 1934.
Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly balanced the current $3.4 billion budget by delaying pension fund payments; by 1999 the deficit is projected to reach more than $825 million.
 
Who Gets the Blame
 How the city got this way and who is to blame have emerged as the central issues in a mayoral campaign being waged by the three-term former Mayor who presided over most of the decline, Marion S. Barry Jr., and Mrs. Kelly, his successor for the last three and a half years.
With the race toward the September primary barely a week old, Mr. Barry and another challenger, John Ray, have begun attacking Mrs. Kelly for doing little to reverse the trends. At the same time, Mrs. Kelly has criticized Mr. Barry for the situation she inherited, the District council for not always supporting her and Congress for not providing more money and more power to tax suburbanites who work in the city. Both Mr. Barry and Mr. Ray are members of the council.
"Everybody wants to point a finger at somebody else," said Richard Berendzen, the former president of American University here. "But it's not a matter of blame. The point is to see what has happened and figure out how to deal with it."
Dr. Berendzen headed the blue-ribbon panel when it was formed in 1989, at Mr. Barry's request, until he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of making obscene telephone calls. He was replaced by Alice M. Rivlin, now the deputy Federal budget director.
 
Study Group Reconvened
 Last month, Mrs. Kelly asked Dr. Berendzen to reconvene the group and report by mid-July on any progress since the initial work was delivered to Mrs. Kelly in November 1990. Mr. Barry resigned as Mayor in 1990 and served a six-month sentence on a drug conviction. He returned to politics two years ago with his election to the District council.
But recognizing the potential for Mrs. Kelly and her two challengers to use the scorecard for their own political gain, commission members told the Mayor on Friday that they would prefer to present their report after the general election in November.
In a statement, Mrs. Kelly said she understood the commission's concerns and would welcome the report whenever it was ready.
While the candidates might disagree on who should bear the blame for the city's troubles, the three candidates at least agree that relations between the District and the Federal Government should be changed.
Washington relies on four main sources of revenue: sales tax, property taxes, income taxes and the annual Federal payment, which is intended to compensate for the loss of property tax revenues from the 57 percent of Washington real estate that is exempt, mostly Government buildings and embassies.
 
The Federal Connection
 But in recent years, the formula has become a chicken-or-the-egg nightmare in that the Federal payment, less than 19 percent of the overall budget now, increases only if the other revenues rise.
Property tax revenues, which contribute the largest share, increased almost 68 percent in five years through 1993, while the average sale price of a single-family house increased only 13.6 percent. Yet now, the city estimates that property tax revenues will drop through the next four years.
And with thousands of middle-class residents -- nearly equal numbers of blacks and whites -- moving to suburbs that promise safer neighborhoods and better services, the situation can only grow worse.
"I've never seen so many 'for-sale' signs around town," Mr. Barry said in a speech announcing his candidacy.
In addition, the District has a higher top income rate, 9.5 percent, than either Maryland, at 7.5 percent, or Virginia, at 5.75 percent, and it is shackled with costs that other cities generally share with counties or states, like welfare, prisons and hospitals.
Picking up what promises to be the theme of her re-election campaign, Mrs. Kelly argued this week before the House subcommittee that authorizes the District budget that those realities have prevented her from doing more to improve life in the city.
Many of Mrs. Kelly's detractors, including Mr. Barry and members of the original commission now called back into service, contend that much of the city's financial strain is her fault, that she could have cut more. For example, the panel recommended reducing the police force by 1,605 positions. By March of this year, 555 slots had been eliminated.
In the Mayor's view, however, that was enough to count as meeting the recommendation. Using similar standards, her staff determined that she had met 75 percent of 89 commission proposals, and she has told Congress and supporters that she had complied with 80 percent of the proposals.
The figures are high enough to raise a few eyebrows.
"I've been quite vocal and open in front of the Mayor that I am very proud of what we did," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a member of the commissioner and a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. "But many feel the report was just thrown up on the shelf for three and a half years."
 
Little Talk of Decline
 Mr. Barry makes little mention of Washington's steady decline during his administration after the economic boom years of the early 1980's. In a speech announcing his candidacy, he skimmed across his 12 previous years in office, reminding people only that he always balanced the budget and began programs to help the needy.
Mr. Ray, who has run three unsuccessful campaigns for mayor, has charged that the city has been "nonmanaged and mismanaged" under both previous mayors.
There have been some signs of encouragement. A recent study by Smithy Braedon Oncor, a real estate services company, showed that retail vacancy rates dropped for a second-straight year in 1993. And Andrew Florence of Realty Information Group, a research company, said the commercial office vacancy rate had fallen to under 10 percent for the first time since 1990.
But Dr. Berendzen and others said that only significant structural changes in the fiscal relationships between the district and the Federal Government could save the city from a bailout in the short-term and the disturbing trends that had brought the city to this point.

HEADLINE: The Evolving Outlook Of Japan's No. 1 Banker

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 27

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, an awesomely wealthy Japan was in the vanguard of the international financial system that used joint control of currency and interest rates to solve big economic crises. There was great optimism here over the benefits of active policy coordination.
It takes only a few minutes with Yasushi Mieno, the plain-spoken governor of the Bank of Japan, to get a sense of how much things have changed. Mr. Mieno, (pronounced mee-AY-no), a gregarious 70-year-old whose passion outside of monetary statistics is sumo wrestling, may well become known as the governor of diminished expectations.
 
Discussion Replaces Action
 With Japan getting little help in halting the punishing rise of the yen these days, the Government being criticized for not doing enough to end the recession and the flood of Japanese capital abroad having become a trickle, coordinated action by the industrialized nations has been largely transformed, in Mr. Mieno's words, into a passive exchange of information about basic policy goals. 
 "That is the notion of policy coordination that I have," Mr. Mieno said in an interview.
His admission reflects the sober mood at the top of Japan's financial system as Mr. Mieno nears the end of his controversial five-year term. His tenure, which ends in December, covered one of the most tumultuous and humbling periods in the country's financial history.
Under his stewardship, the Bank of Japan for the first time increased interest rates, not as a remedy for a burst of consumer price inflation -- which was almost nonexistent when he took office in 1989 -- but to check soaring stock and land prices.
The policy punctured what is now called the "bubble economy" of the 1980's, a speculative period that sent asset prices to astronomical levels. At the peak, the land beneath the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo was said to be worth more than all the real estate in California.
The central bank's action produced the longest recession in the postwar period. Mr. Mieno then reversed course and engineered the lowest official interest rates ever, from a peak of 6 percent to the current 1.75 percent. Yet the cheap credit has failed to ignite an economic recovery because, some argue, Mr. Mieno's experiment in controlling asset prices went on too long.
 
A Burden of Bad Debts
 More than $6 trillion in asset values have been wiped out, the property market is all but moribund and commercial banks are saddled with a huge burden of bad debts. It is no wonder that Mr. Mieno is regarded with a combination of fear, respect and anger -- but never indifference.
Some Japanese consider him a hero for having stopped the orgy of speculation during the 1980's, putting the economy on a more solid footing for the future, even if the medicine has been painful.
"My view is that nobody could have behaved better during such an unlucky period," said Yoshio Suzuki, chairman of the advisory board at the Nomura Research Institute and a former top executive at the Bank of Japan. Others, however, share the view of Shin Kanemaru, formerly the country's most powerful politician, who suggested several years ago that someone ought to behead the central bank governor.
 
Several Difficult Problems

The years under Mr. Mieno have left the Bank of Japan with several perplexing problems that could influence policy well into the future. For one, the bank has to decide if Mr. Mieno's campaign against soaring stock and land prices was a one-time foray or a long-term policy. And if it is a long-term policy, it raises the question: When does a bull market cross the line into becoming the dangerous "asset inflation" that Mr. Mieno attacked?
The central bank must also decide where to draw the line between ridding Japan's financial markets of their heavy burden of regulation -- Mr. Mieno's long-stated policy -- and using regulation to maintain the kind of order with which the bank is obsessed.
"It is uncertain to what extent financial liberalization affected behavior during the period of the financial bubble," Mr. Mieno said. What is certain, he said, is that "under the process of deregulation there was some excessive aggressiveness on the part of the banks."
He said deregulation had to continue, since competition was the only way to teach banks to manage their risks better.
But he also insisted that the Government's heavy-handed manner of handling the bad-debt crisis at the commercial banks would continue because of the central bank's need to protect the financial system against panic. The commercial banks have been pressured by the Government to keep many ailing borrowers afloat with new loans below market rates.
"Our greatest concern is systemic risk in the financial system," he said.
Mr. Mieno spent most of his 47-year career at the Bank of Japan being groomed for his current post. He spent part of his youth in northern China, which Japan was transforming into an engine for its military expansion of the 30's. When Japan lost the war, Mr. Mieno's father, a commercial banker, lost everything. Mr. Mieno was able to attend Tokyo University, the country's most elite institution, but had to live and work in a sumo stable, where he cultivated his interest in the sport. He is now a member of the council that selects the wrestlers to be elevated to the sport's highest status.
He also spent two years in New York in the early 1960's, studying for a short time at Columbia University. But for the most part his career was spent in the bank's domestic departments, where he developed a reputation for being smart and decisive.
Mr. Mieno was engulfed in criticism almost from his first day as governor in December 1989. The press reported that the Finance Minister was resisting a proposed increase in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, which influences what banks charge customers for loans.
The discount rate was raised and, within days, the stock market hit what remains its record high. When the rate went up three more times in the next 10 months, the market plunged and Mr. Mieno became known as the disciplinarian who ended one of the most powerful bull runs ever. Many experts say that he was right to raise interest rates but that he moved too fast.
"It was a question of degree," said Makoto Utsumi, the vice minister of finance at that time and now a professor at Keio University. "The point all along was to avoid a hard landing. I think if we had tightened more slowly we could have had a soft landing."
There was virtually no price or wage inflation, but Mr. Mieno acted because of a belief that soaring asset prices would eventually provoke consumer price inflation. Some still question that view.
"We still don't know the connection between monetary policy and asset prices," said Mikio Wakatsuki, a former deputy governor at the Bank of Japan and now chairman of the board of councilors at the Japan Research Institute. "What benchmark do you use? Which prices do you follow? We don't know, and didn't know then."
 
On One Hand -- and the Other
 Even Mr. Mieno seems ambivalent. He explained that steep rises in asset prices could not be given the same emphasis in policy making as could broader measures of consumer prices. On the other hand, he said, they cannot be ignored.
"The lesson that we learned from that," he said, " is that when we see the symptom of such asset price inflation we have to act immediately."
With the interest rate increases so unpopular at that time, Mr. Mieno put the issue in moral terms: He said that rocketing land prices put a home out of reach of the average Japanese and threatened social harmony.
"The bubble hurt the soundness and stability of Japanese society," Mr. Mieno said in another interview several years ago. "The efforts of labor, which is to work with sweat on your forehead, have been weakened. Morale was reduced and there was unfairness in the distribution of wealth."
In the latest interview, however, Mr. Mieno backed away from that kind of preaching.
"I am a central banker and not a sociologist," he said. "Neither I nor the Bank of Japan is in the position of being able to provide a guideline as to how the public should earn its income. Also, we are not playing the part of Robin Hood -- I like him, but I'm not Robin Hood."

HEADLINE: Balaguer Says He'll Enforce Curbs on Haiti

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Re public, May 29

 BODY:
Faced with American pressure and widespread accusations of voting fraud in his latest election, President Joaquin Balaguer now says he will do what he has scoffed at for months: enforce the international embargo against neighboring Haiti.
The Dominican border is the weakest point of the embargo, which is the major element in President Clinton's troubled effort to unseat the Haitian military. The embargo was toughened a week ago to include everything but food, medicine and cooking gas. 
 Gasoline in particular -- in plastic jugs rowed across lakes in the mountains, in tanker trucks waved through customs checkpoints and in rusty tramp steamers hugging the coast -- has enriched not only the smugglers but also the military and business executives behind the rulers of both countries.
But in this steamy and languid capital, the talk was that President Balaguer had bought himself a reprieve from United States and international pressure in elections that were held on May 16. Among other things, there have been complaints that the names of nearly 200,000 registered voters, mostly opposition supporters, had disappeared from the rolls and that 7 of the nation's 29 provinces had produced remarkably enthusiastic turnouts of more than 100 percent.
 
Recount Under Way
 According to the latest official election results, with a recount under way, President Balaguer is clinging to a razor-thin margin of some 30,000 votes out of three million cast.
Mr. Balaguer's public position on the embargo had been that increasing hardship in Haiti would bring an unwanted influx of refugees. The turnabout came after he met for two hours on Wednesday with William H. Gray 3d, Mr. Clinton's new point man on Haiti, and Dante Caputo, the special representative of the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
On Thursday, Mr. Balaguer called in his military chief, Lieut. Gen. Constantino Matos, who promptly announced a fusillade of measures, including the deployment of thousands of additional troops and the transfer of every officer and soldier who had been on the border for more than two months, presumably to break up corruption. The army, General Matos insisted, was "doing serious and honest work."
But given the real difficulty in enforcing the embargo in rough mountain and coastal terrain and the sudden, unaccustomed wealth that breaking the embargo has brought to poor areas and underpaid soldiers, it is unclear how effective the effort will be or how long it will be pressed.
 
'Political Reasons' Cited
 "President Balaguer will enforce the embargo for his own political reasons," said Jorge Botello, the president of the Chamber of Deputies. "After the meeting, he is of the belief that if he gives in on the problem of the border, that he will be guaranteed to remain in power."
At 87, President Balaguer is blind, partly deaf and walks with tiny steps. But both friends and enemies say he has lost none of the wiliness that has kept him the main player here for three decades.
Even opponents, like Leonel Fernandez, a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for Vice President on the third-place ticket of Mr. Balaguer's old enemy, Juan Bosch, salute Mr. Balaguer's guile.
"He has his own ways, his own tricks," Mr. Fernandez, who grew up on the West Side of Manhattan, said of the President, not without admiration. "He understands the need to negotiate the Haitian matter to be left alone in the electoral process. But he can outplay Clinton, he can outplay anyone. You can make an agreement with him, but he's always outwitting you."
 
An Election Issue
 Haiti was a more immediate, and visceral, issue in the election campaign.
Mr. Balaguer's main opponent was Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, 57, a former Mayor of Santo Domingo. Ebony-skinned in a country where the entrenched political and economic elite is of light complexion, Mr. Pena Gomez was born of a Haitian mother and raised by a Dominican family.
The President's campaign and television advertisements sought to portray him as a sort of closet Haitian who might give the country away to its neighbors.
"This was the most negative campaign ever, very racially oriented," said Mr. Pena Gomez's running mate, Fernando Alvarez, a longtime associate of the President, who broke with him when Mr. Balaguer changed his mind about a pledge not to run again.
For his part, Mr. Pena Gomez threatened that if President Balaguer was certified the winner, opposition members would refuse to take any offices they had won. Since Mr. Pena Gomez's party is estimated to have won about half the municipal posts and legislative seats, this could cause chaos.
"I am a humble man, the color of the night," Mr. Pena Gomez said at a news conference. "This is perhaps why they think they can run over me. But I am not alone."

HEADLINE: Supporters and Critics Equally Ardent in Judging Hynes

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Charles J. Hynes appeared to have all the ingredients for success when he took over as Brooklyn District Attorney in 1990: the prosecutor's background, the air of independence and integrity that came with winning convictions for the Howard Beach racial killings, and the support of major figures in the Democratic Party.
"He was the great hope," said Joyce David, president of the Kings County Criminal Bar Association. 
 Mr. Hynes ridiculed the work of his predecessor, Elizabeth Holtzman, calling her office "dismal," "reckless," and "nothing short of incompetent," and he privately told an audience of Brooklyn judges that their "long nightmare" was over.
 
'Total Pro' or Blatant Politician
 It has, however, been no dream four years for Mr. Hynes and Brooklyn, as the the District Attorney himself admits.
Opinion about Mr. Hynes's resume, after all, is rather badly split. His ardent supporters speak of an unconventionally effective prosecutor's office -- "he's been a total pro," said one admirer who is a criminal defense attorney -- that has become humanized and more representative of Brooklyn's diverse population. Mr. Hynes, they say, is dedicated to equal treatment for everyone under the law.
But his detractors draw a portrait of a blatantly political office -- one former prosecutor called it a cult of loyalty -- that has failed to bring forth major cases and that has bungled many cases both major and minor. These critics cite an unimpressive conviction rate that judges, defense attorneys and former employees say is symptomatic of an office without great training for its prosecutors, one directed by a man whose heart is not in the job.
The full range of Mr. Hynes's performance is destined for a lengthy public airing, for he is one of three candidates aiming for the Democratic nomination to become state attorney general.
His rivals are G. Oliver Koppell, the veteran Assemblyman from the Bronx who was appointed to serve the remainder of Robert Abrams's term as Attorney General and who has significant statewide support in the Legislature, and Karen S. Burstein, a former Family Court judge in Brooklyn who has already gained the Liberal Party nomination. Mr. Hynes, who has support from party leaders in Brooklyn, is said to be placing third in most opinion polls, and could face a difficult task trying to get on the ballot at this week's Democratic convention.
"The No. 1 issue is crime, and what this is all about is two resumes for the job of the people's lawyer," said Mr. Hynes, who clearly figures Mr. Koppell to be his chief threat. Mr. Hynes said that he was proud of his work as District Attorney, and that he believed the state should profit from it.
"I never considered myself a historic figure," he said. "But you'd have to be fairly myopic to say I haven't done unique, nontraditional things. If the final epitaph is that I was an innovator for law enforcement, I'll be happy with that."
 
'More Creative'
 There are those who agree. "Perhaps his political instincts are what have allowed him to be more creative than all the other district attorneys," said Richard H. Girgenti, the director of criminal justice services for New York State.
Mr. Girgenti and others point to innovations by Mr. Hynes, like his program offering residential drug treatment to second-time nonviolent felony drug offenders, and his decision to divide Brooklyn into five zones as part of an effort at "community prosecution." The program was started to let the police work more closely with prosecutors and law enforcement operate more familiarly with specific neighborhoods.
He has also begun an unorthodox policy of allowing defense attorneys to have access to the prosecution's evidence early. The policy might allow defendants to build stronger cases, but Mr. Hynes asserts that it has quickened case dispositions by an average of 74 days.
"I have my fans and my detractors, and I understand that," Mr. Hynes said in a recent interview. "It doesn't bother me to take the shots. I'm a big boy."
 
'Politician on the Make'
 But Mr. Hynes has detractors who accuse him of placing politics before his job.
"He's another politician on the make, and his office is run in service to that," said Alan Broomer, a former prosecutor in Manhattan and State Supreme Court Justice in Brooklyn who criticized Mr. Hynes's early impact on the District Attorney's office before the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary in 1991. Mr. Broomer was later denied reappointment after 12 years on the bench.
"He's used the office for his own ends."
Certainly Mr. Hynes is seen as a vastly more complicated public figure than when he was first elected in 1989. Then, on the heels of his successful turn as the special prosecutor in the Howard Beach racial killing trial, he was widely perceived as a welcome figure of integrity and character. His work record -- which included jobs as special prosecutor for nursing home fraud and later police corruption, as well as the city's Fire Commissioner -- seemed tailor made for future success.
But then came all the difficulty of running law-enforcement efforts in a diverse, violent, politically volatile and economically imbalanced borough of more than two million people.
There was Crown Heights, with its failed prosecution of Lemrick Nelson Jr. in the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum, and the political tug of war over Mr. Hynes's efforts to have the Justice Department in Washington take over the prosecution. There was the police corruption scandal in the 73d Precinct, a case that also had to be turned over to Federal prosecutors, and a Police Department report on police corruption that faulted Mr. Hynes's previous work as special prosecutor.
There were charges of cronyism, too, as Mr. Hynes hired a number of high-salaried senior assistants with limited prosecutorial experience or none at all. He added as well a handful of his colleagues from his days as special prosecutor.
 
'Have I Fallen Down? Yes.'
 Mr. Hynes dismissed the charges of cronyism as frivolous and motivated by embittered former employees. "Everyone who is out of the prosecutorial loop in my office has defined responsibilities meant to deal with public safety in its broadest sense," he said.
"Am I capable of doing things that are wrong? Have I fallen down?" Mr. Hynes asked. "Yes. I'll let the people decide who I am."
According to statistics provided by the Office of Court Administration, over the last four years Mr. Hynes's office has lost jury verdict cases at a rate exceeded only by the Bronx District Attorney's office, where the District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, refuses to allow plea bargaining.
Mr. Hynes's office, once formally criticized by a State Supreme Court justice as possessing "little or no accountability," prevailed in only 67 percent of cases decided by juries in State Supreme Court in 1990, 64 percent in 1991, 62 percent in 1992 and 66 percent last year, the office's records say. The corresponding percentages in Manhattan range from 10 to 14 points higher.
 
Disputes Conviction Figures
 Mr. Hynes's office disputes those figures. Citing records that he said are kept by the Division of Criminal Justice Services, Mr. Hynes said the rate for 1993 was 73 percent. He said further that his own office's records indicated a conviction rate so far in 1994 of 76 percent.
"I don't know the internal workings of the office," said Ms. David, a supporter of Mr. Hynes who has contributed to his campaigns. "In the trenches, I haven't seen that it is that different from Liz Holtzman's tenure."
Mr. Hynes, who said he was concerned about the conviction rates, last year required every assistant district attorney trying a case to be accompanied by a supervisor in court. He said it is a sound method of training. His critics assert that he wanted to raise conviction rates in a hurry as he prepared for his 1993 re-election campaign and perhaps beyond.
No single case has drawn more attention to Mr. Hynes's office than the Crown Heights case, and no case has generated more fire. After one failed prosecution, Mr. Hynes decided to turn the case to the Justice Department when a new suspect emerged; critics say the move exemplified his tendency to let political concerns overwhelm his job as prosecutor.
Mr. Hynes argued that having Attorney General Janet Reno pursue a Federal civil-rights prosecution would cut down on further delays and offer maximum sentences for Mr. Nelson and another suspect, a stance scoffed at by some legal experts.
To others, the end result made sense.
"Did he handle it politically?" asked Noach Dear, a City Councilman who monitored the case. "He's a politician. You have to expect that. It's not a bad word. He saw to it that he got rid of it any way that he could."

HEADLINE: Building Owners May Face Fines for Leaving Graffiti

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., May 29

 BODY:
The City Council wants to fight graffiti, but rather than going after those who deface property, it is considering penalizing the owners of buildings who do not clean up graffiti fast enough.
The Council is scheduled to vote on June 7 on an ordinance saying that the owners of defaced buildings have 21 days to clean them up before being issued summonses and then fines from $100 to $1,000. An owner who does not cooperate could have a lien placed on his property for the amount of the cleanup. 
 "Sure, it'll be an expense, but it's probably covered under vandalism insurance," said Peter M. Beronio, director of the Englewood Economic Development Commission. "Maybe some people think it's unfair, but look, if someone throws a rock through your window you'd love the police to fix it, but you have to do it yourself or you'd get a property code violation."
Bob Benecke, Englewood's city manager, said the theory is that if graffiti is removed quickly enough, those who produce it will eventually get discouraged.
"These people want to see their art on the wall," he said. "Paint over your wall once and the artist comes back. But after you do it three or four times, eventually he'll get frustrated and move on."
 
Painted 'Again and Again'
 Not all property owners agree with him.
"I've painted over those initials and scribbles again and again, and before the paint dries, they're out there drawing again," said Victor Gurunathan, whose strip of eight stores downtown on West Palisade Avenue is a frequent target of graffiti. "My tenants say they're losing business because their stores are so unsightly."
Mr. Gurunathan said he considered himself twice victimized: first by the vandals and then by the city.
But another business owner, Joe Pizzari, proprietor of the Eagle paint store, said he thought Englewood was being generous in giving store owners three weeks to remove graffiti.
"It's a reflection of your business and of everyone else's, too, if you don't get rid of this stuff promptly," Mr. Pizzari said. "Look, if you're one of five landlords on a strip and you don't clean up the same day, pretty soon not only won't customers come to you, but they won't come into your neighbors' stores, either. At the very least, you owe it to them to treat your problem."
A veteran of the graffiti wars, Mr. Pizzari and his neighbors got together a year and a half ago, cleaning up any overnight vandalism by 8 the next morning. Soon the vandalism stopped.
"Leave it up and it's a cancer," Mr. Pizzari said. "But if you paint over it, they can't point it out proudly to their friends, which is what they want to do in the first place. I can't see why any landlord or homeowner should make such a big deal about this ordinance."
 
Night Patrols
 The graffiti ordinance grew out of the work of a task force set up to combat the problem. As part of the crackdown, the Council has also put a civilian zoning officer on night patrol each evening to ferret out fresh cases of graffiti; the officer is to notify the police if he sees work in progress.
A second part of the ordinance states that anyone under the age of 18 must must be accompanied by a parent to buy cans of spray paint from any paint or hardware store in town. Mr. Beronio said that he has also advised those store owners to move spray cans to the back and put them under cover.
Communities like neighboring Teaneck, Cliffside Park and Fort Lee in Bergen County have similar ordinances. Little Falls in Passaic County gives business owners 14 days to erase graffiti.
In Teaneck, violation notices go out to property owners in 10 days. Initial fines are $25 plus court costs.
"We're not being punitive, but you have to maintain your property," said Curtis Caviness, Teaneck's sanitary inspector. He cited a graffiti-marred Pic and Pay store, across from an elementary school, whose owner has been repeatedly fined.
"He keeps painting over with white paint," Mr. Caviness said. "Paint it over with dark brown paint. Maybe it won't look that attractive, but it would cover up all the graffiti."

HEADLINE: U.S. Machine Tool Orders Climb to a 12-Month High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Manufacturers' orders for American-made machine tools rose to the highest level in 12 months in April, up 11.7 percent from March and 18.8 percent from a year earlier, the Association for Manufacturing Technology reported yesterday.
Machine tool orders totaled $413.7 million in April, up from $370.4 million in March. The monthly report covers metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools, which are used to manufacture goods from household appliances to aircraft engines. 
 Machine tool orders are considered a gauge of future economic activity. A rise is viewed as an indication that businesses feel confident enough that their sales will grow to justify investing in new equipment.
Albert W. Moore, president of the association, said the continued growth in domestic orders coupled with the nearly doubling of foreign orders was an especially good sign.
"Continued growth in domestic orders reflects a broadening of demand beyond the auto industry," Mr. Moore said. "The pickup in export orders is a good sign. A rebound in export demand is essential to a sustained growth of demand for U.S. manufactured products."
Machine tool shipments totaled $343.6 million in April, up 7.9 percent from March's $318.6 million and 35.4 percent ahead of the year-earlier amount of $253.7 million.
So far this year, machine tool shipments have totaled $1.16 billion, up 8.3 percent from the $1.07 billion shipped during the first four months of last year.
The most significant rise in orders was in foreign markets. Total export orders rose 85.1 percent in April, to $21.1 million, from $11.4 million in March. Total domestic orders for April rose 9.4 percent, to $392.6 million, from $359 million the month before.
The backlog of unfilled orders for machine tools in April was $1.68 billion, up from $1.61 billion in March and $1.4 billion in April 1994.

HEADLINE: For 4 Collegial Congressmen, Life Looks a Lot Like College

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Sam cooks, Dick cleans, George collects the rent and Chuck raids the refrigerator. Weeknights, they shoot the breeze in their underwear in the Capitol Hill town house where two of them sleep in unkempt beds in the living room like so many superannuated frat boys, and check to see if anyone they know turns up on "Nightline."
Weekdays, as members of Congress, these four help make the trade, farm, environmental and crime laws of the United States. Their little den on D Street may be the capital's highest-powered political domicile outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, so celebrated that it became the subject of a proposed TV sitcom called "Four in the House." (The President has a standing invitation, but hasn't come so far.) 
 For Representatives Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, George Miller of California and Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, Washington life is not all beer and roses. It's more like beer and frozen soy burgers, stale tortilla chips, lost laundry, monthly trips to Price Club and weekly commutes to their districts and families back home.
"My father was in the California State Senate, and he used to say that the worst thing was going home to an empty hotel room in Sacramento," said Mr. Miller, a 20-year veteran from the San Francisco area who bought the two-bedroom house in the late 1970's and began sharing it to save money in 1983 when his wife moved back to California so his second son could go to school there. "If you don't have a family here, and don't do something like this, you succumb to the receptions. We've seen a lot of members who've gotten in trouble here, and it's usually out of loneliness."
The other night, as the Congressmen shared pizza amid the clutter of golf clubs, a doorside basketball hoop and ancient albums like "The Mamas and the Papas 20 Golden Hits," the worst trouble they got into was installing a huge air-conditioner in the front window. The only argument was what to watch on television (the vote was 3 to 1 for the Knicks game, with Mr. Gejdenson a lone holdout for the Discovery Channel).
Yet over the years, the house has provided much more than fellowship for its Democratic kitchen caucus. Its original foursome included Representative Leon Panetta of California, who had to move out after he became President Clinton's budget director last year (bequeathing his bed to Mr. Schumer, who had been stuck on a fuzzy orange fold-out couch). Marty Russo of Illinois left after losing his seat in 1992, but not before talking out his proposal for a universal health-care bill with his roomies one midnight when he was not indulging his penchant for doing laundry.
 
A Tradition of Sleeping Cheap
 It was here, too, that proposals for the alternative minimum income tax and clearer disclosure of credit-card interest rates were hatched.
"You put your idea out there, and the first instinct is not to applaud you," Mr. Gejdenson said drily. "You can run the traps pretty well here. Chuck always talked to us before he called Janet Reno and told her what to do on the crime bill."
Sleeping cheap is a Congressional tradition. In the late 1840's, Representative Abraham Lincoln shared space in a Capitol Hill boardinghouse, and more than a century later, Allard Lowenstein lived on his office couch as a Congressman from Nassau County. What makes the Miller house special is its combination of diverse and influential members.
Mr. Miller, 49, is chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources and was mentioned as a possible Interior Secretary when it seemed President Clinton might nominate Bruce Babbitt to the Supreme Court. Mr. Schumer, 43, leads the Judiciary Committee's panel on crime and criminal justice; Mr. Durbin, 49, heads the Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on agriculture (and is thus a member of the so-called College of Cardinals who guard the gates of spending), while Mr. Gejdenson, 46, runs the subcommittee on economic policy and trade of the foreign affairs committee and is close to Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
"Tip O'Neill used to see us in the morning and say, 'Uh-oh, what's gone on in the house last night," Mr. Miller recalled of the former Speaker.
 
Better Than a Futon
 For Mr. Durbin, who commutes to Lincoln's old hometown of Springfield, Ill. (48 round trips last year), his current home is a step up from his old digs, with Representative Richard Lehman of California. "I slept on the floor on a futon deal," he said. "Here I had a chance to get a bedroom," because Mr. Schumer waived his seniority rights and let him take one of the private rooms on the second floor.
When Mr. Durbin, a former staff member for the Illinois State Senate, came to Washington 11 years ago, the oldest of his three children had just started high school, and moving the whole family was "never really a viable financial option for me." The alternative, he said, "was to live two hours out in the suburbs and commute, and there was no way to have a home as I knew it."
So instead, he heads home each week, Thursday nights if possible, and has endured the guilt of nearly missing one child's eighth-grade graduation and constant delays. "My best time ever was 3 hours and 15 minutes," he said. "You don't want to know the worst."
Mr. Gejdenson is the only one among the group who doesn't have to go far to see his 14-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son; they live a few blocks away with his wife, from whom he is separated pending a divorce. "The hardest part is there's really no place for my daughter to stay here," Mr. Gejdenson said, since his bed is just a few steps from Mr. Schumer's on one side and the big open kitchen on the other.
Last summer, the group was joined by Mr. Miller's younger son, Stephen, who had an internship at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "He refused to sleep with me, so he slept on the floor," Mr. Miller said.
Mr. Schumer almost never stays more than two nights a week, preferring to fly home -- one night at a time, if necessary -- to his wife and two daughters in Park Slope. When his colleagues changed into khakis, blue jeans and moccasins to greet a visitor, he stayed in his blue suit and sock feet, the only clothing he brings with him except for a change of underwear and shirts. What if he spills something?
"He wears it anyway," Mr. Miller answers. "Can't you tell?"
 
Call It 'Ironic Crazy'
 After years of friendship, the housemates communicate in a Morse code camaraderie that Janice Berman, the wife of Representative Howard L. Berman of California, sought to reflect when she wrote her sitcom scenario four years ago. The show got as far as a pilot script by the Broadway librettist Peter Stone, but was never produced, in part because Ms. Berman vetoed the final version.
"It didn't capture the essence of what I wanted to show," Ms. Berman said in a telephone interview. "Things happen here that are kind of crazy. But they're not stupid crazy, they're just ironic crazy. If it's a sitcom, everyone is stupid."
It is hard to imagine how fiction could be stranger than the truth of Mr. Schumer's once killing crickets with paint cans in the middle of the night. ("Leon and I heard this chirping, and what do I know?" he said. "I never slept in a tent.") Or the upstairs roommates creeping down one night to whisper to the sleeping Mr. Schumer, whose sweet tooth they knew too well, "Chuuuck, Chuuuck . . . there are Klondike Bars in the freezer," only to hear his barefoot trek and the sounds of eating in bed.
Or Mr. Gejdenson, the designated shopper whose culinary specialty is pre-cooked frozen onions atop premade all-vegetable patties, buying new padded folding chairs in anticipation of a Presidential visit.
"We were going to invite the First Lady," Mr. Durbin deadpanned. "She was doing a tour of Congressional homes. But then we thought, nooooo."
Often, their schedules are so hectic, and different, that the housemates see one another just a few minutes a week. Other times, they have group gatherings.
"Once we watched 'Dr. Strangelove' on TV as we were getting dressed in the morning," Mr. Miller said, his broad face creasing into a grin. "You remember that? There we were, tying our ties, just laughing."
And at lights out, do they end the day as a family?
"Yeah, we do that," Mr. Miller said. "We say, 'Goodnight, Chuck-boy."

Those students of the 1960's, your mothers and fathers, were in the grip of a powerful idea -- the idea of equality -- whose time they hastened and whose force overcame the tread of mighty armies of racism and segregation. They took that maturing experience to become pioneers themselves, blazing trails in corporate America in government and in the professions. You may think that's ancient history, events that happened before you were born. But the struggle is not over. Yesterday's students began something that today's young people must finish. For despite the tremendous gains that have taken place over the past three decades, too much -- far too much -- remains the same. Discrimination still flourishes, although it is now illegal. . . . You must enter into the serious business of helping black people survive and thrive in the 21st century.

 Our society finds truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form, truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach. What Moses brought down from Mount Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions. They are commandments. Are, not were. The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify in a handful of words acceptable human behavior, not just for then or now, but for all time. . . . The tension between those commandments and our baser instincts provides grist for journalism's daily mill. What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Fifth through Tenth Commandments. . . . Tell me if this doesn't remind you of something: 'Honor thy mother and father. Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness.' Sounds like a script outline for the story of the Menendez brothers, doesn't it?

I had a bad uncle named Dan, who said a male can't be a man unless he'd gone to war. But I had a good uncle named Alex, who said, when life was most agreeable -- and it could be just a pitcher of lemonade in the shade -- he would say, "If this isn't nice, what is?" . . . Now, if he hadn't said that so regularly, maybe five or six times a month, we might not have paused to notice how rewarding life can be sometimes. Perhaps my good Uncle Alex will live on in some of you members of the Syracuse Class of 1994 if, in the future, you will pause to say out loud every so often, "If this isn't nice, what is?"

I was thinking -- just as an example of how much the times influence what a person does with his life -- if Abraham Lincoln were alive today, would he be standing here making his Gettysburg Address and saying, "Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation . . ."? Of course not. The nation isn't new any more. He'd have to say, "Ten score and 18 years ago." . . . Lincoln would probably be a relatively obscure lawyer who was turned down for the Supreme Court because he and Mary had a live-in maid for whom they never paid Social Security.

I have only a brief word for the class of 1994, namely that you are now part of a tradition of rich Quakerism on the one hand, but also of grand but still flawed democratic tradition on the other. I think T. S. Eliot was absolutely right when he wrote in 1919 that tradition is not something you inherit. If you want it, you must obtain it with great labor. It is a perennial process. And it means then that one is going to have to cut radically against the American grain, because it means on the one hand, you are going to have to have a sense of history and understand the present as history. And in my own humble opinion, the major forms of idolatry of our day are the market way of life and the tribal way of life.

No. There are crimes against humanity and against freedom committed every day in countless countries across the world, and America does not go in, guns blazing, to make it right. Instead we lead by example. . . . If we are to maintain our credibility as an economic and moral influence, then we must deal with our problems, like the deficit and crime. And we must remember and teach the values that made America great -- values like decency, honesty and individual responsibility.

Decades of legally dehumanizing all races but white were buried under an avalanche of paper ballots. Yet there was not one of us witnessing history in Pretoria, as representatives of the United States, who didn't comprehend that what was ending in South Africa as a matter of law was thriving in our own country as a matter of practice. The long moral finger of outrage that we for so long had pointed at South Africa was now more properly directed at ourselves.

Twenty-two years later, the people of my class are getting cash out of a machine, dinner out of a clown's mouth and it isn't even possible to get a human being on the phone at the phone company. In Los Angeles, my only chance of having a meaningful encounter with a person is if I smash into one with my car. . . . You've grown up in a strange time where people seem more bonded by the bad stuff than the good. Where in a lot of communities the main common link between neighbors is that everyone knows someone who's been mugged. Everyone knows someone in rehab. And everyone's been touched by a life that ended way too soon. If you want something to change, you personally have to do something different. You have to take a stand when it isn't convenient. Try something nobody else has tried. Defy your own group. Rebel against yourself. Knock down your walls and get out of your way.

HEADLINE: Defaults Rise, Posing Peril For Housing

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As the Giuliani administration tries to rid the city of the expensive task of managing thousands of homes and apartment buildings taken for nonpayment of taxes, a new wave of defaults is threatening to burden the city with thousands of additional units.
The number of buildings in which owners have fallen seriously behind in their taxes has risen sharply in the last five years, from 13,737 in 1989, to 18,003 in 1993. 
 Even more troubling to city officials is that as the number of buildings in default has risen, the number of owners rescuing their properties by paying off taxes has dropped precipitously.
The properties are mostly decrepit structures ranging from single-family homes to large apartment buildings with more than 100 units, generally in poor neighborhoods.
 
Priority on Mayor's Agenda
 The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has the task of managing these properties, puts the annual average cost at $3,000 per housing unit. The city is expected to spend about $100 million this year. And that cost does not include the taxes lost when the city takes over.
Since his campaign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has made it clear that a priority on his housing agenda would be to cut this management burden. Earlier this month he reiterated the goal when he told the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a research organization, that divesting of city-owned property was more than a solution to a fiscal problem.
"By saving millions through the process of divesting itself of property," he said, the city "can, instead of trying to run property, concentrate on stimulating private ownership." The money saved with divestiture, he suggested, could be used to restore properties, for low-cost loans and to rehabilitate abandoned brownstones.
Because of the lingering effects of the recession, which has made it difficult for tenants to pay their rents and landlords to pay their taxes, housing and taxation experts have been warning of a surge in property tax foreclosures for more than two years. But the impact has been delayed because the number of takeovers by the city -- a process known as vesting -- has slowed to a trickle.
The most recent round of vestings was in Queens last September. In Brooklyn, where the number of buildings in default is the highest of any borough with 6,224 in 1993, the city has not foreclosed on any property in two years.
Eamon Moynihan, a spokesman for the Finance Department, the city agency responsible for assessing and collecting taxes, said staff cuts and the increase in properties whose owners are in arrears have substantially slowed the foreclosure process.
The city must search the titles of each delinquent property, Mr. Moynihan said, so anyone who has an interest can be notified before foreclosure.
 
Vulnerability of Tenants
 But some housing advocates say the longer the city postpones the day of reckoning, the higher the eventual cost will be and the more vulnerable tenants in these buildings are to being left homeless.
"By putting off the vesting process for months on end, the city is spending more in the long run," said David R. Jones, executive director of the Community Service Society, a housing, health and education advocacy group for the poor. "As disinvestment in these building escalates, there is no one around to hold things together. By the time the city takes the buildings, they are in terrible shape and what could have been a moderate rehab is a $100,000 job. No one has that kind of money anymore."
The Finance Department's backlog may have bought some time for tax-delinquent landlords. But in addition to the prospect of losing their properties in foreclosure, owners with outstanding tax bills face interest penalties when they settle.
A report by the society showed that most vulnerable buildings were in central Harlem in Manhattan, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Bushwick in Brooklyn, and Mott Haven in the Bronx.
The statistics show the potential for a crisis. At the end of 1989, the city had tax-arrears notices on file for 13,737 properties. By the end of last year, there were 18,003 properties on the list. In the same period, however, the number of owners getting off the list in a given year declined sharply, from 12,472 in 1989, to 5,691 last year.
The city moves to take buildings when owners fall behind on taxes, sewer and water charges. Mr. Moynihan, the Department of Finance spokesman, said the city files a notice of foreclosure when a property is 12 months behind if its annual tax bill is $2,750 or more. For buildings with lower tax bills, the notice goes out after 36 months of arrears.
Despite the trouble on the horizon, the number of defaults does not match those of the 1970's, when tax arrears and abandonments peaked and the city was taking as many as 10,000 properties a year.
In the mid-1980's, as property values rose, owners were more inclined to try to hold on to their buildings. Since then, the housing department has made steady gains in reducing its housing responsibility, mostly by devising programs to turn buildings over to tenants or nonprofit housing groups or by selling then to private landlords.
In 1986 the department managed 39,551 units in 3,944 properties. As of March of this year, the agency was in charge of 30,826 units in 3,098 buildings. City officials cannot indicate precisely the composition but estimate that one-third are in one- to four-family homes, with the rest in apartment buildings and large multifamily dwellings.
But as the department was working to rid itself of these buildings, the city's real-estate market began to unravel after the stock market crash of October 1987. Landlords had less incentive to try to keep their buildings, and as the recession began reducing the number of jobs in the city, tenants fell behind on their rents.
At the same time, landlords faced higher operating costs, particularly increases in water and sewer fees that resulted from the city's move to a metering system for water charges. Because of the burden on some owners, the city is reviewing the practice and has declared a moratorium on increases in such fees.
Landlords and their advocates link the problem of rising defaults largely to the city system of rent regulations that limit rent increases for many owners. The margin of profit for owners of small buildings like many of those now in arrears is so narrow, they say, that if only one or two tenants stop paying rent can been the kind of financial drain from which an owner cannot recover.
Christine Lippus, the owner of a six-unit building in Bushwick, said she was barely hanging on. So far she has kept up with her tax bills, but she said she did not know how long she would be able to say that. "Some months I don't have enough to pay for this place," she said. "But I live here, too, and if I give up, where will I go?"
Monthly rents range from $218.32 to $476.61 on the apartments, which are all four-room units. Housing experts say it costs about $450 a unit to operate a building.
 
'Bad for the City'
 City Councilman Archie Spigner, a Democrat whose Brooklyn district includes some of the most distressed neighborhoods, has held hearings on abandonment and disinvestment throughout the city.
"We are on the verge of a catastrophe," said Mr. Spigner, chairman of the Committee on Housing and Buildings. "We need to alter public policy to allow private owners a way of keeping their buildings. The current situation is bad for tenants, bad for communities and bad for the city."
Mr. Spigner has advocated loosening regulations limiting rent increases in privately owned apartment buildings. He said one reason for the high number of defaults was that owners who paid inflated prices for properties in the 1980's have high mortgages and other expenses that cannot be covered by regulated rents.
Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said the city would be troubled by these properties as long as the ownership and management of low-income housing was not an economically viable enterprise.
"The root cause of the problem is that there are a lot of poor people in the city who cannot afford to pay rent at a level that makes it economical to maintain their buildings," said Mr. Braconi, who added that he did not believe that rent decontrol would solve the problem.
"The solution," he said, "will come only through a combined effort at the local and Federal levels that includes support for owners of low-income housing and for tenants."

HEADLINE: Ambivalence Like Rye's May Re-elect Cuomo

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Ask the residents of this Westchester County town to assess the state of New York State and the response sounds at first like a living advertisement for why Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is sure to be swept from office this November.
Their property taxes drift upward each year. Jobs keep fleeing once-redoubtable local companies like I.B.M. And while their azalea-filled town remains safe enough that car keys are sometimes left in the ignition overnight, they look at crime in New York City and plead for the death penalty. 
 But among the affluent, educated residents here who typify the suburban swing voters vital to Mr. Cuomo's re-election, politics, it seems, is not such a clear-cut thing: as many would give him a fourth term as would oust him. Indeed, as Mr. Cuomo prepares to receive the Democratic nomination in Buffalo this week, he might look to the ambivalence of Rye to understand both why he is in deep trouble this year, and why he is still in the race.
In dozens of recent interviews, people repeatedly said they longed for changes in the state government. "A change of blood always is better," said Alexander Litvinoff, 53, who owns a dry-cleaning shop in town. "New York is a stale state. There has been nothing good for the last three years."
 
Wary of the G.O.P.
 But that didn't always translate into a throw-the-bum-out mentality. Even many of his detractors said they admired Mr. Cuomo's intellect, integrity and speech making. And though the majority were registered Republicans, many expressed wariness of the Republican Party, whose 1990 gubernatorial candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, was referred to time and again as "a joke."
"I'm a Republican and I vote the Republican line," said Jim Finneran, 47, who owns The Pub, a bar in town. "But I don't think they stand a chance. They just don't match up against the Democrats statewide."
Rye is not exactly Everytown, U.S.A. The shirts in the stores are made of silk and linen, the coffee at the grocery store is Sumatran, the cars along the dogwood-lined streets are typically Volvos and Mercedeses. At a recent City Council meeting, the main topic of discussion was whether to hire a new caterer at the city golf course.
According to the 1990 census, 90 percent of Rye's 15,000 residents were white, 43 percent had a college education or better and two out of three owned their own homes. The median household income was $72,863, about double the rest of the state.
In three previous elections, Mr. Cuomo has won because he and the Republicans split the vote in suburban towns like this one. In Rye itself, where independents are almost as numerous as Democrats and where Republicans outnumber both by three to two, Mr. Cuomo has easily outpolled Republican rivals in his last two races.
But this year Mr. Cuomo's approval rating, at about 36 percent, is near the lowest in his tenure as governor. Crime and taxes, the voter concerns cited most in polls, are traditional Republican issues. And the endorsed Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki, is almost the embodiment of the typical swing voter: grandchild of immigrants, Westchester native, Roman Catholic, Ivy League-educated.
"To some degree Pataki is the swing voter," said a Democratic Party strategist. "The question now is, can he prove he's as attuned to their problems as the Governor is?"
At The Pub, in the heart of Rye's small, boutique-filled shopping district, that question seemed premature because no one knew much about Mr. Pataki. But the patrons were sure of one thing: they were tired of Mario Cuomo.
"He's putting us into the poor house with taxes," said Philip McGovern, 42, a general contractor, as he sipped beer and munched on a hot dog. "This is the only state where you can get a vasectomy on state aid, but the average guy can't get his teeth cleaned. They pay $3,000 a month for putting homeless people in hotels. Who's in charge? Mario wants the kudos, but he doesn't want to make the hard political decisions."
But many residents' disgust with Mr. Cuomo was accompanied by disenchantment with what they saw as a perpetually weak Republican Party.
"If the Republicans put up a viable candidate, my vote is open," said Ted Carroll, 37, the chief financial officer for a Manhattan media company, as he rushed for a morning train clutching a newspaper. "But if it's another Rinfret, forget it. Maybe Howard Stern is the guy."
Citing the two issues that Republicans think will be Mr. Cuomo's downfall, almost everyone interviewed said they supported the death penalty -- Mr. Cuomo has vetoed it 12 years running -- and believed that taxes were too high.
But most people said Mr. Cuomo's stand on capital punishment was not reason enough to vote against him because it seemed rooted in deep moral principles. "I'm for the death penalty, but it doesn't bother me that he's not," said Terry Demas, 56, who runs a video and film store in town. "It's what he believes in."
And unlike in New Jersey, where former Governor Jim Florio drew intense voter ire by raising sales and income taxes, few could pinpoint a single tax that Mr. Cuomo was directly responsible for raising.
That, however, did not mitigate all the anger. "How do we feel about Mario Cuomo? I can sum it up in one sentence: we're moving out," said Emanuel Mafilios, 35, a national sales representative for a plastics company.
Mr. Mafilios, his wife and young daughter are looking to buy a house in nearby Westport, Conn., because property taxes there are 40 percent lower than in Rye, they said. Though Mr. Mafilios knows Mr. Cuomo does not set local property taxes, he ticked off a litany of complaints about the Governor's tenure: climbing welfare costs, inadequate budget policies, higher automobile registration fees and faltering schools.
"He's really slick; he's got an answer for everything," Mr. Mafilios said. "But things don't get better."
Residents were divided over whether to blame Mr. Cuomo for the state's job losses in recent years: more than 500,000 between 1989 and 1993. Some said it was a result of the national recession; others said it was the result of high business costs directly attributable to Mr. Cuomo's policies.
"I don't think you can point a finger at the recession anymore," said Peter Jovanovich, who works for a book publishing company in Manhattan. "You have to ask why is New York doing so much less well than other regions."
Still, Mr. Jovanovich, 45, a registered Republican, said he was pleased that Mr. Cuomo had proposed cutting some business taxes this year. "If he's recognizing he's killing the goose that lays the golden egg, I'll consider him."
 
Respect for Intelligence
 Just as his detractors often could not pinpoint taxes he had raised, Mr. Cuomo's supporters rarely could name a program or policy of his that they liked. More often, their approval was based on respect for what they consider his intelligence, articulateness and honesty.
"He's a fine person who works very hard and is a great speaker," said Andrea McDonald, 32, a mother of three and a registered Republican. "It's what you don't hear. All the things that happen in New York City and its scandals. You never hear about that with him."
Mark Anast, the owner of an upscale jeans store in downtown Rye, said: "I don't think he has anything to prove. He doesn't owe anyone anything. He's not in anybody's pocket."
But if Mr. Cuomo's aides fear any single thing this year, it is the sense among some voters that 12 years is long enough for anyone to be governor. Though that was not a universal complaint in Rye, it could be detected in the voices of a few who wanted someone like Ross Perot to run for governor.
"A guy like that can shake the tree a little, and you need somebody like that," said Harold Aken, 36, a local fireman and lifelong resident. "We're a little too complacent. A little change is good."

HEADLINE: Farm Equipment Sales Make Surprising Gains

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 30

 BODY:
After more than a decade of drastic cost-cutting, losses and consolidation, farm equipment makers have been repeatedly surprising Wall Street lately with sharp earnings increases, thanks to stronger-than-expected sales of tractors, combines and other equipment.
The latest sign of revival came last week when Deere & Company, the venerable market leader, reported earning $189.3 million, a big gain over last year's performance, in its fiscal second quarter and far more than Wall Street stock analysts had expected. Its worldwide agricultural equipment sales for the quarter jumped 19 percent from a year ago, to more than $1.3 billion.
 
Restructuring Praised
 "Deere and the entire industry have done a fantastic job of restructuring," said John McGinty, who follows the equipment makers from Boston for CS First Boston. "When volume goes up, earnings take off." 
 Sales of tractors and combines in the United States were up 16 percent in the first four months of this year, an acceleration from the overall rate of just under 10 percent in 1993, according to the most recent estimate by the Equipment Manufacturers Institute, a trade group based here. The growth puts the industry on track for its best year since 1990, and analysts say conditions are ripe for the recovery to continue.
Farm incomes are high, interest rates are relatively low and debts are at the lowest levels since the early 1960's. Also, many farmers need new equipment because they bought so little during the 1980's and much of what they are using now is aged, patched-up and limping along or is ill suited to newer, conservation-oriented planting techniques. And with total acreage planted in corn and soybeans up this year, many farmers need new machinery to deal efficiently with the larger workload.
"There comes a time when you've just got to do something," said Dan Troyer, an Indiana farmer who has spent about $285,000 for two new Case International tractors and a combine in the last year, his first major purchases in five years.
Robert Combs, a Deere spokesman, said, "The excitement at the retail level is higher than it's been in years."
All of this has caught the attention of investors, who have bid up the shares of Deere and other publicly traded farm equipment makers. Tenneco Inc. responded last month by announcing plans to raise about $500 million by selling at least 35 percent of its J. I. Case subsidiary to the public. The deal will make the 152-year-old Case, based in Racine, Wis., a public-traded enterprise for the first time since 1970.
 
Makers Moving Gingerly
 Still, rather than rushing to stoke the current sales upturn, Deere, Case, the Ford New Holland subsidiary of Fiat and other equipment makers are moving gingerly, as if they scarely recognize the economic terrain confronting them after so many wrenching changes. Rather than letting inventories rise in anticipation of robust demand, they are keeping production schedules tightly matched to orders and gradually scaling back on discounts, extended warranties and other inducements they have used to increase sales in the past.
The biggest reason for caution is that American farming has changed too much for history to be a reliable guide to demand. To start with, there are fewer farmers, and the biggest ones, who buy most of the equipment, shop cautiously after having seen the disastrous results of borrowing too heavily in the 1980's.
Also, many farmers are more willing than before to hire others to harvest, spray or plant, rather than invest in new equipment.
They also use soil-conserving planting and tilling methods that may require new attachments but that allow their tractors, which are much more expensive, to last years longer than they did in the past.
The equipment producers are also worried about overextending themselves at home because the outlook in Europe is so dismal. Many American manufacturers have major operations there that focus on equipment suited for Europe's smaller farms. Unit sales in Europe have fallen 50 percent since the early 1980's and no end to the decline is in sight. Farmers' incomes there are declining as government subsidies are reduced.
 
Constant Price Wars in Europe
 With a highly fragmented market, weak local farm equipment companies there engage in constant price wars as they struggle for enough of the shrinking pie to avoid bankruptcy. And while developing countries are potentially huge markets, few farmers there can afford the technology-rich machinery now being made in the developed world.
The quest for higher sales volumes is crucial to prospects for higher profits because equipment makers are finding growing resistance to price increases. Farmers are upset that prices for tractors and combines, the industry's two big-ticket items, have jumped more than 225 percent since the 1970's while crop prices have risen just 40 percent. Manufacturers say the new equipment is worth it because it is much more productive, but experts who track equipment purchases, like Dennis M. Conley at the University of Nebraska, say that sales drop 2.3 percent every time tractor prices are raised 1 percent.
One sign of resistance is the strong market for used equipment. Another is the accelerating sales of Belarus Machinery Inc., the Milwaukee-based distributor of tractors and combines from the former Soviet Union. Belarus's machinery has a reputation for being ponderous, less reliable and primitive compared with the newest models from companies like Deere, Case, and Ford New Holland, but it sells for as much as 40 percent less.
"The big guys have moved away from what farmers can afford," said E. W. Muehlhausen, Belarus's manager of operations.
 
A Chastening Tumble

The industry has certainly had plenty of practice at belt-tightening, having struggled through a crash in demand in the early 1980's followed by a chastening tumble in 1991 and 1992 that cut short a rebound.
Some big names did not survive. International Harvester, the one-time industry leader whose origins date to the invention of the mechanical reaper in 1831, was absorbed by Case in 1985. That was one of five major deals in the mid-1980's that cut production capacity in half as demand plummeted and the industry lost billions of dollars. Overall employment fell nearly 60 percent, from almost 160,000 people in 1979 to 66,000 in 1986.
The consolidation continued after a rebound in the late 80's. Ford, having previously merged with New Holland Inc., ended up last year as a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, ending ties to agriculture dating to Henry Ford's days as a pioneer tractor builder. And Massey-Ferguson, still the world's largest tractor maker despite having lost much of its North American market, was sold last month to the AGCO Corporation, a holding company based in Norcross, Ga.
One old face angling to squeeze back into the fray is Caterpillar Inc., which began as a maker of steam-driven farm tractors more than a century ago in California. Cat, the world's largest construction equipment company, had all but disappeared from agriculture by 1987, when it introduced high-powered tractors that roll on rubber tracks instead of wheels. Next year it will begin shipping the first lower-horsepower Challengers, aimed at grain farmers with operations as small as 800 acres, promoting them as vehicles that can operate in fields too wet for wheeled tractors.
 
Sales Peaked in 1973
 No one expects a return to the glory days of the 1970's, when huge export deals with the Soviet Union and high inflation rates that encouraged heavy borrowing and expansion had equipment flying off the dealers' lots and had factories operating at more than 80 percent of capacity. Domestic tractor sales peaked at nearly 157,000 in 1973, and 139,000 were sold in 1979. More than 30,000 combines a year were sold during the decade.
The bottom came in 1986, when annual sales of tractors fell to 47,000 units and combines to below 10,000. Dealers desperate to move inventory were selling products at half their list price. A strong dollar only made matters worse for the manufacturers, crimping exports and giving companies like Kubota of Japan a chance to invade the American market. At one point, Case simply stopped manufacturing entirely for 75 days.
Today, inventories are down to a half a year's sales for major companies, less than half of the level they stood at when the current rebound began. Dealers complain that they have to order some products as much as a year in advance.
Some smaller "short-line" companies that focus on one or two types of products are actually stretched beyond capacity. Kinze Manufacturing Inc., which makes planters and grain wagons, increased production capacity by 50 percent last year but still had to stop taking 1994 orders just six weeks after it opened the books last summer.
"We're completely sold out," said Jon Kinzenbaw, president of the privately held company based in Williamsburg, Iowa.

HEADLINE: Job Market Gains Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The job market is expected to improve slightly this summer, bolstered by strength in construction, manufacturing and retailing, a quarterly survey said yesterday.
The forecast, by Manpower Inc., a temporary-employment company based in Milwaukee, showed increased optimism for all regions, with the South and Midwest having the most job opportunities and the Northeast and West lagging. 
 Manpower said that 29 percent of employers interviewed said they intended to increase hiring in the July-September quarter and that 7 percent projected decreases.
"It will be the best summer since 1989," said Michael Evans, an economist and president of the Evans Group, based in Boca Raton, Fla.
Manpower said the biggest gains were expected in construction, wholesale and retail businesses and manufacturing and the weakest in transportation, public utilities, education and other service industries.

HEADLINE: New York Hospitals Are Facing A Sharp Increase in Empty Beds

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

 BODY:
The number of empty hospital beds in the New York City area is growing steadily, only a few years after patients faced a critical shortage of space. The reduced demand has already shut down entire wings and caused layoffs of almost 2,000 workers over the last two years, hospital officials say.
The decrease in demand comes after a similar trend emerged nationwide, driven in part by a turn to health maintenance organizations that emphasize preventive and outpatient care. And the decline is expected to continue. 
 "They were having trouble finding space for their patients, and now they're having trouble finding patients for their space," said Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the state Health Department. "In the late 80's they were concerned about having the capacity to keep their business going, but in the brave new world of reform there's a much more long-term concern about the hospitals' survival."
The average daily census of patients in New York City hospitals last year was 19,667 people, or 81.6 percent of available beds, according to the state Health Department. That was a decline of more than 4 percent from the average of 20,536 two years earlier.
Public health experts also attribute the decline to medical advances that have shortened patient stays, and to some extent, a reduction in the length of stay of AIDS patients, as more care has become available at home, in hospices or on an outpatient basis.
As a result, state health department officials say they expect the size of hospitals in New York City, its suburbs and the state as a whole to shrink by 20 percent in the next five years. And inevitably, said Dr. Mark R. Chassin, the state health commissioner, a number of institutions will be forced to close.
"I think there are going to be a lot of hospital closures," Dr. Chassin said, "and I hope we can manage that in a way that won't cause access problems in rural as well as inner-city areas."
Marc H. Lory, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, said, "I'd be lying if I said we weren't nervous, but I guess all of us are sort of hoping it's the other guy."
Columbia-Presbyterian recently laid off 350 of its 6,735 workers and closed a unit with 166 of its 1,460 beds -- temporarily, he said, until administrators see whether the trend holds. He said the hospital started thinking about closing beds and taking other economy measures about 18 months ago.
Large institutions are not as vulnerable as smaller, community hospitals, which are most at risk. But excess capacity is encouraging larger hospitals to merge with smaller ones that will feed them patients who need high-tech care in return for protection from extinction.
And ultimately, proponents of community health care say the declining demand for inpatient services will force all hospitals to redefine themselves, by shifting much of their work to outpatient clinics that provide primary care, with fewer, smaller hospitals left to tend only the sickest patients.
Gerry Hudson, executive vice president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care workers, said the future of the health care system depends upon the hospitals' ability to convert to a primary care system that will transfer its resources to community clinics, where health care is in short supply.
"We're looking for funds for a conversion plan pretty much like the military has," he said, to retrain health care workers for employment in new settings. "If you do it any other way you'd have huge layoffs." He said a vast reduction would devastate the local economy, in which the health care industry in a leading employer.
In some ways, the situation is analogous to the downsizing of the military, with some in the industry arguing that major reductions could leave communities vulnerable to surprise assaults like the AIDS epidemic and the resurgence of tuberculosis.
"AIDS teaches us we ought to expect the unexpected, and there are reasons to be cautious about how much smaller the system gets," said David A. Gould, vice president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a philanthropic, policy and research organization.
He said a new generation of surgical procedures still being developed, like gene therapy, for example, could soon create new demand for hospital beds. "Volatility makes it difficult to plan," he said, adding that the real danger for patients in a shrinking industry is not the hospitals that have closed but those that are struggling to remain open. "The two or three years before they close, do you really want to be a patient in one of those places?" he asked.
But in both public and private New York City hospitals, the number of empty beds has increased sharply since mid-1992, with an occupancy rate dipping from over 90 percent at the height of the hospital bed shortage in the late 80's to 85.7 percent in 1991 and 81.6 percent in 1993, according to the state Health Department.
As the trend continues, some hospitals are trimming excess capacity as aggressively as possible, convinced that hospitals of the future will be significantly smaller. Others have taken a wait-and-see approach, hoping to protect their investment in the beds they have now.
 
Shorter Stays, More Patients
 The average length of stay also decreased by half a day over the last year, said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
"We dropped a full day in length of stay in a little over a year," said Mr. Lory, of Columbia-Presbyterian. "That may not seem like a lot, but if you take the size of our institution, one day equals 1,400 empty beds."
Columbia-Presbyterian is at relatively low risk, he said, because it maintains a high turnover of patients.
To remain solvent, hospitals are in the difficult and rather paradoxical position of trying to attract more patients but for shorter stays. That is because New York is one of only two states in the country -- Maryland is the other -- that reimburse the hospital based on the diagnosis rather than the number of days a patient stays, even if the patient is privately insured. The state's reimbursement policy means the hospital makes more money by discharging patients quickly, since it is paid the same whether the patient stays a day or a month.
Other hospitals that have cut their inpatient capacity include St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which this spring eliminated a total of 53 beds in two medical and surgery units and two psychiatric inpatient units, resulting in some layoffs. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center cut 80 beds in two medical and surgery units between 1989 and 1992 after a concerted effort to reduce their patients' length of stay. The hospital reports that since the cutbacks its occupancy rates have risen to about 90 percent.
"We've been proactive and tried to move on this ourselves," said George Vecchione, director of New York Hospital.
The emptiest wings in most hospitals these days are in the medical and surgery areas; in pediatric wards, absent the young patients eating ice cream after their tonsillectomies, which is now day surgery, and in maternity wards, which keep women for increasingly shorter stays after delivery. At the same time, there is a shift in emphasis to intensive-care beds as hospitals increasingly concentrate on sicker patients.
 
More Space in Other Areas
 There is even more excess capacity in some areas of the region, with New Jersey reporting a 70 percent occupancy rate in 1993, down from 73 percent in 1992.
And across the country, hospital occupancy rates began declining more than a decade ago, with an national average occupancy rate that now hovers around 65 percent, according to the American Hospital Association.
New York is actually the last state in the country to see its hospitals emptying, primarily because it is the nation's most highly regulated health care system; while other regions overbuilt, New York forced its hospitals to prove the need for every new bed, which must be certified by the state health department.
"I can't think of a new hospital built in New York in the last 20 years, while across the country you had enormous growth," said Jeffrey Merrill, a professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health.
Health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care were also slow to take hold in New York, because of the opposition of an unusually strong medical community. Unlike the business people who run most hospitals in other parts of the country, health officials said, the top executives of many major New York hospitals are doctors.
 
The AIDS Factor
 And in the late mid-1980's, just as medical advances were starting to create some excess capacity, the AIDS crisis hit New York with particular virulence, devastating communities but reviving several hospitals.
"AIDS and TB had a dramatic impact on why we haven't lost" more inpatient demand, said John Billings, an associate professor of health policy management at New York University. "But we're starting to manage AIDS in a different way and patients have decided they'd rather be treated in other settings."
Preliminary state health department figures for the last quarter of 1993 indicate that the hospital census of AIDS patients has leveled off, Mr. Slocum said.
Sidney Pitter, a 33-year-old opera singer who has AIDS, is among those who, with the help of a visiting nurse and a nurse and lay volunteer with the supportive care program at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medcical Center of New York, has been able to stay out of the hospital for most of the three years since his illness was diagnosed.
"In Sidney's case, we really have clearly been able to keep him out of the hospital because he's forgetful about taking and refilling his medication" for toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection of the brain that responds to the medicine he takes daily, said Patricia Moule, a nurse with the St. Vincent's supportive care program.
During a recent visit from Ms. Moule, Mr. Pitter offhandedly mentioned that his vision had been slightly blurred; he was immediately hospitalized with retinitis, and doctors said the nurse's timely intervention probably saved Mr. Pitter's sight. When he was released on Friday, after his second hospital stay in three years, Ms. Moule also helped him home.
Some of the older patients who once filled New York's hospital beds because there was no room in the state's tightly regulated nursing homes have also been moved out of hospitals now, with the building of 5,000 new beds statewide over the last several years.
 
More Outpatient Service
 And the number of procedures that can be done on an outpatient basis, or as day surgery is growing rapidly, now including such serious operations as a partial mastectomy, hernia repair, and the setting of broken bones that have penetrated the skin. Exploratory surgeries are increasingly rare, and admissions for a battery of tests are all but unheard of.
In the newly competitive environment in New York, hospitals have started aggressive public relations campaigns, including mailings and advertisements.
In the future, Dr. Chassin said, the institutions that survive will specialize. "You'll have cardiac surgery in one, obstetrics in another, instead of hospitals that have seen themselves as full service providers," he said. Many others, he said, "should be looking for a new mission in life."

HEADLINE: Slow Gains by Minority Broadcasters

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
After 12 years of perceived neglect by Republican-dominated Federal Communications Commissions, the role of minorities in broadcasting has moved up on the agenda as the commission tries to increase minority ownership and employment.
In February, the agency decided to increase greatly the fines it may impose on stations that do not meet its standards for employment of women and minorities. Under its new rules, fines of up to $250,000 may be imposed on a station owner, compared with a previous maximum of $20,000. 
 The commission and its chairman, Reed E. Hundt, are also looking into whether the ground-breaking rules adopted in 1978 to increase minority ownership have produced sufficient gains. Those rules created tax and other incentives to encourage purchases of radio and television stations by minorities.
The Federal regulations have roughly tripled the number of minority-owned stations, to nearly 3 percent of the total, from less than 1 percent. But "over all, the increase has been relatively small," James H. Quello, an F.C.C. commissioner, said.
And members of minority groups and others say it will take more than the support of the F.C.C. to do more, mainly because of daunting economic hurdles.
"In the best of economic times, the bank is only going to lend you a portion of the purchase price," said James S. Winston, executive director of the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters, whose 110 members represent 202 stations. "Even if you get the loan, where do you get the personal equity capital? We have been a community of working people, not business owners."
Others say a succession of Republican chairmen at the F.C.C. have turned a blind eye to minority issues. "Part of the difficulty for minorities has been economics, but that has been compounded by successive Republican administrations that have sought to frustrate its implementation," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access Project, a watchdog group based in Washington.
Mark Fowler, the chairman of the agency from 1981 to 1987, suggested several times that the F.C.C. should discard the procedures that awarded station licenses to members of minority groups when all the other qualifications were equal. Even after Congress passed legislation that retained the preferential policy, the commission showed little enthusiasm, preferring to concentrate on the larger issue of deregulation, according to some broadcasting experts.
But deregulation, too, has set back minority ownership, allowing larger broadcasting companies with deeper pockets to acquire additional licenses, increasing the pressure on smaller companies like those owned by minorities.
One reason for encouraging minority ownership is to increase minority employment. "The absence of minority owners meant the pressure to hire people unlike oneself was very low," David M. Rubin, dean of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, said. "So white owners hired white males. Minority owners are more willing to hire minorities."
But it is unclear how either minority ownership or employment influences programming. "There is very little research yet determining how their presence in the programming and news-making process affects decisions on news coverage and entertainment," Dr. Rubin said. "The assumption has been that it would. But others feel that the medium and career pressures mold the individuals."
If the minority stake is small in media regulated by the Government, it still compares favorably with minority ownership of print media. While members of minority groups own hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers and monthly magazines aimed at minority audiences, they own no mainstream newspaper or magazine in America.
Yet there are some success stories. One of the nation's leading black business executives is J. Bruce Llewellyn, whose diverse business interests include WKVW-TV, the ABC affiliate in Buffalo, and Garden State Cable Television, a cable system in New Jersey. U.S. Radio L.P., a limited partnership in Philadelphia controlled by Ragan A. Henry now owns 10 radio stations. Raul Alarcon Jr.'s Spanish Broadcasting System, based in New York, owns seven radio stations.
 
 
Exceptions to the Rule
 Still, such successes do not represent a trend. "They do not speak to the question of overall opportunities available," Mr. Winston of the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters said. "One or two exceptions don't disprove the rule."
And some owners of broadcast properties say that the minority ownership numbers are misleading. "Many are small stations in small markets so they don't even get the proportionate amount of advertising dollars that ownership suggests," Mr. Henry said.
When the F.C.C. adopted the new regulations, less than 1 percent of the nation's broadcasting properties -- 49 stations -- were owned by members of minority groups. Today there are more, but the 300 stations owned by members of minority groups represent only 2.7 percent of the 11,021 stations in the United States, and many are the weakest in their markets. Of the nation's 1,151 television stations, minorities own 27; of the 9,870 radio stations, 273 are minority-owned.
To a large extent, the progress has been an outgrowth of the F.C.C.'s initiatives. In 1978, the commission instituted a two-part program. One allowed radio and television station owners to defer capital gains if they sold to a minority bidder. This "tax certificate" program was invoked in the sales of 275 television and radio stations, and of 20 cable systems. The second part of the program allowed radio stations that were deemed to have violated the F.C.C.'s rules to sell to members of minority groups rather than lose their licenses. Thirty-eight sales were made under that provision.
Yet for most investors in radio stations in the 1980's, the timing could not have been worse.
"If you bought a station in that period, you generally overpaid, were overleveraged and are probably suffering now," said Erwin G. Krasnow, a partner at the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand and former general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group in Washington.
 
 
Lower Revenues
 A subsequent decline in advertising spending hurt both radio and television revenues, making it harder for new owners to pay off their debts.
That made it more difficult to get financial backing. "The recession dried up the financing in the industry and minorities were hit pretty hard," Mr. Henry of U.S. Radio said. That, perhaps, is one reason tax certificates dropped sharply in 1990, to 17, from 42 the previous year.
"This is a high-leverage business, and the banks do not consider us bankable," Mary Helen Barro, vice president of the American Hispanic-Owned Radio Association, said.
The worst casualties of the 1980's were mainly smaller stations that lacked the ability to vie for programming, which had often already been acquired by rivals.
Nowhere was the predicament clearer than at Blackstar Entertainment, a television company in Washington owned by John Oxendine. In 1987, Mr. Oxendine's three stations needed money and programming.
"In order to borrow money from banks, you have to have some cash flow," Mr. Oxendine said in a recent interview. "To have cash flow, you had to have programming."
Mr. Oxendine sold a 45 percent stake in Blackstar to Silver King Broadcasting, a division of Home Shopping Network Inc., for $5 million in nonvoting stock. Under the contract, Blackstar must carry Home Shopping Network's programming for 22 hours a day on its three stations, and buy Silver King's shares back if it does not.
 
 
New Ownership Rule
 It is not only the lack of programming that squeezes minority owners. Despite the recent support from the F.C.C., the agency has been criticized for its decision last year that allows a single owner to own more than one AM and one FM station in a given area. Mr. Quello of the commission said the rule was adopted to save stations that might otherwise have gone bankrupt.
But Ms. Barro, who owns KAFY-AM in Bakersfield, Calif., and hopes to buy another FM station, said the changes hurt. "Now I have a competitor with three stations so they can promise advertisers a larger audience," she said.
Another sore point among some in the minority community is a practice known as "fronting" -- the purchase of a station by a group of investors led by a member of a minority group, who puts up little money and then sells out to his partners, generally nonminority buyers.
No data are available on the extent of fronting, but the practice was encouraged when the F.C.C., in 1984, opened the door to rapid resale by eliminating a three-year minimum holding period for station ownership. That change was made in the name of deregulation.
"That decision turned broadcast properties into commodities where for the first time you could make money from stations as investment vehicles and many people took advantage of that," Mr. Krasnow said.
 
 
Times Mirror Deal
 The most recent example was the $320 million sale in 1993 of the Times Mirror Company's four television stations to a group led by Ibrahim Morales, a New York-based businessman who put up $30,000 of his own money and another $123,000 he borrowed. The agreement let Times Mirror put off paying $80 million in taxes, while giving Mr. Morales the right to sell his control block for $1 million within two years of the deal.
Mr. Llewellyn, the black business executive, said he did not object to minorities selling their stakes, but said buyers should be required to put up more capital, so as to assume a significant risk.
But Mr. Oxendine of Blackstar said buyers should be able do what they want. He also suggested that the seller should have to put some of his gain into an escrow fund for minorities.
Mr. Oxendine also called Mr. Llewellyn a hypocrite. "Now that he has made his money, he is raising the hurdles for other buyers," Mr. Oxendine said. "You don't have to own 50 percent of a business to run it. Anybody in their right mind knows the real test is a control test. If the rules he is advocating were in place, he would not be in business. He is talking nonsense."

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Urges North Korea To Preserve Atom-Fuel Evidence

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
In a last-ditch effort to avert a political crisis, the United Nations Security Council urged North Korea today to preserve evidence of how much nuclear fuel it may have diverted to its weapons program.
Adopting a position worked out earlier today among the five countries with veto power -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France -- the Security Council issued what amounted to a final warning that the North Koreans not cross an important threshold. 
 The statement the Security Council approved unanimously today carries less weight than a full Council resolution, but was politically palatable to the Chinese, whose support is important. The statement also had no explicit threat of economic sanctions, another move to win China's approval.
In a parallel diplomatic move reflecting the situation's increasing urgency, Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent a message to the Chinaese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, over the weekend imploring Beijing to use its influence to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
President Clinton cited China's ability to put pressure on North Korea as one reason he decided last week to renew China's favorable trade status with virtually no conditions. But it remained unclear whether the Administration's conciliatory approach toward Bejing would yield the benefits that the White House has claimed.
Other senior Administration officials have said publicly that they simply do not know whether Beijing is willing or able to influence the North Koreans, or support tough economic sanctions in the United Nations if North Korea continues to defy international efforts to halt its nuclear program.
China's concerns are twofold. American officials say Beijing shares Washington's goal of having a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. But China also does not want to risk the instability that imposing sanctions on the North could bring. China has historically opposed applying economic sanctions to rogue nations.
Today's debate among the five permanent members, in fact, centered on how tough the statement should be. American officials said France sought to make explicit the threat of economic sanctions if North Korea failed to comply, but China balked at that wording.
But no one doubts that the crisis has intensified in recent days as North Korea has stepped up a seemingly relentless effort to remove spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor. One Administration official said today that the pace of withdrawal had accelerated even beyond the heightened tempo first detected last week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, which sent inspectors to observe the removal of fuel rods at North Korea's main reactor at Yongbyon, has cautioned that the North is within days of destroying important evidence of how much nuclear fuel has been shifted to its weapons program.
Washington has threatened to seek economic sanctions against the North if the evidence is ruined. North Korea has denied that it has diverted fuel but at the same time has refused to agree to allow inspections to resolve the issue. The Government in the North has said it would consider sanctions tantamount to an act of war.
 
Time Slipping Away
 The hastily convened meeting of the five permanent members today reflected the view of many officials that the time to reach a diplomatic solution is slipping away, and that a Security Council debate on sanctions may come soon.
"There's a growing gloom that the possibility to preserve historical analysis will be destroyed," said one senior American official, who had expressed some optimism as late as Saturday that a compromise could be worked out.
Administration officials expressed exasperation at the latest twist in the tortuous talks with the North Koreans, where optimistic predictions have repeatedly collapsed under warnings of impending confrontation.
Just last week, the Administration signaled a conciliatory stance toward the North, offering to open a new round of high-level talks about diplomatic and economic ties that North Korea has long sought.
 
U.S. Goes the Last Mile
 "We've walked up to this point before, and there's always been some way in which that irrevocable action has been avoided by them," said a senior American official. "Whether this time we'll play the same cat-and-mouse game, or this will be the action to trigger stronger measures, like sanctions, we probably won't know until Tuesday or Wednesday."
The Administration has argued to countries reluctant to consider sanctions, like China, that Washington has gone the last mile diplomatically. The Administration has offered North Korea political and economic inducements if it would halt the removal of fuel rods, and would only resort to sanctions once all diplomatic options were exhausted.
At issue now is the atomic energy agency's demand that North Korea put aside 300 of the 8,000 fuel rods so that measurements might be carried out in the future to determine how much plutonium the North might have diverted to its weapons program in past years.
Hans Blix, the agency's director, said last week that the North had already removed more than 3,000 of the rods, effectively discharging nearly half the fuel in the reactor's core. Two international inspectors remain at the site.
American officials have held out hope that a technical compromise could be worked out in which the North identify the 300 crucial fuel rods for future analysis in a different way than how the atomic energy agency insisted.

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Ezra Taft Benson, the president of the Mormon Church since 1985 and a Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower Administration, died yesterday at his home in Salt Lake City. He was 94.
Mr. Benson, who had been in frail health in recent years and rarely appeared in public, died of congestive heart failure, said Bruce Olsen, a spokesman for the church. Mr. Benson suffered a broken hip several years ago when he was standing near a horse and it rolled over on him. 
 Mr. Benson took charge of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints nine years ago, as it was emerging as one of the world's fastest-growing denominations. It was also enjoying great prosperity (to remain in good standing, Mormons must donate 10 percent of their income to the church), and its political influence was growing, particularly among conservative Republicans. Indeed, Mr. Benson once questioned whether it was possible to be a good Mormon and a liberal Democrat at the same time.
Mr. Benson became well known in the 1960's and 1970's for his opposition to the civil rights and the women's movements and for his association with the John Birch Society. In 1980 he angered liberal Mormons when he declared in a speech that the church might begin endorsing political candidates, something it had not done since its leaders told Mormons to choose President Herbert Hoover over his Democratic challenger, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1932.
 
Mission Work in Youth
 Mr. Benson's family had been prominent in the church for generations, and he himself had been committed to its cause since his days as a youthful missionary in the British Isles. He had been next in line to the leadership since 1973, when he became president of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the second-ranking Mormon Board after the First Presidency, consisting of the church president and his two-man council.
The council chose its senior member, Mr. Benson, as president of the church in 1985, on the death of 90-year-old Spencer W. Kimball, who had himself been in frail health for several years. As president of the council, Mr. Benson was in line to become president of the church; church officials said the selection of anyone else would have been a departure from established procedure. The current president of the council and probable successor to Mr. Benson is Howard W. Hunter, 86.
Mr. Benson was made leader of the Mormon Church at a time of some uncertainty and turmoil for the Mormon Church at large and in its headquarters in Salt Lake City.
Mr. Kimball, the president for 12 years, was widely regarded as a progressive force for modernization in a church distinguished by conservative values.
Under Mr. Benson, membership in the church grew to 8.7 million, church officials said.
 
A Professor of Agriculture
 Mr. Benson, a professor of agriculture who founded an organization of farm cooperatives, came to national prominence in 1953 as Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower Administration. He was one of the few Cabinet-level appointees to remain in office for both Eisenhower terms, an accomplishment attributed to Mr. Benson's doggedness in the face of opposition. On a trip to Sioux Falls, S.D., he was pelted with eggs by farmers. Testifying before the Senate Agriculture Committee, he was hectored; it took him an hour and a half to get through a three-page statement. His only displays of anger were a reddening of his neck and a defiantly outward thrust of his lower lip.
In later years he was openly critical of Eisenhower's views, calling them socialistic. He also condemned welfare programs as "galloping socialism" leading to Communism.
After leaving Washington, he became closely associated with, but never joined, the John Birch Society, a right-wing political organization for which his son Reed eventually served as press officer.
In the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Benson accused the civil rights movement of advancing Communist causes, called the graduated income tax "Marxist" and criticized detente with the Soviet Union.
He was outspoken in his belief that a Mormon woman's place was her home. "The undermining of the home and family is on the increase, with the devil anxiously working to displace the father as the head of the home and create rebellion among the children," he said in 1975. "Working mothers should remember that their children usually need more of a mother than of money."
 
Son of Early Settlers
 Ezra Taft Benson was born Aug. 4, 1899, in Whitney, Idaho. His parents were among the early settlers of southern Idaho. He was also the great-grandson of Ezra T. Benson, a church pioneer who trekked to the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847 with Brigham Young after Joseph Smith, founder of the church, was slain in Illinois.
Mr. Benson was distantly related to President William Howard Taft and his son Robert A. Taft, the Republican Senator from Ohio.
As a young man, he was active in scouting and church auxiliaries. He served as a missionary in Britain for two years, until 1923, when he enrolled at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He graduated with honors in 1927, and the university's yearbook, The Banyan, named him "most likely to succeed."
His missionary work also opened the door for him to the Mormon campus's most prestigious church club, the Young Doctors of Divinity.
 
Adviser to Roosevelt
 Mr. Benson earned a master's degree in farm economics at Iowa State College, now Iowa State University. He served for a year as a county extension marketing agent in Idaho before taking charge of a newly established Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing at the University of Idaho at Boise.
Working in a time of economic hardship for farmers, he helped form the Idaho Cooperative Council, and in 1939 he was elected executive secretary of the National Council of Farmers Cooperatives. In World War II he was a member of an agricultural advisory board for President Roosevelt.
Meanwhile, Mr. Benson continued his church work. In 1943 he became a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles.
His wife, Flora Smith Amussen Benson, died in 1992 after 65 years of marriage. Mr. Benson is survived by their two sons, Reed of Provo and Mark of Salt Lake City; four daughters, Barbara Walker of Calgary, Alberta, Beverly Parker of Salt Lake City, Bonnie Madsen of Littleton, Colo., and Beth Burton of Frankfurt; 34 grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: High Homicide Rate Leaves New Orleans Fearful

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 30

 BODY:
The casual visitor here sees the city's beguiling facades, but, like the rows of boarded-up houses only a few blocks from the elegant ones, fear lurks nearby. Murder is booming in New Orleans.
In 1993, with nearly 80 homicides per 100,000 people, the city's homicide rate led Detroit and Washington, two other high-crime cities, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the first quarter of this year, the homicide rate for the city of New Orleans was up 36 percent over last year, and it was still leading the other two cities' rates. The homicide rate of the New Orleans metropolitan area led all others in 1992, the last year for which Federal figures are available. 
 This month, the homicide countreached a new intensity, with 195 for 1994 through May 30. Six people were killed in one day this month; the coroner said bodies were piling up so fast that his staff was overwhelmed. Also this month, New Orleans recorded its youngest shooting victims of the year: children 9 and 2 years old. And a tourist was killed, a relatively rare occurrence that nonetheless makes officials uneasy because tourism is the city's fastest-growing industry.
The new Mayor, Marc Morial, devoted his first big initiative to a series of crime-fighting measures, including a tough curfew for youths 17 and under.
Announcing the measures two weeks after he took office earlier this month, Mr. Morial said his city was in a "deep, deep crisis." In a poll taken on May 9, 10 and 11 for the Mayor, 86 percent of the 600 people surveyed listed crime as the city's biggest problem.
In a Central City neighborhood where houses need paint and boards sag, behind the barbed wire and "Bad Dog" sign of her aunt's house, Jessie Mae Brady, a neighbor of the 9-year-old shooting victim, said: "Here in New Orleans, you never know when they're going to strike. It pays to be afraid."
Fear has helped double the number of burglar-alarm companies operating in the city since 1980. New Orleans has lost over 130,000 residents since 1960, many of them whites who have fled to the safety of the suburbs.
Fear has also put guns in the pockets and desk drawers of merchants along Magazine Street, made Uptown residents circle the block before emerging from their cars if a stranger is spotted and forced residents of housing projects to sleep on the floor when gunfire is heard.
"Sometimes you think if it's less shots, no one got killed. If it's a whole lot, somebody got messed up," said Emma Brown, who lives in the grim St. Thomas Housing Development.
 
Unjustified Fear?
 Crime experts and some officials say the fear is not entirely justified. In 1993 New Orleans had lower per-capita rates of robbery and aggravated assault than Detroit and Washington. Nor can the city claim the distinction of being the nation's homicide capital, even though its metropolitan area was ranked number one. The city of Gary, Ind., had a higher homicide rate last year than New Orleans, which was ahead of the cities of Washington and Detroit.
Finally, tourists are relatively safe in New Orleans, if they do not stray from relatively well-traveled areas like the French Quarter and Uptown. One tourist was killed last year and one this year, the police said.
"I think the average citizen's fears are somewhat exaggerated," said Joseph F. Sheley, a criminologist at Tulane University here.
In New Orleans, people are killed for the same reasons as in other cities: casual arguments turn violent, drug deals go bad, robberies. Or the victims are innocent bystanders like James Darby, the 9-year-old who was slain. As in other American cities, most victims and killers are young, black and poor.
What may help explain this city's high homicide rate, experts here say, is widespread poverty. Nearly a third of its residents are poor, the second-highest rate in the nation after Detroit. New Orleans also has the nation's highest rate of abandoned housing and the third-highest rates for single-mother households and births to teen-agers.
"The things we see causing the problems are the same as they are elsewhere," Mr. Sheley said. "But it is unique in that we've got more of them."
 
Scarcity of Low-End Jobs
 New Orleans is only just emerging from a severe recession that cost the metropolitan area almost 10,000 jobs. Over a longer period, technology has eliminated thousands of low-skill jobs in traditional mainstays like the port. "It's very difficult to provide jobs for people at the lower end of the scale when the economy is so weak," said Tim Ryan, dean of the College of Business Administration at the University of New Orleans.
Hopelessness, like fear, is not hard to find. "I'm fed up," said Darrin Ellis, 23, as he wandered through the St. Thomas Housing Development. When it comes to seeking work, "I don't even get up and go looking," he said. Mr. Ellis's younger brother was fatally shot in the head earlier this year in a robbery.
In all, St. Thomas had 11 homicides last year, the police say.
"You know why it's like that?" Mr. Ellis asked angrily. "Because there's nothing to do. It's just simple and plain. They don't have nothing else to do. They pick crime as a hobby."
Crime casts its heaviest pall on the city's 10 public housing projects. An organized effort to encourage drug dealers to apply for real jobs was met with laughter, said Teresa Nicholas, a resident of the William Guste Sr. Home housing development and a member of the residents council.
Residents speak of nightly gunfire and drug deals. Nearly a third of the homicides committed by May 17 this year had taken place in housing projects.
"It's just scary," said Ms. Nicholas, whose son was shot and robbed earlier this year and who said she had seen men outside her apartment with guns drawn. "Now I'm inside every night. I'm actually afraid."
 
Many Stories to Tell
 The fear cuts across geographic and racial boundaries. In New Orleans, no resident -- black or white, rich or poor -- lives far from neighborhoods that resemble war zones. While some mixing of neighborhoods is found in many cities, it is found to an unusual degree in New Orleans, some sociologists say. As a result, gunshots from St. Thomas can be heard in the upper-class Garden District. And everybody has a crime story to tell.
But the crime stories told by the residents of poorer neighborhoods often differ from those of white Uptown residents. The former recount violent, recent crimes. Four Uptowners, members of a neighborhood anti-crime association who gathered on a recent morning, focused on homicides that had made headlines several years ago or on property offenses. "It makes me angry that we can't have anything, because somebody's going to take it," said Mehl Cimini, whose mother was robbed at gunpoint some years ago.
But in the housing projects, many seem to know someone who was shot or killed within the year, like Mr. Ellis's brother. "I don't see how on this earth he was chosen to get killed," Mr. Ellis said. "That just hurt me. I think about him all the time. Every day. Constantly."

HEADLINE: A Mixed and Light Day on World Markets

 BODY:
International financial markets were mixed yesterday in light trading, as exchanges were closed for holidays in the United States and Britain.
In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 104.40 yen, down 0.13 yen from Friday. It closed in New York on Friday at 104.28 yen. 
 In Hong Kong, stock prices were higher in moderate trading. The Hang Seng index, the Hong Kong market's blue-chip indicator, rose 53.50 points, or five-tenths of 1 percent, closing at 9,523.63. On Friday, the index slipped 11 points.
In Frankfurt, the DAX index of 30 stocks declined 22.84 points, ending the session at 2,118.15. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.84 points, to close at 2,052.51. Last week, German stocks lost 6.2 percent as investors worried that German interest rate reductions might be put off. The belief that German and French central banks had paused in cutting rates was reinforced when the Bank of France left the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, unchanged at 5.4 percent.
Stocks rose yesterday in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, but fell in Belgium and Sweden. Trading in Mexico City left stocks little changed.
 
Dollar Rises in Europe
 The dollar was up against major European currencies, climbing to 1.6466 German marks from 1.6450 and to 5.6291 French francs from 5.6095. The British pound fell against the dollar, to $1.5087 from $1.5100.
In Zurich the late bid price of gold was $385.00, down from $385.50 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.39 to close at a bid of $385.38.
Traders described investors as cautious. "People are not worried about them going up," Matthias Tislev of Banque Worms said, referring to interest rates, "but they think they've stopped going down for the moment, or at least have slowed right down."
Bond prices recovered slightly and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell after steep declines throughout Europe last week.

HEADLINE: Japanese Rightist Fires Near Ex-Premier

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 30

 BODY:
A suspected right-wing militant fired a shot near former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa tonight in apparent anger over Mr. Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's behavior in World War II.
Mr. Hosokawa, who resigned last month amid questions over his financial dealings, was unharmed. The bullet hit the ceiling of the Tokyo hotel lobby as the former Prime Minister was leaving a party held there. 
 The police immediately overpowered the assailant, who was identified as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52. The police said Mr. Nozoe had told them that he was angry at Mr. Hosokawa's comments about Japan's role in World War II and at his economic policies, according to the Kyodo News Service.
In his first news conference upon taking office last August, Mr. Hosokawa called World War II a "war of aggression."
Japan has hundreds of right-wing groups that embrace the idea that the nation did no wrong in World War II. These groups do not have a wide following, and most Japanese ignore their preachings from dark trucks equipped with deafening loudspeakers.
 
Occasional Violent Attacks
 But ultra-nationalists occasionally resort to violence. In January 1990, the Mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, was shot in the chest by a right-wing gunman. Mr. Motoshima, who recovered, had said Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.
In March 1992, a rightist fired three shots, all of which missed, at Shin Kanemaru, who at the time was one of Japan's most powerful politicians but who has since been disgraced in a bribery scandal. The assailant said he had heard that Mr. Kanemaru had been trying to normalize Japan's relations with Communist North Korea.
The shootings have evoked memories the 1930's, when right-wing military officers committed a wave of assassinations as Japan moved toward involvement in World War II. Some analysts have said such attacks stifle free speech by causing people to think twice before condemning Japan's behavior in the war.
Nearly 50 years after the end of World War II, Japan is still having trouble coming to grips with its role in the conflict, and the issue can arouse fierce passions.
This month, Japan's Justice Minister, Shigeto Nagano, was forced to resign after only a week on the job because he said the so-called Rape of Nanking, a massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people, was a "fabrication." The remark enraged Japan's Asian neighbors, who still have bitter memories of Japan's conquests and colonial rule.
The Government recently decided not to have Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visit Pearl Harbor on their trip to the United States in June. Right-wing groups and officials opposed the visit, saying they did not want the imperial couple to have to apologize for the surprise attack that drew the United States into the war.
Just before tonight's shooting, Mr. Hosokawa was attending a rally at the Keio Plaza Hotel for the Japan New Party, the political organization he heads. It was one of his first public appearances since he resigned last month after heading the first government in nearly 40 years that was not controlled by the Liberal Democratic Party.
Since his resignation, Mr. Hosokawa has been trying to avoid questioning about his financial transactions, including a huge loan he received from a scandal-tainted trucking company.
The assailant fired a revolver after Mr. Hosokawa had come out of the party gathering into the lobby of the hotel, which was crowded with television cameras and reporters. Some early reports said the gunman's hands were deflected by policemen, causing the shot to miss, but Mr. Nozoe later told the police that he had meant to fire at the ceiling.

HEADLINE: First Settlers Domesticated Pigs Before Crops

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
DIGGING at the ruins of a village in southeastern Turkey, where people lived more than 10,000 years ago, archeologists expected to turn up the usual traces of a society on the verge of the agriculture revolution. There should be leftover grains of wild wheat and barley and perhaps the bones of butchered sheep and goats in some early stage of domestication.
The archeologists found nothing of the kind. Instead, to their complete surprise, they dug up the ample remains of pig bones. 
 The discovery, they said, strongly suggests that the pig was the earliest animal that people domesticated for food. The diminished size of the molars was one of several clues that the transformation of wild boars into pigs was under way at that time. Radiocarbon analysis put the date at 10,000 to 10,400 years ago.
So in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains at a site known as Hallan Cemi, the domestication of the pig appeared to have occurred 2,000 years earlier than once thought -- and 1,000 years before the taming and herding of sheep and goats.
Much earlier, at least 12,000 years ago, wolves more or less invited domestication as the dog, developing a symbiotic relationship with people. They became camp followers, sentinels and "best friend." Only in a few cultures later on were dogs served as food.
A broader significance, archeologists said, was the absence of any sign of wheat or barley at the settlement. The prevailing assumption, based mainly on research to the south in Syria and the Jordan River Valley, has been that with the end of the last ice age, wild grains were abundant in the more temperate climate over the entire Middle East. People settled down to harvest them, and this led to agriculture, animal husbandry and eventually the rise of cities and civilization.
"All early agricultural models are predicated on the assumption that people gathered wild wheat and other grains," said Dr. Michael Rosenberg, an archeologist at the University of Delaware and director of the Hallan Cemi excavations. "But this is the earliest settlement site so far north, and it has no cereals. So another resource must have made it possible to settle down."
In a report at a recent meeting of the Society for American Archeologists, Dr. Richard W. Redding, a University of Michigan archeologist and member of the discovery team, said that a heavy reliance on data from southern sites in the Levant might have resulted "in a very narrow view of the origin of food production." There may have been a variety of ways by which people made the transition from foraging to farming, and some of them did not include the intensive use of wild cereals as a crucial first step.
Dr. Patricia Wattenmaker, a University of Virginia archeologist with wide experience in Middle East excavations, said the new findings were among the first from this part of the Turkish highlands in prehistory and were certain to force a serious rethinking of theories regarding human subsistence patterns leading up to agriculture.
 
Roles of Environment and Culture
 "It looks as if the pattern varies from place to place," Dr. Wattenmaker said. "This takes the punch out of arguments that environmental factors" over a wider area triggered the transition toward agriculture, she added, and suggested that "cultural factors were really the key."
Dr. Robert J. Braidwood, a professor emeritus of archeology at the University of Chicago who is a specialist in research on early agriculture, praised the Hallan Cemi excavations for providing a much-needed examination of pre-agricultural cultures beyond the Levant. But the Turkish village of no more than 150 inhabitants was extremely small, he cautioned, and evidence from three or four more sites in the area might be necessary before drawing any sweeping conclusions.
The Hallan Cemi site is scheduled to be flooded next year by a new dam on the Batman River.
In three years of excavations at Hallan Cemi, though, archeologists have established that people there had left the wandering life of hunting and gathering for a more sedentary village existence. Ruins of small stone houses and stone sculptures indicated a permanent settlement, and the growth pattern in fresh water clam shells at the site revealed year-round occupation. Evidence of long-distance trade in obsidian, copper and Mediterranean shells reflected the expansion of economic horizons by an increasingly complex society.
All this was happening at the time of the Natufians, people in the Jordan Valley who were probably the first to adopt settling down as a permanent way of life. But if wild cereals were critical to the Natufians' transition, the people at Hallan Cemi apparently depended on gathering nuts and seeds, hunting wild sheep and deer and raising pigs. The absence of any wild grains at the site was determined by Dr. Mark Nesbitt, a paleobotanist at University College, London.
No single piece of the pig evidence is conclusive, Dr. Redding reported, but all the clues together "are congruent with the early phases of the domestication of pigs."
 
Clue on Domestication
 Not only are the bones plentiful and the molars smaller, he said, but they show that the people appeared to favor young male pigs more than would be expected if they were hunting wild animals. A preponderance of the bones were of male pigs under one year of age. If they were raising pigs, they would spare most of the young females for breeding. Survivorship patterns of hunted animals reveal a more normal age distribution.
Pigs may have been the villagers' insurance against famine caused by any sudden shortage of nuts and fruits and wild game. In a pre-agricultural sedentary culture, Dr. Rosenberg said, such shortages posed a greater risk because the people had a more limited foraging and hunting range.
"We think they fiddled around with maintaining animals to decrease that risk," he said, "and pigs make sense if they are not gathering and growing grains."
For one thing, young pigs are easily obtained and tamed. They require little labor to control since they can be left to forage for themselves throughout the community. And they are the most efficient domesticated animal, Dr. Redding said, in that they convert 35 percent of food energy into meat, compared with 13 percent for sheep or a mere 6.5 percent for cattle.
Pigs, the archeologist concluded, may have represented one more transitional step in some pre-agricultural societies; the pattern was not always a direct progression from settling down to growing cereals to raising animals. Perhaps the subsistent strategy of the highland villagers was to supplement their diets of nuts, fruits and grasses with pigs until cereal production was adopted. In time, Dr. Redding said, the highlanders took up grain cultivation, probably as an innovation borrowed from the south.
 
Decline of Pigs
 In any case, the archeologists said, as soon as the people of Hallan Cemi began growing grain, there was a sharp decline in domestic pigs, which were gradually replaced by domestic sheep and goats. It was a necessity. Pigs compete with people for cereals. They could no longer be left to forage unattended near the village and fields, and they are not as easily herded as sheep and goats.
Although some of the interpretations are tentative and more research is required, Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Redding said they were increasingly confident in their evidence for the early domestication of the pig. And contrary to previous findings in the Levant, they said, there could be sedentary village life without an abundance of grains, wild or cultivated.
"Hallan Cemi is almost a mirror image of what's going on at this time in the Levant," Dr. Redding said. "We will have to rethink all the models we've been developing about early food production."

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Scientists Struggle To Survive in a Market Economy

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
SIX years after Vietnam's leaders began converting the country's economy from a rigidly controlled form of state socialism to a market economy, scientists have had to find a new way to carry on their work.
Although the country has modestly prospered since the 1988 decision, the change brought a collapse of government subsidies for research, and the beginning of a desperate struggle by Vietnamese scientists to feed their families. 
 Little if any "pure" research is carried on in Vietnam these days, but scientists are learning to live by their wits. In an environment where a scientist in a teaching post generally earns no more than $25 a month (comparable to the pay of other professionals, who also scramble for a living), ingenuity is a requisite for survival.
In some of their most successful ventures, chemists and chemical engineers are banding together to create commercial enterprises -- state-owned manufacturing enterprises that are allowed to operate almost as if they were private, profit-making companies.
Among the most successful of these new plants is the Essential Oils Enterprise (Enteroil) in the Tu Liem suburb of Hanoi -- a semi-independent branch of the government's National Center for Natural Science and Technology. Using improvised distillation columns, crystallization chambers and other simple industrial tools, the engineers and scientists at Enteroil extract volatile flavoring oils from various costly spices and herbs grown in Vietnam.
 
Improvising From Crude Supplies
 Neither time nor money is available for original research, but the chemists have created jobs for themselves by applying their technical knowledge toward improvising complex plant machinery from the crude materials on hand.
Products include cassia oil, which is used as an ingredient in cola beverages, menthol used in mentholated cigarettes, and citronella, anis and sassafras oils, used in food products and perfumes.
Dr. Le Trong Vong, general director of the enterprise, says it is the first privatized manufacturing company to be able to pay its workers regularly each week. Workers and managers share in the plant's profits, he said.
One of the main problems the organizers faced, they say, was convincing foreign buyers that they could count on consistent quality in Enteroil's products. Some visitors to the plant have been startled by its somewhat primitive appearance. A row of storage tanks in the plant's warehouse, for example, was assembled from tank trailers detached from abandoned United States Army trucks seized at the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975.
"Our first task in finding customers," said Dr. Nguyen Quyet Chien, "was to establish a reliable system of quality control."
This meant that each batch of each product had to be sampled and analyzed for purity, using analytical methods internationally recognized as accurate and valid.
 
Seeking American Equipment
 "We desperately needed modern laboratory equipment," said Dr. Chien, who received his doctoral degree from the University of Halle in the former East Germany. "But because of the United States embargo, we had problems getting the American apparatus we wanted."
Dr. Chien, who speaks fluent English, gestured toward a bench loaded with scientific equipment made by Hewlett-Packard and other American companies. "We had to buy this equipment through third-party intermediaries, and it was expensive doing it that way," he said, "but the important thing is that we can now offer our customers proof of the quality of our products."
Although many scientists have abandoned their specialties to become commercial traders, Dr. Pham Khoi Nguyen, vice director of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, believes that his government's new emphasis on the development of national scientific information networks will stimulate industries and help scientists.
"We need appropriate technology -- the kind that will one day allow us not only to assemble computers but to manufacture their components," he said. "We are making progress. And at its last session, our National Assembly enacted a law requiring each proposed plant to prepare an environmental impact study, so we are not ignoring our environment as we push forward."
But scientific pursuits that cannot be directly applied to making money are starved of support.
 
Effect on Education
 Dr. Vu The Long, a scientist at Vietnam's Institute of Archeology in Hanoi, believes the shortage of money is having a devastating effect on both science and national education in Vietnam.
"It used to be that everyone in Vietnam had at least 10 years of education, but today far too many youngsters drop out after a few years, many unable even to read," he said. "We studied even during the war. When the B-52 raids on Hanoi got too bad in 1969, our whole class from the University of Hanoi moved into a forest out of town, where it was safer. We dug holes for shelter and lived on manioc root, but we worked and studied, because we had heart.
"But now scientists can hardly live on what we earn, and young people tell us, 'What's the point of studying, if you can't make a living from what you learn?' "
Dr. Long sometimes collaborates with foreign scientists in studies of Vietnamese fossils found in limestone caves. In a recent project with Dr. Ian Tattersall, curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and Dr. Jeffrey H. Schwartz, professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Long and his colleagues identified some previously unknown species of extinct primates. Their discoveries suggest that early man, Homo erectus, had a large variety of contemporary competitors, including the huge extinct ape Gigantopithecus.
"But we have no money to undertake expeditions," Dr. Long said. "At present, the government is excavating a lot of limestone, partly to widen the main coastal road, and partly to quarry limestone used as a raw material in the cement plants. We get to look at some of this limestone for fossils, and that gives us something to examine," he said.
Along with foreign scientists who try to help colleagues in Vietnam, many overseas Vietnamese scientists are lending a hand.
Last December, Dr. Tran Thanh Van, a high-energy physicist who lives in Paris, organized an international conference on particle physics and astrophysics in Hanoi. Vietnam has no large particle accelerators or major astrophysical research programs, but the conference was intended as a gesture of support for Vietnamese science.
"We read of the complaints by American scientists about their lack of money these days," said a Vietnamese physicist, "and we can only sympathize. We know what it's like to have to live by hustling. That's how all of us in this country survive."

HEADLINE: In Mississippi, a Clue to Low-Inflation Economics

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, Miss.

 BODY:
Two years ago, business was so bad that the Georgia-Pacific Corporation was forced temporarily to shut its thundering linerboard plant on the Pearl River a few miles outside of town, idling 600 people, in an effort to reduce inventory.
"The marketplace was completely flooded," Asa D. Hardison, the general manager, recalled. "The box plants filled up and there were no orders out there." 
 Now, the Monticello plant is churning out linerboard, the main component of cardboard cartons used to ship Downy fabric softener, Kellogg's Pop-Tarts and many other products, at a pace that not only breaks production records but even exceeds 100 percent of the plant's intended capacity.
The plant, however, exhibits few characteristics of boom times -- testimony to a profound shift in American factories. During previous economic expansions, when plants started approaching their maximum production capacity, economists started looking for signs of inflation, assuming that there would soon be more demand for goods in the economy than factories were capable of turning out. But in this expansion, American industry seems to be defying the old inflationary assumptions by finding ways of doing more with less.
So far this year, managers at the Monticello mill, on 2,200 acres surrounded by pine forest extending to the horizon, have added just 8 people to the work force of 585 and have put no new equipment on line, even as the operation squeezes out nearly 3,000 tons of linerboard a day. Virtually no one, other than workers maintaining machinery, is working overtime.
"The name of the game is to become the low-cost producer," Mr. Hardison said. "One thing about a recession -- it makes you innovative, it makes you think."
With the resurgence of economic growth since late last summer, many analysts have fretted as the utilization, or operating, rate of American industry has crept toward the danger zone that traditionally has meant overheating, reflected in faster inflation. For manufacturing, the operating rate in April reached 83 percent, up from 80.4 percent in September. For the paper industry, the rate is 91.7 percent, the highest of any business sector except for petroleum, which is at 93.6 percent.
The experience of this mill and others like it, however, suggests that inflation risks may well be less than at similar stages of previous business cycles. This could imply, among other things, that the Federal Reserve may need to make few, if any, additional increases in interest rates to keep inflation at bay.
There is a growing belief among economists that productive capacity is markedly higher than the statistics show, reflecting an apparently underestimated ingenuity of American managers and the benefits of computerization and other technology. Another, not unrelated, factor is worldwide competition, more prevalent in some industries than in others, that in effect puts foreign capacity at American disposal.
 
Benefits of Low Inflation
 Undoubtedly, another spur is the fact that inflation has already been low for a sustained period, with the annual rise in consumer prices halved, to 3.1 percent, in 1991, and reduced modestly again in both 1992 and 1993.
"In a low-inflation environment, companies find revenues flat to down so they have to economize, use less inputs," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a Washington investment firm. He called the inability to hide fat and mistakes by raising prices "probably the least heralded benefit" of low inflation.
While it is the interplay of supply and demand, not costs, that most influences how prices are set, cost reductions of the kind achieved here constitute an addition to supply that may not be captured in official figures. Indeed, some economists doubt that the Federal Reserve's estimates of capacity have kept up with the recent capital-spending boom in American industry, for which figures are published, or that they adequately reflect the rapid spread of computerization.
Whatever the case for the economy at large, the Monticello mill, opened in 1968 and purchased by Georgia-Pacific from the St. Regis Paper Company in 1984 -- is clearly producing more linerboard than even its managers at one time thought possible. And it is doing this with fewer and fewer resources, particularly labor.
Judged by man-hour for each ton of output, the plant has raised efficiency nearly 35 percent in the last six years. The plant's overall costs are down about 8.5 percent in real terms and 27 percent before adjusting for inflation.
Mr. Hardison, a 45-year-old bear of a man who talks like a football coach at halftime, brushes aside a question about whether linerboard quality might suffer from strained production.
The plant has begun to harvest hefty profits in recent months. Unexpectedly strong demand for corrugated boxes, including export orders, has lifted linerboard prices to nearly $350 a ton from a low of about $295 in October, Walter Bone, the plant's controller, said.
Contributing to the plant's strong performance are a variety of measures, large and small, to hold down costs and pump up production. Mr. Hardison's new penny-pinching attitude shows up in such moves as halving the plant's typical woodlot stockpile to 15,000 cords, using computers to reduce processing variation and maximizing the use of bark for fuel and recycled cartons for fiber.
"In the past, we didn't scrutinize everything," Mr. Hardison said as he walked through the busy but orderly shop floor. "Now I know what I'm paying for, no more guessing at it."
 
Flying the Flag
 It also involves such psychological techniques as hoisting the American flag -- Mr. Hardison said he had found that the flag inspires tidier premises, contributing to fewer accidents -- and the introduction last year of a "gain sharing" plan. Under this plan, workers can earn quarterly cash bonuses of up to 5 percent of gross pay depending on the mill's, not an individual's, performance as gauged by manufacturing costs, output and safety.
The plant's rank and file, those on the cutting edge of cost-cutting, said they had few complaints about working conditions and that the extra effort involved in the new practices is well rewarded.
"Ninety-five percent of the time, what's good for the company is good for the union," said Billy Dan Little, president of Local 371 of the United Paperworkers International Union, representing about 145 workers who maintain machinery and plants. In the last year or two, Mr. Little said, "there's grown a pretty good deal of trust between us and management," with Mr. Hardison deserving "a lot" of the credit.
Their current squabble is mainly about 23 maintenance slots the company does not want to fill.
 
Sought-After Jobs
 Pay here, averaging $17 an hour, is roughly 40 percent more than the average for American factories -- and exceptionally high for this rural area. Jobs at the Monticello plant are so attractive that it routinely has 5,000 applications on file and keeps the list manageable only by starting it from scratch again every six months.
Generally in business, "management only knows so much," said James F. Smith, a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is wise, therefore, to enlist the help of employees.
From 1990 to 1993, American factories raised output per hour an average of 3.8 percent a year, surpassing both the foreign competition and the nation's own typical performance.
"You've got managers who understand that nothing's forever, that markets can be lost," John M. Albertine, a Washington consultant and a former vice chairman of Farley Industries, said. "You're seeing the fruits of the long rationalization of American industry."
But those who find in this a "historic transformation," the term recently used by Business Week to describe the current surge of innovation and productivity, may be somewhat premature, some specialists contend.
Edwin R. Dean, head of the Office of Productivity and Technology at the Labor Department, pointed to the 1960's and 1970's, when similar claims were made on behalf of automation and numerically controlled machine tools.
Something important may indeed be going on, Mr. Dean said, but the evidence is almost entirely anecdotal and so far not convincing. "There is no survey," he added, "that will tell you how many unnecessary jobs have been eliminated."
Here in southern Mississippi, meanwhile, Mr. Hardison, Mr. Bone and Charles E. Hodges, the plant's production manager, keep bearing down in their campaign to extract as much linerboard as they can from pulp mill and paper machine.
"We're not at full capacity" quite yet, Mr. Hardison said, adding, "We think we've got 250" more tons a day to go.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Beijing's New Prisoner

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Soon it will start sinking in -- just how much President Clinton and the United States will have to pay for his broken official promises about China. The truth is that payment has started already.
Politically the Chinese Communists have taken a new prisoner -- the President. And at a time when misunderstanding about American intent could bring war with the North Koreans, how are they now supposed to figure out what Mr. Clinton means, really, or does not mean, really? 
 Children often think they can break their promises and get away without penalty if they just put on a sugar-face. But when grown-ups, particularly a Presidential grown-up, carry that fantasy into adulthood, life can get nerve-racking for everybody.
Some of the economic men-boys around the President told him to forget that order imposing a tariff penalty if Beijing continued to destroy dissent by arrest, torture and forced labor. Forget that Beijing, in your face, refused to budge. Tomorrow the voters will not remember if you break your word. Some of them will even forget that most of the China trade jobs were going from us to them. Do it -- American big business will remember and be grateful.
Chinese Communists do not play children's games. They know the President has put himself into their hands and they know how to squeeze.
From time to time they may release some political prisoners. The Clinton Administration will dance happily on the strings. It has committed itself to another fantasy -- that Beijing, in gratitude to Mr. Clinton for destroying his human rights pledge to the Chinese people, will relax rule by police terrorism.
That must astonish Beijing. Didn't the Communists say repeatedly that the "stability" of their Government depends on putting down opposition and that arrests are likely to go up over all, not down? No pretense there.
And now they know there is no possibility of economic reprisals by the U.S., the one thing that might have brought a bit more than a one-night stand on easing repression. Now the jailers can turn to the prisoners in the political cells and say, where are your American friends -- you fools?
When more arrests do come, the Clinton Administration will not be just an innocent bystander tut-tutting away. Washington did not arrest Chinese dissidents -- it just put on double locks, that's all.
Without outside pressure Beijing will not give up repression voluntarily. It fears freedom too much. But sporadically it can tighten or loosen a bit at will.
When it tightens, Mr. Clinton will look foolish. Then, as the reward for loosening repression for awhile, Beijing will collect political or economic reward from America. It will be a brand new game, but not for children.
The price Mr. Clinton will pay for his China turnabout will involve only him, America's honor, tens of millions of Chinese prisoners and forced laborers, Tibet's existence and such fringe matters.
But the price in Korea could arouse even economic bottom-liners in Washington. The last time North Korea misunderstood American intentions and resolve it started the war that devastated Korea and brought China and the U.S. into combat.
So far Mr. Clinton has played a bad Korea hand carefully and generally well -- few threats, much emphasis on negotiation and compromise.
But compromise what, when and how? One day the President says North Korea must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. Another day U.S. defense and intelligence people say North Korea already has them. One day international inspection looks hopeful, another day it is one more Korean trick.
China helped North Korea get missiles and nuclear techniques. What Beijing does in the future does not depend on U.S. human rights policies. China will decide its Korean stand and what it thinks are the risks of war from North Korea. Even then Beijing may not be able to control its clients.
The North Koreans will make their own final decisions largely on how they read President Clinton. The world has some trouble doing that about Bosnia and Haiti. Now the President's whirlabout on China makes North Korea's reading light considerably dimmer.
That can be dangerous, for them, for South Koreans, for Americans and for Chinese -- in or out of the doubly locked cells.

HEADLINE: After College, a Search for a Job and for Health Coverage

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
As college seniors leave their dorm rooms, many will be leaving something else behind as well: health insurance.
Of the estimated one million students receiving college diplomas this spring, the American College Health Association says 20 percent will lose their health insurance when their college health plans expire or when they no longer qualify as dependents on their parents' policies. 
 Collin Winterbottom, a researcher in the Health and Long Term Care Department of the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, said that although more college graduates obtained long-term coverage (60 percent) than young adults with only a high school degree (45 percent) or some college credits (53 percent), they still belonged to the most underinsured age group in the country.
But while President Clinton's proposal to reshape the health system has focused attention on the dangers of being uninsured, those dangers have not necessarily translated into a greater sense of urgency among graduates.
 
'Nothing Can Happen'
 "You're dealing with that mentality, 'I'm immortal, nothing can happen to me,' " said Cindy Launchbaugh of the American College Health Association. "There are a lot of young people out there who do not understand or do not totally accept the need for health insurance."
Jonas Stiklorius, 22, who is majoring in international politics at Georgetown University in Washington and is moving to New York this fall to work for a bank, said two weeks before graduation: "I think my parents' health insurance will cover me, but I honestly haven't even thought about it."
Few companies offer inexpensive, short-term insurance. Those plans geared toward temporarily insuring low-income people have a moderate pool of applicants for short stretches who pay low premiums, but those plans sometimes provide millions of dollars in coverage for catastrophic accidents. Many insurance companies regard these plans as bad business because they are not highly profitable.
Dr. Neal F. Kassell, vice chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia, said that young people might use far fewer medical services than older people, but that when they had problems they tended to require costly trauma treatment.
"The services they generally need are from accidents," Dr. Kassell said. "The most common form of injury or 'sickness' for that age group are drunk-driving related accidents."
 
Connecting With Parents
 Medical treatment for trauma is much more expensive than that for routine ailments, a difference that the insurance industry passes on through higher rates.
Graduates under age 23 who are still listed as dependents have the option, by Federal law, to "roll over" their university insurance to their parents' plan until they reach age 23.
Dr. Kassell comes to the debate as both a physician and a father. He said his policy would pick up coverage of his youngest daughter, who graduates college this month, "as long as she's completely dependent on me for money, housing and food."
But if Dr. Kassell's daughter becomes independent or reaches her 23d birthday before obtaining her own health care benefits, she will have to pay for individual health insurance.
Many university health plans are based on a 12-month schedule, which provides coverage for graduates until late August, though some students lose their insurance at the end of the month in which they graduate.
"I have to pay, and I'll do it as soon as I get home in June," said Christian Aviza, a senior at Georgetown. Between his May 28 graduation and rolling over his university coverage in June, Mr. Aviza admits he will be nervous about being uninsured.
In addition to graduates, there is a growing number of students who have no insurance, though there are no statistics on how many.
In 1992, Massachusetts, which has 282,164 college students enrolled in the state, became the first state to require both public and private college students to have health insurance. Last fall 97,754 students (35 percent) were required to enroll in the plan, indicating that more than one in three students were uninsured before the policy took effect.
Experts say Massachusetts' enrollment figures may be the most accurate that the country has on insured undergraduates.
Under the Clinton health care plan, everyone would be guaranteed health care, and people with low incomes would be eligible for subsidies, even temporarily unemployed college students. A senior policy analyst on the Clinton health task force, Christine Heenan, said, "Those not earning income will be fully subsidized, with no waiting period."
Using figures supplied by four of the largest insurance companies that offer coverage in the Washington and Chicago areas, a conservative estimate of the cost to insure a healthy, nonsmoking 22-year-old man for six months is $357, and for a woman of a similar profile it is slightly more expensive, $477, mainly because of gynecological and obstetric services. These figures are based on an average cost of those companies' individual packages in Washington and Chicago, two of the costliest areas in the country, and on their temporary plans with the highest possible deductible of $2,500.
 
Package Takes Legwork
 The prices of health insurance packages are substantially affected by the region of the country in which a student lives, whether a student smokes and the size of the deductible that a student is willing to pay.
According to Al Mainor of the Health Insurance Association of America, there are 1,200 commercial insurance companies in the United States, with 95 percent offering individual health insurance. But that does not ease the legwork for finding the most comprehensive and economical insurance package for a recent graduate.
A senior at George Washington University paused recently in cramming for her final finals. "I'm supposed to get a job, a place to crash, and health care insurance before Labor Day?" she asked. "That's just not realistic."
